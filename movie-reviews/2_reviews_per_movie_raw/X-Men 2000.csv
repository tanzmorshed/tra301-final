","There are some films which take the genre to some other level. This film is definitely the one to do so in the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Good : There's a whole bunch of good things that I can talk about. Bryan Singer does his best to tell the story, considering the comparatively weak script for an experimental film like this. This was the first time in YEARS that a superhero film was taken seriously. Given that there had been no introduction to any of the characters prior to this film, it does a really good job to make them interesting. Plus, it establishes the conflict between Eric and Xavier, which have been an integral part of many films that came afterwards. Not to mention, the character introduction, especially that of Wolverine, was incredible. We instantly know the basic characterization given to each of them, which was enough to get behind the movie. Hugh Jackman was the optimal choice for the role of Wolverine, and he proved it for next 17 years. Every single actor have done a good job in their roles. Also, I believe that X-Men films have been the best superhero films when it comes to ""social"" themes. We get to see the first of many times two friends with different world views clashing with one another. It has grown incredibly stale now, but was great to see back then and some other films after this, especially First Class and DoFP. The mutants wanting to be accepted by humans, and the other mutants wanting to destroy mankind - what other superhero series have given such a theme, or a similar one? This movie is the reason we are getting films like Infinity War, Civil War, Endgame, Batman Begins and The Dark Knight. While I prefer these over the first X-Men movie, if it didn't bring the genre back on track, we would've never gotten such films.<br/><br/>Mixed : It feels dated. Had it been made today, it would've been a lackluster. It was clear that they were trying to experiment with this movie and still figuring out how to get things right. While they got most of the things right, they could've made the story a little more complex.<br/><br/>Bad : The story is quite a bit of a throwaway story. While there's an interesting twist, it still feels like the movie becomes a little goofy and cartoony after that twist. Some moments feel like they were shoehorned just to give some ""comic accuracy"", but they didn't feel justified. I believe that if you get the basic elements right, it doesn't matter if it's not deadly accurate with the comics. But if you want it to be so, make some baseline for that. Don't do it randomly.<br/><br/>Conclusion : It's a movie that set the genre back on track forever. While the story and script might feel a little lazy when viewed today, you can see that the execution of the ideas were as good as humanly possible. If you are a superhero movie fan, it's a must watch. Not because it's insanely great, but just as a reminder of what led us to where we are. I am a huge fan of the genre. All credits go to Nolan's Batman films, the good X-Men films and Raimi's first two Spider-Man films. I absolutely love the MCU and many DC films apart from Nolan's trilogy - Man of Steel, Wonder Woman, Shazam, The Dark Knight Returns, Superman/Doomsday, etc. But for me, like for the genre, it all started with the first X-Men movie. So, I have a very special place for this in my heart, as a fan.<br/><br/>Rating.<br/><br/>Score : 8/10<br/><br/>Grade : A-"

","I find X-men a good start to the x-men franchise since it brings the characters we all know in love from the comics or even the old animated TV show of x-men with people like the wolverine, jean grey or mystique, all of which we know from the comics and I get why some people say now that it doesn't really have good CGI anymore but in my opinion I honestly think that it still has good animation till this day. I give X-men 2000 10/10 stars, For its good story and how they put such good casting in this movie."

","""X-Men"" is a rare treat-- a blockbuster that lives up to its hype and a comic book adaptation that hits the mark.<br/><br/>Along with Tim Burton's ""Batman"", this stands head and shoulders above all other superhero movies.  It's a genre that's usually synonymous with silly, campy, cartoonish crap, but Bryan Singer delivers a long-awaited exception to the rule.  ""X-Men"" is smart, stylish, and very cool... one of the better sci fi/fantasy films of the last decade.<br/><br/>Of course, it helps to have good source material.<br/><br/>The X-Men comics, which originated in the 1960s, are more politically progressive and morally complex than older superhero stories such as ""Superman"" where the heroes are always right, and truth, justice, and the American Way always prevail.  The series is a well-crafted parable about individuality and discrimination.  The characters are mutants--struggling to find a place in a society that rejects them.  Its primary villain, Magneto, isn't an evil lunatic-- he's a sympathetic character, a misguided revolutionary playing Huey Newton to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King. The iconic character, Wolverine, is a beer-swilling anti-hero who cares little for ideals and fights only to protect himself and his loved ones. The female characters are as powerful and important as the men, rather than being mere love interests.<br/><br/>Rather than making just another flashy explosion-per-minute-special-effects-extravaganza, Singer practices the lost arts of character and plot development.  As a result, the movie has a far greater depth than the average big budget summer flick.  The acting is also quite good on the whole.  Hugh Jackman, who plays Wolverine, is fantastic--a bona fide Clint Eastwood caliber badass.  Some of the dialogue is fairly cheesy, but in the hands of Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart it sounds quite convincing.  (Stewart has made a career out of making lame dialogue sound cool.)<br/><br/>Hard-core fans of the comics have complained about the omission of several popular X-Men.  This is silly.   A movie that gave the background on every character in the comic books would be 6 hours long.  There will be plenty of time to develop new characters in the forthcoming sequels.  Fans have also complained about the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue.   I disagree.  Rogue is unable to touch another human being without harming them--she would not realistically act like a confident, sassy warrior.  Paquin did a tremendous job of conveying the fear and isolation that such a young woman would feel. She will undoubtedly grow into the part in future movies.<br/><br/>In the end, ""X-Men"" is a comic book movie.  Superpowers are explained with silly pseudoscientific babble, the plot revolves around a fairly ridiculous take-over-the-world scheme, and names like ""Magneto"" are spoken with a straight face.  Don't read all the glowing reviews and expect Citizen Kane. But don't underestimate ""X-Men"" either.  It is an intelligent movie that people will enjoy whether or not they are familiar with the comic."
"infinitesc","10","109","136","18 July 2000"," Not a ""Comic-book Movie""
","There's no doubt about it, X-Men is not a stereotypical ""comic-book film"". Whenever a movie is made that is based on comic books, there is always a fear that it can and will be typically pigeonholed into the ""comic book film"" genre and that the movie is basically made for the fans of that comic book.  Comic-book films are usually unrealistic and unappealing to the general audience.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer, however, did a wonderful job at making X-Men a movie that will not only overjoy the fans of the comic book, but also the general movie-goer as well.  The movie is grounded, without the flighty unrealism of comic book material, and it delivers a message about prejudice that has always been what X-Men were about: fighting for a world that hates them.<br/><br/>The performances are outstanding, especially Hugh Jackman who, in my opinion, did a dead-on Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart, who never failed to show the peace and self-control that Professor Charles Xavier always strove to maintain.<br/><br/>Aside the characters, the plot was original (I couldn't tell you what was going to happen in the end by the middle of the movie) and most importantly: the world was REAL.  The only suspension of disbelief that is required is the assumption that these genetic mutations can happen, and did, causing these extraordinary people.  Honestly, I was a little disappointed that the colorful high-flare costumes were omitted, but I instantly forgave Singer when I realized why.  It was simply to add to the realism.<br/><br/>All in all, X-Men was excellent.  If you're a fan of the comic book series as I was, then you'll endlessly enjoy seeing these characters come to life.  And if you've never been exposed to the comic book, this movie will give you an entertaining way to be exposed to its message about fear, hatred, and prejudice."
"Crave","Null","75","94","15 July 2000"," intelligent and significant
","With so many movies out right now that are designed solely for entertainment puposes--from ""Gone in 60 seconds"" to ""MI-2"" to ""Scary Movie""--it is promising to sit through a 90-minute film based on a comic-book that actually gives you an opportunity to think and be challenged.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's ""X-men: The Movie"" is nothing more than an introduction to the lives of the characters from the comic book. The very fact that his movie doesn't try to add new elements, or change elements that already existed within the comic, is what makes it so successful.<br/><br/>X-men the comic series has been around for more than 30 years. And for good reason. It has dealt with all of the important elements that good storytelling includes--rejection, loneliness, hope, fear, distrust, love, selfishness, power, and the price you pay for doing what you believe is right. By consistently exploring various difficult elements of humanity, the X-men comic has been able to be not only entertaining but stimulating as well.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Singer's movie translation is no exception. ""X-men"" is very well executed, with excellent character work for the leads (Logan, Rogue, Magneto and Xavier), a good exploration of the motives of each character, and dialogue that is sharp and intelligent. However, lest you think X-men is only intellectual, let me assure you that the special-effects department has done an incredible job of mingling the human elements of the story with action. From Wolverine's claws to Rogue's devasating touch, from Storm's namesake displays of nature to Magneto's awesome power, ""X-men"" constantly finds new and arresting ways of showing-off each mutants power. And the closer you get to the end, the more exciting it is.<br/><br/>True, the movie was not perfect. Certain story elements were modified slightly for big-screen adaptation (nothing, however, that is disloyal to the ethic of the series). The soundtrack was only sufficient, rather than being something truly memorable. And not all of the characters were given equal time on screen (some important characters were completely missing).<br/><br/>But for a 90 minute movie that needs an action plot, it's obviously impossible to give all the X-men (and their evil counterparts) equal attention or character development. In fact, the sheer scale of the series alone all but requires a sequel to flesh out what was missing in this first, ""Intro to X-men"" movie.<br/><br/>Yet, as a beginning exploration of the ""X-men"" universe, this movie shines. It is attractive, fun and meaningful. Whether you're an X-men fan, you're looking for something that will make you think, you want an action movie, you enjoy sci-fi, or you just want to leave the theater feeling like you didn't just waste a couple of hours and seven bucks, go see Bryan Singer's ""X-men."" You won't be disappointed."
"odradek-4","10","98","126","13 July 2000"," X-cellent!
","A tale of super-evolved mutants in a struggle against human oppressors, X-Men is an instant sci-fi classic, combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Lacking the tongue-in-cheek camp of the later Batman films and other recent comic books-turned movies, X-Men draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers, and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd. Not to say that there isn't any humour in the film, in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this year.<br/><br/>It is a rare thing for an action blockbuster to feature great acting, but with a cast that among others involves both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is bound to be above average. Both Stewart (as Professor Charles Xavier) and McKellen (as Magneto)deliver stellar performances, and their onscreen chemistry is compelling as they play two old friends turned arch enemies.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast deliver solid performances, including Hollywood newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Oscar-winner Anna Paquin as Rogue, and another rising star Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the seductive but deadly Mystique.<br/><br/>A classic tale of good versus evil, with heroes, baddies, and great special effects, I don't think it's going too far to say that X-Men is destined to be mentioned in the same breath as Star Wars and other all-time sci-fi greats."
"MinorityReporter","7","43","53","11 December 2005"," X-ellent entertainment!
","If this film had been given to the wrong director it could have been incredibly cheesy. Being a reader of the comics I know that there are a few things that works on the page of a comic book but not in a film and let me say that the costumes is one of these things that in all probability wouldn't work. Singer chose to go with black leather outfits and I, for one, am very thankful for this choice. There are many things in this film that works but unfortunately there are a few things as well that prevent the film from being truly great.<br/><br/>Lets start with the things that work. Acting wise the film is very good. This is above all attributed to some excellent casting. Hugh Jackman is simply perfect as Wolverine and brings out the duality of the character in a very satisfactory manner. Also the scenes were we see a glimpse of the rage in the character work remarkably well. The only thing that could be said about him is that he is too tall but it seems most people, including myself, have accepted this fact. I think also that it was a wise choice to let a relatively unknown actor play the part because in that way we have no preconceived notions about him. As for Professor X no other man than Patrick Stewart could/should play him. Stewart simply becomes Xavier both in presence, voice and looks. An example of perfect casting. Ian McKellen is brilliant as Magneto and succeeds in creating a human villain rather than the usual cliché like villains we see in Hollywood productions. The acting aside from the ones mentioned above is pretty good. Not spectacular but good. The only one who does not look and act like the character we know from the comics is Anna Paquin who plays Rogue. The character is nothing like in the comics and Paquin's performance doesn't help the character.<br/><br/>When it comes to music and sound effects in general the film is a notch above average. The musical score has a very grand, even epic, feel to it and this suits the film very well. The score is not as memorable as the score from Batman (1989) but it is very adequate. As for the general sound effects they are both very fitting and believable adding to the overall credibility of the film which is considerable. The sound Wolverine's claws make when they come out is exactly as I imagined it. Very well done. The effects in general are also very well made. Not as good as in Spider-Man but still very good. A lot of care has been taken to make the effects seem as believable as possible and from where I'm standing they work. The only character whose powers I did not fully believe in was Toad's. Ray Park is an excellent athlete but many of his stunts look like obvious wire work. This is a pretty general complaint I have as some of the action look rehearsed. There is, however, some interesting action scenes and overall the action is acceptable.<br/><br/>The story is pretty well written and the dialog is both witty and sharp. Especially much of the dialog between Wolverine and Cyclops (James Marsden) is very entertaining and true to the comic books. Where I feel the story is lacking is in the climax which I am afraid to say is a little silly. Magneto's plan for world domination is actually pretty stupid when you think about it and that is a shame because much of the exposition is very well done. Generally, however, the first film is all about setting the stage for the films to come and it does do that in a satisfactory manner.<br/><br/>All in all X-Men is definitely one of the better super hero movies out there and although it was surpassed by the sequel it still stands as a true testament to Singer's skill.<br/><br/>8/10"
"cherry2x","9","57","75","29 November 2000"," Can your comic heros really come to life?
","The answer to that question can be found in this movie with a resounding YES.  Being a fan of X-Men comics and cartoons, I watched this movie with great skepticism.  It was wonderful how the characters remained true to the comics.<br/><br/>The special powers that our mutant heros and villains possess are displayed exceptionally.  It made me wish that I could have a special power of my own.<br/><br/>
Enough can not be said of the phenomenal cast of actors that were selected for their roles.  Not only did they fit their parts perfectly, but they made you believe.  Bravo to Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen and a host of actors who were lucky enough to take part in this adventure.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer does a fantastic job of bringing it all together.  The special effects in this movie, only enhance the great script and acting.  After seeing the DVD with the outtakes, the editing was quite effective.<br/><br/>The true battle of good versus evil can always make for a great story but when a comic book is adapted to film and you feel that what you see is really possible, it is a true stroke of genius."
"Chiron1987","Null","43","58","17 July 2000"," Lee and Kirby's Finest Creation Comes to Life...
","The film version of Stan Lee and Jack ""The King"" Kirby's best-selling comic book creation, X-Men, has finally succeeded where more than twenty years of four-color, superhero movies have failed.  They have finally got it right...<br/><br/>It is a stunning cinematic experience, faithfully adapting nearly 40 years of continuity into a stream-lined, fast-paced, wonderfully exciting trip into the legendary Marvel Universe.  X-Men features incredible portrayals of much of the classic mutant cast, especially virtual unknown (at least here in the States) Hugh Jackman as Logan, the Canadian wildman we all know and love as Wolverine.  Jackman seems born to play this coveted role with every bit of gruff and grim gusto; his Wolverine looks as if he simply stepped off one of Chris Claremont and John Byrne's exquisitely crafted pages.  The rest of the cast was also pleasantly well-casted and well-suited for their roles, including the handsomely chisled James Marsden as the stoic field commander Cyclops and the gorgeous Anna Paquin as the can-never-touch-but-wish-we-all-could Rogue.  Famke Janssen and Halle Berry are beautiful and bold as Jean Grey and Storm, respectively, not just appearing as fleeting shards of eye candy, but actually adding depth and strength to the flow of the film.  Patrick Stewart's excellent Professor Charles Xavier is in fine Stewart fashion, extrapolating on his Jean-Luc Picard character, and adding genuine compassion and warmth.<br/><br/>Ian McKellan is superb as the tortured master of magnetism, Magneto, playing the part with malicious glee, tempered with an extreme form of jingoism for his cause of the militant uprising of mutants over ""normal"" people.  His Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants is composed of Sabretooth, viciously and animalistically portrayed Tyler Mane, The Phanton Menace's Ray Park is the wickedly amusing Toad, and the stunning Rebecca Romaijn-Stamos is the shape-shifter Mystique.  Park actually had the most to say of Magneto's henchmen, but it was appropriate as these three comprise an awesomely evil team of muscle and not philosophy like their leader.<br/><br/>The productions values were spectacular, as were the settings, taking us from a stark, malign concentration camp in Poland to the wilds of the Canadian north to the serenity of Westchester, New York to a mind-bending climax on Liberty Island.  The action sequences were well-paced and action-packed, and much more smoother and better choreographed than any of the Batman films.  The special effects, especially Wolverine's legendary adamantium claws, were truly awe-inspiring.<br/><br/>X-Men was meticulously directed by Bryan Singer, who along with 20th Century Fox, actually listened to and cared about what X-Fans thought and wished to see on screen.  Although we would have all liked to have stayed in that theater for another 95 minutes, there are many more stories to tell, and God willing, Fox will let it happen.<br/><br/>Most importantly, X-Men finally gives Marvel Entertainment Group a firm footing on film, a foundation that was never fully in its grasp until the surprise hit of two years ago, Blade.  Now that Marvel has discovered that it can succeed with its top-tier characters, the sky is truly the limit for its varied cast of great characters.  I hope that Warner Bros. will sit up and take notice at what X-Men has accomplished.  Maybe this will be a wake-up call to those studio executives in charge of Superman and Batman, and make them realize that the fans' input really does count in the end...<br/><br/>Highest recommendation!"

","""X-men"" is a well done sci-fi action film for all action fans: especially for those who as kids dreamed of having special powers themselves. Each of the main mutant characters has a special ability and during the film I sometimes found myself thinking about which of those abilities I would choose if I were given the chance. Of course all of those special abilities are visible in the film's spectacular special effects. But the special effects were not the only thing that made watching this film fun. There is also plenty of action and character interaction besides shooting and beating and using special powers. As each mutant character is given a past (to give him a motivation) and a weakness, the film's plot never got boring because I also wanted to know how things developed between the mutants themselves.<br/><br/>And I won't even talk about the ending. It actually surprised me. But go see for yourself"
"melissa3","8","48","74","5 March 2001"," I gave this film an 8.
","I've always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I'd never really read any of the comics though... ^_^). So when I heard they were making a movie about them, I was counting the days until it was released. Maybe that affected how I viewed the movie, but I was a bit disappointed. Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he's got... the multiple characters, etc. The whole project seems a bit ""safe,"" though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn't flop. It's a good movie, but not a great one. Fans of the X-Men might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either Wolverine or Rogue. Mine personally is Cyclops, but he had a minor role. James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor. On that note, all the actors did an excellent job, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, as the forces of good and evil. It brought an endearing humanistic side to a story I had thought was dominated by sci-fi. If you're an X-Men fan, I would definitely recommend this film--but you probably have already seen it! What X-Men fan would miss out? If you're not a fan, maybe this movie can be a starting point for a new obsession... :o)"
"Animany94","8","4","4","11 June 2019"," A lot better than expected.
","After watching a lot of animated X-Men stuff, I thought that it was time to watch some live-action movies. I'd heard rumours that the X-Men franchise was rather hit and miss. Well, this was a very solid start.<br/><br/>Not everyone delivers a top performance, but I was so happy that my favorite characters delivered. Hugh Jackman does a relly good and charismatic job as the tough Wolverine coming from a place he doesn't even know himself. He ends up meeting Marie aka Rogue who brings him to Xavier's School for the Gifted. Their relationship is a highlight here.<br/><br/>Magneto gets a lot of star power from the magnificent Ian McKellen and a well done take on his harsh past which leads him onto his dark path in life conflicting with his old friend Xavier who are also given a nice portrayal by Patrick Stuart.<br/><br/>The otherwise talented Halle Berry wasn't as convincing as Storm, I must admit. The booming persona I knew was shifted to a quite monotonous one, and her powers weren't to show before nearing the climax. James Marsden was a good choice as Cyclops, but was kind of the same case as Storm without real punch to the performance.<br/><br/>But despite a few small bumps on the road, I enjoyed X-Men more than I had expected, because the story was actually really engaging when the focus was on the right elements like Wolverine and Rogue and how Magneto fulfills his plan. It's not the usual superhero movie where action and special effects are the main focus, but more like a psychological drama with some hero elements. That makes it stand out among the crowd.<br/><br/>But even though the special effects weren't the main focus they were awesome, hands down! It may be a movie from the year 2000, but back then the effects weren't used as much as they are today, so when they were good they really rocked the screen.<br/><br/>I would recommend X-Men to people who like a well balanced movie with a well told story spiced up with the right amount of action and special effects."
"FABMAB","10","44","77","22 July 2003"," An imaginatively realized sci-fi thriller
","Tibetan Buddhist teacher Robert Thurman writes in Inner Revolution: ""In karmic evolution, the successful actions that lead to positive evolutionary mutations such as a human life are those of generosity, morality, tolerance, enterprise, concentration, and intelligence. Their opposites - stinginess, injustice, anger, laziness, distraction, and ignorance - are unsuccessful actions, which lead to negative evolutionary mutations that take you down the chain through animal incarnations."" We got to thinking about this when we realized that the mutants in the sci-fi thriller X-Men are of two types: the generous, moral, and intelligent ones, and the animal-like ones acting out of revenge and anger. The message is clear: evolution can go toward the good or the bad, and there will always be a battle between the two possibilities.<br/><br/>X-Men, with stories revolving around the activities of a group of mutant superheroes, has been a phenomenally successful franchise for Marvel Comics. Now director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) and screenplay writer David Hayter have adapted this series for the screen. The movie exposes the battle going on for America's soul. In doing so, it goes right to the heart of the country's shadow - our continuing inability to deal with those who are different from us, either by race, ethnic heritage, sexual preference, or generation. The story taps into the reservoir of feelings we have about diversity, tolerance, and exclusivity. And, let's admit it, all of us, at one time or another, have felt like a mutant outsider different from the ""norms"" of society and cut off from the ""in"" crowd.<br/><br/>U.S. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) has a cause. There are mutants living in American communities, and nobody knows how and where they might use their strange and strong powers. He wants to protect human citizens by passing legislation to require them to register with the government. Indeed, even mutants with the best intentions can't always control their impact on others. When Rogue (Anna Paquin), a Mississippi teenager kisses her boyfriend for the first time, he ends up in a coma for three weeks. She can absorb the energy and memories of anyone she touches.<br/><br/>Fleeing to Alaska, Rogue meets Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), another mutant who has amazing healing powers, which come in handy when his retractable adamantium claws inadvertently inflict damage. These two ""freaks"" as the locals call them eventually team up and find their way to Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most potent telepath who has started a school for ""gifted students"" - a.k.a. mutants. His key assistants are Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who has telekinetic and telepathic skills, Cyclops (James Marsden) whose eyes release energy blasts, and Storm (Halle Berry) who can manipulate weather disturbances.<br/><br/>Not only must these X-Men fight the forces of bigotry and repression afoot in America, they must square off against Magneto (Ian McKellen), a mutant who has survived the Holocaust and now believes that a war with the humans is inevitable. He concocts a plan to turn the world's leaders into mutants at a special U.N. gathering on Ellis Island. The X-Men come to the rescue and must contend with his evil team consisting of Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), a beast-like warrior; Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), a metamorph; and Toad (Ray Park), a high-jumping monster with a ten-foot tongue.<br/><br/>Thanks to its thematic riches, X-Men is far more interesting than the Batman superhero flicks. Most fascinating is the love/hate relationship between the peaceful Professor Xavier and the power-hungry Magneto. In the last scene of the film, they play a game of chess in a prison holding Magneto. We all know that the mutant villain has not made his last move."

"RJC-4","1","29","53","16 July 2000"," Execrably bad
","Was ""The Usual Suspects"" a fluke?  Bryan Singer turns in a decidedly B-movie job directing this flat, predictable comics adaptation.  It's almost too faithful to its original medium, with 2-d performances from all the principals except for Hugh Jackman (as the grouchy Wolverine, he displays the closest thing to personality among these cardboard cut-outs).  Patrick Stewart is lifeless.  Ian McKellen, who was believably dark in Singer's ""Apt Pupil,"" here only looks very drowsy.  And the X-Men themselves look like the cast of ""Dawson's Creek"" in drag.<br/><br/>This film has endless problems.  The action sequences, and in particular the climactic battle in and on the Statue of Liberty, look terribly staged: just as on the comics page, the characters halt to strike dramatic poses, or dotingly brandish their ""super powers"" (one of them, hilariously, even utters at one point: ""Storm, use your power!"").  It simply doesn't work any more than if Singer had put speech bubbles above the characters' heads. Compare these silly little fights to the superb sequences in Jet Li's ""Black Mask,"" (1996), a film shot for a fraction of this one's budget but obviously with much greater talent and vision.<br/><br/>For a comic with a rich graphical past, the movie's art direction delivers a strangely bland, sterile look, both for Professor X's school and for the Liberty set.  Both look low-budget, but neither is quite as bad as the villain's secret seaside hideout, which Singer shot in such darkness that nary a detail can be seen.<br/><br/>Oddly, ""X-Men"" looks like two different movies.  The first 15 minutes are lavishly designed and shot, from the opening flashback of Jews herded into a concentration camp to the discovery of a Wolverine slumming in a moody northern logging camp.  Then, abruptly, the flair is gone, and for the remaining 90 minutes we get a film that looks like one of the Star Trek TV franchise vehicles.  (Except for Storm's look: it's pure Penthouse Magazine, ca. 1975, with Halle Barry's vapid expression rounding out the bill.)  The villains are half-comically done, but even that is a blunder by Singer -- we don't really get any comic relief from them, and we can hardly worry too much about the X-men if they're beset by the likes of a villain called Toad, and even less when they remind us of the far wittier and better-looking send-up of all this nonsense, last year's ""Mystery Men.""<br/><br/>Apart from the inanities, there is also a true sin: it's unforgivably trite when a pulp fiction like this one hijacks the Holocaust to inflate its meagre storyline and insincere theme.  ""X-Men"" isn't really an allegory of genocide, or even merely of racism.  That stuff is just tacked on to what is really an exercise in big fights and big boobs -- the old Marvel formula.

It was not an engaging story at all after they left Poland in the beginning.  You kept expecting something that would to grab your attention, but it never came.  The ending was pretty lame, and it seemed like the last 3rd of the movie was just setting up for the sequel. I never really understood what the story was.  I was expecting much better things.

","Special-effects and terrific 5.1 surround sound are the highlights of this science fiction film. And what highlights they are - tremendous in both categories, at least for 2000 when this film and DVD came out. At the time, they were the best special-effects I had ever seen, but strides are being made so fast in that category that every few years we movie fans are stunned at something new we see. Audio-wise, the rear speakers come into to play as well as any movie I've heard.<br/><br/>As for story, once the beginning plugs for evolution and political correctness are over with, it is a simple good guys-trying-to-get-the-bad guys fare. It's pure escapist fun made so with tons of sci-fi effects. The characters aren't particularly involving, either the ""good guys"" or the ""bad guys."" The two leads, played by Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, should have been, but weren't. Jackman's ""Logan/ Wolverine"" always seemed to be pouting and angry, but I guess he's a favorite of females. <br/><br/>For me and most males, Rebecca Romjin-Stamos was a treat for the eyes. Her outfit was something to behold.<br/><br/>If profanity bothers you, the film was treat in that department, too, as there was very little. Obviously, this film was popular enough to spawn not only a sequel but more in the making."

"J. Spurlin","Null","9","15","7 December 2006"," The usual tedious superhero blockbuster for humorless, fun-hating fanboys
","Fanboys have no sense of fun. It's partly their influence that makes these superhero tales increasingly self-important and witless. If you flip through comic books today, you'll find they tackle issues such as drug addiction, street crime, racial bigotry and homosexuality, all while muscle-bound louts in circus costumes are flying around and shooting laser beams out of their fists. And no one fights crime any more; they just wrestle with their own demons. I recently scanned a comic book where an old Superman and a young Superman were throwing trucks and boulders at each other as they screamed pop-psych jargon about their grievances in what seemed like an apocalyptic episode of ""Dr. Phil.""<br/><br/>This movie opens with a scene in a Nazi concentration camp—yes, a superhero movie with a realistic Nazi concentration camp—where we meet the villain Magneto as a boy, who discovers his ability to move metal with his mind. Once we're in the present (or the ""near-future""), we see the U.S. Senate debating on whether mutants like Magneto should be exposed and listed on a public register. It's like the yellow stars and number-tattoos Jews were forced to wear in Nazi Germany. Get it? I don't. How is a fear of Jews parallel to a fear of people who can walk through walls, shoot fire out of their eyes or control the weather with their minds? In this movie the earnest idealists are against the mutant registry and the snooty hypocrites are in favor of it. Frankly I'm with the snooty hypocrites. What would we do if there were real super-powered mutants among us? Thanks to the fanboys' thirst for ""realism"" even in comic book adventures, the issues of Wolverine and his ilk are made to seem like urgent social problems.<br/><br/>Fanboys have no sense of humor either. A sense of humor is not the ability to laugh at everything, but knowing when something is funny and when it isn't. Fanboys have nerd-humor. Nerd-humor comes from the desire to condescend to the very thing that one takes deeply seriously. It comes out in this movie when Logan (later to be Wolverine) mocks silly superhero names like Cyclops and Storm. ""What's your name,"" he says to Professor Xavier, who uses a wheelchair, ""Wheels?"" This sounds like the movie spoofing itself, but it isn't. It's the movie congratulating itself for being aware of its own absurdities; and once it acknowledges them, it can dismiss them and take itself all the more seriously. This is in contrast to the 1960s TV show ""Batman,"" which really was a spoof. But a fanboy doesn't get it, not even if you tell him the joke. ""Yeah, I know it's a spoof, but what kind of Batman has a pot belly?""<br/><br/>Marvel Comics used to have a jaunty sense of fun, but that's the company that introduced social relevance and superheroes who have everyday problems just like us. The DC Comics concept of heroes that are larger than life is dead and now even Batman and Superman have ""issues."" This opinion will guarantee me 0 of 564 useful votes, but I think the ultimate superhero show is the wonderfully ludicrous cartoon series ""Challenge of the SuperFriends"" (now on DVD). It's funny, fast-paced and entertaining in a way that a movie like this never could be.<br/><br/>""X-Men"" (the word ""the"" was dropped so that no one would give up on the title before he finished reading it) offers the usual fare for fans of fantasy blockbusters: great old actors (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) spouting nonsense; younger actors delivering dismal wisecracks (""You're a dick!""); rapid cutting so that we're unable to savor a performance or believe that an actor is making more than one move at a time during a fight sequence; CGI out the wazoo; grand-looking sets and fabulous sound design for those who want their junk to look and sound good; and overblown music.<br/><br/>Obviously I don't like the movie, but it could have been far worse. I watched the whole thing; whereas I shut off ""The Fantastic Four"" (""The Fantastic 4""? ""Fntstc 4""?) after 30 minutes. And I was amazed how compelling and subtle Anna Paquin could be in a sea of SFX. I kept wishing she and Hugh Jackman would steal away from the freak show, sit down at a coffee shop and just talk for 90 minutes."

However, I'd disagree with that. Before The Avengers first suited up, before Captain America and Iron Man, came Marvel's first notable movie (to my knowledge): X-Men.<br/><br/>The movie definitely doesn't compare to the performance, tone, and general excitement and anticipation of the aforementioned movies, but that doesn't make it any less fun. It clearly should be viewed, and rated, on its own merits absent comparison to the more successful superhero movies of recent times.

"utgard14","8","3","4","31 May 2014"," ""We are the future, Charles, not them.""
","There have been so many comic book movies since the year 2000, and quite a few of them X-Men movies, that it may be a good idea to think back to when this movie came out and remember this got the ball rolling. Yes, there had been Batman and Superman before that, but they were DC properties that seemed to exist within a little bubble all their own. There was also Blade but that was a supernatural action movie. A lot of people didn't even know it was based on a comic book character. This movie was the first successful superhero movie based on Marvel comics characters. It took the source material seriously and treated it with respect. It did away with the notion that superheroes were solely kids stuff and what followed was a wave of comic movies based on Marvel properties that is still going strong today.<br/><br/>The casting is mostly spot-on. Hugh Jackman became a star overnight due to his performance as Wolverine. It's hard to imagine he'll ever have another role to top this one or that they'll ever be able to recast with an actor better-suited for the part. And no, nerds, don't say he's not the perfect Wolverine just because he's not physically identical to the comics version. Open a window, people. The casting of Patrick Stewart as Professor X was a no-brainer and he's also perfectly suited for the part. Ian McKellen's excellent as Magneto. It's arguable he's older than he should be but he's so good in the role it really doesn't matter. Rebecca Romijn (Mystique), Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey) are all great, as well. I especially enjoyed the chemistry between Jackman and Paquin. Their scenes are some of the film's best moments. Not all of it is a home run. James Marsden's wooden performance as Cyclops is something of a negative. He has no chemistry with Famke Janssen, which ultimately weakens that portion of the film. Tyler Mane's monosyllabic Sabretooth and Ray Park's ridiculous Toad are both lame. These two are frequently mentioned by the movie's detractors and I find it hard to defend them. They are also the worst of the ""Hollywoodizations"" of the characters' appearances, something they all suffer from. Despite the movie's many strengths, it still exists within the narrow mindset that you can't do movies with people in colorful costumes without it appearing silly. So, hey, black leather y'all because that's not something you literally see all the time in movies.<br/><br/>For some reason, this first movie gets a lot of flack today in certain circles. Is it perfect? No, but neither are some of these more recent superhero movies that have been hailed as masterpieces. The direction is strong, the script is smart, the acting is wonderful. There are some flaws and I've addressed a few but, on the whole, it's a fantastic film that entertains me every time I watch it. There have been some good (and bad) X-Men movies since this one but this stands as the one I rewatch most often."

","This first movie about the X MEN is my favorite of all the trilogy, and the only one I was really excited to watch and I really liked of them all. There is not a better Wolverine then Hugh Jackman, and I cannot imagine Dougray Scott , who was the first choice to play Logan, in Hugh's place. Patrick Stewart and James Marsden have both a big resemblance with the characters they play as well.<br/><br/>After watching all the X men movies, only now I noticed that Halle Berry was using an accent to play Storm in this first movie. It's a sad thing that so many famous mutants in the comics, like Jubilee, Shadowcat, Colossus; Iceman and Pyro only have a small participation in it. Another sad thing is to see Rogue as a frightened kid,instead of the sexy and strong woman she is in the comics. Instead of Gambit, Rogue's true romantic partner in the comics, in this movie she has a interest in Wolverine.<br/><br/>The movie was directed by Bryan Singer and explores the ideas of prejudice and discrimination in the world, specially United States."

","This film was awesome! It's the first installment in a series of adaptations from the classic comics to bring the beloved comic heroes to life and the director achieves this with such cinematic kudos! The film begins with the character Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) struggling to come to terms with what he truly is, but not for long we start getting introduced to the other characters as well, at least the ones who haven't checked themselves into the Xavier school for the gifted yet. We are introduced to a young Rogue (played by Anna Paquin) who is so frightened by her special powers and what it does to the people around her that she runs away from home. Sooner than later, she meets up with Wolverine (actually she hides in the back of his truck) and he inadvertently allows her to tag along with him. The chemistry between the two is blazing but weird since Anna is so young and Hugh is very much older. Along the way, they are attacked by Sabretooth and now know that it is imperative that they find the Xavier school which they eventually do. While there the meet a slew of gifted X-men and team up with Professor Xavier (played by Patrick Stewart) to help stop the evil Magnetto (Played by Sir Ian Mckellen)."

","Whenever I put pen-to-paper, (or digit-to-keyboard for that matter), I always want to appear much cleverer than I really am, by using long words and such, but in this review for X-MEN, all I really want to do is throw myself on the floor, kick my legs, pound my fists and scream and scream until I'm sick. Indeed, a tantrum is never a pretty thing to witness. But, oh! What have they done to my beloved X-men?! I'm trying very hard not to waffle on about the DECADES of source material available for the movie-makers to draw upon; The wealth of characters, the gamut of emotion, the endless high-adventure!!<br/><br/>For all you fan-boys; no I'm not talking about the mockery of the expanded X-Franchise that these days litters the magazine-shelves of every supermarket and comes with a free holographic Pog stuck to the cover! I am, of course, referring to the Golden Age of comics, long before Marvel saw fit to suck Satans scaly member, and churn out the vacuous drivel its famous for today. No, Marvel is dead, and movies such as this one are surely the final nails being hammered into its coffin. (Mercifully, the art of the comic book is still alive and well, and flourishing in the tender hands of the poorer, independent labels, where both artists and writers still toil away for the love of the medium.)<br/><br/>This movie, even standing alone and not being compared to its periodical counterpart, soars to new heights of mediocrity. Looking as though its been filmed almost entirely on location in someones garden-shed, it has none of the grandiose, theatrical spectacle that it seems to think it has. Even given a beautiful location, such as Liberty Island, (and was that Grand Central Station?), our intrepid film-makers still manage to find a way of shooting it, so as to make you believe your watching someones shaky wedding-video! Every effort to impart a sense of gravitas or screen-presence falls flat. And the score? Well... Do you remember seeing Rocky for the first time? Or Superman-The Movie? Remember how, on leaving the theatre, that theme tune was still ringing in your head, and did so for many years to come? Yes, well, this has none of that. Even the X-Men animated series had a catchy theme, I only saw it once or twice, but I can still hum you a few bars if you'd like? Oh, but wait, I haven't even started on the X-Men themselves yet! They had the cast. <br/><br/>SIR! Ian McKellen! <br/><br/>Patrick ""was-that-boldly-or-baldly?"" Stewart! <br/><br/>Halle ""but-i-look-pretty!"" Berry! <br/><br/>Hugh ""rugged-yet-charming"" Jackman <br/><br/>And Anna ""i-was-good-in-The-Piano-wasnt-i"" Paquin. They had the makings of a true ensemble cast, and then sadly, had them all plod along through a story that just never seemed to get off the ground. Yes, I've seen the sequel, and yes I will watch the third instalment, but this review encompasses my opinions for both the movies thus far released.<br/><br/>Uneventful.<br/><br/>For example; Wolverine & Sabretooth. On paper, these two have a long history together. Ask your average Fan-Boy, and he'll surely tell you, that when these to appeared in a book together, you were guaranteed a thrilling, acrobatic and visceral encounter. Sabretooth, the savage, brutal, remorseless assassin, and Wolverine, the berserker with the soul of a samurai, struggling to tame his bestial urges! Never were two warriors more finely matched! <br/><br/>What do we get in the movie?? Sabretooth; An American Pro-wrestler in a BonJovi wig, following Ian McKellen around like an bouffant poodle, only to fall to his death at the first sign of trouble. <br/><br/>And Wolverine; Well, actually, Hugh Jackman was one of the few things I cant fault about this movie. (Cyclops, being the other.) Although the makers elected to portray Wolverine at his most uninteresting, Jackmans performance, given the material, is a credit to him. Magneto, on the other hand, appears as a pale shadow of his comic-book self. On paper hes not a geriatric waif of a man in a silly hat, but a charismatic, virile titan of a figure, bestride the world, a god-among-men! Some characters appear to have just been entirely re-written, Rogue being the most obvious example. Now, I wouldn't have a problem with this, understanding the difficulties of bringing comic-book characters to the medium of film, but if you're going to completely reinvent such widely loved characters, at least do it well.<br/><br/>For the most part, the X-men are all weak, watered-down versions of their comic-book originals, thanks in no small part to the fact that they have been stripped of their trademark costumes. Garish, and impractical though they may have been for the cross-over to celluloid, (cyclops' little nod to this, noted! ""what would you prefer? Yellow spandex?!"", it does detract greatly from the overall effect of superheroes on screen. And although its true that at one time The Uncanny X-Men did sport a standardised uniform, and some X-Men rarely even employed a costume at all, imagine Spiderman, or Superman without their hallmark undies!<br/><br/>Overall the X-Men suffers from one major and unavoidable flaw; 2 hours in the theatre simply isn't enough time. With so many years of development and plot in the comic-book, and a cast of hundreds, the move to celluloid was never going to be a successful one. So I suppose this begs the question; Should it ever have been made? On the strength of the two, (very soon to be three), already made, I have to say no. I've heard tell that a number of spin-offs are in the pipeline; A Wolverine movie perhaps. Its my opinion that this will stand a better chance of succeeding, and if its good, then perhaps the travesty of the previous movies will be justified. But until then, I suggest you satisfy yourself with The Uncanny X-Men as they were meant to be enjoyed; Between the pages of a comic-book."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","4","7","23 July 2014"," A solid start to the X-Men film franchise
","Not one of the best Superhero films but a long way from one of the worst. While with imperfections and better was to follow in the franchise, X-Men is a good film and a solid start though with a yet-to-properly-find-its-feet feel. X-Men is well-made, the special effects while not mind-blowing are great, the film was slickly shot and edited and the dark, moody visual style worked wonders. Michael Kamen's music score had those grand, mysterious, rousing and haunting qualities that really add a lot to the film's atmosphere. Apart from the odd cheesy moment the dialogue is smart and taut with some subtle humour that thankfully did not feel out of place, and Bryan Singer shows that he does know how to direct an action sequence, tell a good story and not let the special effects overwhelm everything, a solid directing job indeed. The story, while simple compared to what was to follow in the succeeding films, is compelling and doesn't try and take itself too seriously or like a joke. The character exposition was nicely done on the whole and doesn't drag things down too much, Cyclops, Storm and Toad are underdeveloped but Wolverine and especially Magneto(who actually has depth to him rather than being a clichéd villain) are interesting characters. The relationships between the characters were also believable, Wolverine and Rogue's was a standout. And the story didn't feel like it was second fiddle to the action sequences, which weren't big and bold as such but were tightly choreographed and performed with spirit and passion. Admittedly though the Statue of Liberty climax while strikingly filmed is on the silly side at times, but it was fun too. The cast are mostly very good, apart from a stiff James Marsden(he and Famke Janssen's chemistry was very bland), a monotone Tyler Mane and Halle Berry and Ray Park also felt a bit bland. Hugh Jackman however shows great charisma as the lead character Wolverine and has a powerful screen presence, Rebecca Romijin-Stamos is a sexy and icy Mystique, Anna Paquin did bring a feistiness to Rogue and Famke Janssen is fine. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen promise much on paper, and both of them deliver, Stewart brings a cool, classy command to the screen as Professor X but even better is McKellen, who is certainly menacing but gives Magneto a sympathetic edge. To conclude, a good film and a solid start to the franchise. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","I have always liked the movie X-Men! Its a serious movie with a deep story and a dark nature! It<br/><br/>has a very different cast and some incredible action! The special effects are top notch! The movie also has a unique score by Michael Kamen that fits this film perfectly! Below in a small but In-depth look at the characters of the film.<br/><br/>The X-Men<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Wolverine - There is not much information that is known about Logan or as he is called by another name which is Wolverine because of his hair and his raw fighting skills and not to mention his great sense of smell and like his arch nemesis Sabertooth, he too has an incredible healing rate! He also has the outstanding ability to have three steel claws in each hand that comes through the knuckle area. He uses these thick blades for weapons and they do the task well! What kind of mutant is Wolverine? How can he possibly have this painful but yet great advantage that literally shoots out of his hands? Will Professor X and his X-Men help Logan find out or will Wolverine have to find out on his own?<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier - Professor X, The head of the School For Gifted Youngsters. He helps mutants with their powers by teaching them many things. He is a kind man and he seems to be more of a father or parent than a mentor. He is a very intelligent mutant and he can do many things with his mind! In fact he just may have the most powerful mind on Earth. Unlike Magneto, Charles Xavier believes in peace!<br/><br/>James Marsden as Cyclops - Scott Summers has such powerful eyes he needs a special visor to control it. What causes this red beam is unknown and his visor helps him maintain this dangerous red light but he can control the beam with the help of a knob as he can adjust this to help him whenever he needs to use it however but without the special visor look out for an incredible blast! He is also a skilled pilot!<br/><br/>Famke Janssen as Jean Grey - She also has a very powerful mind though she needs more time on how to master it with the help Professor X! She likes Cyclops but she also cares about Logan.<br/><br/>Halle Berry as Storm - This Egyptian beauty has the power to create all kinds of storms! Ororo Munroe has long white hair and whenever she uses her great power her eyes turn white as well!<br/><br/>Anna Paquin as Rogue - She has the unusual power to drain the life out of anyone she touches! She must wear gloves to prevent this from happening!<br/><br/>The Brotherhood<br/><br/>Ian McKellen as Magneto. A very intelligent man that is Erik Magnus Lehnsherr. Where he hails from is unknown but what is known he has an extraordinary power that he can magnetize anything that is metal! Whether its as small as a key or as large as a car it becomes no problem for Magneto!<br/><br/>Tyler Mane as Sabertooth - The huge maniac that is known as Sabertooth has incredible senses and is able to heal from injuries faster than anyone except Wolverine! This giant lunatic loves to hear women scream and he has a passion to hear the scream or none other than Storm! Victor Creed is a psychopath and with his long claws and razor sharp teeth he is out for blood!<br/><br/>Ray Park as Toad - The green skinned Mortimer Toynbee has a real long tongue and can grab a hold of an animal for lunch and also can use it to grab and use to swing out of danger. He has great leaping ability and fighting skills!<br/><br/>Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique - Though her real name is Raven Darkholme, she prefers to be called Mystique due to her mysterious shape shifting. The blue skinned woman can change exactly into anyone and even duplicate the clothes they wear! She is incredibly agile and She has excellent fighting skills and she'll give the greatest fighters the planet has to offer a great challenge!<br/><br/>Other Characters<br/><br/>Bruce Davison as Senator Robert Kelly - Unlike some people he is a believer in mutants and knows what they can do. He is captured by the lovely Mystique as it was a mission to her. Magneto shows the Senator what its like to be a mutant!<br/><br/>I really like the X-Men movie and I think Bryan Singer did a good job on the characters. Though X-2 is arguably better than this and I would love to have the X-Men franchise to spawn more than a trilogy. Though it may never happen but I think about this a lot that wouldn't it be awesome if they would have these great comic book characters together with other Marvel characters from movies like The Hulk, Spider-Man, Blade, The Punisher, & Daredevil? Think of the epicness and possibilities! I hope you have enjoyed this In-depth look at The X-Men!"
"paul2001sw-1","6","5","10","24 October 2003"," Not X-traordinary, but better than average
","'X-Men' has much to commend it compared with the average comic book flick. There's a star director in the form of Bryan Singer, and excellent performances from veteran British actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. Although McKellan plays a villain, he also draws sympathy to his character, which is also unusual in a film of this type.  Above all, there's an uncommonly interesting scenario.  The original comic book was apparently inspired by the civil rights struggle in the U.S.A., and in the film version, there's also a hint of the McCarthy era.  Ordinary human beings, far from being portrayed in an attractive manner, are shown as weak, small minded bigots who might vote for George Bush or read the Daily Mail. Meanwhile, a civil was erupts among the mutants they persecute, one faction (Stewart's) committed to peace, the other (McKellan's) convinced that co-existence with humans is no longer possible, and ready to fight all those who stand in their way.<br/><br/>Against this, there are a few negatives.  The acting of the attractive characters who play the young X-men is wooden (or, more appropriately, metallic) compared with that of their elders.  The expensive special effects are also slightly cumbersome, they feel like inserted sequences.  'The Matrix' may have been empty-headed, but it set new standards for integrating computer-generated animation into the entire world of the film, and 'X-Men' rates poorly by comparison.  Also, the possibility that McKellan might be right is never acknowledged by the film.  We're allowed to accept that he is genuine, but not that his chilling analysis may yet be correct.  And finally the plot is a 'by-numbers' affair.  Neophytes are inducted by a master, only for the master to become incapacitated leaving the newcomers to fend for themselves, before a happy (and sequel-setting) ending - exactly the same as 'The Matrix', in fact.<br/><br/>Better by far than the average blockbuster, 'X-Men' doesn't quite live up to it's potential.

","This film made my butt hurt!?!!? Sometimes you can sit through a three hour movie, and it keeps you captivated all the way through, not giving you a reason to think about your sitting position in the theater seat. Even though ""X-Men"" is about ninety minutes long, it's really slow, and it made me think about how I was sitting, and therefore it made my butt hurt. So now you know that!!<br/><br/>But ""X-Men"" is not just a pain in the a**, it's quite good, but not a must see.<br/><br/>The trailer for ""X-Men"" promises an action packed movie, as trailers often do. But ""X-Men"" is more of a character film, even though the characters are not that deep. So I guess this movie would be more fun for readers of the comic book, to whom I don't belong.<br/><br/>Anyway, I was hoping for action a la ""The Matrix"". And surely director Bryan Singer has been inspired a little by ""The Matrix"". One of the female characters makes a sideways flip in the air, and I think that shot even has the same camera angle as in the otherwise same shot in ""The Matrix"". This is the kind of stealing that film makers call homage. But to Bryan Singer's defense, I would like to say that he has already proven to me that he has a good visual sense, in ""The Usual Suspects"".<br/><br/>The problem with ""X-Men"" is that the action scenes are few and far between, even though they are visually stunning. Other than that the film has some cute scenes making it all worthwhile in the end.<br/><br/>I also have to add, that this is Newton Thomas Siegel's (Director of photography) best work yet."

","X-Men surprised me with its intelligence, marvelous direction, and wonderful characters.<br/><br/>A startlingly fun movie to watch, X-Men is one of the better comic book adaptations out there. In fact, I'd say it was the best one made until Spider-Man came out. Even then, it's a close call. X-Men does really well with balancing the terrific number of characters it features on screen. I think this is the movie's best aspect. It gives us a lot of depth to every character on screen. Including Wolverine, who I was not pleased with when I saw X-Men Origins: Wolverine. It's a little ironic that there was more depth given to Wolverine in a film that was not strictly about Wolverine than the ""character study"" film did that was supposed to be solely about Wolverine. I started to feel an interesting connection to this character. This is incredibly important because this is the first time I had ever thought much of anything for Wolverine, including in other films, TV shows, and comic books. Excellent development.<br/><br/>I was even more impressed with some of the side characters, like Rogue. Rogue was portrayed beautifully by Anna Paquin. I was unprepared for the level of intensity that this young actress was able to bring to the table with her character. She seemed frail, but independent. Strong and weak at the same time. And there was so much emotional strength given to her that by the time we got to the climactic battle, I was genuinely concerned for her. I also really loved the friendship that was played out between her and Wolverine. It was done extremely well and the two shared some really impressive scenes.<br/><br/>Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey were a little underplayed, but I was still satisfied with the level of character development that we still got from them. I was able to take all these characters seriously and I was able to follow each of their own inner struggles in a way that, again, I had not anticipated.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen was yet another surprise for me as Magneto. I had never held much stock in the villain, believing him to be nothing particularly special. And when I saw the old man who was to play him, I couldn't hold back my scoff. But the surprises kept coming through and I couldn't help but love this guy's performance. He plays the villain Magneto very well, giving a powerful and poignant performance. That's nothing to scoff at.<br/><br/>And while I am talking about the actors and characters, I cannot forget Patrick Stewart who played Professor Xavier. I think this was the best performance in the film. Patrick Stewart really brought this character to life, giving the audience an incredibly powerful performance. There was a scene when he was talking to Wolverine and Cyclops and I suddenly realized I was leaning forward in my chair to hang onto every word this guy had to say. A brilliant and underrated performance.<br/><br/>Then there were the incredible visuals in this story. Whether they were all CGI or not I did not know and neither did I care. This film was still made before everything had gone to such gargantuan lengths in the computers and I could tell the effort that was put into the visuals. And they looked really darn good.<br/><br/>But what impressed me still more than anything else about X-Men was the direction. This film was directed by Bryan Singer, and he gives the audience some really intense direction. I was blown away by the cinematography among everything else. Singer is a wonderful director. I haven't seen any of his other films, but I want to now.<br/><br/>X-Men is an entertaining and--above everything else--fun ride that is sure to grasp comic book fans and non-comic book fans alike.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mr_quizzical","2","3","5","20 September 2001"," A plodding, wasteful film
","How can the same man who directed the taut and surprising ""The Usual Suspects"" have been involved in a film this banal? ""X-Men"" is a plodding, pointless, unexciting, and wasteful film. Wasteful, because the excellent cast is given absolutely nothing to do. Plodding and pointless because, well, it is. Every scene is a few seconds too long, every plot point telegraphed a few minutes in advance. There is simply nothing fresh in ""X-Men,"" nothing to distinguish it from any B-grade action movie, except for the special effects; and the film leans on so heavily on effects that I don't doubt that the plot was an afterthought.<br/><br/>I was never a reader of the comic book series, so I can't compare it to that, but I can recall around 1988 when Terry Gilliam was attached to this film and my comic-reading friends were beside themselves in anticipation of how Gilliam's visual sense would bring the world of the X-Men to the screen. Well, 12 years later, this is the flat, unimaginative film we got instead."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","4 February 2002"," Dark comic book adaptation
","In the near future, where children are being born with a special X-Factor in their genes, giving them special powers, and making them ""mutants"", the seeds of a new Holocaust are being sewn by Senator Robert Kelly. The situation brings fellow mutants and former friends Erik Lehnsherr, a.k.a. Magneto, and Professor Charles Xavier into opposition. While Xavier seeks to stop the hatred toward mutants peacefully, Magneto seeks to even things out, with a machine that would speed up the mutation process in all humans, making everyone equal. To stop Magneto, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to stop him.  Two mutants with dangerous powers, Logan and Rogue arrive at Xavier's retreat seeking refuge.<br/><br/>This is one of the few comic book adaptations that delivers fully.  Ignore the fact that this takes liberties with the comics by changing costumes and leaving out characters.  The changed costumes are better - darker colours making it feel more realistic rather than bright spandex, the missing characters maybe a disappointment but the film would have been too packed for any characters to come through.  The basic story is exciting and allows plenty of room for great set pieces.  The mood is perfect, Singer delivers a dark vision of the near future.<br/><br/>The script is pretty clever, taking the US's natural reaction to mutants and putting it onscreen - this is a country that doesn't accept other nationalities readily, of course some senator would try to make political points out of hatred.  The fact that both Magneto and Xavier are both flipsides of the same coin, trying to deal with the same problem makes it very clever - not merely a bad guy and a good guy set-up.  The action scenes are the best though and are very stylishly done by Singer - it's clear he likes his  characters and their powers.<br/><br/>The cast are roundly excellent.  Stewart and McKellen add great class in the two fatherly roles and both give good performances.  Hugh Jackman is the best of the rest, it was here that his star started rising.  In fairness it helps that he has the best character in the whole film in the dark, mysterious Wolverine.  Does anyone else think he looks like a young Clint Eastwood?  Paquin is good as are Janssen and Berry.  The bad guys are OK in terms of looks but they don't really have any character - they are merely henchmen.  Given the screen presence of Ray Park when he did his recent heavily made-up bad guy his Toad is a bit of a disappointment.<br/><br/>Overall this dark comic book action movie is excellent for a blockbuster. It's main problem is that it is far too short and really leaves you wanting more.  Hopefully for X-men 2, Singer won't take the Batman route and lighten the mood to make `Happy Meal' merchandising deals easier."

"veensepeper","10","2","3","1 November 2014"," ""A New Hope"" for Comic Book Movies
","When this movie came out, comic book movies were down on their @$$es. The last big comic book movie until then was ""Batman and Robin"", so basically: the genre was dead and killed. It was no other movie than X-Men that re-ignited the genre and proved that a comic fantasy world does not have to be corny, goofy and cheesy at all.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer created a suspenseful story, in which the characters had to deal with being different - and the conflict that rises from bigotry.<br/><br/>""In the not too distant future"", Prof. Charles Xavier has a school for so-called mutants: people who are different. Generally, these mutants possess abilities that normal people do not have - which causes fear and hate in the hearts of the American people. Hence, Senator Robert Kelly proposes a law that calls for mutants to register themselves. Xaviers frenemy, Erik ""Magneto"" Lensherr, is appalled by this law and plots to spread mutancy among world leaders at a UN summit. Xavier's X-Men Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey struggle to stop Magneto. In the middle of these conflicts runaway mutants Rogue and Wolverine take refuge at the Xavier School for Gifted Youngsters...<br/><br/>It's a brilliant movie, with tons of easter eggs and nods to the fans. While not lacking action or fantastic elements, the movie plays the brain card. It is clever, slightly dark. Remember how recently, the second installment of Captain America (The Winter Soldier) was described as a political thriller? Well, X-Men did it first.<br/><br/>But what really excels X-Men is how it captures the emotional impact of being different. How the daily struggle of minorities is portrayed through the metaphor of Mutancy. It is what sets X-Men apart from other super hero / comic book movies; it is their Trump Card. Therefor, it's a shame that this element is being shoved more and more to the background as the X-Movie franchise expands. I hope in the future, they will look back at this first one from time to time, if only to remember what the ""X-Gene"" of this series is.<br/><br/>All in all, X-Men brought back comic book movies. It did for the genre what Star Wars (A New Hope) did for Space Movies. So, maybe there are comic book movies you enjoy more than this... they would not be here if it wasn't for the X-Men and their first movie. I have never granted a 10/10 to a movie before, but this one deserves it."
"BA_Harrison","8","2","3","28 March 2014"," A great start to the franchise.
","Telepathic, follically-challenged, wheelchair-bound genius Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) aims to promote the peaceful co-existence of mutants and humans, teaching students at his School for Gifted Youngsters how to control their powers. Angry metal-bending mutant Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) has other ideas: he wants to transform the world's political leaders into genetic freaks so that they will no longer show prejudice against his kind.<br/><br/>""This is the stupidest thing I've ever heard""— Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), X-Men.<br/><br/>That may be so, Wolverine, but it makes for great entertainment. A smart script that explores interesting themes is expertly brought to the big-screen by director Bryan Singer who uses every special effects trick at his disposal to brilliantly realise the incredible world of the X-Men, giving us just the right balance of drama and action (the film culminating with a fun battle atop the Statue of Liberty (very apt, given the film's motif of tolerance and freedom for all).<br/><br/>X-Men also benefits from excellent casting: distinguished thesps Stewart and McKellen possess the necessary acting chops to effectively portray two such powerful and complex adversaries, Hugh Jackman makes for a very likable hero, Anna Paquin is adorable as troubled mutant Rogue, Halle Berry is hotter than a July heat-wave as weather-controlling babe Storm, Famke Janssen is super-sexy as brainy telekinetic Jean Grey, and Rebecca Romijn looks gorgeous even though she is blue and covered in scales (must be something to do with the fact that she's completely starkers under all that paint!)."
"KillerLord","5","2","3","28 May 2009"," Singer has a problem!
","The first superhero movie by Bryan Singer that I saw was Superman Returns and I knew at once that here was a director that had all the art to make a good artistic movie but just could not deliver too well on the action front. Superman Returns had some really neat and nice effects but the movie just moved too slow to leave a lasting impression on me. Same I found with X-Men (which I repeat I saw after I saw Superman Returns).<br/><br/>The movie of X-Men just fails to weave all the pieces together. It is about a group of mutants divided into two sections. One led by a good man named Xavier, a psychic who believes that the powers of the mutants can be used for the good of the mankind and the other section led by Magneto, a man who believes in condemning humans. And needless to say, the movie is all about how the bad guys scheme in order to get their work done and somehow the good guys managed to prevent them. And no points for guessing - no prominent good guy dies in the end.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent. But I always believed that there is nothing in this world that can substitute a good old close-up fight. CGI rarely manages to give you the impact that a good-old staged fight can give you. The best example is the comparison of fight between Jackie Chan's CGI based ""The Medallion"" and the older movies of Chan where he does everything for real. None of the fights were truly enjoyable to me. And I also do not believe that it is the fact that the fighters are not humans that ticked me off. Because even in the Matrix trilogy, the fighters were superhuman but the movie makers managed to add some believable aspect to the movie.<br/><br/>Maybe, just maybe, it is possible that for someone who has read the original X-Men comic books by Marvel might like the movie for it gives them a chance to see their comic book characters come alive but for someone like me who wants the story told from scratch, I do not see anything great in this movie. The cast is good but the movie is either too short for all of them or maybe too dumb, I am again not sure of that.<br/><br/>To briefly summarize what I felt about the movie is that it fails to impress. There is no character you can sympathize with. There is no character whose profile you can construct at the end of movie simply because the movie does not spend any amount of time telling you about anyone. Anyone watching the movie can easily guess that there has to be a sequel and two more sequels have been released. How they score, I do not know but I am going to get right to seeing the second and third installments of the movies to see if Bryan has been able to do something good to them."
"newfiesailor","8","2","3","27 April 2006"," Not just another comic book movie...
","This movie ranks up there with Spiderman as the best comic book adaptation. It introduces us to the mutants with a little of their background and how they joined Professor X in his fight against Magneto.<br/><br/>Stellar acting and a plot that doesn't take itself too serious, yet serious enough, keeps the movie fueled. The mutants and their adversaries are interesting, the showcasing of their various powers a real treat. Because they are not overly endowed with powerful abilities, each mutant having one definable power, their one on one matchups are all the more attractive. We have a little bit of a love triangle, three dimensional characters, tortured souls, comedic relief, and an attractive cast all wrapped up in costumes. Great stuff! The movie inevitably sets up sequels for years to come. There is no doubt this will become a franchise, much in the way Batman Begins and Spiderman are. The question is: will the departure of Bryan Singer mean the fall of this budding series?"
"Erewhon","8","2","3","10 July 2000"," Delivers as promised
","It's very rare for a movie to live up to the claims made about it by publicity and in articles prior to its release; even GOOD movies often fall short.  But by George X-MEN does deliver the goods right down the line. It's made in a straightforward, basically realistic style, with superpowers taken for granted and, thankfully, not >explained<. If this isn't our world, it's the one next door.  I loved the first Tim Burton BATMAN, but it takes place in its own dark universe; the Richard Donner SUPERMAN (and Donner was involved in X-MEN, too) has some problems, but its big, sweeping, almost pastoral approach was just right.  Singer does X-MEN differently, but just as legitimately.  It's one of the best super-hero movies ever made, and the best big-studio movie this year -- easily.<br/><br/>
Just as they said they'd do, the movie concentrates on the characters and their relationships to the degree that the superhero stuff, of which there is plenty, seems almost secondary to the story which, in this first entry, is mainly about Wolverine and Rogue. I was very disappointed in APT PUPIL; Singer misjudged that one, so I was unsure as to what to expect with X-MEN.  Would it be more like USUAL SUSPECTS or more like APT PUPIL?  It turns out to be MUCH more like USUAL SUSPECTS, at least in terms of quality.<br/><br/>And you get to see the X-Men turn into a team before your eyes. Very satisfying movie."

","The first major superhero film of the 21st century; X-Men is somewhat of a groundbreaking film. For better or worse it helped usher in the era of the summer superhero blockbuster that we are currently living in. As for the film itself, it's a good one. Some of the casting is flawless. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is right up there with Robert Downey's Iron Man and Patrick Stewart's Professor X is not far behind. Ian McKellen, Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin are solid choices to play Magneto, Jean Grey and Rogue respectively. Not all of the characterization is spot on. James Marsden's turn as the leader of the X-Men, Cyclops is uninspiring and Halle Berry's accent as Storm is distracting. The story is not earth-shattering but it is engaging. It's an ironic tale of a man (Magneto) that has witnessed atrocity and discrimination and because of his hatred and fear of humans is prepared to do his own acts of atrocity. Come to X-Men to see where it all started for the legendary original cast and stay for one of the better superhero films ever made.

The movie lacks good action choreography, which some some of you may disagree with because it's the time it was made. But I'd seriously like to bring this up that many other movies did good action before 2000s or even 90s.<br/><br/>Anyways I really wasn't hoping much from the action side but story-wise I must say I was expecting a lot. The first half of the story is not that common or used as much, but, the second half, you already know what's gonna happen. As I mentioned before, good for the beginning of the francise (not considering comics or any other references/adaptations). You'd want watch the next movie for some reason but not desperately.<br/><br/>The casting is brilliant of course with popular names are already seen to play the major roles and their characters and performance was at par good.

","How can we describe things we don't know, things we have no idea about? What is the symbol of things that have no definition? ""X"" can be the answer to this. It is is the third least frequently used letter in English, with a frequency of about 0.15% in words.
It stands for the other, the different and the unknown. It is a minority very much indeed. And what is it about those things? These are the things we sometimes fear the most because we can't tell what's behind it? The rustling in the bush - is it a cat or a sabre-toothed tiger?<br/><br/>So the mutants in the X-Men stand for a minority of life forms, pretty much look alike as humans, but still different. As they have different powers, some of them quite dangerous for humans, and since they are just different, not necesseraly worse or better than humans, they become marginalized by the majority population of humans.
Many mutants find themselves excluded from the society, running away, living on their own and trying to avoid any contact due to fear of being punished. This
raises not only anxiety but also rage and aggression.<br/><br/>There are the good and the bad on both sides, the humans and the mutans. The ones who want war and the ones who seek for peace. This is one of the most outstanding metaphores in the X-Men series and in this first movie. Therefore this movie is a great depiction and may - unfortunately - always be representing current events and how humans treat each other.<br/><br/>Understood this way, this movie shows that it is not about our gender, religion, origin, sexual orientation, nationality, etc. but about if we can live together in peace and freedom.

","The new millenium was when comic book movies were to be taken much more seriously. Blade (which was released in 1998 and even before hand with Tim Burton's Batman films) were good films but it took another film to get viewers and critcs to take the comic book movie seriously. That movie would be X-Men. While not the first depiction of the X-Men ( a spinoff TV movie called Generation X was released in 1996), it is one of the best known. While I have not read the comics, I have a general idea of what the characters should be like. Overall, the characters are pretty good and the actors and actresses are perfect for the roles of the characters. The villan, Magneto (played by Ian McKellen) is not a cliche villain at all which is a huge surprise. But where does the film lack? That would be in special effects. Granted, this was when CG was starting to become better, the CG was not great but not terrible. The plot is a typical taking over the world kind of story. Nothing special there.

"Benjamin-M-Weilert","9","1","1","8 March 2019"," Probably one of the best comic-to-movie transitions ever made.
","Up until the 21st Century, DC had dominated the comic book adaptations on the big screen. Film franchises like Superman and Batman were essentially the only acts in town. Of course, by the time the year 2000 rolled around, Superman hadn't been in theaters for more than a decade, and Batman had become almost as campy and goofy as its 1960's counterpart. This was now Marvel's time to shine. Partly due to a large cast of recognizable characters, X-Men was the right choice to reboot the comic book adaptation film franchise.<br/><br/>Even though X-Men set the standard pretty high for comic book adaptations, very few have followed in its stead. Where most first films in a hero franchise focus on the origins of the main character, the X-Men spans such an enormous timeframe, with characters coming in and out of relevance, that it would be difficult to give all of their origins at once. Instead, the focus is on Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Logan (Hugh Jackman), essentially giving some of their ""origins"" without having to explain the motivations of every other X-Men character.<br/><br/>What really makes this film work, aside from its relevant plot, is the casting. Not only were these top-tier stars appearing in the film, but they were expertly given roles that fit them incredibly well. In fact, I can almost not imagine anyone else playing Wolverine but Hugh Jackman. The same goes for Halle Berry as Storm, Ian McKellen as Magneto, and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier. I wouldn't have gone with anyone else for those roles, which definitely made casting the prequel trilogy quite the challenge.<br/><br/>Probably one of the best comic-to-movie transitions ever made, I give X-Men 4.5 stars out of 5."

Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Rebecca Romijin and Halle Berry (in a white wig) are all decent enough, without being great.<br/><br/>But for me,it is the casting of Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian Mckellan that is a masterstroke. As Professor X and Magneto, respectively. They are not enemies so much as ideological opposites. They bring style, gravitas and panache to the proceedings.<br/><br/>For an origin movie, introducing a host of new characters, to the movie going public, it's not overly long, I actually thought ""This has flown by"" then I realised its run time as the credits rolled, most of the special effects hold up, it has a nice score and I'll admit it does hit me in the feelings during Logan's attempts at reviving Rogue during the finale."

","While 'X-men (2000)' can be lacking in action and its age is starting to show in a couple of areas, this pioneer of the genre is still an entertaining experience with great character moments. It's at its sharpest when exploring themes of civil rights, those that were at the heart of the series since its inception, and the thematic elements can be surprisingly dark; I don't think anyone expected this big budget blockbuster to begin in a concentration camp. The film is a solid start to what would become a major franchise and it's easy to forget what a monumental task it had. Setting up its fantastical but grounded world and characters while making them digestible for a wide audience is no mean feat and the fact it pulls it off so effortlessly is commendable. Its fantastic casting helped, with most of the main cast sticking around for over ten years. While the series did get better - though it also got much worse, this feature is an enjoyable and engaging one from start to finish. 7/10"
"gcsman","7","1","1","15 April 2018"," This is where the superhero movie genre began
","Contrary to the ongoing publicity from the MCU, the superhero-film genre did NOT start with Iron Man (2008). It began 8 years earlier with X-Men and director Bryan Singer's deft vision of how to take realistic people who just happen to have mutant powers, and convincingly put them on screen. <br/><br/>My rating for IMdB really means a 7 ""with an asterisk"". Several years ago I would probably have given X-Men a higher numerical rating for IMdB, but of course the field has kept rising in the nearly two decades (!) since.. But that's really the whole point: this ground-breaking movie itself deserves a ton of credit for getting that train rolling. With apologies to the classic Superman and Batman films of the previous generation (ca. 1980-90), they really had no successors, and the special effects capabilities were not really up to the task. X-Men is what made this genre stick. I watched it again recently on DVD after many years' absence, and it still holds up quite well. It's just so likable. The characters are engaging like people you'd want to know better, the storyline is clear, and the ending is satisfying while obviously leaving threads for a followup. Its eagerly welcomed sequel X2: X-Men United (2003) raised the bar in every way and it still ranks IMHO among the handful of the best superhero films ever made.<br/><br/>X-Men gets a lot of things right. For one thing, the X-Men comics from which it draws its basic elements has had a very strong cohort of female characters almost right from the beginning. Sure enough, in this movie the cast of players has something approaching gender equity with Jean Grey, Ororo, Rogue, and Mystique (Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn) alongside the leading men (Professor X, Magneto, Scott Summers, and of course Wolverine -- Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, James Marsden, Hugh Jackman). The only thing that doesn't *quite* make it to full gender equality is that the agendas driving the plot are still being set by the two older men who lead the opposing teams of good and bad mutants. <br/><br/>Another obvious highlight is the quality of the casting. Stewart and McKellen, already well established top actors at that stage, gave the cast instant credibility are almost perfectly suited for their roles. Hugh Jackman was a revelation in his breakout role as Wolverine: the snarling, physically intimidating antihero continually plagued by the mystery of his own origin. Halle Berry, who I guess was intended to lend another reasonably big name to the list, looked the part of Storm all right but was too soft-spoken: that character needs to have a commanding, regal demeanor. James Marsden is fine as action team leader Scott Summers, though a dozen other guys would do as well. The young Anna Paquin plays a mutant who hates and is trapped by her own power. Famke Janssen, though not a great actress, nevertheless nicely puts across a charismatic warmth. In a key too-short scene halfway through, we get an early foreshadowing of her capability for self-aware self-sacrifice: the mind-enhancing Cerebro computer (straight from the comics!) has been sabotaged and puts the Professor into a coma after he tries to use it. Jean, knowingly putting her entire mind at risk, uses it to uncover Magneto's location. In X2 -- where she's really the central character -- she will choose a much costlier action to save the entire team. <br/><br/>For the villains (here called the Brotherhood -- the ""Brotherhood of Evil Mutants"" as it was in the early rather simplistic X-Men comics, just wouldn't have worked -- Tyler Mane and Ray Park as Sabretooth and Toad don't have much to do before the final dust-up, but they're fine. The shapeshifter Mystique (Rebecca Romijn) doesn't need to do much either except look spectacular, which indeed she does, but in the final action scenes she has a great all-out fight with Wolverine. Storm also gets to show off her full weather-controlling power at several points throughout. <br/><br/>The first 20 minutes or so has the difficult job of introducing not just one new leading character but an entire team of them. To get this across, we get a very nicely staged series of dramatic entries. First is the flashback to the concentration camp in 1944 where young Erik (now Magneto) has the traumatic experience that shapes his entire life. Then it's the present day with Jean speaking at a Senate committee meeting that also introduces Senator Kelly (an effective Bruce Davison) and the ""mutant problem"" that underlies all the X-Men movies, along with Charles and Erik behind the scenes . Then in rapid succession we get Rogue, Logan, Scott, and Storm expertly linked, and finally the X-mansion where the main plot can finally get started. A nice touch is that all the action is placed in historical context: the shadowy contest between Professor X and Magneto and their teams has already been going on for years, and this plot is just one episode in a bigger story. X2 continues the saga pretty much where this important first one leaves off. <br/><br/>Finally, I'll repeat what I said in my review of X2: they both succeed because the storyline and the characters take center stage -- not the action scenes. X-Men doesn't skimp on action, but it's what happens *between* the action set pieces that makes a movie like this last."

","X-Men released back in 2000 had several among fans of hype since it was the beginning of the decade as well as the film has been very anticipated. This film does a lot well and is a great piece of entertaining. Running relatively short on screen time (about 96 mins excluding the end credits) compared to the typical 2+ hour of other comic book superhero films. Although the pacing could have been better, since it wasn't too long, things come into place very quickly and the film becomes instantly good. <br/><br/>The cast is great, which is what makes the film excel. The chemistry between the characters work out well, especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) with Patrick Steward (Charles Xavier) as well as the other heroes Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Rogue. The visual effects are top notch. <br/><br/>We see how far this franchise has come into the year 2017 as many had not known back then how successful these films would have become. Comparing this original X-Men film to the newer films of the 2010's, this feels somewhat more dark in spirit, and less comical in some ways. A feel in tone is noticeable. X-Men most definitely lived up to the hype and is overall exciting and faithful to its original comic book origins. <br/><br/>Although with quite a simple plot, it flows decent enough and by the end of the film (in which an obvious sequel was set), we are left wanting more. Highly recommend for those of fans of the source material as well as those wanting to see how the origin started."
"andrewnmiller","10","1","1","31 October 2017"," A new dawn for comic book movies.
","When it comes to the X-men, I watched the 90s animated show, but I never read the comics as a kid, so when I sat down to watch the movie, I wasn't sure if I would like it or not, well I can say that X-men is a fantastic movie from it's themes about discrimination and bigotry to it's acting and it's faithfulness to the source material, in fact had it not been for this movie, the comic book movie renaissance may never have happened.<br/><br/>The movie starts with a young Erik Lehnsherr is taken from his parents, inadvertently reveling his mutant abilities, later the Senate attempts to pass a registration act for mutants which deeply concerns Lehnsherr's former friend Charles Xavier, meanwhile Marie D'ancanto flees her home and arrives in Canada where she meets another mutant named Logan, the two are soon brought to Xavier's school and now must stick together to stop Magneto's evil plans.<br/><br/>Unlike many of Marvel's and DC's heroes, X-men is a more socially and morally complex comic series about individualism and injustice as the heroes are not accepted and have to fight for a place in the world and unfortunately suffer because they're not only different but also possibly deadly. The bigotry that humans display towards these mutants provides an interesting metaphor for our own recent climate of political, ethnic, sexual and homophobic intolerance as well as the anxiety teens and young adults face as they seek their own place in the world. Some have equaled the battle between Magneto and Professor X to the clash between Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X while others have commented on mutants as badges for any persecuted group of people compelled to classify themselves whether they be minorities, LGBT, or gun owners. Even the narration at the beginning of the movie aptly captures the X-men's background as well as the deep-seating battles they will have to face.<br/><br/>While many comic book movies open with sweeping credits and fabulous music, Bryan Singer decides to set this movie up a little different by showing us the horrors of the Holocaust which recalls several scenes from Schindler's List while Lehnsherr unleashing his power evokes the prom scene from Brian De Palma's Carrie and as far as movie intros go, the opening scene at Auschwitz grasps the viewer with its sadness and clearly, this appalling and gloomy scene isn't the traditional way to open a comic book movie not to mention the way the scene also shapes the villain's perception of mankind and allows the viewer to feel sympathetic for Magneto and realize that he isn't like Darth Vader or Norman Bates but rather a ill-guided radical who has seen the dark side of humankind and sees them as inferior making for a much more interesting comic book villain than what some comic book films try to do with their villains.<br/><br/>As for the director, Bryan Singer, he deserves all the praise given to him over the years because apart from a few other directors, he has been able to make a truly great comic book film by giving each character, be them hero or villain, enough development to in order for us to care about them as well as addressing the themes that the comics touched on without preaching or hitting the audience over the head with it and a lot of that comes from the acute and insightful dialog from the screenplay by David Hayter and an unacknowledged Christopher McQuarrie whose fingerprints can be viewed throughout the movie like the argument between Senator Kelly and Jean Gray at the beginning of the movie is enlightened but it also sets up the events of the movie to come while the conversation between Erik and Charles towards the end of the movie interprets what a discussion between MLK Jr. and Malcolm X would should be like. The film is nearly perfect with it's editing and music as we move from scene to scene with every moment benefiting the scene and never overstaying it's welcome while the music by composer Michael Kerman is truly magical but also dark and foreboding at time, perfectly complementing the dark tone of the film. Unlike a lot of more recent superhero movies, there isn't a lot of action in the movie as it isn't the focal point but it's still impressive to watch and is more than fulfilling and incredibly elegant like the fight between Wolverine and Sabertooth in the snow or the final battle at the Stature of Liberty while the visual effects are also fantastic and seem to add to the film rather than distract from the viewing experience.<br/><br/>As for the cast, they're all flawless, Ian Mckellen is outstanding as Magneto and what might have come across as a corny performance instead gives us a distinguished and authentically enraged villain as Ian appears to create layers of cruelty and discrimination within himself, making for a more sympathetic villain rather than a power-hungry madman and he could have easily made the movie his own. Famke Jessen is admirable as Jean Gray and brings a lot of deepness to what otherwise could have a poorly written character while James Marsden brings the overly firm Cyclops to life in a wonderful way, Rebecca Romjin brings a lethal edge to the shape-shifter Mystique while Halle Berry brings a certain believability and truthfulness to the role of Strom. Patrick Stewart was born to play Charles Xavier and gives a wonderful performance, conveying all the characteristics of a father figure and leader. Anna Paquin is perfect as Rouge, bringing a level of anxiety to her performance but also still managing to be a strong interesting character, but Hugh Jackman as Wolverine makes the movie and plays the character with every dose of hotheaded and depressing enthusiasm and it's a joy to see.<br/><br/>There's really nothing more that can be said about X-men, it changed comic book movies and should be watched."
"brandinscottlindsey","6","1","1","16 July 2017"," Mutants, Puns, Action
","X-Men is a 2000 film based on Marvel's X-Men comic book series. The plot follows a drifter named Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, who is soon introduced to a young woman, nicknamed Rogue. Wolverine quickly realizes why the girl wants to stay with him: they are both mutants, or people who are born with supernatural abilities. The misfit duo's genes soon bring them in the middle of a clash between two organized mutant groups: Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart, and his mutant X-Men against Magneto, played by Ian McKellen, and his Brotherhood of Mutants. Action and heroism follow that lead to an epic battle of mutant against mutant.<br/><br/>The film takes many liberties from the comic books, but it seems to work well in this setting. The movie has all the action and fun you'd expect from the X-Men, including a smug Cyclops, the rebellious and awesome Wolverine, and an interesting cast choice of Halle Berry as Storm. The special effects are good, the movie keeps an exciting pace, and the story is interesting.<br/><br/>The problems with this movie mainly consist with the poor dialogue. This is the part of a comic book movie that needs to be the least like a comic book. Corny one-liners, puns, and melodramatic dialogue take away from the seriousness established in the conflict. Some of the fighting scenes are a little silly, especially the ones including the shape-shifting mutant, Mystique. My final complaint, which I make in hesitation, was the way some of the plot devices were handled. I cannot elaborate too much on this without giving anything away, but one example I can make is the villain's clichÃ© ""doomsday"" weapon. Where did it come from? How does it work? It's just there to be there, to be the conflict and the problem that has to be addressed.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, the film is still entertaining and enjoyable. Action-packed and full of your favorite characters from the comics, this movie is mostly for the fans. Outsiders are in for a corny ride that the action may not justify."
"Leofwine_draca","6","1","1","6 December 2016"," A satisfying piece of light entertainment
","Here's a cinematic rarity: a comic strip getting a successful big screen treatment. It doesn't happen very often, but we're finally at the stage of CGI technology to actually make an effects-intensive movie like this work, and look ""right"". This is a film never designed to win any awards for the script, direction, or acting abilities, yet instead appeal to the crowds as a fun, exciting way to spend one hundred minutes of your life. And with a film like this, the biggest impact comes watching it on the big screen. I've never been a fan of the X-Men comics or television series myself, which is why I was surprised about enjoying this film. The characters are clear cut, easy to identify with and, most of all, extremely cool. For a blockbuster film like this it's rare to find characterisation, but (gasp) it does occur here, chiefly with the character of Wolverine, who is given most screen time. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the role, bringing the right balance of instability, anger, love, and honour to his character, and he's also very charismatic as well. And that's not mentioning the great big bloody spike things which frequently shoot out of his knuckles.<br/><br/>The rest of the X-Men are familiar, yet due to there being so many of them, are given little or nothing to do. Storm gets to partake in some spectacular hell-raising moments yet that's it. Patrick Stewart is on hand as the wise mentor Professor Charles Xavier, yet is also given little to do aside from roll around in his wheelchair and lapse into unconsciousness at important moments. Anna Paquin puts in a good, heartfelt performance as the shunned Rogue, unable to come into skin contact with another living soul, and we do feel for her situation, but she's the only one. Cyclops has great x-ray vision, but when he's got his glasses on, he's forgettable.<br/><br/>The bad guys are a mixed bunch and seemingly possess little in the way of intelligence. And, there's only four of them. Sabretooth is a big, hairy and powerful guy, yet just seems like a bigger, inferior version of Wolverine. Ian McKellen, as Magneto, seems a somewhat lame leading bad guy, and the decision to make him a three-dimensional and human villain takes away some of the impact of his character. And the sight of him floating around in a cape is guaranteed to raise the odd chuckle. Mystique is visually arresting as the blue-skinned shape shifter, but most of her tricks have been stolen from the liquid metal man in TERMINATOR 2 and countless ""body snatcher"" films. Finally, Ray Park (better known as the actor under the makeup playing Darth Maul in THE PHANTOM MENACE) is a delight as the purely evil Toad, with a whopping great tongue and the ability to jump about all over the place.<br/><br/>For those expecting action, there is actually not that much, aside from the predictable ending. One standout moment has chaos reigning at a train station, but little else in the way of fighting occurs. As this is a 12 certificate film, we never actually see any on screen deaths occur, and there's hardly any blood or impact to the violence either - here, it's unfortunately glamorised. Wolverine's claws are used to impale only a few people (who survive), which is a bit of a cheat. But the biggest cheat of all is the film's cop-out ending, predictably paving the way for a sequel, which leaves most of the bad guys alive and the fate of the others unknown.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth watching for the special effects alone, as they easily surpass the overdone nature of the ones in something like THE PHANTOM MENACE. They're also almost constantly on screen, and most effective when they occur in ""normal"" situations when you don't expect them. My particular favourite was when one unfortunate man dissolved into water, or a moment where one character squeezes between cell bars and has his eyes bulge out alarmingly. And then there's all manner of comic-book explosions, lightning, lasers, and big clouds of vaguely threatening white stuff (no, I have no idea what it was supposed to be either). The only complaints come from the occasionally poor editing and the open-endedness of the finale. Otherwise this is well worth a watch and a nice, satisfying piece of light entertainment."
"generationofswine","10","1","1","20 November 2016"," An Honest Review
","I remember Wizard Magazine and a couple of other comic book publications speculating on who would be case for which roles when the film was greenlit...<br/><br/>Danzig was recommended for Wolverine and instead they cast Hugh Jackman a man who, in 2000 no one ever heard of. Time proved that to be a near perfect choice. I mean 17 years on and he's still loyal to the role.<br/><br/>Danzig likely would have been flighty, but at the time a comic book movie franchise was unheard of. James Bond got a movie franchise. Slashers got a franchise. Everything else, at the most you could expect one, maybe two sequels.<br/><br/>But then the X-Men sort of started it all didn't it? Sure Blade came out in '98, but no one ever thought of Blade as a franchise film. The X-Men was really innovative in that way, here they are still making the movies.<br/><br/>Mark-Paul Gosselaar I remember was suggested for Cyclopes and instead we got James Marsden and again that was a good choice, Marsden looks like a prig and that is exactly what Cyclopes should be...a jerk with a false sense or moral superiority.<br/><br/>Again it was a great casting call. You disliked him from the start and he is the boss that knows how to get the job down and no one really likes...save Jean Grey who again was an awesome choice of casting.<br/><br/>Halle Berry as Storm...hmmm, that one I question. But the recommendations I remember reading cast an SI Swimsuit model and that I would question even more.<br/><br/>It's not that I don't think Berry can act, but Storm is a kick-butt goddess and, well, in 2000 you didn't have the feeling that Berry was tough enough. As a result, you only got that one shining moment of the character Storm was supposed to be and that moment she delivered a line that was clearly Joss's contribution.<br/><br/>Singer did do a great job. He has carved a name for himself in X-History...but serious fan boys still wonder what could have been if they kept Joss on, or even if they only kept his script.<br/><br/>Wolverine gets all the attention, but the X-Women are arguably the most powerful women on any super hero team. Joss Whedon knows how to write strong women, he knows how to make them work. He knows how to make them the tough hombres they are in the comic.<br/><br/>It's evident by that one Storm line that could only have been his.<br/><br/>And there alone is the singular fault of the movie. The women aren't as powerful, aren't as tough as they are in the comic books. The series was reliant on the men in it more than the women. It was a disappointment, but it worked.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen was cast as Magneto...great choice. The Comic reviews were recommending Clint Eastwood and, well he's a far better director than he ever was an actor McKellen can act and he did a stellar job.<br/><br/>So can Stewart and even now, bald head aside, it's hard to imagine anyone else as Professor X.<br/><br/>There were so many good choices, so many turns it made that could have gone wrong that the few mistakes they made seem overshadowed by the great decisions of all involved.<br/><br/>There is a reason why X-Men really introduced us to the cinematic age of comic books."
"keithbrown-90195","6","1","1","18 September 2016"," A Dated but Important Superhero Entry
","The gulf that exists between this film and where superhero movies are now is so vast that X-Men feels quaint by comparison. But there's something to be said for a plot that mostly keeps a strong focus on character and a compact running time. The resources for large-scale spectacle just wasn't there yet, which may have benefited the end result in some aspects, but it leaves you feeling like there's something missing. There are some clunky action scenes, which does add a bit to the old-fashioned charm, but it does also make it feel quite dated.<br/><br/>I like X-Men more than most superhero stuff just by the nature of the world in which they occupy. Their problems and sufferings are easy to relate, and the antagonist's perspective is clear and understandable. The conflicts are driven by character choices that remain consistent. The varied abilities of the mutants has endless potential for the screen. Plus, they really feel like a team, where each character serves a useful purpose and is given real personality.<br/><br/>I'm not always the biggest fan of where superhero movies have gone, but this was clearly an important piece in getting the ball rolling. It's too bad that the genre's progress has made this more of a historical artifact than an enjoyable movie."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","1","12 June 2016"," Laughable by today's standards, but okay for what it is.
","The release of this first X movie marks the beginning of good superhero movies. A decade and a half later, superhero movies are some of the biggest of each year. Two of the biggest movies of the year so far have been from the X-Men franchise in Deadpool and Apocalypse. The reason that I think accounts for the recent rise in success is the advancement of visual effects, because the larger than life stunts that superheroes pull don't look laughably cheesy now that we have better visuals. The visuals of this first installment are pretty pathetic in light of what we see nowadays. You can all but see the ropes and such pulling the characters when they jump or get throw back or something.<br/><br/>What' s really great about the X-Men series compared to other superhero stories is that they aren't considered heroes. There's always a huge social question in play about how mutant's should be integrated into society with humans. Some people complain that this is too much of an allegory for how racial minorities and in particular homosexuals are treated, but art is meant to comment on the problems of the time. Besides, the mutant powers are more than just a social statement, which is why all the mutations resemble superpowers. Like any ability, the mutant's powers can be used well, abused, taken advantage of, suppressed, and set off unexpectedly and uncontrollably. This is what Professor X is getting at by having a school for mutants.<br/><br/>The characters are written decently in this first movie, but not as well as they are in the prequel movies of the 2010's. Most of them aren't one dimensional, but their personalities are caricatured as with Logan's irritability and Professor X's generic mentor performance. The main characters' motives are simple, but strong, which makes for an easy-to-follow story, but not the most interesting one. The writing of the minor characters is easily one of the weakest aspects of the movie. All of Magneto's followers (Toad, Mystique, Sabertooth) feel really cheesy from Toad's awful dialogue to the poor action sequences with Sabertooth, to Mystique's eyes flashing green to alert us that she's impersonating someone. The minor protagonists are a little better, but Bobby and Storm definitely could have used some more personality.<br/><br/>All of the actors give adequate performances, but nothing beyond that. The directing is fine, except in the action sequences. I don't know if the action was good for the time especially since I've grown up with great spfx all my life, but I doubt it was great even in 2000. The score is very string and woodwind dominant with a flutey feeling to it, much like John Williams' music is when he isn't using one of his main themes.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend this as a top pick for someone looking to get an action movie. I doubt it will be many people's favorite today, especially in light of all the new X movies that have come out. It's good to see if you want to catch up before seeing the new ones, and you'll likely enjoy it beyond merely gaining a better understanding of the sequels/prequels. So go in with low expectations and you might be surprised at how much you like it. Overall Rating: 7/10."

","Now whether you agree with me or not, I could never really get into the first X-Men movie. If you were to ask me the highlights of the first movie, I'd say it established beloved characters impressively and had stellar acting throughout. Then all I could think about was the dull pacing of this movie, a final confrontation that I found unimpressive and a pretty much absurd plan from the villain (I understood the plan, I just thought how convenient and nonchalant everything managed to come together).<br/><br/>That said though, the movie was more than impressive in other aspects. I liked that it included its fear of mutants (Originally a stab at communism), and it was extremely well casted. Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellen portray Xavier & Magneto to a tee. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine had slowly grown into the role for me, as well as Halle Berry, James Marsden and Rebecca Romijn etc. Who all did a fantastic job.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Was this really a good X-men movie? I greatly respect Bryan Singer's filmography and as I currently write, there are a plethora of better X-Men movies to choose from. 6/10. It was one of the first of it's kind for the new millennium, but it's starting to show it's age considerably."
"rparham","8","1","1","5 June 2006"," X-Men are X-celent
","X-Men is one of Marvel's oldest superhero teams, launched in the early 1960's. A comic interpretation of a ethnic or racial group that is met with bigotry, hatred and intolerance, X-Men continued Marvel's tradition of featuring heroes that were decidedly more down to earth than their DC Comics brethren. It took years of development to bring the mutant superheroes to the big screen, but it was finally tackled by director Bryan Singer, who made a big splash with his sleeper cult hit, The Usual Suspects. As realized by Singer and his screenwriter collaborators Tom DeSanto and David Hayter, X-Men would bring comic book adaptations into a more realistic world than the ones that Batman had played in in the 1990s, and successfully launch Marvel comics into a string of strong adaptations that continues to this day.<br/><br/>In the universe the X-Men inhabit, small numbers of humans have begun to show evolutionary mutations. Some of these mutations manifest themselves in the form of physical deformities, such as different skin coloring, scales or extreme sizes. Others appear normal, but possess powers that make them superhuman such as extreme healing abilities, control of temperature and the weather, and walking through solid objects. Normal humans view the mutants with fear and trepidation, shunning them and forcing mutants to live in hiding and with shame. As X-Men opens, we are shown a flashback scene in which young mutant Eric Lensherr, aka Magneto, reveals his powers to control metal objects when he is separated from his parents at a German concentration camp during World War II. When he grows up, his experience with intolerance at the hands of the Germans has ingrained in him a strong distrust for human society in general. When crusading Senator Kelley (Bruce Davison) decides to introduce the Mutant Registration Act, which would force all mutants to be identified by the government, Magneto (played as an adult by Ian McKellan) has determined that no mutant will ever be marked as he was as a child and plans to fight back.<br/><br/>Simultaneously, a young teenage girl, Marie, aka Rogue (Anna Paquin), has just discovered her power, which is to take the life energy out of any person she touches. This revelation comes to her when she first kisses her boyfriend, leaving him in a coma. Fearful of her powers, she runs away from home and in a small town in Canada discovers a fellow mutant, loner Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). Wolverine has advanced healing abilities, and is also equipped with a skeleton covered in a material called Adamantium, a metal that is indestructible, along with three sharp claws imbedded in his hands that he can unleash at a moments notice. Rogue and Wolverine are attacked by mutants working for Magneto and are saved by the X-Men, the name of a team of elite mutants that have been trained to use their powers for good by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who founded a school for mutants in New York. The key members of the X-Men are Cyclops (James Marsters), who can shoot energy beams from his eyes, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who has telekinetic powers and Storm (Halle Berry) who can control the weather. Professor Xavier believes that Magneto wants Wolverine for some purpose, so he is determined to hide him at all costs and prevent a plan Magneto has to convert normal humans into mutants.<br/><br/>X-Men is very much an allegorical story, depicting man's intolerance to that which he finds different. This gives X-Men a dramatic strength many other comic book stories lack, which are often a bit too wrapped up in their fantasy material. Singer and crew have made a good decision to ground X-Men in, essentially, the real world. New York is New York, there are the references to the Holocaust which provides a good basis for Magneto's hatred and the characters are smart enough to find the trappings of the comic book world they are in a bit ridiculous (In one scene, as the X-Men introduce themselves to Wolverine with their code names, he snickers and says ""This is the stupidest thing I have ever heard."").<br/><br/>On the character front, X-Men does suffer a bit from an overload of characters. Storm, Professor Xavier and Magneto's henchmen suffer from lack of development because there just isn't enough screen time for everybody. On the flip side, Wolverine, Rogue and Magneto are fleshed out to a decent degree, allowing us to become familiar with them and involved in their story. This imbalance of character development would haunt the future X-Men sequels as well.<br/><br/>X-Men was a film that had the potential to be a budget buster, so some care was taken to not overload the film with visual effects and as a result, X-Men looks a little low budget and underwhelming compared to it's bigger budget successors. The action sequences are kept to a minimum, but the film is not completely lacking in it's quota of fisticuffs. The special effects are decent, but noticeably restrained, so as to keep the film in check. In some ways, this restraint is almost better, as it allows X-Men to look to something other than eye candy to fill it's running time, leaving more room for the issues and characters.<br/><br/>X-Men would prove to be a popular comic book translation and Marvel used it to launch itself into superstardom after that, following up with Spider-Man two years later. While it has some flaws, X-Men is a good entry in the genre and one that set the tone for good adaptations to follow."

","I read some of these post and thought that I had to write something. Cyclops is my favorite character in the comic and in the movie.  He was stiff in the movie, yes.  Why?  Because that is the way he is in the comic books.<br/><br/>Wolviren was not watered down because that is the way he is when he is with the X-Men.  He always takes a likin' to the younger person.<br/><br/>There were ten characters.  It is hard enough to come up with enough for each.  They did a great job.<br/><br/>There really isn't a lot about Cyclops to know other then he is stiff. Unless they wanted to tell about how he hit his head when he was yonger and that is why he has to wear a visor to keep from blasting everywhere.<br/><br/>Wolviern is only human, partly, because he doesn't always act like a ravge beast.  He has a loving side to him.<br/><br/>Rouge is not sassy.  She wasn't when she first found out about her powers. Now she became that way, and people who have read the comic books would know that.<br/><br/>This movie was a start and it was a very good start.  It could have been better if they had the Beast and Gambit and Pyro, like they wanted, but the money was not put up by Fox.  Just like they wanted the Danger room in there too.<br/><br/>As for comparing it to the Batman stuff, you cannot.  Batman was one character it was easier to make it and make it where you understand him and where he is coming from.  X-Men is based on many characters and therefore take longer to developed when they have to share the screen with others. Batman movies were good up to two.  Then they lost out.  So I hope it never compares to Batman since Batman droped after the second one.  X-Men, if handled right, will never drop.<br/><br/>The X-Men in this movie stay with the charters that are true to the X-Men. I am a big fan and I see it.  There was not enough development but no one seems to understand how long the movie was and how many people were in the movie.  You barely got to know Magneto.  They didn't tell you that he has two children and that a mob killed his wife.  That his two children grow up to be against their father.  One being on the Advengers, Scarlet Witch, and one on one of the X-Teams, Quicksilver.  They didn't tell you that Profesor X has a step brother who is very strong and named the Juggernaut.  They didn't tell you that Cyclops has a brother and they were split in the adoption process.  That the person over the Adoption place Cyclops was at was owned by Mr. Sinister his nemises in years to come.  They didn't tell you that Storm was a Goddess and that she is claustrophobic.  They didn't tell you that Wolviren was an experiment and that Sabertooth was a part of that experiment but when Wolviren escaped he made Sabertooth lose out on it. They didn't tell you that Mystique had a real child and his name was Nightcrawler.  That she has a best friend named Destany.  There is so much that could have been said to make you care for them but that is too much in the time that was alloted.<br/><br/>This movie was, as I said, a great start.  And Batman it is not because they are the X-Men."

","Finally, a comic book to movie transplant that survived the operation! X-Men is sure to become the latest in a series of US Summer season dark horses.  Never before has a film of this genre so skilfully played to mainstream audiences and die-hard fans alike!  From a Big Summer Movie perspective, it provides a tight story, efficient character setups, dazzling visual effects, creepy villains, a lean (but sufficiently packed) running time, even the odd spot of sharp dialogue!  From the fans' perspective, it hits the mark in every dramatic area: the characters all have small but extremely telling moments to display personalities completely consistent with those you've known and loved all these years.  The group dynamic is well established, and the actors are all terrific- special mention MUST be made of Hugh Jackman (NOT because he's Australian!), as his Russell Crowe-esque performance beautifully fleshes out Wolverine's angst, confusion and warring mental states.  Expect this guy's star to go nova within the next couple of years.  Director/co-writer Bryan Singer returns to his ""Usual Suspects"" form (after the disappointment of ""Apt Pupil""), making what is ure to be the biggest comic book-crossover hit since the Tim Burton ""Batman"" films.  Overall, it makes for a terrifically enjoyable ""Big Movie"" experience.  One of the few movies where the prospect of a sequel actually seems promising..."

","I was really counting down the days before X-Men was going to be released in Malaysia, downloaded all the trailers and even read every preview I could get my hands on.<br/><br/>When it finally got released, I went to watch it on the first day with my whole family.<br/><br/>And amazing as it would seem, it was better than I had ever anticipated! The pacing, the story, the special effects and most of all Hugh Jackman!<br/><br/>From its opening in World War II Poland to the climatic final fight on top the Statue of Liberty, this movie had me in its vice-like grip and just wouldn't let go!<br/><br/>Far from being an action film, director Bryan Singer has done a great job in recreating the world of the X-Men on the big screen.<br/><br/>Best of all, the movie wasn't just about some special effects thrill ride with unbelievable action scenes but rather an intelligent film which we can all relate to.<br/><br/>The world of X-Men is not entirely unlike our own. Prejudice towards mutants in the movie echoes the racial problems of our own world.<br/><br/>Mutants are made to feel like outcasts in the movie, something most people would be able to relate to since one time or another, we have all had the feeling of not fitting in.<br/><br/>The movie also excelled in its realistic portrayal of human relationship. Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan all gave superb performances as mutants with human feelings, frustrations and convictions.<br/><br/>The big brother-small sister relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was perhaps the emotional strongpoint of the movie. Great acting indeed.<br/><br/>The on-screen relationship between Magneto and Professor Xavier too was another high-point of the film. Here are two equally brilliant minds who could have had the strongest of friendships had it not been for their opposing views on humanity's prejudice towards mutantkind.<br/><br/>Magneto himself was not portrayed as your average I-wanna-rule-the-world villain, but rather a product of Nazi brutality towards Jewish people. Magneto is on a personal war to prevent what he sees is the beginnings of another Holocoust, this time not against Jews, but against mutants everywhere.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is a must see, not for its special effects (though excellent) or action (very good), but rather for the human drama. And that is what X-Men succeeds in. In being a movie that is directed against racism, bigotry and prejudice. Highly recommended!"

","What a waste of a great comic book series.  There hasn't been a great film made about a comic book superhero since Chris Reeve's Superman films. These guys needed a better script and a better director.  Bryan Singer doesn't know how to direct big budget action special effects pictures.  The casting isn't the best and the plot is dull as can be.  The dude who plays Wolverine has some good one liners but that's about it.  Patrick Stewart and Ian M. were good choice for their characters I have to admit.  But this piece of crap film making still doesn't work.  But if you are easily amused you will probably dig this."

","X-Men the movie manages to be an deep as X-Men the comic book which is quite a comment when one compares the comic book medium prior to Stan Lee and his `mutants'. After a surprisingly effective scene when a young Erik Magnus is forcibly separated from his parents in Nazi concentration camp unleashing his intense magnetic powers the action moves to the home of Marie played by Anna Panquin.  As a young teen with a love of travel she confides her dreams to her boyfriend who kisses her.  Instead of lovely moment Marie's boyfriend passes out and suffers a seizure.  Marie is one thousands who are mutants; people born with unique genetic gifts that emerge in adolescence.<br/><br/>In Washington D.C. Senator Edward Kelly (Burce Davidson) advocates a law requiring mutants to register themselves.  Kelly in tense public meeting produces a list of known mutants and even enlists gun control supporters to outlaw mutant `weapons in our schools.'  Very few young people will appreciate Kelly's `list' and its subtle reference to McCarthyism.  In the audience a much older Erik (Ian McKellen leaves the auditorium as the throng applauds the senator.  Erik is then confronted by Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who suspects that his old friend will take action against `humankind'. X-Men spends nearly half the movie introducing us to the world of the X-Men and create the setting.  The film also uses the beloved character Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) to introduce us to the rest of cast.  This makes the film slow moving for fans of the comic book who are already up to speed.  Soon the X-Men discover Erik's AKA Magneto's plan to destroy a United Nations conference and make the first strike in a new race war between humans and mutants. Director Bryan Singer manages to weave the vast backstory of the X-Men into the film without boring fans or overwhelming newcomers to the X-Men and the Xavier School.  Singer manages to coax an exceptional performance from his players including Ian McKellen with whom he worked with in ""Apt Pupil.""<br/><br/>The only people who may be disappointed with X-Men are the die hard comic book fans who can't appreciate Singer's handling of a complex (and yes sometimes unfocused) screenplay. A exciting adaption of comic book without the comic book feel."

","I thought this film was OK.<br/><br/>This was more chat-packed than action-packed, which I found very surprising for a movie of this genre. The talking slowed it down considerably and I found myself becoming rather bored sitting through the film. I chalk this down to expectations of non-stop 'Die-Hard' action!<br/><br/>Characterizations of Wolverine and Rogue were very good. I liked Wolverine and Sabretooth, they were played well, especially Sabretooth with his pointed fangs and roars (too bad he doesn't have a lot to say). Anna Paquin's Rogue was interesting, it is nice to see her as a confused teenager, before she became the Rogue we know in the comics.<br/><br/>
Patrick Stewart played Xavier well. Additions of other X-men (Shadowcat, Iceman etc) was smart. I especially liked Toad, a mutant I don't recall having seen in the comics! Magneto should have been made more evil.<br/><br/>Introducing the X Men this way obviously sets the sights for X Men part II, III, etc, so I shall be very curious as to how the sequels will be handled.<br/><br/>

Beautifully crafted, and shined oh-so-close to perfection this is surely as good as they get. Fans of the story will catch the odd inside joke here and there but with it's great CG, and intense (but not overdone) action sequences this a film for one and for all.<br/><br/>However, where this movie really made my cup of tea was the interaction between the characters. All are woven into the story so appropriately and so well that the director seems to rarely miss a hit with the audience with the emotion he seeks to draw.<br/><br/>Though this isn't possible without the talent to carry it off, there's no evidence of miscasts here. Special mention to Hugh Jackman as Logan, making what may have just been a good show a great one. Along with none other than Dune's Gurney Halleck, Star Trek's Jean Luc, who else more appropriate to cast as the charismatic, noble and fatherly Charles Francis Xavier than Patrick Stewart. A sin it would be not to mention the gorgeous icing upon the cake in the form of Netherlands's Famke Janssen as Dr Jean Grey, combining a sense of professionalism and underlying vulnerability (with those sultry eyes) to ooze femininity over the screen. (Angelina Jolie has a lot of work to do in Tomb Raider to top this act).<br/><br/>The only drawback of this film? It makes you scream for more, more, particularly between the characters, though sequels have tainted reputations of being unable to live up to their predecessors. But in my mind Bryan Singer can do no wrong, as I await the next chapter with baited breath."

","One nice thing about this is the casting of McKellan and Stewart. Despite the latter's adventures with the stupid StarTrek, he is an intelligent actor, as is McKellan. They tower over the amateurs in this film as their characters should. About bad acting, can we be spared from Ms. Berry in the future?<br/><br/>The photography is overloaded on face supercloseups, and the tone is suitably dark. None of the sets thrill.<br/><br/>What's awkward about this attempt is how muddled all the conspiracies are. Thrown into the same blender are Nazi mass murder, Nazi experimentation, radioactive fallout, mind control, US war-time mutant experiments (to come more explicitly when we find out about Wolverine), religious righteousness in the Senate, one-world governments, the hidden x-men, and the evil mutants-who-are-sometimes-merely-mistaken. Are there supposed to be bad guys? What's the central struggle? There's not enough intelligence here to put shades on the real driver. It's paranoia in the comix, which are far more intelligent and nuanced than this film. How can that be?<br/><br/>The ultimate Marvel film should come from Dr Strange. Give it to Ridley Scott to direct, Kenneth Branagh as the Doctor. dark, intelligent, spooky, Kafkaesque."
"Ziya90","10","4","9","7 February 2010"," Perfection
","Unbelievably, I have recently learned that some people don't like this first movie very much. I don't know why, because I did not want to learn, I will just write what I think. X-Men is the best one in the series including X-Men Origins Wolverine by far, even if the second one is deeper and it comes from perfect direction mostly. The movie is very consistent, no uneven material it has at all, it is very stylish and very enjoyable also. The tone, the atmosphere of the movie are so different from the comic book or/and the animation, it is like Bryan Singer creates his own X-Men world, but somehow, it does not turn into a flaw or disappointment. Visually, it looks like a thriller rather than a (colorful) fantastic super hero movie, but this works somehow. Personally, I did not complain about it. Instead, it makes the movie eccentric, idiosyncratic. I like the snowy shots and despite it is short, one of the best action scenes of the movie, the fight after the accident. As for Magneto, Ian McKellen was made for Magneto (and of course for Gandalf too) As I know, some people complained about Sabretooth, but may be even if he was not made for the character like McKellen, Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Halle Berry as Storm, Tyler Mane looks great as Sabretooth. I saw the original character, I watched the animation, but I don't know why they were not satisfied with Tyler Mane's Sabretooth, what was wrong? He is as harsh as the original character too. Halle Berry is so cute by the way. There are a few smart moments like the steel balls or the metal floors related to Magneto by the way, I liked it. The action scene takes place in the station is my second favorite. Just a note: there is a shot with a weird angle, it was amazing. Visually, X-Men is one of the most stark, plain movies ever made probably. The last parts are amazing too, we see some cool fight scenes, everyone encounters with each other. Every time it is so fun to watch thanks to Singer's stark, eccentric direction and the colorful characters. The Wolverine Sabretooth clash is not the focus of the movie, but better than X-Men Origins Wolverine. On the Statue of Liberty, there is a spiral camera shot, loved! And X-Men has much more."

I can't believe storm did not have any moments where she flew about fighting baddies, storm walking to fight baddies is pretty lame. I also wish the x-men fought together as a team near the end in a climactic fashion, maybe to take down sabertooth, instead of wolverine alone, then a mediocre teamwork scene. The script, acting and effects are decent, but it never lives up to its inspiration in any sense. I guess bryan singer (director) just doesn't think big enough for this franchise."

","The X-men had the potential to be a great film but it wasn't. FOX budgeted 75 mil for this film and Singer was able to produce detailed sets, hire decent actors, and have great special effects in this movie for that money amount.<br/><br/>My first grievence of this film is lack of plot. The movie utimately spends more time introducing characters than advancing the plot. I agree character introduction is important for the non-fans of the x-men comics but SInger should refer to other comic-to-film movies like Batman(1989) for how to introduce a character and still have an abudence of plot.<br/><br/>This leads to my second grievence the lack of quality even when a plot was present. (A few minor spoilers) Wolverine crashes through his car and immediately gets up and heals but later when he is hit by a log he is out cold for hours until he arrives back at the mansion. Since the focus of this movie is on Wolverine he shouldnt have big plot discontinueties. The protaganist of the story was Magneto, a good choice for a first movie, but his method of ""evil"" was a doomsday device that would turn the world's population to mutants. Wow that is hoaky. If you want to use a doomsday device in your movie watch Star Wars and pay attention to the Death Star scenes.<br/><br/>My final grievence comes from knowing a little about the comics. (Some major spoilers) Why is Wolverine getting beat up by Sabertooth without putting up a fight? Rouge has had her story line completely changed? Why is Jean Grey so old? You never get the sense of Magneto's power and that he only spares the X-men out of respect for Xavier. Although Mystic can fight, she is generally outclassed by all of the X-men and avoids physicall conflict with them. She uses her cunning to foil the X-men. Why is Iceman, one of the original members of the X-men, just a kid? Maybe this one is just me, but Wolverine seems calm and rational, it doesnt feel like Wolverine."

","This was far busier than it needed to be, stuffing in drama, morality and comedy relief. Since neither of the former two motifs can be taken seriously, we have to look at this as a comedy.<br/><br/>The way this is centered on Jackman and way he is directed to play this puts me in mind of Eastwood in ""Coogan's Bluff""...the attempt is to insert a smart aleck into a fish out of water situation and just let him crack wise at every opportunity.<br/><br/>The problem is, Singer didn't understand ""Coogan's"" structure...in addition to the defined jokester, that movie had defined targets (remember the ludicrous 'Pigeon Toed Orange Peel'?) and both were at a distance from the audience. This movie can't distinguish the targets from the audience: the moral is ""we all have to get along with each others' differences"" and the audience is expected to empathize.<br/><br/>The morality play propped up by Stewart and McKellan is a sort-of MLK versus Malcolm X philosophical debate. It's not offensive, but it is unnecessary. The whole point of it dissolves like the erstwhile senator.<br/><br/>One item of interest is the camera's movement around Jackman during the Statue of Liberty fight; it rotates through 360 degrees in slow motion and only at the end of the shot do we find our perspective again...if only there had been more of these *film* ideas and less comic book flatness and penny-ante moralizing, we'd have had something to remember."

","Not only did Bryan Singer's first X-Men film pave the way for following films to come in the franchise, but it really set the way for the modern era of superhero films. The very first X-Men film really told people that comic book films could mean something and that they weren't just goofy films. These films could relate to the real world and that's why it works so well.<br/><br/>Co-written by Bryan Singer & Tom DeSanto, X-Men is the first time a superhero film truly played with real problems we face in society. The film plays with the ideas of racism and discrimination throughout as soon as the films opens. That's why the comics and the film works wonderfully, the way that the people and mutants fight - in politics or in hand-to-hand - is fueled with passion and true hatred for one another.<br/><br/>Shot with a knowledge of the comics, and a true passion to make the film successful, Bryan Singer directed this first film so well. Its quite mesmerizing how well Singer shot this given it came nearly 17 years ago. The sequence of Logan waking up and exploring the mansion is done to perfection and the quick editing makes it to me a tense scene. I also love just how small scale Singer keeps the film. It all takes place within a somewhat contained area and it really allows the film's characters to hold it together, and boy they sure do.<br/><br/>It seems like Marvel as always been great with casting, because X- Men has a pitch perfect cast. Patrick Stewart's Professor Xavier is just pure brilliance. Ian McKellen as Magneto is menacing and brilliant at the same time. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is pure badass. He resembles everything the character is, and matched it to a tee. The supporting cast of Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Anna Paquin, make the film so much better. Their conversations really bring life into the film and their banter is hilarious.<br/><br/>Another key component to why Singer's first X-Men works so well is how well he treats both sides of the characters. I feel the comparison between Xavier and Magneto and I feel for both sides and that's important, because most films don't allow that to happen. The technical aspects of the film are pretty 50/50. In some parts of the film - Wolverines claws, Storms powers, the fighting between Wolverine and Mystique - the effects look really good for 2000, but some parts - Wolverine flying out the car window - are pretty bad and some dialogue can be a tad cringy, but works overall.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer should go down in history as a director who really allowed the superhero genre to take off to where it is now. X-Men allowed itself to resonate with the audience on a realistic level and that's why it's one of the best comic book films to date. The direction from Singer is beyond it's time, the effects, while iffy sometimes, bring in realism, and the characters are so brilliant and truly make X-Men entertaining."
"ThomasDrufke","7","2","4","15 February 2017"," Where it All Began
","It's hard to believe Hugh Jackman has been playing Wolverine for 17 years now. 'Logan' is just around the corner and it's time to take a deeper look at all of the times Jackman has graced the screen as the legendary comic-book character.<br/><br/>X-Men (2000) hasn't particularly aged as well visually as some other superhero films, but the story is just as relevant as it's always been. It's nice to go back and watch the beginning of it all again after two separate trilogies and a few spin-offs. And just like in every other X-Men film, it always comes down to Charles and Erik. Professor X and Magneto have probably the most fascinatingly complicated relationship in comics. Charles wants everyone to get along and make peace with the humans, while Erik has always believed humans will inevitably turn on mutant kind. What makes the dynamic so great is that neither are 100% right. The only major problem with Erik is that he usually involves killing. Even in 2017 we are having issues with accepting people who are different than us. That's what sadly makes these X-Men films so relevant and timeless.<br/><br/>With that said, there are certain aspects of the film that are more than dated. Storm's inconsistent accent is awkward at best, and Halle Berry doesn't really add anything of value (at least in this film). Sabretooth and Toad are nothing more than pawns for Magneto's use. Some could even say Mystique is one as well, but at least she has some cool action sequences. Mystique adds to the plot with the Senator, but I don't understand the reason for Toad or Sabretooth. Perhaps there just wasn't enough time to cover their motivations in a breezy 105 minute film. On the good side of things, Anna Paquin gives a strong turn as Rogue, Famke Janssen brings an appealing gracefulness to Jean Grey, and Jackman as Wolverine may have been the most brilliant casting in any comic-book property. The early films hold up because of the incredible characters, and not necessarily because they have the most memorable stories or visual flare.<br/><br/>It's always nice to see how far characters have come and see where it all started. For the widely popular X-Men franchise, this is where the countless continuity issues began, when the team first suited up, and where Jackman first donned the claws. It doesn't have the narrative scope or the dazzling visuals that the films do now, but it will always hold a special place in my heart. <br/><br/>+Where it all began<br/><br/>+Story is still relevant<br/><br/>+Charles vs Erik<br/><br/>+Dynamics between characters<br/><br/>-But really, what's the point of Sabretooth or Toad<br/><br/>-Berry's accent<br/><br/>7.8/10"
"ARTaylor","10","2","4","30 May 2011"," Still One of the Best Superhero Movies
","X-Men may have come out fairly early in the recent superhero renaissance, but it still holds up as one of the genre's best. Blade was the first serious modern superhero film, but X-Men was the one that made them popular. For the first time since they stopped making Superman films, audiences got to see heroes using superpowers fighting others with superpowers.<br/><br/>The film was also one of the first to deal with some deep themes. It is in no way a simple good guy versus bad guy story that usually populates the genre. Magneto is every bit as developed, interesting, and sympathetic as the heroes. Possibly, more so. And Singer is able to use his own experiences being a homosexual to enhance the mutant problems so that it becomes an excellent allegory for current events that still remains true to the vast comic book history.<br/><br/>The story is presented as an origin story, but it's not like the numerous other origin stories. Like Blade and Tim Burton's Batman, they're already heroes and can start with the action right away. The Wolverine-Rogue relationship works wonderfully. I don't quite know why they didn't just use Jubilee as it is in the comics, but Rogue works just fine. The Logan-Jean-Scott love triangle starts off great, though I wish they went further with it in the sequels. Though the really terrific relationship is the Xavier-Magneto friendship-turned-rivalry which out shines everyone else. It really added a whole other dimension to the movie that, quite honestly, no other superhero movie has been able to match.<br/><br/>The movie does have a bit too much exposition. Sure there is a lot needed to be explained, but there are a few too many sections of the movie where it's just long speeches by Jean, Xavier, etc. There is plenty of action, more than many other origin movies, and they all work well that you can forgive the long exposition.<br/><br/>The movie is nearly perfectly cast. Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, Jean, Rogue, and Senator Kelly are exactly like they are in the comics. Now, I can hardly read the comics without thinking of their voices to match the dialogue. Mystique is good, but she is better in the sequel. I liked Cyclops, though he has progressively less to do in the sequels which is disappointing since he is such an interesting character. Storm is fine here, but Berry's subsequent rise to fame and insistence on more screen time drags down later movies. I loved Mane as Sabretooth, but the character is given so little to do and honestly he was portrayed more interestingly and faithfully in the Wolverine movie.<br/><br/>The movie isn't just a terrific superhero movie, but a great movie in general. Singer really goes above in beyond in his two X-Men movie, that it's a real shame the next two had to be so overstuffed with characters that everyone became uninteresting. There's a faithfulness and intelligence that's missing from too many other superheroes. X2: X-Men United may do everything this movie did better, but it's still a wonderful movie that I'll happily watch any time."

The director, Bryan Singer is perfect for the job. He creates a darker version of the comics perfectly. Even though it's pretty dark, there are lots of great humorous moments. My favourite line of the film is: <br/><br/>Wolverine: You actually go out in these things? Cyclops: Well, what would you prefer?

","X-Men is one of the most beloved comic-book series of all time, and the 2000 film directed by Bryan Singer really shortens the whole thing up, but still gives us a really good, kick ass film.<br/><br/>The cast in this film are great. Hugh Jackman was born to play Wolverine, for he brings out the character so well, almost making him real. I also liked Patrick Stewart as Jean-Luc Picard, I mean, Charles Xavier. The fight scenes in this film are also something to talk about. My favorite of the scenes was the end fight on the Statue of Liberty. Totally awesome.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the character development in this film. Be sure to check out how Wolverine became Wolverine, and see Magneto being taken away during WWII. In the end, X-Men is a very exemplary film, and is one of the best comic-book films of all time. It is also the reason why we see good super-hero films today.

","In the future, a race of humanoids called Mutants born with unique powers or looks when reached adulthood but the human race misunderstands them and mistreats them badly. So a good and powerful mutant named Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) who has telepathic/telekinetic abilities has formed a school for the gifted or mutants to control their powers and help mankind however there are some terrorist mutants who are hellbent on destroying the human race such as Magneto (Ian Mckellen) who thinks mankind would never accept mutants as he leads some mutants to kill off humans. A runaway mutant girl with the power to temporarily absorb people's energies and mutants's powers named Rogue (Anna Paquin) meets up with a Canadian mutant named Logan a.k.a. Wolverine (Huge Jackman) who has an adamantium skeleton that is unbreakable and has powerful claws including the power to self-heal and senses like an animal. Of course they get attacked by a vicious mutant brute named Sabretooth (Taylor Mane) but gets saved by three mutants named Storm (Halle Berry) who has the power to control elements and weather, Cyclops (James Marsden) who has lazer eyesight he can control and of course Jean Grey (Famnke Janssen) who has powers similar to Professor X only not as strong rescue the two mutants and takes them both to the mansion of the professor. The two new mutants join the secret team of mutant heroes called ""X-Men"" who are sworn to protect all humanity from the bad mutants as Magneto with shape-shifting deadly beauty Mystique (Rebecca Romijin-Stamos), Sabretooth and Toad (Ray Park) plans on mutating the entire human race.<br/><br/>An excellent adaptation of the ever popular Marvel comic books created by Jack Kirby and Stan Lee from the 60's to now that made Marvel comic book movies big again back in 2000 starting with 1998's excellent ""Blade"" movie. Bryan Singer of ""The Usual Suspects"" and ""Apt Pupil"" fame is a big fan of the comics/animated series from the 90's as he wanted to bring the magic of the comics on the screen yet he succeeds, he brings the huge metaphor on discrimination of a different minority group that was presented in the comics and show. The film took years of development hell with Richard Donner originally gonna direct it but instead now serves as executive producer of the saga and was originally gonna be produced by James Cameron and Carolco Pictures all had original rights before Fox which i think is the right decision to have for a studio. The acting is excellent including some of the action sequences and character development including an allegory of trying to accept a person who is different then us.<br/><br/>A must see Sci-fi action movie with it's even better sequel."
"gigan-92","10","2","4","13 May 2009"," A Good Start
","The popular comic is finally brought to life. Bryan Singer brings us a very innovative film that is a fantastic way to start the series. The main challenge here was getting the right actors to portray these unique characters. We are not let down. Patrick Stewart is Professor X, Ian McKellen is Magneto, James Marsden is Cyclops, along with Halle Berry and Famke Janssen. The performances are top rate most definitely and Hugh Jackman is dope as Logan/Wolverine. I don't think anyone could play him the way Hugh does. The writing is very well done and grabs you from the beginning till the end, a rare feat these days. And while there are bits of comedy, it does so while maintaining the dignity of the characters presented.<br/><br/>The action is well paced and incredibly well done. The shots are simply magnificent. The music is also very original and offers something new for the hero genre, a nice touch. Rest in peace Michael Kamen, and I'm glad to own the soundtrack. In short, this film is great, but some criticize its shortness is its major problem. Luckily, Fox has released the extended cut ""X-Men 1.5"", solving this dilemma. As an intro piece to a much bigger universe, it does fine."
"poolandrews","5","2","4","1 August 2008"," Not my favourite comic book superhero flick.
","X-Men is set in the near future where evolution has gone haywire, strange genetic mutations have begun to reveal themselves & 'normal' people including politicians are scared of them, their powers & what their existence means. Treated like freaks & outcasts mutants are shunned by normal society & Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is trying to get a law passed in which every mutant has to be registered & therefore controlled. Not everyone likes his idea & evil mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen) who can control metal objects with his powerful psychic abilities wants to wage a war against normal human beings as he believes mutants are the future. However Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) runs a private school in New York for young mutants & also leads a team of mutants known as X-Men who use their unique abilities for good & are determined to stop Magneto & his evil plans to wipe out the human race...<br/><br/>Directed by Bryan Singer this along with Spider-Man (2002) really kicked off the whole Marvel comic book superhero trend that has continued with the likes of Iron Man (2008), The Incredible Hulk (2008), Punisher: War Zone (2008) from the Marvel stable & Hancock (2008), Hellboy II: The Golden Army (2008) & of course the mega hit The Dark Knight (2008) this year alone. To be honest I am not a huge fan of the comic book superhero genre & I personally just don't think character's designed to be drawn in 2-D make the transition to live action film that well. With the possible exception of the Blade trilogy of films & the Spider-Man franchise I just can't get that excited by them. Here in X-Men the film concentrates on only some of the character's, the actual comic books contained more X-Men & evil mutant bad guys for them to fight with the main focus of the story being Wolverine who goes from shunned outcast into a superhero. The script is alright but I really can't raise any more enthusiasm for it, the plot about Magneto bombarding politicians & world leaders with radiation to turn them into mutants is rather basic actually, X-Men is more of a character driven film but as I said I just don't think character's like the X-Men translate to film that well. There are obvious allegories & references to racism, intolerance & acceptance too just to try & add some dramatic weight & give the audience a moral message to think about. The X-Men, mutants & their powers can often look silly, some of the CGI computer effects don't do them any favours & it's hard to relate to them in any way as 'people'. At only just over 100 odd minutes at least it's a lot shorter than the average two hour plus superhero film, it moves along at a decent pace & it tells a reasonable story but I must say I couldn't get into it, I couldn't get into the world of the X-Men & what they were about & I did lose interest in the film & it's plot quite quickly although I did manage to watch it all without becoming bored.<br/><br/>The special effects are generally very good as one would expect, there's plenty of CGI ranging from the impressive to the substandard Playstation game graphics. I was also a bit disappointed in the villains, Sabretooth doesn't do much, Mystique is very blue while Toad just looks daft & if I was him I would be very upset if I saw the immense & useful power mutants like Magneto & Wolverine had & I had to be happy with pale green skin & a long tongue! The final climatic battle is set on the Statue of Liberty & is quite good as are all the set-pieces but I couldn't honestly say they were much better than quite good. I only saw it last night & the only scenes I remember are the ones at the train station & the final fight. Apparently 20th century Fox originally approached Tim Burton to direct by turned it down, imagine how that X-Men Tim Burton style might have turned out!<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of $75,000,000 X-Men was fairly low budget for a summer blockbuster which usually have $100,000,000 plus budgets. Although set entirely in the US the film was shot almost entirely in Canada. The acting is OK, Patrick Stewart & Sir Ian McKellen add the distinguished weight while Hollywood starts of the day Halle Berry & Hugh Jackman get plum roles as X-Men.<br/><br/>X-Men is a film that I can't say I loved & yet I can't say I hated, I just found it watchable & not much else, nothing more or nothing less. There are worse films out there to be sure but if your not a comic book superhero fan than you can live without seeing X-Men. Followed by X2 (2003) & X-Men: The Last Stand (2006) while two money grabbing spin-offs X-Men Origins: Magneto (2009) & X-Men Origins: Wolverine (2009) are due out next year."
"GuitarJedi83","8","2","4","15 January 2007"," An analysis of X men against Superman and the American Dream
","American Dream can be defined as a social idea whereby one can attain a prosperous and material life, through hard work and good ethics. It works upon the basis that there are equal opportunities for all to pursue one's own dream without any restriction. The American Dream becomes an aspiration for many immigrants, whose hopes were torn apart by wars, injustice or inequality in their homeland.<br/><br/>Superman lives like a model immigrant and encompasses most of the traits denoted by the American Dream: white American with a humble background working hard to integrate into the society. His ability to fly is a metaphor of the American Dream such that one can get what he wants and always reaching for greater heights. Superman shows us that it is possible to have all the freedom in the world to pursue one's dream; but only within the boundaries of justice and righteousness. His character is consistent outwardly, as Clarke Kent the journalist; as well as inwardly, through his secret identity of a superhero. He knows and lives out his mission. All of us can contribute to our society through the utilization of our talents and skills in a positive and wholesome manner.<br/><br/>With X-men, we see the social phenomenon of teenagers who grow up in families who believe in the American Dream, as well as those (eg.Magneto) who embark on a journey to settle in the land of the free, only to find that the Dream is as misguided and distorted as it can be. The power that these superheroes possess is a stark reflection of their inner insecurities, fears and hopes. We see a potentially talented bunch of heroes who are unclear of their mission, and constantly fearing the unknown, as opposed to what Superman is. Furthermore, as there are no equal and just methods in handling the issue of mutant discrimination, the mutants' existence comes under a threat that is driven by the fear of the mainstream humans These circumstances do not allow ""those who are different"" to pursue the American Dream freely.<br/><br/>In my opinion, X-men challenges the American Dream such that not every American will equate a consumer-driven material life as the ultimate goal; there are more important social issues, such as discrimination and social inequality to be address. To limit and standardize how one should live in the American Dream simply neglect those who have a different purpose and calling in lives. As there are no strict definition of truth, justice and the American way, the characters in X-men have learn to redefine and live the American Dream by their own terms. In another way, they learn from Superman how to make judgment about what is right and wrong and eventually do what is 'right' in their own justification.<br/><br/>In conclusion, not everyone needs to adhere to the American brand of 'freedom'. X-men managed to raise the question: If America is as just and free as it seems, then why does one need to work hard to fit into the society; why can't they gain acceptance based on who they are?"
"levvyp","9","2","4","9 November 2006"," X-Men far superior to its sequels
","I just watched the first x-men film again (just felt like it) and I have to say it far outweighs the other two. The film has an enormous amount of exposition, several key characters to introduce and this is expertly executed by Bryan Singer. The characters are in no way unbelievable and from the opening scene, which depicts a young Magneto arriving at Auschwitz in 1944, the film grounds itself in reality. It is for this reason alone that I prefer the first of the trilogy.<br/><br/>Too much in cinema now we have directors and fans alike sharing the belief that for a sequel to exceed its predecessor, it must be louder bigger and ultimately have 'more'! But so often this 'more' amounts to a detrimental effect on the realism and impact of the original. Is this the reason why so few sequels exceed their prequel? I believe so. We've seen it in films like Matrix Revolutions, The Lost World: Jurassic Park, the disastrous Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines and more recently The Lord of the Rings The Two Towers.<br/><br/>It could be argued that The Lord of the Rings The Return of the King was superior to The Two Towers, but neither one had the same impact on me as The Fellowship of The Ring. This ultimately amounts to the fact that Fellowship, like the original X-men film, were films that were made with the intention to tell a story not with the intention to thrill an audience. When a story is told well, when invigorating and believable, relatable characters are properly introduced it's very difficult to fail. It feels as if the first of these films has one singular voice that gets the message across whereas the others have several voices all shouting at the top of their lungs hoping to be heard.<br/><br/>Essentially my hope is that one day filmmakers will realise that not everyone wants to see more explosions or have more meaningless characters paraded in front of them in order to appreciate a film.<br/><br/>Simply tell the story well and the rest will fall into place, after all, it did in the first one!"

","See, I like this thrilling and well done film, but in no way will claim that this is a masterpiece or a serious social commentary. The idea is clear and straightforward - there are mutants among us, they are different, they are the others. People hate them, are afraid of them and want to get rid of them. Right, the film is about how unique and different we are all and that we all have to be tolerant and correct. But the very meaning of tolerance was distorted and mis-used so much these days that it is almost a wrong and bad term now. Anyway, the film is well made, the video effects are impeccable and the characters of Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, or Ben Kingsley are very good. But, still, even with all this in mind, I watched this film not as a any serious or deep attempt but only as a quick, up-tempo and highly entertaining fairy tale.

","I don't know what I can say about X-Men. I liked most of the performances and really enjoyed Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. There were a lot of exciting action sequences and the picture looked good visually, but what lowered my expectations about it was the weak storyline involving Magneto (Ian McKellen) using Rogue(Anna Paquin) and her mutant ability of absorption.<br/><br/>His plan was to let Rogue absorb his magnetic powers in order to change many of the world leaders into mutants so then they wouldn't pass the Mutant Registration Act. This would then likely kill Rogue, which was one of the reasons why Magneto wouldn't do it himself. He did it earlier in the movie to someone and was nearly killed doing so. I don't know how his magnetic powers, with the help of the machine he built, would be able to do this. It was never really explained, and the ending was over too abruptly. I was expecting more an never got it.<br/><br/>X-Men still had some good moments though. I just wish the story could've been done better. It was almost like it was just thrown together because the writers were running out of time or something. The sequel was much better and even more entertaining."

","The X-Men have one of the richer history in comic books. When someone took the decision of made an X-Men saga they were playing with fire. Anyway this first installment in the X-Men series turned out great. We have a rooster formed by some of the founding members (in Marvel universe continuity) along with more modern characters (this ""modern"" characters have appeared in the comics for more than 25 years!).<br/><br/>The decision of have superheroes without their individual uniforms could be controversial but the need of simplify the costumes is logical: 10 superheroes and villains fighting each other all wearing different uniforms it would turn out been a big confusion for standard movie goers. The uniforms of the cinematic version are adequate and eye-catchy. Of course there were more things changed. Magneto is not a Charles Atlas 60 years old-man because it is almost impossible to find someone that could fit that 'psyché du rol' Ian McKellen as Magneto wipe out the doubts using all his talent as actor. Patrick Stewart IS Charles Xavier. The Brotherhood (Magneto's team) even seem to be fugitives from the panels of X-Men comics, examples? Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, Rebecca Romjin Stamos as Mystique and everyone else. It is unfair don't speak about the rest of the cast, because everyone has something interesting to offer.<br/><br/>This heroes and villains are deeply motivated even bad guys have serious motivations that lead them to act on the edge. One of the reasons that make the mutants so charismatic is that they are not adventurers, they fight for their ideals, for what they think could change the world for the better besides the moral side they choose. The team behind the adaptation respected that aspect, a quintessential aspect that made the X-Men succeed all these years. The drama is unavoidable because we need to understand what make each X-Man stood for fight. This time the center stage of the story is focused on Wolverine and Rogue two mutants that are not sure about which side choose.<br/><br/>Visually this is not a mix of cinema and video-clip like many others blockbusters, it has many moments of drama and suspense. In all the transcendental good films the star is the director. Bryan Singer made a superb work presenting clearly difficult scenes (an example would be how Charles Xavier uses his power against Magneto and the Brotherhood). Singer can be satisfied because he achieved the hard work of create something that stands strong in both the commercial and artistic fields."

Tim Burton had the visual look accomplished by the time he made 'Batman Returns', but then let Schumacher destroy the series.  Raimi's 'Spider-Man' lacked his usual visual flair, probably brought on by studio executives who didn't want him to expand like in 'Darkman'.  'Superman' was pure Donner, but Donner's problem was that he didn't have a model to follow other than the prior cheesy series.  Stephen Norrington is atrocious and Guillermo Del Toro is questionable at the moment (I'm waiting to see how 'Hellboy' comes out).  I won't even mention the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' or 'Men in Black'.<br/><br/>Despite all these branches, the genre really boils down to two camps.  There is the light-hearted fare of 'Spider-Man' and 'Superman', reliant on truth, justice, blah blah blah.  Then there are the pessimist, ""dark"" films. 'Blade' and 'Spawn' fall into the ""wannabe"" sections of this genre.  'Batman Returns' marks the high (low?) point.<br/><br/>It's as though the studios think they can't make a truly pessimistic ""graphic novel"" and be successful.  So, as in the case of the first X-Men movie here, we get everything to us at 50% power.  More emphasis is given towards what we know of film rather than the comic books themselves.  How else do you explain the X-Men's costumes or Professor X as a weaker Dr. Treves?<br/><br/>Perhaps one reason why so many of these latest installments don't work is that they don't create the right environment.  The Batman movies, though they boiled down to pure idiocy by the 'Robin', still created a world both detailed and ugly and reminded you that the world was real fake and not pure fake.  That's another nail against these X-Men movies.<br/><br/>What do I consider to be the best ""comic book"" movies?  Mystery Men, Darkman, Batman Returns, RoboCop, and Raiders of the Lost Ark.  They annotate the genre (except Returns) with their own styles.<br/><br/>Singer did better the second time.  There he used the characters as themselves, much like Kerschner did with 'Empire'.<br/><br/>Final Analysis = = Cinematic Dud"

"Raiderofthelastfries","Null","2","4","27 September 2002"," Paradoxically a big leap forward for comic-to-film adaptations and, one of the biggest let-downs ever
","First off, Patrick Stuart acquits himself well and(though his costume design lacks the menace of his comic book counterpart)Ian McAllen is a good villain. The rest of the actors are suitable. The story begins well, untill you realize the exposition will go on for quite awhile and, your feet start doing the double cross shuffle. The first scene is a prime example of how a backstory should be handled: concise; dynamic- it sets up Magneto's internal conflict skillfully (sadly given the conflicting writing styles of the script's MANY collaborators, the opening is in a much better class than the remainder of the feature. Whoever wrote it  should have been allowed to do all of it), but the rest is leaden stuff they wouldn't play on Lifetime. It's a waste of one of comicdom's richest mines.  This problem could have been solved by going back to very beginning of the comic, when the only members were Cyclops, Angel, Beast, Ice-Man (portrayed as an apprentice here!), and Marvel Girl(Jean Grey). This not only eliminates the amount of origin stories, but also allows for better character development(a wasted Halle Berry as Storm for instance, serves no purpose other than as convenient vehicle for cool lightning effects). This in addition to allowing for a greater number of sequels to play out over the next decade! Only Professor X, Wolverine, and Magneto are done any justice (Rouge, who's strength and infectious sense of humor are absent, is portrayed even more poorly than Storm). The movie also lets you down in the critical action department. The trailers promised an adrenaline rush on par with the Matrix; a kick in the pants; the most fun you could have legally. Well, it turned out to be no more than a cock tease , to borrow a crude, but apt expression. The film boasts only one (ONE!) truly kick ass fight between Wolverine and Mystique. If the story was well written, this would have been excusable, but it AIN'T. I hate to keep hammering a movie I wanted to like so much, but the costume designers made a grave misstep as well, in sapping the flare out of the X-Mens's famous costumes. Since most of the characters were  written as mentioned, only their ethnicities (and gimmick of course) distinguish them by the end in which they all don identical leather uniforms. Not that such a monotonous color scheme would have worked anyway, but this just made everything worse. On the plus side the film also has one genuinely funny exchange between rivals Cyclops and Wolverine(C:How do I know you're the real Wolverine? W:You're a dick. C: Okay!), and treats the material with a degree of seriousness not seen since the Tim Burton's Batman movies. For all of its manifold failings, the movie remains a hopeful sign of better things to come."

As for everybody else...Halle Berry is all wrong as Storm (not exotic enough); James Marsden is a good actor but he's totally miscast as Cyclops; Famke Janssen (sp?) is given nothing to do as Jean Gray and Anna Paquin is too whiny as Rogue.

"mar9","6","2","4","3 March 2002"," Live action anime, but why?
","Passable but not great adaptation of the popular ""X-men"" comic series. Once the decision was made to adapt this story from comic to live action, rather than opt for the obvious path of creating an anime version, the question had to be asked: what is the live version trying to achieve that an anime can't? It wouldn't be the special effects - CGI is so good by now that live action and anime can produce similar end results, only the palette and textures are different. The answer must lie in the acting, in the ability of human beings to provide emotional depth and subtlety that animation and voices cannot. ""X-men"" doesn't quite make it in this regard. Which is a pity, given some of the names on the cast sheet.<br/><br/>In fact, some things such as action and fight sequences in this genre are still best done by anime. A number of such sequences in this film look like manga frames brought to life. It's impressive, but ultimately weird. The fight scenes are cranked up to such a bizarre level, with odd camera angles and exaggerated violence, that they look frankly unbelieveable. Particularly when no-one actually appears to die in this film, if they lose a fight they just get belted for miles out of the frame and disappear. If the camera happens upon them sprawled on the deck, they get up and wade back into the brawl. If it doesn't, they seem to just quietly disappear from the film. Odd.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart have both done better work than their roles as the two mutant leaders, doing their own version of the War of the Roses (check the actors' birthplaces and your English history!). Much was made in Australia of ""nice guy"" Hugh Jackman landing the plum role of Wolverine. Apart from a simplistic study of macho posturing, he brings little to his role, it must be said. My favourite from this film is Anna Paquin, all grown up and looking just a bit like Claire Danes, which is no bad thing. We first see her upstairs in her suburban whitebread house, her mom's piano tinkling downstairs (a nice touch and this film's single delightful moment). Anna gives a brave and layered performance in what is admittedly the most interesting role of Rogue, the mutant with the poison touch. A few more performances like Anna's and this could have been a great film.<br/><br/>To summarise, the film does enough to pique the interest of those unfamiliar with the corresponding comic series to give it a look. But only just. I cannot speak for existing fans of the comics."

","I've always been a fan of the X-Men, since the Animated Series aired (I'd never really read any of the comics though... ^_^). So when I heard they were making a movie about them, I was counting the days until it was released. Maybe that affected how I viewed the movie, but I was a bit disappointed. Director Brian Singer (Usual Suspects) did a good job with what he's got... the multiple characters, etc. The whole project seems a bit ""safe,"" though, as if the producers wanted to make sure this big production didn't flop. It's a good movie, but not a great one. Fans of the X-Men might be especially disappointed if their favorite characters do not include either Wolverine or Rogue. Mine personally is Cyclops, but he had a minor role. James Marsden, who played Cyclops, was a bit on the stiff side, but I forgive him because I like him as an actor. On that note, all the actors did an excellent job, especially Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan, as the forces of good and evil. It brought an endearing humanistic side to a story I had thought was dominated by sci-fi. If you're an X-Men fan, I would definitely recommend this film--but you probably have already seen it!

","""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else."". Iconic. Simply groundbreaking. One could say it ""kicked up a storm""..., I'm here all day, honestly. The 90s were not particularly kind to the superhero genre, so naturally many watched the start to this franchise with trepidation. Fortunately, this was the seed for the superhero supernova that followed, and it's pretty good. Dated and slightly unfocused, but enjoyable nonetheless. Mutants are in hiding from the rest of humanity, where a school of mutants must stop a maniacal mutant from turning the rest of humanity into mutants. It's all very mutant. There's plenty of imaginative powers that are replicated from its source material. Storm can manipulate the weather, Cyclops harnesses a powerful laser beam and Wolverine has a skeleton made from an invulnerable metal. Oh, and Toad with his long tongue. Useless in combat, but I'm sure that comes in handy in other departments (bow-chika-wow-wow). It makes for some exciting spectacles, particularly the third act, that adds variety to the action. However it's the social commentary that powers the narrative. Humans debating to give equal rights to mutants can be metaphorically transferred to modern society, especially in racial context. It's a shame that this theme is underdeveloped and put aside for the action, but there is an underlying sense of justification for both sides of the argument. The acting is decent, particularly Jackman with his brutal physicality (my God...) and McKellen with his epic voice, although Paquin was considerably weaker in comparison. She's unable to express her emotions well, as she whimpers everything. But, ehh, she was young I guess. There's so much information to take in as the script builds a world filled with turmoil and superpowers, that assimilating everything is quite an achievement. It's a building block for the sequel, but this first instalment is entertaining enough to bypass the dated flaws."

","Featuring a studded star cast X-Men is effectively paced with a good balance of exposition, character development, and special effects-enhanced action. Neither the plot nor the character relationships are difficult to follow, and the movie avoids the trap of spending too much time explaining things that don't need to be explained. X-Men fandom is likely to be divided over whether the picture is a success or a failure. Many comic book lovers will be pleased to see the heroes brought (mostly) intact to the screen by a group of filmmakers who are concerned about maintaining the characters' identities and dignity. Others will grouse about missed opportunities and will cringe at even the most minor missteps. But, with a project like this, there's no pleasing everyone."

It's short but feels long, it's dated but feels modern, and it's poorly written but strongly structured. What is this film? This movie is so out of the map, but it's just... another film starring Hugh Jackman that's just adequate! What is this strange pattern?<br/><br/>What's the story?

They are locked in a battle with former colleague and friend, Magneto who believes humans and mutants should never co-exist.<br/><br/>Okay, let's start this review with a good aspect: the special effects. Although the opening credits look really dated and cheap, the rest of the effects are surprisingly really good, especially for its time. This was back in 2000, where CGI was in its early stage and still developing, but for early CGI this is very nice to look at. It also makes the action scenes look very exciting and amps up the fun aspect of the film. The story itself is pretty bland, like an Avengers-before-Avengers story, but as far as those stories go, despite being pretty short, this makes a pretty decent crossover film. Not that it's the best or anything, but it does give us enough background knowledge on all the characters before pursuing into the climax of the film. As for the acting, the only performance that legitimately stood out for me was Hugh Jackman as the Wolverine, and even HE could sound pretty bland sometimes. This isn't really a movie known for its good acting or anything, but more to admire the technical aspect.<br/><br/>In conclusion, X-Men is a nice kickoff to the franchise, but as a standalone film, it's okay. The action and effects are good, but the acting (excluding Hugh Jackman) and the writing can be done a bit better. If you like X-Men, maybe you'll like this, even though I don't make any promises.

","**SPOILERS!!**<br/><br/>This movie...makes me glad the X-Men are a thing! This is an awesome movie and Bryan Singer earned my respect. When Wolverine and Rouge are recruited by the X-Men, Professor X, Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm, they fight against Magneto and his Brotherhood of Mutants to prevent him from turning the world leaders into mutants, only after mutant-fearing Senator Kelly was killed because his cells were fighting against the artificial mutation process. I'm glad Bryan Singer had these characters portrayed seriously and by some big name actors to do so. I love the way he makes these characters relatable. However, I thank the good lord the sequel was even better."

","This is a very good movie based on the X-Men comics. Sir Ian McKellen does an excellent performance as Magneto and Patrick Stewart also makes a great performance of Professor Charles Xavier. Hugh Jackman does his best as Wolverine and he's my favorite X-Men member. I sometimes wish though that I had Magneto's powers so that I can lift cars during traffic rush hours. lol. We see great action in this especially when Storm is fighting Sabretooth and Toad. Cyclops is cool too. Also it was a very good idea at the end to have Magneto in a prison made of plastic since lifting plastic is not part of Magneto's abilities. A good beginning to the X-Men movie franchise here."

","In the world where you have a super hero movie every year or sometimes even up to 4. Deadpool, Batman v Superman, Captain America and X- Men: Apocalypse.<br/><br/>X-Men is an instant sci-fi classic, combining impressive special effects with an involving plot to create a truly memorable cinematic experience.<br/><br/>Lacking the tongue-in-cheek camp of the later Batman films and other recent comic books-turned movies, X-Men draws the audience into its world of mutants and superpowers, and prevents it from becoming tacky or absurd. Not to say that there isn't any humor in the film, in fact it delivers some of the best one liners in a film this year.<br/><br/>It is a rare thing for an action blockbuster to feature great acting, but with a cast that among others involves both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen is bound to be above average. Both Stewart (as Professor Charles Xavier) and McKellen (as Magneto)deliver stellar performances, and their on screen chemistry is compelling as they play two old friends turned arch enemies.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast deliver solid performances, including Hollywood newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Oscar-winner Anna Paquin as Rogue, and another rising star Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the seductive but deadly Mystique.<br/><br/>A classic tale of good versus evil, with heroes, baddies, and great special effects, I don't think it's going too far to say that X-Men is destined to be mentioned in the same breath as Star Wars and other all-time sci-fi greats."

","X-Men is directed by Bryan Singer and is the origin story of the X- Men, a team of mutants that turn superheroes in order to stop a mutant named Magneto that is preparing, and attempting to start, a full on war between mutants and humans. When Magneto, and a few other mutants, threaten civil society as we know it, the X-Men must put aside their differences and fight to stop an all out war between the two classes of people, mutant, and human.<br/><br/>X-Men is the first successful Marvel film, and it's easy to see why. Although Marvel films have been better, X-Men, in a way, paved the way for every other Marvel movie to come, from Spiderman (2002) to Guardians of the Galaxy (2014). With likable characters, great direction, and fantastic special effects, X-Men is a very enjoyable film in whole, and works in every genre of film it was going for, be it action, superhero, and even a sci-fi.<br/><br/>X-Men offers some amazingly relatable characters that the audience immediately feels for in each and every situation. Although this was my favorite feature of the film, I feel this is where its biggest weakness lies as well. Although characters like Wolverine, Professor X, Rogue, and Magneto are very well-rounded, most of the others aren't. We get to know a little bit about Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Storm, but not too much all in all. We know that Jean Grey hopes to be much like Professor X when older, but that's about it. We also know that there is conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine due to their mutual affection for Jean Grey, but nothing else about their characters.<br/><br/>The characters of Mystique, Sabretooth, and Toad, who are the mutants working with Magneto, aren't given much depth to either. Although it's cool to see Mystique transform into other people, but we aren't given much, if any, information about her character on a personal level. Sabretooth and Toad are both characters that have special powers, but no personalities. They both feel as if they are basically the ""grunts"" of Magneto's team, and don't really serve that large of a purpose in the movie.<br/><br/>The direction, by Bryan Singer, is actually quite amazing. Every action scene, as well as exposition scene, is so nicely filmed in every way. All of the action looks very nice, with no quick cuts or shaky cam to be found. Bryan Singer did an excellent job with the camera, and made X-Men look very good. The special effects are probably the best thing I could say about X-Men. The CGI throughout the entire movie is revolutionary, from Mystique shapeshifting to Wolverine's metal claws coming straight out of his knuckles. There's not a single shot in which the audience might call out ""fake,"" due to the amazingly impressive special effects littered all throughout X-Men.<br/><br/>The acting is also very impressive. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, as we all know, is a perfect casting choice, and he does fantastic in his role. Both Ian McKellan and Sir Patrick Stewart as Magneto and Professor X play two age old rivals magnificently, and are very believable as life long friends. All of the other smaller casting choices, such as Anna Paquin as Rogue, are also chosen very well. I must say, however, that I didn't like Sabretooth's character or the actor who played him, Tyler Mane. Although he was a good casting choice for the character, Mane didn't really impress me with his acting abilities.<br/><br/>Another complaint I have, which may be small, is a small portion in the film in which a couple different characters do certain actions that don't fit their personalities, but solely to advance the plot. Their actions are necessary, as called for by the script, but their nature and deeds don't match up. This only occurs at a specific time that's tough to talk in depth about without spoilers, but it's still present, and stands out as a negative on the script's part.<br/><br/>Comprehensively, X-Men is a great film. It stands out as a landmark in the superhero genre of film, and contains much enjoyment in it. Despite it being flawed, I would recommend X-Men to anyone who enjoys superhero, or action, movies."

","I remember when this film first came about and I caught my first glimpse of the trailer ""Trust a few.....Fear the rest..."" and I was immediately blown away and then I watched the actually film and again was blown away. For me around 70% of the movie works for me and that is more than enough for a first effort, particularly when dealing with the X-Men. The main plot hole for me was the lack of explanation when it came to Magneto's grand plan, what exactly was this machine and how did it actually work powered by Magneto???? To be fair I saw this as more an intro movie so I was more than willing to overlook it on this occasion. Casting and character portrayals were pretty solid with some major standouts and a few duds. The chemistry between Stewart and McKellen was superb and they carried they're roles well, McKellen just pips Stewart for me. Jackman was very faithful to the character of Wolverine and reigned it in enough to keep him interesting and multi dimensional rather than cartoonish. Paquin portrayed a very different Rogue and once I got over my inital fanboy disappointment I rather enjoed her performance and she brought a lot of depth to the character. Romijin was also a major scene stealer with her alluring Mystique. Janssen played the tore Jean Grey well but her character did come across a little flat at times as did Marsden, although he has kinda nailed that annoying Scott Summers quality. Mane & Park done well also and I was delighted to see both characters brought to the big screen. OK they were pretty just lackeys but it's a comic book film so it has to be expected. It was nice to see both actors having so much fun in their roles. For me personally the biggest let down character wise was Halle Berry's very weak Storm. Now to be fair Storm is my favorite of the X-Men so I was thrilled to say the least when I discovered she was going to be in the film. I was expecting a strong African woman who kicked ass and was not to be toiled with. Instead I got a rather weak character, not physically I mean as she did have some of the best action set pieces in the film. But as for the actual character Halle brought nothing, she had no real voice (god that awful accent) or presence whatsoever which is just a crying shame. It wasn't all on Halle as I feel Singer could have done sooo much more with the character, what a missed and failed opportunity. I should also mention that Singers biggest flaw was making Wolverine pretty much center stage really had a knock on effect on allowing other characters to truly shine and other plot avenues to be explored. Having said ALL of that I truly thought the X-Men was a triumph with it's sleek look and excellent action set pieces, it has most certainly paved the way for the comic book films we see today."

","X-Men is a title that is given for a bunch of mutants who have various superpowers ranging from reading others minds to self- healing. The movie exceeded my expectations as it did not feature too much action and had just the right amount of character development and emphasis on plot.<br/><br/>The movie features a stellar cast comprising of veteran actors like Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart. Hugh Jackman made his Hollywood debut in this movie and his gritty role as Wolverine is one of the reasons why he is one of the biggest movie stars today.<br/><br/>All the aspects of the movie gel together to give us a complete entertainment package that does not verge towards being pretentious or silly. The primary antagonist is Magneto (Ian McKellen) whose aim is to obtain Marie (Anna Paquin) and use her mutant powers, through which she can leech out the powers of another person through physical touch, to transfer his own powers to her in order to power the machine that artificially induced mutation.<br/><br/>Due to its short runtime of 104 minutes, the film flies by and the result is a satisfying, ingenious piece of work that does justice to the Marvel Comics on which it is based. Also, the special effects are exhilarating to watch and are not excessive unlike some of the modern superhero movies."

","'X-men' was the long-awaited 'comic book to film' adaptation of the popular superheroes of the same name. For years fanboys debated who should play the iconic roles of the mutants (superheroes), therefore, when it finally came to production, casting was always going to be an issue. As a so-so fan of the source material, I can't really say how well ALL the mutants were transferred, but most of them seemed pretty faithful – most.<br/><br/>However, what let it down for me was the fact that it's called 'X-men' – i.e. plural. There are numerous mutants – some fighting for the noble Charles Xavier (the X-men themselves) and those fighting for the dastardly Magneto, known as the 'Brotherhood.' Therefore, because there are multiple stars in a ninety minute movie, you can't really give them all the screen time they deserve. 'Wolverine' (Hugh Jackman) is arguably the fans' favourite, so he gets much of the screen time. The others are just kind of there for him to bounce off of.<br/><br/>Basically, it's good superheroes versus bad superheroes. So if you generally like your superhero movies then you should get something out of this.<br/><br/>Of course it was made a fair few years before 'Marvel' superhero movies really took off, therefore it does feel a little dated compared to today's modern Thor, Iron Man and Avengers films.<br/><br/>I have my own grips with X-men – I never approved as Sir Ian McKellen as the villain 'Magneto.' I always thought the baddie should have the body of Arnold Schwarzenegger and the face/temperament of Al Pacino's Scarface. Having an 'English nobleman' as the supervillian just didn't seem to work for me – he wasn't physically intimidating for me (sorry, Sir Ian!).<br/><br/>But, overall, most people liked it and it spawned numerous sequels and spin-offs. I can watch it every now and again. It's not too long and it fills a void if I'm in the mood for something light."

","I am doing a superhero franchise review and it is X-MEN.<br/><br/>In 1994, 20th Century Fox and producer Prawan Singh bought the film rights to the X-Men. Andrew Kevin Walker was hired to write and James Cameron expressed interest in directing. Eventually, Bryan Singer signed on to direct in July 1996. Thought not a fan of the comic-books, Singer was fascinated by the analogies of prejudice and discrimination it offered.<br/><br/>John Logan, Joss Whedon, Ed Solomon, Christopher McQuarrie and David Hayter wrote the script, with Hayter receiving sole credit. Production began in September 1999 in Toronto, Canado and ended in March 2000.<br/><br/>The film was released on July 14, 2000 to positive reviews and critical success and spawned a reemergence of superhero films and it would prove to movie studios that superhero films could succeed.<br/><br/>The film introduces us to Wolverine and Rogue into the conflict between Professor Xavier's X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto. Magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a United Nations summit with a machine he has built, to bring about acceptance of mutant kind, but Xavoer realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deaths.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice of Wolverine and this film would lead him into being in the sequels and two spin-offs and other movies including Van Helsing and Prisoners. Patrick Stewart plays Professor X and Ian McKellen plays Magneto and they were also really good casting choices.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin was the perfect choice to play Rogue / Marie and this would lead her into playing in ""True Blood"" as the main character, which ended in 2014 and my 25-year-old sister watches the show, but I don't. Famke Janssen and the rest of the cast were all cast perfectly in this film as their roles.<br/><br/>The action sequences were amazing and there is less CGI in this film because some of the visual effects are really amazing and this film only had a $75 million dollar budget and I really liked the way this movie turned out and the story is not action-packed, but I will say it is really amazing, but there is just one major flaw: This was 2000 and it did not make me feel any emotion for the characters, except for Wolverine and Rogue.<br/><br/>The musical score is really good and I think Michael Kamen did a really good job with his X-Men theme. But, I like John Ottman's X-MEN theme in the next film.<br/><br/>Overall, I like X-MEN, but the one thing that had me confused is that the story is not action-packed enough and it does not make me feel any emotion for the characters, except for Wolverine and Rogue. X-MEN is the reason why we have superhero films today like Batman Begins, Spider-Man, Iron Man, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel, 300, Blade, Watchmen and of course, both The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Mr-Fusion","7","0","0","24 April 2015"," From such humble beginnings
","The X-Men movies have become so big and the characters varied that it's actually kind of a surprise just how effective the first movie is. ""X-Men"" does its job pretty well; it establishes the origins, sets up the world and makes it palatable to the mainstream. It's got a killer opening with Wolverine up North and Senator Kelly's Mutant Registration Act as McCarthy witch hunt. The rest of the movie isn't dull, but it's hard to top that.<br/><br/>It's certainly not without its quirks. The blinding error of casting the oddly sedate Halle Berry (who bears none of Storm's regal presence) is only offset by the spot-on choice of Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. And there are a few spotty effects due to the low(er) budget, but that's nothing. Although, whoever wrote the ""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?"" line should be ashamed of themselves.<br/><br/>But really, when all is said and done, it makes for both a good comic book movie and solid Summer entertainment.<br/><br/>7/10"

It has enabled us to evolve from a single-celled organism into the dominant species on the planet. This process is slow, and normally taking thousands and thousands of years.

","Rating-7/10<br/><br/>X-Men is a comic book film that makes the transition well and comes out in the end being one of the most memorable superhero welcomes. With a fine cast and some crazy super powers, X-Men manages to mould together some of the best elements we want to see to engage us in a way not seen before this very much. I felt the movie to be solidly a pretty good film and here below is why I thought so.<br/><br/>The story is exciting yet allows a certain amount of calm moments that create tension throughout. The whole plot does seem to ride a long well and the ending doesn't come too fast nor are we bored of one scene that goes on too long because well, no scenes are too long. It has great action and although the effects don't do great justice to the awesome things going on, it still puts you on a bit of a thrill ride.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is good in this and really introduces his character in a gritty and angry way. Patrick Stewart is good as Professor X and along with Ian McKellen brings in two completely different roles but both acted to the same great way. I wasn't too keen on Halle Berry as Storm, she felt awkward and over dramatic at times, even at times feeling like she had only one liners which were just badly timed.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer is the real mastermind behind this and really impresses with his first X-Men, he directs it fairly well although could have been better, it is written very well and this for me was one the major highlights. I said about the effects before and I know they weren't great in reflection on the time this movie was made but they don't enhance this movies reputation, if anything at times it drags it just a slight bit.<br/><br/>My main criticism is the lack of true action, quite a bit of talking which can be good at times but too much throughout the middle and even the end feels like it needs a little injection of fighting. The acting is good although there are some people in it I would have liked to have seen more, mostly the students or teachers who although seen are never quite explored in depth like those such as Wolverine.<br/><br/>If you want a good old comic book superhero film then this is by far for you, it isn't quite similar to many others but still manages that great thing where the characters are well represented and the budget is used very well. I think if you want a lot of fighting and I mean a lot then avoid this, there is some but as previously said, it isn't abundant and even sometimes the effects can take away the adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Overall I give this a 7/10 and felt it to be Solidly a Kind of Good movie that never quite gets too near to being good well to be good but far outreaches just being ""OK"". The X-Men franchise starts well here and seeing this as if I were in 2000 would definitely fill me with some hope for the future with the X-Men. Marvel seemed to have really hit the major big time much later than when this film came out and so I feel that this movie really represents the beginnings of what Marvel had and have to come."

","'The X-Men' is the first action movie in a long time that doesn't overload itself with special effects in an effort to give the audience it's money's worth. This is a film more about ideology than fistfights (though it has a few). I'm not an X-Men fan but that doesn't matter. The characters have a 35-year continuity in comic books but the movie never assumes that you know that.<br/><br/>We are sometime in the near future when man is facing a new stage of evolution. Mutants live as outcasts on a fringes of society. Each one of them has an extraordinary gift to, say, walk through walls or change shape. A senate hearing is being held to decide whether or not to catalog these freaks of nature before they begin figuring out that crime pays. The anti-mutant stance is taken up by the McCarthy-like Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) The story centers on a girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin) whose fate is positively Shakespearean because whenever she touches someone's skin she drains their life force (freeze tag must have been hell). She runs away and meets a fellow mutant, a drifter named Logan (Hugh Jackman) who has an extra skeletal structure made of a substance called Antimantium which includes knuckle-blades which retract apparently with great pain. The two get into an accident and end up at a private school run by a wheelchair-bound psychic named Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart).<br/><br/>His school provides a safe haven for mutants and teaches them how to use their powers in a positive way. At the school we meet the professor's confidants: Cyclops who has deadly laser beams for eyes; Storm who can dredge up bad weather and Dr. Jean Grey who moves objects with her mind.<br/><br/>Xavier's nemesis is a holocaust survivor named Magneto (Ian McKellan) whose has the power to bend steel. He is positive that a war is coming between humans and mutants. His plan is to use a machine to turn all humans into mutants. His small band includes a blue-skin shape-shifting femalien named Mystique (Rebecca Romjyn-Stamos), the wookie-like Sabertooth (Tyler Mane) and Toad (Phantom Menace's Ray Park) who lashes his tongue like a bullwhip.<br/><br/>The first hour of 'X-Men' spends a lot of time developing characters. That's good because there is a lot of ground to cover. I was genuinely interested in these characters and their powers and I was glad that writer David Hayter had patience enough to spend some time letting me get to know them. If the first hour seems too talky consider how many action movie these days contain almost no dialogue that isn't thrown in to string the action scenes together.<br/><br/>After a tedious jukebox light show like the awful 'Batman and Robin' I was happy to see a comic book adaptation that settles down and tells a story. Unlike Batman and Superman, The X-Men are darker superheroes, hunted and hated outcasts living in the shadows. I like this approach. I get a little tired of cities where superheroes are seen as minor celebrities.<br/><br/>I also liked the intellectual battle going on between Professor Xavier and Magneto. It's a battle of the mind and of ideas instead of machines and muscle.<br/><br/>'X-Men' is a smarter film then you might expect. When I see a film based on popular characters that I'm not familiar with I try to see if the movie can tell me what the appeal is. 'Pokémon the Movie', 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles' and 'Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers' failed to generate much interest from me. But I can see why people would like the X-Men, they are smart, clever, they have individual personalities and they're kinda cool."

","Bryan Singer's straightforward, adult approach to X-MEN is to be commended: like Tim Burton's treatment of BATMAN, Singer's approach to the subject of super heroes is as dramatic as it is super-heroic- the perfect blend. (Both BATMAN and X-MEN have humorous moments, but the humor is not out of context- and it's certainly not the kind of goofiness that we find in, say, the BATMAN TV series of the 1960s and all too many of the subsequent attempts to bring superheroes to The Big Screen.) Both Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen lend the proceedings a gravitas lesser lights could NOT have. In fact, the cast from top to bottom is solid. The black leather look that has been de rigeur since Burton's BATMAN is on display here, as well- and it works, in this world of mutants with extraordinary powers (like many of the characters on THE X-FILES, the characters in X-MEN are all treated realistically- despite some truly Comic Bookish SUPER super powers). The cgi are beautifully integrated, as well. (Note: the cgi actually looked better on The Big Screen than they do on television...) In an age when Genocide has become the Norm (the death toll in Gaza has today passed 1100), it's genuinely sad to see Magneto staring up at the Statue of Liberty and musing, ""America was going to be the land of tolerance..."""

","X-Men is an spectacular cinematic achievement! The way comic book movies were meant to be seen, with respect and a surrendering belief to the comic book world. A belief is natural for real fans of the comic universe. X-Men is a realistic take on comic book heroes. The story of the X-Men is ultimately one of the best reasons to even film a movie in the first place of any kind. X-Men addresses major relevant societal issues entirely through, just as the original comics, in a simple to understand and positive way. Bryan Singer and company did wonderful work to create X-Men the movie. The actors and actresses are X-cellent! Hugh Jackman is the Wolverine, and nobody, that is, nobody could have done better. Hugh is feral and warmhearted as Logan. Patrick Stewart epitomizes Charles Xavier, Professor X. Patrick Stewart the mastermind. Ian McKellan is too, ideal as Magneto displaying a real understanding and connection to the character. Getting Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan for these roles is a perfect world come true. Halle Berry does a great job of acting support from the side and not becoming too much of the focal point in her portrayal as Storm. If I'm not noticing Halle then the movie really holds up, believe me. Anna Paquin is such a naturally very gifted actress and she fits the role of Rogue beautifully. Famke Janssen really personifies X-Men Jean Grey acting as one of the noticeably more interesting characters of the viewing. Rebecca Romijn is really the perfect Mystique and she certainly has the perfect body for Mystique. And if anybody ever needed an actor to play Cyclops, we could only hope James Mardsen was available. Marsden is very solid, very good. The other two stars, Ray Park and Tyler Mane, are as good as any playing as Toad and Sabretooth. X-Men has a smartly shown story developing sharply from scene to scene. Smart action with very good special effects. A great visual experience. It has an impressive score. The mutants abilities and their mutant powers are truly awesome. Thank you, Brian Synger and company. Thanks to the great casting of the cast and to the cast themselves. And, of course, a true special thanks to Stan Lee the creator. I love the X-Men. It is one of my most interesting and favorite things to think about and imagine and adore, that is, I love the X-Meeeen! X-Men is great and very appreciated by the fans. X2, the sequel, is a really special film and even better than the first, much better."
"troubledyouth66","6","0","0","9 October 2011"," just a good movie at best
","After watching this movie, i remembered writing a review i deleted on how biased it was do to the comic book devotion. Yes, its biased but at the same time i forgot that the story was actually good. Following the first appearance of the X-men, you get superheroes who look act and dress like the 1960s comic counterparts. The short intro of the films and its origins were spot on. Sure, magneto's helmet looks funny from the traditional Romanesque one, sure the origin of wolverine doesn't portray him as the beastly one we all love but the tame trimmed down wolvie from the pages of 1970s alpha flight. Jean grey was probably the best portrayal here. Revamped X-men characters are a must but not required although some like the mystique, works for the better. Sure saber-tooth was a good portrayal but without costume, while rogue was just a little girl with powers, or a makeshift jubilee, devoid of the past incarnations and southern roots but with a few of these changes the characters and movie would have been perfect. The mutants though, really were mutants in this film and not superheroes. Cyclops is spot on, storm is okay too yet clearly a line between mutants, and superheroes are drawn here. Maybe even throw in juggernaut? Magneto's assault on the mansion? Overall good movie with no overplay. Like how casting for a Russian black widow as scarlet johansson in the iron man film and other minute details, marvel films in general will be entertaining but never perfect to their comic book counterpart yet will come close. But then again I haven't read the ultimate marvel series line yet. The cartoon of Deadpool was revised accurately wasn't it? It seems that the DC and Marvel film industry should just stick to cartoons but nobody's perfect. To see the movie from a 90s perspective in growing up with comic reading is a must but the traditional 60s story lines work well too. The sci-fi fantasy shakespearean aspect worked well but not too well. A good cast and great scene distribution will be overlooked by fans yet characters may not be. With a little biasm, I give this along with every marvel film a ""meh"", nuff' said."
"johnnyboyz","6","0","0","21 July 2010"," Despite its shortcomings, X-Men makes for reasonably interesting viewing with spits and spots of various character plus story elements combining in an obtuse fashion.
","Structurally, X-Men is all over the shop. Its building, brooding hour and a half of character and conflict is stretched out to an awkward length during which things unfold, but sporadically before having everything land at an overall 'base' in which a finale of good vs. evil can predictably play out. But the getting there is enjoyable enough, if a little scattered and episodic; the fun the film has with its lead refraining from taking either side, even though there are those in one camp so desperately wanting him to join them, keeps the film from descending too quickly into that aforementioned battle. Small, relatively inconclusive sub-plots bulk up the runtime and make us feel more gets done that perhaps does; the sense of the franchise being set up is certainly prominent in this first edition in flirtations and meek romance between characters; rivalries between others as well as an entire back-story shared between the two most powerful characters in the whole film is only hinted at, but not fully explored. Regardless, from its muddy and grotty opening during which an individual who's rendered an outcast by a superior force suffers at the hands of human beings, right the way up to its climatic fight on Liberty Island during which a similarly desired extermination of a 'race' must play out; the 2000 film X-Men, an adaptation of a comic book series of the same title, works.<br/><br/>We begin with, mercifully, one of the film's very few expositional moments during which an American senator explains to a crowded room just what the mutants are and what threat they may or may not pose, the the view being to take away their right to hide as mutants and make themselves known. We're in, and, like everyone in that room, informed on what everyone is and the general proceedings. Later on, we get a sense of how important this issue is to everyone when the item is placed relatively high up on the United Nations' mandate at their annual meetings. The film provides us with a lead in the form of Hugh Jackman's Wolverine, a mutant with the power of invulnerability of which many will rightly point out there is usually little to no peril when revolving a text around an indestructible lead, although he does come with a sort of secondary 'power' in the form of indestructible metallic blades which shoot out of his knuckles when provoked. <br/><br/>Wolverine come across like Clint Eastwood came across as Blondie; complete with gruff voice and nary a cigar too far away so as to easily light up and chomp down on a fresh one now and again, in the process struggling to find much compassion and rarely ever being anything but cynical of what or who might be around him. His introduction, after the brief political speech, sees him forebodingly dominate his human counterparts in the outback of Canadian snowy nowhere as he persists in winning tavern-set cage wrestling matches. In providing us with Wolverine as a lead, we are spared having the film revolve around someone ready to accept his role as a mutant and thus are granted the chance to observe an arc dedicated to coming to terms with one's identity on top of future ideas linked to where one comes from.<br/><br/>The leader of a large proportion of mutants is a certain professor named Charles Xavier (Stewart), whom has set up a base disguised as a school for the gifted in order to bring in young mutants so they may learn more about their powers and how to control them. Under his tenure, Cyclops (Marsden); Storm (Berry) and a certain Jean Grey (Janssen) have prevailed; the mutants on this side of the ideological fence retaining generally 'normal', human-like features in their basic appearance and that each of them are either very handsome or rather attractive in general, as they, complete with Xavier, inhabit this rather beautiful, isolated locale of an academy. On the other side, Ian McKellen's Magneto inhabits a very dark, dingy base of operations with his office taking on a very ugly, metallic, cubist form while his minions are these abnormal creatures whom carry disfigured, scarred bodies in the likes of hulking Sabretooth (Mane); an ugly, blue lizard-type shape shifting creature named Mystique (Romijn) and the, well, toad-like mutant named Toad (Park). Despite being a victim of a proposed purification himself as a young boy at the Nazi death camps, it is Magneto's goal to himself purify human beings as mutants so a more ""developed"" species can take over, before we supposedly wipe them out; a kind of rooted hatred of humanity after what happened all those decades ago. It's an interesting move from director Singer to ask us to root against this character, given what we saw him suffer through at the beginning.<br/><br/>The fitting element to the conclusion, during which a U.N. meeting is taking place in New York City and Magneto wants to 'mutantanise' the members, is that the final fight unfolds on The Statue of Liberty; itself a piece of iconography symbolising liberation; freedom and freedom of choice – the key thing being that Magneto is out to sabotage these things in reaction to the popular pass that mutants must surrender their own freedom of choice to remain in the dark. We only need to be told once where the fight is unfolding, and a number of exterior shots during this climax only serve to emphasise the point. At its worst, X-Men is the equivalent of watching a series of slightly interesting battles between expensive action figures giving a makeover by way of a computer, as numerous dead-end sub plots worm their way to nowhere; but these complaints minor and rarely happen. At its best, it's an interesting and genuinely fun romp about, at the most, three conflicting ideologies during which oneupmanship is the rollicking order of the day."
"lewiskendell","6","0","0","18 April 2010"," A good introduction to the Marvel Universe.
","Batman, Superman, and several other comic book icons had been coming to the big screen for years, but none of those movies really required the sheer ambition that was necessary to bring such a beloved and complicated, ensemble style book like X-Men to film. I don't think that X-Men was quite as good as the first Spider-Man or Batman movies, but it succeeded admirably in putting together the world and characters necessary for it's sequel, X2, to be such a great movie. <br/><br/>I think that Bryan Singer and the producers made a lot of good decisions with this movie. Focusing the story on the relationship between Wolverine and Rogue was smart, as were most of the casting decisions. The film adaptations of the various characters and their powers were not perfect, but they certainly could have been worse. The special effects were great for their time, too.<br/><br/>For all those things that it does right, though, I still consider it to be only slightly above average. Maybe the reason that I don't love the move more, is because I've seen it so many times that it has little left to offer me. I don't ever remember thinking it was amazing though, even when it was new. X-Men is a decent comic book flick, but it pales in comparison to its much better sequel."
"Red-Barracuda","6","0","0","16 February 2010"," Decent superhero offering
","X-Men is a pretty decent superhero action flick. It benefits from some good performances from stalwarts Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart – who both lend the necessary gravitas to their respective roles – while Hugh Jackman is charismatic as the central character Wolverine. The story itself is not all that good though. The origins of the X-Men aren't really detailed and maybe could have been, while Magneto's villainous plan at the centre of the story is quite mediocre at best. Like a great many action films X-Men gets bogged down in its final third; the big showdown being not terribly interesting. However, I admire the fact that the film was short. Many similar productions are overlong without any real excuse. A movie like X-Men benefits from this fast approach, and didn't as a result, wear this viewer's patience thin. Overall it was an enjoyable enough ride with decent acting and some welcome humour. Although admittedly I know nothing of the comic, so it's impossible for me to say how this compares; I guess that's a good thing. Superhero films aren't really my cup of tea but this one was alright."

","I like the effort, but the result is sub-par. Here the X-men of Marvel comics are given the big screen treatment, ala Spiderman.

Brian Singer manages to give us the correct visual imaginings of Wolverine, Storm, Psyclops, Jean Grey etc. The convoluted plot leaves this a tragic mess. Fortunately Singer made a competent sequel that manages to take a poor first outing, and make it into a very balanced, smart part 2. Unfortunately he went too comic booky for the third and final installment, rendering the trilogy one of the most uneven productions in modern cinema. Blah, to Great, to Yuck. Amazing."
"ctrout","8","0","0","14 June 2007"," My Favorite ""Superhero Movie""
","Everyone these days talks about how great Spider-Man, Batman Begins, or Superman Returns is, but they forget about the one film that made superhero movies popular again. Back when X-Men came out, I was blown away. I'd never seen a comic book movie have so much substance. The action was fantastic and this brand new talent named Hugh Jackman was destined to be a star.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a school for gifted youngsters. The general population refers to them as mutants, but they're really just like everyone else. Some of these ""mutants"" use the special power they've been given for good. They learn to harness their abilities and let them come out only when it is necessary. These extraordinary people are led by Charles Xavier, played by Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>Of course, there's another side to all of this. There are those who are using their unique traits for evil. Because of all of the hatred toward the mutants, the villains want to make everyone in the world a mutant. Their leader is Erik Lensherr, played by Ian McKellan, who is the perfect foil to Stewart's good natured character.<br/><br/>Our main characters are that of a wide eyed girl, Anna Paquin, and a battle hardened soldier, Hugh Jackman. Both come to the school for gifted youngsters looking for answers or possibly a new life. Like the audience, they're new to this world of mutants and aren't sure of what to make of their ""super"" powers.<br/><br/>Through the course of the film, we run into many other mutants, both good and evil. Each one has a purpose and there's a reason for their inclusion in the movie. It's easy to have a favorite character and I'm sure you'll have one by the end of the movie. The fun and adventure is pretty infectious.<br/><br/>One thing I've noticed about X-Men is that it seems to have been overshadowed and tossed aside because of all the other great movies of this genre that have come out since. Many people think that the sequel to this was even better, but true fans know otherwise. Each character, while we may not see much of them, has their own little scene. You'll remember them for something they do, even if they have just a few minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>X-Men is the perfect superhero movie. It has everything you want in that category and more. The fact that it ends up being an allegory for something in today's society only adds to the greatness of this story. You don't have to love these kinds of movies to love X-Men and that's one of the reasons why I loved it so much. I just wish they could make them like this all of the time."

","I've never really been a fan of comic book-based films but ever since I saw Spider-Man 1 & 2 I believe I have become a fan of comic book films. I love the Spider-Man movies and so when X-Men came on I felt like I just had to see it. And astonishingly I enjoyed it. I love the action and the fight scenes. They're so amazingly choreographed and sequenced and I love the fact that they're so interesting to watch without being bloody and graphically disturbing. They're cool. I loved all the characters. Patrick Stewart was great as Charles Xzavier and I loved Sir Ian McKellan as the deliciously evil Eric Lensher/Magneto. He is one actor who never fails at playing the creepy, intelligent villains. Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, James Marsden as Cyclops, Halle Berry as Storm, and Anna Paquin as Rogue were all awesome as the superheros, the X-Men and I enjoyed all their characters. But I think Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was the one character/performance that stood out the most. Mr. Jackman WAS Wolverine. He had his look down pat and he was so masculine and confident. And I found it hard not to like Wolverine. I believe he was my favorite character. But I liked them all. My favorite scenes were when the X-Men were using their powers and trying to save the world. They're so much fun to watch and it makes you anxious to know when they're gonna use their powers. And I also loved the fact that the action wasn't cheesy in this film. Most superhero films have cheesy dialogue and villains that have cheesy super powers but this film didn't' have that. I loved all of it. X-Men is a great action/superhero film and any fan of comic books or films based on them should watch this. And even if you're not a fan of comic books I think you will enjoy this one for the top notch performances. I really enjoyed X-Men and I'm glad I finally gave it a view. I had kept refusing to see it because I had no interest in comic book films but this one was great. Thanks for reading my review!"

","The first adaptation of the brilliant comic book created by Stan Lee is perfectly translated on screen through the talented hands of Bryan Singer.Not only does X-Men have a stacked cast starring Hugh Jackman,Halle Berry,Famke Janssen,Ian McKellen,and Patrick Stewart but it also has a lot of political and social commentary.X-Men explores intolerance towards racism and homosexuality by using mutation as a metaphor for it and Bryan Singer gets his point across loud and clear.Each and every character with the exception of maybe Rogue is spot on and 100% accurate to the original comic book characters and each actor flawlessly portrays their X-Man.First let's talk cinematography, it is absolutely stunning with a very science fiction, matrix look and feel to it really creating a sense of visual satisfaction.The pacing is sort of slow but the action in the final few scenes is breathtaking and accompanied by great special effects that create the atmosphere that is X-Men.The fight sequences aren't the least bit cheesy of kung phooey they are intense and really get your adrenaline pumping waiting to see whose power will be used next.Thhis was one of the first big budget comic book movies ever produced before this was the first four Batman films, the Superman films, and Spawn making X-Men look even better by comparison.Many argue that Spiderman and Spiderman 2 are Marvel's best films ever made but i disagree I think X-Men is above the first two Spiderman movies,Daredevil,and The Hulk it is truly a work of art perfectly adapted from a work of art.My only few criticisms are the lack of action, and that there weren't many mutants in the film that i wanted to see (Beast,Angel,Gambit,Emma Frost,Jubilee,and Nightcrawler) but my craving for those characters would be satisfied by it's equally brilliant sequel and it's final epic X-Men:The Last Stand.Overall the greatest beginning to any comic book trilogy and perhaps the greatest comic book trilogy to date."

","Apt though dry first installation of the underdog comic franchise delivers fairly decent introductions into these comic heroes lives. The often stilted narratives delivered through mostly acceptable acting are thankfully offset by the practical yet glamorous nature of the special effects. Despite the tasteful implementation of effects, the direction of the action scenes often feel disconnected. Alongside the mechanical script, the film offers no real emotional connection to much of the fantasy, save a few human, comical moments.

After seeing it I definitely cannot see anyone else who would have played Xavier's part better than Patrick Stewart. Brian Singer also did a wonderful job with the music and putting the story together to make people think that mutants with powers could very well exist in this world. Many people think that actresses and actors should be perfect with their looks and their features, and there were a few in the movie that I noticed. Being a good director in my opinion is accepting people who may not have the greatest of looks or the greatest teeth. And I applaud the director for this, because I watch too many shows or movies who have people who look too phony.<br/><br/>The make up and costuming was very well done, Mystique's costume took a very long time and it was very well done. She looked as if she could exist in this world as a mutant, the contact lenses looked as if they could have been real eyes.Everything was done excellent in the movie, all except for one tiny thing. Not all mutants are going to know how to do self defense, some may know how to fist fight or kick someone. But doing sumer saults in the air, seems fake to me. I can understand someone who may have the ability to jump like a toad, but a shape shifter or a wolverine. Just seems fake to make all the characters perfect in fighting skills. This is only my opinion.<br/><br/>Still the movie was great and was done well, just wish they could have kept either Toad or Sabertooth alive as well. Not all villains who can't fight well should be killed and have the best fighter live."

","The film that brought comic book adaptations back into the Hollywood forefront, director Bryan Singer's X-MEN works for many reasons, but mainly because Singer and company take the entire premise and characters with the utmost seriousness and respect. This film does not exist merely to wow audiences with effects and set-piece or bombard them with zinging one-liners (both of which are present, of course), but Singer also wants to elicit an emotional response form his viewers, and he succeeds. Although Singer perhaps crams too many characters into a film with such a short runtime (which leaves the movie a bit top-heavy), he has effectively laid the groundwork for a likable assortment of characters. This is also aided, of course, by the terrific cast that Singer has tapped.<br/><br/>The real casting ace is then-unknown Australian actor Hugh Jackman, who delivers a fierce and emotive performance that justifiably turned him into a major Hollywood star. When asked if his metallic claws hurt when they tear through the knuckles of his hands, Jackman replies, ""Every time,"" and his somber delivery perfectly captures all of the physical and psychological pain that comes from being different. Singer also pulls memorable work from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, although it must be pointed out that both Anna Paquin and Halle Berry are terrible, inflicting completely unlistenable attempts at character accents upon us. The film has so many characters and set-ups that the whole picture is a bit top-heavy, however, X-MEN is still one of the few film blockbusters of the 21st century to dig below surface-level aesthetics, and it proved that audiences still respond to heroes at the box office."

The maker's already set the mood right with the shot of the concentration camp at the beginning and the film retains this tone all-through-out.<br/><br/>The film also has a brilliant cast, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart pull off their roles as the two best recognised figures in the X-Men and Marvel universe. Undoubtedly the actor who always makes my day is Hugh Jackman, who is just perfect for the role of Wolverine. As such it's rather a pity that some of the other characters have a harder time standing out, but ones that definitely do are Rogue and Mystique.<br/><br/>The film is not unfortunately flawless. Despite it's brilliant execution I always felt that the film lacked a certain amount of drama. Even though it is an excellent film, I still think that Hulk pulled it off better."

","I thought that this movie was excellent. I never thought much about seeing the X-Men movies until the third one came out. The reason why I decided to see it then was because one of my favorite actors the beautiful Ben Foster is in it.<br/><br/>I think it is pretty cool of how the knifes and blades and spears come right out of the mutants whenever they want and need them to. The school that they went to for mutants was really just like an ordinary school. I thought the costumes and settings were wonderful.<br/><br/>I also thought the acting was great, directing, photography and script. Two Thumbs Way Up! 10 out of 10 stars!"

","this is absolutely one of my favorite super hero movies! i love the drama and the action scenes but its not to full of action like x-men 3 was were their was more action then the story! i think Bryan singer is one of the most brilliant directors like when he directed the usual suspects that was a great movie. i hope to see the superman returns movie the day it comes out just with the directors past it should be great, i only wish that he would have stuck with x-men 3 instead of going with the man who wheres underwear on the outside! but back to the movie it was entertaining great characters great acting too.

"cwrdlylyn","8","0","0","14 June 2006"," X-MEN : Not Too Exciting, But A Great Set-Up For Future Sequels...
","X-MEN <br/><br/>After seeing X-MEN:THE LAST STAND in the theaters I was anxious to revisit the film that started the franchise. Lately, X2 has been on television all the time, and considering it's the better film then X-MEN I've seen it more often. When I first saw X-MEN in the theaters, I was left with mixed feelings for the film. I couldn't help but admire it for bringing to the screen my favorite childhood characters... however, I couldn't help but be underwhelmed compared to the pictures I'd had in my imagination all those years.<br/><br/>X-MEN, the first film in the franchise, had an almost impossible task in front of it when it was made. The scope and sheer size of the comic book stories is so huge it's impossible to please all the fans of the series. If the first film had started with the origin of the X-MEN... we would have had to wait through numerous films to see many of our favorite X-MEN. However, to dive into the middle of a story that took place over centuries of time in the comic books risks alienating fans of the original story lines. Bryan Singer had to make a choice... remain 100% faithful to the comics or remain loyal to the central theme while manipulating some characters and stories to work in a film franchise. Either way, not everyone could be 100% please.<br/><br/>In the end, Singer opted to re-formulate some stories and characters. I assume he did so in order to make it feel more current, and to ensure that bringing some other mutants in for further installments in the series was easier to accomplish. It is in this choice that my reservations for this first film were born. When I first left the theater, my mind was filled with thoughts like ""Why does Rogue not do anything she's supposed to"" and ""Why did they not use certain mutants enough"" and ""Couldn't this have been bigger?"".<br/><br/>Now, having seen where the franchise continued to move, I can appreciate these changes a little more. Things in the first film felt surprisingly hollow to me when I first saw it in the theaters. I saw that there were subtle allusions to the Dark Pheonix Saga as well as a strong establishment of the ""mutant war""... however the sequels to the film have made me appreciate the subtlety of this first installment more.<br/><br/>X-MEN begins the story of the X-Men in a time when mutant privacy is being threatened. Senator Kelly (played by Bruce Davison) is leading the campaign that all mutants should be forced to register as such. However, two allegiances of mutants, led by Profesor X (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen) have very strong feelings against this campaign. Profesor X leads the X-Men in the fight to co-exist with humans peacefully, while Magneto leads the fight to eliminate human supremacy.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a young girl named Rogue (Anna Paquin, who unfortunately is mis-cast in this role) is discovering she has powers she can't control, nor does she want. After being taken under the wing of Wolverine (played to perfection by Hugh Jackman), they find themselves under Profesor X's protection. But exactly who needs to be protected and from what? The problem with this film as a stand alone piece is that there simply is not enough action. I assume budget constraints kept the film from being able to unleash all the action we see in X-MEN:THE LAST STAND... however, the lack of any real fight scene pitting a team of X-Men against an opponent is the major disappointment here. Action scenes clearly had to be created on a small budget, and while some more intimate fights remain exciting (Wolverine vs. Mystique in particular)... the finale leaves the audience slightly underwhelmed.<br/><br/>However, as an introduction to the series this film functions rather well. Those subtle allusions to Dark Pheonix and the ""mutant war"" I mentioned before don't seem as hollow now that I see they were actual seeds to future plots. Also, the fact that this film a character study of Rogue and Wolverine more then anything gives additional weight to the future films.<br/><br/>All in all, although the film seems boring as a stand-alone ""blockbuster action film""... it adds weight to what has turned out to be a compelling franchise. It is a more personal film then X-MEN:THE LAST STAND and it is a more information film then X2:X-MEN UNITED. Although at first I couldn't fully appreciate it as an avid fan, I have come to enjoy the original X-MEN film for what it is. A good, if not great film, that is a strong establishment of better things to come.<br/><br/>... B ..."
"north-julie","7","0","0","5 June 2006"," its dated now but its still a brilliant introduction for the series
","When x men came out in 2000 it was the first of the new batch of marvel comic book movies. The x men series of comic books is apparently the highest selling series in the world (according to creator Stan Lee) and as such a movie was inevitable. Director Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) has delivered a movie that pleases the fans while bringing newcomers a lot of joy.<br/><br/>When a US senator decides that all mutants in the USA should come forward and be registered Magneto (playesd impressively by Ian Mckellen) realises that it would spell doom for mutants everywhere and so he decides that now is the time to fight back. Kidnapping the Senator, he builds a machine that can give any human mutant powers. His plan is to use the machine on the upcoming world summit meeting and inflict mutancy on every world leader so that they can no longer distance themselves from the mutant population. Meanwhile Magneto's old friend Charles Xaviar (played wonderfully by Patrick Stewart) and his loyal band of mutants the X-men learn of the plan and set out to stop him. Joining them are young girl Rogue who can kill anyone she touches and angry Wolverine who has incredible regenerative powers and sharp claws that shoot out from his knuckles.<br/><br/>What is a mutant? Well, every few thousand years evolution comes on leaps and bounds and a select group of humans experience changes around puberty. Some of the afflictions seen in this movie are the ability to control the weather, laser beams emanating from a mans eyes and telepathy.<br/><br/>As an introduction to what would eventually become a trilogy, this is a perfect film. It has a lot of exposition because the makers obviously realised that it would be followed by more films in the series, and as such it lacks any grandstanding action scenes. The effects are top notch, and the acting by the impressive cast (Halle Berry, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen) is as it should be. Indeed, Hugh Jackman takes centre stage as the sceptical Wolverine and his brand of hard edged charisma is pivotal to the films success.<br/><br/>The action (a train station bust up, a fight on top of the Statue of Liberty) is entertaining and at the time was amazing eye candy, but since then the amazing action scenes of the last few years (city wide destruction in War of the Worlds, huge battles in the LOTR trilogy) have pushed these rather meagre conflicts back a bit. In essence, X men seems simply like a teaser for its sequel and the upcoming X men 3.<br/><br/>In short, this is a great film that has brilliant characters and a good dose of controlled humour (Wolverine tells Cyclops to 'keep his eye open') as well as solid foundations laid out by ever reliable pairing Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. Bryan Singer delivered a film that entertained and amused us all, but looking back its clear that this was merely a film where Marvel tested their products and waited to see if their comic book characters could work on celluloid.<br/><br/>A great origin movie, and remember that if this film hadn't been a success we'd never have had Spiderman or any of the other Marvel films that have been produced.<br/><br/>7/10"

","With the comic book hype growing each year, it is nice to see a story come to life without being cheesy or childish. This movie brings the X-Men universe to real life in a very real way. The story's heroes have their abilities yet never seem to exceed them. In the cartoon or the comics they always go toe to toe with tougher opponents and seem to be able to take more damage than they should. In the movie that isn't the case. I was very pleased to see them use their powers in a real environment, and it didn't seem fake to me. I like the story they chose to tell in this first installment. It did a good job with character development, but it didn't have all the characters I would have liked to see. Where's Gambit? Why is Rogue more like a Jubilee in regards to her relationship with Logan? Once I got past my disappointment I really enjoyed this movie. It is definitely worth watching over and over again."

"Robert_duder","8","0","0","26 May 2006"," One of the most well made, intelligent Superhero, comic adaptations to date!!
","Okay so it is a Marvel creation...I can cut it slack for that ha ha kidding kidding...settle down Marvel fans. It's true I've always been a DC fan but still X-Men are classic heroes at the finest and director Bryan Singer do an incredible job bringing the heroes to life. In fact I think X-Men is one of the most well cast films ever period!! Everyone is perfect for their roles, everyone is exactly what you expect from them, the story line is deep and intelligent and the action is amazing and non stop and builds to a good vs evil blow out at the statue of Liberty. How can you top that?? <br/><br/>Unknown Aussie actor Hugh Jackman nailed the lead as Logan/""Wolverine."" Certainly looks wise he had the part down cold but it was so much more than that. He absolutely made Wolverine. He was exactly what the character was and always has been. He is a great action hero, and the part made Jackman into a star and for good reason. I only wish he did more action parts. Still he is and always will be Wolverine. His character gets the best story, the best character arc, the most depth and he pulls it off with incredible emotion and personality. How could Patrick Stewart not be Professor Charles Xavier?? He looked the part, talked the part, he was perfect. He was just as perfect as Jackman was for the role. Stewart exudes intellect and he is a great fatherly figure to them all. The terrific Ian McKellen plays the evil Magneto. He's the perfect villain because he has such great intellect, a great history with Charles Xavier as friends and enemies and he's almost a misunderstood villain with seemingly pure reasons behind his madness. Famke Janssen plays the telepathically powerful Jean Grey. Although she too plays her role very intelligent, her performance is a little wooden and not entirely important. She could have done a lot more with the character. James Marsden plays Scott ""Cyclops"" Summers. Unfortunately Cyclops doesn't have a huge role and it's a great character. On top of that Marsden is terrific in the part. His chemistry opposite Jackman's Wolverine is fun and hilarious at times as they banter and fight over Jean Grey's affections. Halle Berry is the star power as Storm. Apparently she doesn't like how small her part is but I think she does a great job and she does have a significant role. I think Berry's performance as Storm is actually one of her best. She too completely embodies the character. Young Anna Paquin plays the naive Rogue who finds her way to the Xmen. Rogue and Wolverine have a heavy story together and Jackman and Paquin are good together in the father-daughter type role. Paquin is a little quiet but she looks very forlorn and you feel sorry for her character. She's a little young to be playing Rogue but still her character is important and she's good enough to carry it. The rest of the cast (mostly bad guys) are fantastic, Tyler Mane, Rebecca Romijn, Ray Park, and Bruce Davison are all fantastic in their smaller but very significant roles. Romijn is especially intriguing under all the make up as the deadly and mysterious Mystique...able to take the form of ANYONE. This is without a doubt her best role as well.<br/><br/>If Bryan Singer had a hand in casting...bravo to him for pulling together the absolutely perfect cast. They all clicked together unlike anything I've ever seen. On top that for an action film and a super-hero film this has one of the best story lines I have ever seen. There is no origins to cover per se but instead launches immediately into the brewing war between Mutants and humans. Singer creates a future world where fear creates a chasm between them. X-Men is a terrific action film, and starts a great series!! So much potential for sequels and so much amazing story and characters. It's a must see!! 8.5/10"

"theshadow908","7","0","0","26 May 2006"," Pretty good comic book film.
","X-Men is based off the famous Marvel comic about the conflict between average human beings and mutants. Charles Xavier is a mutant who runs a school where mutants can go to learn and be safe. However, underneath the cover of the school, he has a strike force he calls the X-Men, sworn to protect humanity from any threat. The X-Men consist of Cyclops, Storm, and Jean Grey. On the other side of the spectrum is Magneto, an evil mutant who believes in mutant superiority and leads his own team, the Brotherhood, consisting of Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth. When Magneto attacks two mutants named Wolverine and Rogue, Xavier must find out what his old friend wants with them. X-Men is a good movie for anyone who is a fan of the comics or the 90's cartoon series, but people who just want to sit down and enjoy a movie might not like it.<br/><br/>The acting is really good. All of the actors involved bring their characters to life with good results. Hugh Jackman made a surprisingly good Wolverine even though he was a complete unknown at the time. Halle Berry is a great actress and she made a really good Storm, even though her screen time was a little under what it could have been. By far the best acting job in the movie is Ian McKellan who tackles the role of the evil Magneto. His voice is ice cold and it makes Magneto seem even more threatening that he already is.<br/><br/>The action scenes are great, especially the climactic battle at the end. Bryan Singer breathes a new life into the X-Men and makes their cinematic adventures look as if they're taking place in the real world rather than the comic book world. The only problem with this first movie is that it's basically a two hour introduction to all the characters. If you think about it, not a whole lot happens in this film. The plot isn't that deep, but instead it focuses on establishing the characters and where they stand. Don't get me wrong, this isn't a bad thing, the movie is still good, but like I said, it's more appreciated among fans of the source material.<br/><br/>So, X-Men is a good comic book/action film albeit a little underdeveloped, and should be viewed by all X-Men fans.<br/><br/>7/10"
"Droid777","9","0","0","18 May 2006"," Smart, funny sci-fi adventure loaded with great action.
","The Xmen comics is given a slick and realistic make over, that not only brings the mutants powers to the big screen but also makes them believable. Mutants are people who are feared for being different, the movie first focuses on Wolverine and Rogue, who end up joining the X-men in an attempt to stop Magneto, a mutant terrorist who wants to destroy the human race.<br/><br/>The movie is smart, with a great plot and a great cast. Ian Mckellen and Patrick Stuart are brilliant in this giving great performances. Hugh Jackman plays a tough (although slightly taller) Wolverine. It introduces the Xmen well, and there is a lot of character development, especially between wolverine and rogue (Anna Paquin). The love triangle between Cyclops, Jean Grey and Wolverine brings in tension and a lot of funny scenes between Cyclops and Wolverine. The Special effects are also great considering there wasn't a huge action movie budget on this, with great lightening sequences for Storm. The villains are also interesting with the disgusting toad, frightening Sabertooth and Mystique who has some spectacular scenes. I won't give away the ending but it all comes together with a bang and leaves room for a sequel."

","X-MEN **** Based on the comic book series that began in the 1960s, this big-screen adaptation is more of a variation on a theme than an outright recreation. It entails the mutant race who are rejected and persecuted by society because of their abnormality. The second contending rift exists between the mutants trying to help the human race and those striving to extinguish them. The story begins with a young woman (Anna Paquin) trying to find her place in society upon discovering her internal mutanic structure. She is taken in by the good guys, and in the climactic point the opposing force wants her for their own purposes. I took 'X-Men' as a simple entertainment of cool hand-on-hand combat and impressive special effects and really enjoyed it."

","Like Spider-Man, I've never read any of the X-Men comics, but I am a big fan of the X-Men cartoon. And a very good cartoon it is too. All of the characters are well fleshed out with their own distinctive personalities and pasts. This is where my knowledge of the series comes from. And when I learnt a film version of the X-Men was in the works, it elicited mixed feelings from me because a TV series allows for development of all of the characters. I didn't see how it could be done within the confines of a 100 minute film.<br/><br/>Still, it has to be said that Bryan Singer's X-Men works far better than expected, even if some of my fears were justified. For anyone not familiar with the characters, the X-Men are mutants. They represent the next stage of human evolution. The film doesn't include all of the X-Men, but it does have some of the most important ones. There is Cyclops (James Marsden) who can shoot energy beams from his eyes, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who has a metallic skeleton, metal claws that sprout from his knuckles, and remarkable healing powers, Storm (Halle Berry) who can control the weather and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) who's a telekinetic.<br/><br/>The leader of the X-Men is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a very powerful telepath who wants to bring peace between humans and mutants. But there are some mutants who don't share Xavier's dream. And the ringleader is Magneto (Ian McKellan), a mutant with the power of magnetism, who has amassed his own team of mutants. Mystique, a shapeshifter, Sabretooth, a feral mutant, and in the case of Toad...well his name speaks for itself. He's got a nasty tongue too. Magneto is a survivor of the Holocaust, and he has no intention of letting mutants become the victims of persecution just like the Jews were. He has developed a machine that triggers mutations in human beings, and his first test-subject is Senator Robert Kelly.<br/><br/>Senator Kelly believes mutants are a threat to mankind, and has played upon peoples fear and mistrust of mutants to turn it to his favour. When Kelly is kidnapped by Magneto, the machine turns him into a mutant, but Kelly's body rejects it, killing him in the process. All this is unknown to Magneto, who is planning on doing the same to the UN summit before they impose a legislation on mutant registration.<br/><br/>Powering the machine would mean killing Magneto, so he kidnaps a young mutant called Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can drain the energy out of people with a simple touch, and a mutant's power too. Magneto will transfer his power to Rogue who will power the machine hidden inside the Statue of Liberty, and bring about Magneto's future of a mutant dominated society. It's up to the X-Men to stop him.<br/><br/>As I write this review, X-Men feels a bit cluttered. Singer's direction is excellent and the camera-work is sharp and astute, but X-Men is quite a juggling act. Not only is there Magneto's scheme to contend with, but there are far too many characters and not enough development.<br/><br/>Some are afforded massive screen time, like Wolverine and Rogue. Which isn't a bad thing because Jackman and Paquin's acting is superb. But Storm and Cyclops are shortchanged. Patrick Stewart was born to play Professor Xavier, embodying the character's trademark serenity. Ian McKellan is perfectly cast as well. He makes Magneto into someone who isn't really evil, just passionate about keeping the future safe for mutants. He doesn't want history to repeat itself. And he is genuinely regretful about Rogue's sacrifice for his plan.<br/><br/>Although some of the casting is inspired, others are badly miscast. James Marsden is annoyingly bland as Cyclops, and Halle Berry is all wrong too. She has none of Storm's majestic grace as the mistress of the elements. Famke Janssen makes an impression as Jean Grey, even if she is a little subdued. But I sense great potential in her, something happily expanded upon in the sequel.<br/><br/>But it's Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin that captures the attention. Jackman's film debut is a revelation. He captures the feral attitude of Wolverine to a tee, and knows when to dial it down too. Anna Paquin brings the right blend of teen angst and confusion at her growing mutant power. In one of X-Men's quieter moments, she confesses to Wolverine how she put a boy into a three week coma through a simple kiss. Her performance is dazzling because of the way her young mind comes to grips with the fact that she will never experience intimacy in her life. I predict Anna Paquin has a very promising future ahead.<br/><br/>X-Men is most effective in exploring mutants burgeoning powers. How they realise they're different, but they're afraid to come forward. It bears connotations with gay and ethnic minorities and shows why X-Men is filled with possibilities.<br/><br/>There are some great action scenes too. Wolverine's fight with Sabretooth and Mystique. Magneto flipping police cars about, and Toad's impressive gymnastics. The climax at Liberty Island is perhaps slightly disappointing (compared to the sequel anyway) and the film is more enjoyable if you have a working knowledge of the characters beforehand, but Bryan Singer's film is a good start, and leaves things open for the next welcome instalment.<br/><br/>X2 is a more tightly plotted film and feels more epic in scale. It was the same with Spider-Man 2. Whatever shortcomings the original had, they've been eliminated from the sequel. But X-Men still succeeds as an engaging superhero film, and leaves the door open for many sequels to follow."

","Move over Superman, Batman, Spider-Man, and the Incredible Hulk. The X-Men are here. Based on the Marvel comic-book heroes created in 1963 by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby, the ""X-Men"" movie is mostly just that--comic-book material. But it's done with such remarkable visual style, you might not notice its want of substance. In fact, ""X-Men"" resembles a lot of today's action movies; it involves a boatload of good actors in state-of-the-art technical wizardry and at its core lacks heart. As Gertrude Stein is supposed to have said of Oakland, ""There's no 'there' there."" In typical comic-book fashion, both the premise and plot of ""X-Men"" are quite simple, but the filmmakers have done their best to muddle them up, making the first hour of patchwork developments a chore to piece together. Here's the idea: Mankind, according to evolutionary theory, has taken millions of years to mutate into the species we are today; but what if those mutations could be effected in only a few years? Would not the result be a race of beings with possibly extraordinary powers compared to mere Homo sapiens? Without explaining how these instant mutations could occur, the story line assumes such things have already happened, resulting in a world of the ""not-too-distant future"" being inhabited by growing numbers of mutant people with unusual capabilities. Actually, it just gives the writers a flimsy excuse to let loose a bevy of superheroes and super-villains on the world without having to explain how they got that way. Even still Its the great series brought to life. Love it. Wolverine is the best."

Jackman played an excellent lone bad***. Following the old cartoon video with the exception of lacking a few characters, and where Magneto's machine is, this movie is portrays the plot line of the cartoon like no other. Spider-Man, Daredevil, Hulk, Punisher, etc... all these superheroes were revived to movies simply put because the X-Men hit the box office like a ton of bricks. The reason being is before this movie we had flops like The Phantom, Batman Forever, Batman and Robin, and Spawn.

","When I look back at the summer of 2000 there's really only two films that come to mind; Ridley Scott's Gladiator (which I loved), and Bryan Singer's X-Men. Which in my opinion, was the best comic book movie adaptation (at least at that time), even beating out Batman for the top spot. X-Men seemed to deliver just the right amount of big-scale action, humor and sci-fi imaginings that made the film accessible to anyone, whether they were die-hard comic book fans, or not. And at that particular time, I was not, but now I am a huge comic book fan.<br/><br/>When I was really young (around four or five) I used to be into Superman and Batman, so I was more of the D.C. Comics type of kid. I watched those old 40's Max & Dave Fleischer Superman cartoons, the George Reeves 50's black and white Superman TV show, and of course the Christopher Reeves films, and both the Batman and Superman animated TV series of the early-mid 90's (which I still love), heck I even watched the 60's Batman TV show with Adam West (remember back before he was the Mayor of Quahog?). I didn't really get into Batman until Tim Burton came out with his film in '89. But despite all of these things I still wasn't a ""comic book kid"". I never went out and bought, or read comic books, but it wasn't until I saw Bryan Singer's X-Men, and to a greater extent Sam Raimi's Spider-Man that I became a real comic book fan. So for me X-Men is kind of a turning point in my interest with comic books and superheroes.<br/><br/>X-Men has a number of things working for it. First off, the film is under a hundred minutes, and is very quick paced; never slow, or dull. Second, the casting is, well excellent. Hugh Jackman is spot-on perfect for the character of Wolverine, who was always my favorite X-Men even before I saw the film. He's a tough character whose rough around the edges, but with a tender heart, but don't mess with him, because he'll tear you a new one, literally! Then there's Professor X (for Xavier), played by none other than Patrick Stewart. Honestly though, could you even image for a second for anyone else in this role? Because I certainly know I couldn't. Then there's ""the bad guy""; Magneto, played by the great Sir Ian McKellan, needless to say he's great as well; a villain evoking both cold-blooded menace and intelligence. Then there's the rest of the cast which includes James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Halle Barry, Anna Paquin, Rebecca Romijn (insert drooling sound here), Tyler Mane and Ray Park. All of them were great, well all except Halle Barry's wig and fake accent, but other than that it's hard to see anything wrong with this cast. And I for one am glad they decided to change the costumes a bit, because Wolverine just wouldn't have looked as kick-ass as he did if he was wearing yellow spandex, like in the comic books, but I thought the X-Men looked great in the black leather costumes.<br/><br/>The plot of X-Men, in case you've been living under a rock, or just haven't seen the movie before is about two mutants (Wolverine and Rouge) who are rescued by two X-Men (Storm and Cyclops) and brought to a ""school for the gifted"" run by Professor X. It seems as if they are on the edge of a war between humans and mutants. Magneto has an evil, secret plan towell, I ain't gonna spoil it for ya, you'll just have to see the movie. But X-Men isn't just a big summer action flick, filled with computer effects, no, X-Men is also well-acted and well-written. Any ""popcorn"" flick can have special effects, but not all of them deliver the solid performances and smart dialogue like X-Men does, and on top of that the film is also dark, stylish, exciting, and at times surprisingly funny. I couldn't have asked for a better comic book movie, and it still holds up after many viewings, many years later. This is excellent summer fun that's not dumbed down, and people of all ages, young and old, and both male and female alike and both fans and non-fans can enjoy."

","I saw this at the cinema on the day it opened in the UK. I was quite excited about an X Men movie and at the time I was left disappointed. I have since seen it again and find that its actually quite good. But it suffers from one major flaw, that luckily the sequel doesn't. And thats that it feels like a pilot for a TV show.<br/><br/>Still the action scenes are well done and everyone is cast great. One of Marvels best adaptations so far.<br/><br/>Lets just hope the third one lives up to the first 2. This is one of those rare times that a sequel is better. But you really need to see this one in order for the series to make sense and really its not a bad film."

","What Bryan Singer has done to bring X-Men to the big-screen is both smart and fun to watch. Instead of making X-Men about nothing but big mutant action, he's managed to make a good action movie with a good plot and puts everything in the movie together nicely and with some style in a few areas.<br/><br/>Considering the mutants included in this movie, Singer has done, if I may say so, an excellent job in selecting the actors and actresses for each role. As far as bring their character to life, Jackman does the best job as Logan or Wolverine as he's better called by fans. Paquin does a good job at capturing the confused and seemingly stressed feeling of Rogue. But Patrick Stewart is the smartest choice in particular, even though Jackman does the best at being Wolverine. Not only does Stewart have the perfect look for Professor Xavier, but he also has the right personality and attitude, a kind of know-it-all but helpful and not-so geeky kind of personality makes him one of the more believable characters. Ian McKellen is a great choice for Magneto. Not only is he the smartest choice for Magneto, but McKellen creates a charming and calm kind of feeling towards his character, which even as a baddie he manages to make the audience like him. All the other performers of X-Men do their part to bring their mutant role to life, and they all do it successfully and almost perfectly.<br/><br/>X-Men's plot is actually one of its better elements. Yes, you could go on saying how cool each of the mutants were, how great the special effects are and how cool the vs. battles were, but to talk about this movie and not mention it having a good plot is almost an insult. The thing I like about this movie is that it takes its time to let the audience understand everything that's going on and the movie takes what some might call a risk in not being so involved in the action sequences and using up a majority of the viewing time to let the story of the movie flow and lets the action and performers go and unfold the events that happen throughout the film. But since I don't want to spoil the simple but more than above-average plot for you, I'll keep it on the down-low from now. Just know that if you're looking for a good plot in X-Men you won't be disappointed.<br/><br/>The action in X-Men isn't that much of a focus of the movie as the plot is, but not to worry, the action is more than satisfying and most of the time pretty cool. The special effects in this movie aren't used in a way that it'd make X-Men the king of CGI like King Kong and Titanic are, but they're nothing short of impressive and make the action sequences much more stylish. Most of the action is thrown out near the end and it all leaves a good feeling with the audience to make them feel satisfied and to have gotten a good share of action.<br/><br/>But even with all that I've said in X-Men, it just doesn't seem to rise to that mark to make it an Oscar-worthy film. It's not that the movie lacked anything, not at all, everything in the movie was pieced together right, but it's just one of those movies that doesn't give the viewer that ""wow"" or ""now that's a stunning masterpiece"" impression once the movie ends, but instead comes out being a great movie that only lacks the beyond belief factor that the biggest movies deliver. But by no means is X-Men a bad film, there's absolutely nothing that I could say was particularly wrong with the film, it's only when you stack it against the best movies that it comes short, and X-Men almost seems to want to challenge those films in some way."

","Bryan Singer introduces us to the world of ""X-Men"" in a mostly successful way. The film is properly cast - with a special mention for Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier (one of my favorite actors) and Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine. However, the other areas are less than par (including a silly costume for Magneto - what's with his helmet?) and a so-so score by the late Maestro Michael Kamen (FYI, I do enjoy his scores for the Die Hard and Lethal Weapon films but in this case, it was not very memorable). If you want to see a great X-Men movie, I suggest renting the sequel X2 (which was properly done by Bryan Singer). For this outing however, an above average 7 out of 10 for a good introduction to a memorable superhero series."

","Evolution has created the next link in the chain, people who have special powers. They have been classified as mutants by the 'normal' population, who fear these different people, greeting them with trepidation. Rogue has only realised she is a mutant after she place her boyfriend into a coma; she takes peoples' energy. On the run she runs into Wolverine; another mutant with fast healing abilities and three retractable blades on each hand. The two are attack by an mutant Sabertooth on unknown intentions, Rogue and Wolverine are saved and taken into the care of Professor Xavier; with his protégés Storm, Cyclops and Jean. Xavier has been fighting for equality between mutants and people, but a former friend Magneto has the opposite idea. Magneto want superiority over the human race; believing mutants are the next ruler of earth. Magneto has devised a plan with his henchmen Sabertooth; Toad and Mystique that will make people think differently about mutants.<br/><br/>X-Men is a faithful adaptation of the comic book series, without ever falling into the pit of over the top sensibilities. Bryan Singer has played it on the lower keys where the characters come to the fore front; instead of the action. There are a lot of character in X-Men, yet it doesn't over load you. They may not be fleshed out a lot, but your still are able to understand them and attach yourself to them. The most developed is Wolverine who has a lot of past to uncover, yet it still would have been nice to have more depth on the other characters.<br/><br/>The action is kept on the low down, there isn't a lot of it, and it soars in that respect. With action and special effects kept to the minimum, they have been able to develop the characters and the story. As the special effects are used a lot, it allows the scenery to come forward, and the scenery is visually rich and detailed. X-Men has a real quiet tone, but from this the subtexts really are uncovered. There are a lot of ideas and morals beneath the surface; acceptance, tolerance, bigotry,social stature, and that fear that everyone has when they don't understand the unknown. There are some great scenes between Rogue and Wolverine that elevate this from just am action film and really humanise the story. There is a sense of realism to the story, reflecting a lot of the racial intolerance in humanity at our current times.<br/><br/>X-Men shows what great casting can lead to. All the actors perfectly fit their roles, with a lot of unknown actors showing some great talent. Hugh Jackman is great as the rugged Wolverine, Famke Janssen wonderful as Jean, same with Halle Berry as Storm, Anna Paquin shines as Rogue, James Marsden also great as Cyclops. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart both are great in their roles, Ian as the determined Magneto and Patrick as the humble Xavier.<br/><br/>X-Men is one of the better comic book adaptations as it goes beyond the action and delves deeper to bring a very deep and meaningful story, with so much subtext to explore."

","I have never read an X Men comic nor even heard them referred to in any medium until this ""X Men"" movie came out. <br/><br/>So I was really involved in the background exposition, which is most of the movie and is mostly a set up for the sequels. It was a bit much to start with the real environment of Nazi concentration camps in '44 and then somehow leap to the ""near future"" rather than making the whole thing futuristic, but I'm sure other folks know if that's based in the comics.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman took over the whole movie in a star-making turn. Halle Berry surely won't be able to use this as an audition tape; I hope she at least made big bucks because she had zero to do. James Marsden fans will be similarly disappointed, though Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan get to sleepwalk and still emote.<br/><br/>The sibling-like relationship between Jackman's Wolverine and Anna Paquin's Rogue is surprisingly touching, marred by an unnecessary ending comment that now she has a thing for him that he has to condescendingly put down. Hey, what's the matter with familial affection these days as a motivator?<br/><br/>The fight scenes were a bit ho hum - - it was like a Sesame Street lesson in cooperation as each set of mutants gangs up on enemies to use their super mutant powers together. I kept thinking how much more intense and scary was the Statue of Liberty scene in Hitchock's ""The Saboteur"" compared to this climax.<br/><br/>The music was bombastic but effective.

"pyrocitor","9","0","0","29 October 2005"," Predecessor to a whole generation of successful superhero movies
","When you look at in, X-Men really was a risk when it was first released in 2000. Big budget superhero movies hadn't been successful in ages, the last attempt being the abominable flop 'Batman and Robin'. As well, X-Men incorporated a huge cast, most of which were big name actors, almost all of whom needed roughly equal screen time to make the story work. All in all, it seemed a lot to juggle to make work.<br/><br/>Lucky it seems then that a director was attached to the project who actually knew what he was doing. Brian Singer, whose credentials included 'The Usual Suspects', a heist thriller known as one of the most brilliantly executed of all time and 'Apt Pupil', detailing the life of an ex-Nazi trying to incorporate himself into an ordinary lifestyle; seemed like the kind of director who would pass off a comic book film as ""too lowbrow"". But Singer instead embraced the deeper themes of the story, such as societal prejudice and exclusion, and played them for maximum effect. And it worked; X-Men seems surprisingly grounded in reality considering it features characters able to blast laser beams from their eyes and control the weather. The viewer can almost picture themselves inhabiting a world where parents are afraid of their children going to school with the mutant kids.<br/><br/>Singer also comprehensively explores the comic backstory of the characters, and brings this into effect. And yet, for all the comic book trivia incorporated into the movie, the plot never sags, or seems overcrowded. Such traits as Professor Xavier(Patrick Stewart)'s paternal instinct towards Cyclops (James Marsden), his first student are expressed in only a couple of lines, and yet become definitive and clear to the audience. We also see such characters as Pyro, Shadowcat and Colossus (who made larger appearances in the second movie) take cameos, as if to see which comic fans are paying attention. Truly a classy directorial move. There's also several knowing winks to the characters backstories (the ""what would you prefer - yellow spandex?"" line being the most obvious) as well as several cheeky and intelligent touches, such as Wolverine's middle claw, and ""keep your eye open"" comment to Cyclops.<br/><br/>It also helps that Singer has managed to assemble a stellar cast to bring the much loved characters to life. The movie built solid careers for relative newcomers Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn, and certainly brought Halle Berry more into the commercial spotlight. But the movie not only features many well known actors, but also manages to perfectly capture the essence of the age old characters. Hugh Jackman seems born to play Wolverine; every gesture, every move he makes is purely in character. This also seems to be the case for Patrick Stewart, who makes a pitch perfect Professor Xavier, trainer and mentor to the X-Men. Famke Janssen is a superb Jean Grey giving more depth to what could have been a character written with very little to do. James Marsden also brings the overly strict Cyclops truly to life; his back and forth exchanges with the defiant Wolverine are comic genius, and straight out of the comics. Halle Berry may not have been the most economic choice for Storm (as her behaviour regarding the 2 sequels proves) but she does bring a certain credibility and truth to her character. Ray Park also proves that despite being constantly cast for his stunt skills, he most certainly act, playing a truly edgy and gross Toad, who in the comics was a simpering moron. Rebecca Romijn gives a dangerous edge to the shape shifting Mystique, despite almost certainly being cast for her stunning looks, displayed in full glory, as she is never clothed, with only a few tastefully placed scales, leaving tantalisingly little to the imagination. Wrestler Tyler Mane also makes a menacing and genuinely frightening Sabertooth. <br/><br/>But in this cast full of standouts, if one had to pick the single most affecting performance, the only contender is Sir Ian McKellan as the ""humanitarian"" villain Magneto. Again, it only goes to show that good casting counts for so very much: what could have been reduced to a campy, ranting performance by another actor is instead morphed into a dignified, cultured and genuinely angry villain. McKellan seems to build layers of repression and injustice into his very soul, with the truthfulness he projects his hatred for humankind, and their intolerance for anything different from themselves. In fact, if it wasn't for Hugh Jackman's brilliant performance, McKellan would easily walk away with the film unchallenged. As is, the picture still belongs to him, but it's an extremely close thing. The exchanges between Magneto and Wolverine are dynamic; you could swear you feel the very air crackling with intensity. <br/><br/>So in the end, there's really nothing not to love about X-Men - an incredibly truthful, intelligent and relevant script is brought to life in a remarkably tasteful and affecting manner by a truly skilled director. The tremendously capable cast bring their characters to life in a truly satisfying way, and it's all tied together by a truly enjoyable and powerful score by the late Michael Kamen. All in all, the tremendous success of X-Men served to birth other successful superhero films, such as the Spider-Man series and the recent Batman Begins. But even if viewed as a stand alone, X-Men proves a superbly enjoyable and very solidly made film.<br/><br/>-9/10"

It was that exiting. It sound's weired but I've felt a strange kinship to the mutants when I was watching the movie. The story just sucked me in and made me feel that close to the characters. Now that's good story telling.<br/><br/>The casting was perfect. Each character was represented faithfully. It sent shivers up my spine when I saw Cyclops and Storm appear for the first time in the scene. They looked awesome. You have to keep in mind that many of the casts in this movie were little known until they've made it big in this movie, and it takes someone with an eye to recruit all these talents to create a believable X-Men.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer said he had little regret about how the movie came out because he was rushed to make it for the 2000 summer release, but anyone who can manage $75M and turn it into a celluloid gold like this gotta have some talent. First time is always the hardest, and he did a crazy good job in my opinion.<br/><br/>I'm giving this movie a 9 only because I gave 10 to X2 which I felt had better attention to the props, but I would have happily given it a 10 if it wasn't compared to anything else.<br/><br/>A landmark epic in cinema history if you ask me."

","This adaptation of Marvel's mutant super-heroes took many by surprise, building & improving on the success of the first Blade(98) film and paving the way for the most successful Marvel adaptation, Spider-Man(2002). Like the better adaptations of comics properties, this found the core element which defined X-Men's success, especially since 1975, when the books were revamped: a minority within the human race, persecuted by the majority, struggling to overcome prejudice and ignorance.<br/><br/>X-Men, as a comic book, began way back in 1963, but the film depicts a mixture of characters from the sixties and later ones introduced in the seventies. Chief among equals is Wolverine, a loner and anti-hero who may go either way in choosing between 2 sides of the mutant camps, one led by Professor X (Stewart,the benign faction), the other by Magneto (McKellen, the radical side); or, Wolverine may choose neither - he is a loner, after all, and the true X-Factor in this intrigue. The film scored a triumph with casting Hugh Jackman as this bad-tempered mutant in the 11th hour: he was an unknown, complementing the strengths of Wolverine's own character, and fit the role splendidly. He brings a much-needed energy and intensity to the entire picture.<br/><br/>Many viewers regard the sequel, X2, as even superior to this intro, which may be true, but there's a raw energy here that cannot be duplicated in a sequel. Here is where a strange new world was first brought forth to an audience, a ""near-future"" where fantastic beings were a somewhat natural outgrowth of mankind's evolution (if you discount possible influences of the atomic age, which isn't mentioned here). The creation of a whole new world landscape is a daunting prospect, but director Singer and the writers pull it off, using the established comics lore instead of disregarding it.<br/><br/>Of the other characters, McKellen shines as the main villain, making Stewart appear stiff by comparison. Magneto's is a tragic history as shown, more complex than most comics' villains, but he's also a super-powered terrorist and does not engender much sympathy. His henchmen are all fine, with the blue-colored female shape-shifter standing out a bit. Of the heroes, Rogue (Paquin) has the most interesting role besides Jackman. The one area the filmmakers failed in is the Jean Grey/Cyclops romance. This relationship, evolving over the many years in the books, had the capacity for great things on film - Scott & Jean were meant for each other, soul mates if you will. None of this comes across in the film; Jean is made the older woman for some reason, and Marsden, miscast as the brooding Cyclops, lacks any depth. Halle Berry, probably criticized most as Storm, isn't really given a chance to be good or bad in the role; most of the time, you just stare at her apparent beauty.<br/><br/>It was a pretty exciting film. It could have been much worse. All comic book fans at least breathed a sigh of relief afterward."
"say_andy","8","0","0","1 June 2005"," It had me at snikt...
","I've been reading X-Men comics since before my voice got low and girls started getting prettier. I have a solid run of 240 straight, plus hundreds of others from other X-related series. Reading X-Men comics is pretty much the only thing from my old life that I still do. So, when the movie came out, I was ready to geek out as much as any Star Wars fan waiting in line for a prequel.<br/><br/>I was also trepidatious that the movie would stomp all over that which I had loved for years, as Hollywood had done with every other comic book movie to have come out before X-Men. However, I was very hopeful that this one would be different. The reason? Bryan Singer.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer, the director of The Usual Suspects, one of the coolest movies ever. If he couldn't make a good X-Men movie, then it couldn't be done. For years, there had been talk of an X-Men movie, and for years I didn't want it to happen. Then, they got Bryan Singer, and I was cool with it.<br/><br/>When there was talk for years about an X-Men movie, there was always a consensus regarding one person that needed to be cast: Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier. Because no bald cap would do, we needed a real live bald guy! I was surprised he took the role, since he already played one iconic fanboy character, I figured he'd be tired of going to conventions by now. But play Xavier he did, and he did so flawlessly. Singer filled the cast with another esteemed British actor Ian McKellen to play arch-foe Magneto, Oscar winner Anna Paquin as Rogue, big star (and eventual Oscar winner) Halle Berry as Storm, Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, James Marsden as Cyclops, supermodel Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, a wrestler, and Darth Maul. A good blend of solid actors and cheap talent to fill out the cast. Better than Dolph Lundgren as The Punisher, I say.<br/><br/>The only problem was casting the main character. They had someone cast, but he went and broke his hand right before shooting. So, they cast some guy no one's ever heard of, Hugh Jackman, to play the most important role in the movie. And he does so flawlessly. Jackman IS Wolverine, a performance so pitch-perfect that it just might be the best portrayal of a comic book character on film ever. Better than Christopher Reeve as Superman, better than Tobey Maguire as Spider-Man. The first time I saw him on screen, stopping a guy's punch, with the sound of clanging metal echoing through the theatre, I marked out like a guy in a storm trooper outfit seeing Yoda fight Count Dooku. Then, Jackman growls, and sneers, and SNIKTs. He had me at snikt. No, wait, he had me at ""bub"". Or, at ""every time"". Ahhhh... so good.<br/><br/>Singer and co-writers Tom DeSanto and David Hayter do an excellent job in wrangling 40 years of mythology into a manageable 1.5 hour movie. He manages to show each of the 10 main mutants of the film showing off their powers in interesting ways (along with other background mutants like Iceman and Pyro), and hints at larger stories and origins surrounding them. He wisely plays down on some of the larger science-fiction elements of the series mythology, and focuses on the core myth surrounding the X-Men: protecting humans who hate and fear them. It is the most resonate theme of the film and the mythos, and the one that best gives a film purpose.<br/><br/>Sadly, the film is far from perfect. An hour and a half is not long enough to sufficiently develop the characters, leaving the film to operate at a break-neck pace to get its business out of the way. Even with the fast-pacing, it drags during the origin stories portion (or, at least it does for non-fans, it was just fine by me), while the audience awaits the next battle. And, in true comic book fashion, their is some really lame dialogue at times. Not Revenge of the Sith lame, but still pretty lame (""Do you know what happens when a toad is struck by lightning?"" Ugh). Another problem is that favourite characters go underdeveloped or unfeatured (such as my favourite, Cyclops) while the movie focus on Wolverine, Xavier, Magneto, and Rogue. But, those are the choices that need to be made in a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I loved-loved-loved this movie when it came out. Loved the tension between Wolverine and Cyclops. Loved Rogue's longing for human touch. Loved Magneto's handling of the police. And now, watching it 5 years later, I still love it. Of course, I'm seeing it all through my X-Men coloured-glasses. Which are ruby quartz."

","X-MEN <br/><br/>Aspect ratio: 2.39:1 (Panavision)<br/><br/>Sound formats: Dolby Digital / DTS / SDDS<br/><br/>Against a backdrop of social exclusion and intolerance, a new breed of superhuman 'mutants' - ordinary people with extraordinary powers - are forced into a confrontation with supervillain Magneto (Ian McKellen), who plans to launch a devastating assault on the world's non-mutant population.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's magnificent film (based on the Marvel comic book) transcends genre expectations without skimping on the spectacle and melodrama inherent in modern blockbusters. David Hayter's clever script provides an almost entirely character-driven rationale for its flashy set-pieces, and Singer is able to convey a wealth of information at high speed without obscuring the film's primary thematic concerns (tolerance, individuality, finding your own place in the world, etc.).<br/><br/>The performances, too, are uniformly excellent: Stewart and McKellen are unlikely adversaries, but these immensely gifted actors add real depth and nuance to their respective characters. The younger members of the X-Men team (including Halle Berry, Famke Janssen and James Marsden) look suitably spectacular, while Ray Park (Darth Maul himself!), model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos and wrestler Tyler Mane also provide visual fireworks as Magneto's villainous henchmen. Elsewhere, Anna Paquin (THE PIANO) provides the film's emotional core as a young girl targeted by Magneto because of her unique powers, while Hugh Jackman takes center-stage in a star-making role as the most reluctant recruit to Stewart's team of superheroes (his verbal conflicts with rival Marsden are often joyously funny). Production values are predictably solid, betraying little or no evidence of the film's rushed production schedule: Newton Thomas Sigel's scope photography conspires with John Myhre's astute production design to render a silver-blue color scheme that subtly emphasizes the movie's comic-book origins.<br/><br/>While Singer insists the movie's subtext is critical of all forms of intolerance, closer scrutiny suggests more specific concerns about homophobia: Bruce Davison (LONGTIME COMPANION) plays a rabble-rousing politician who frightens Congress with exaggerated 'scare-stories' about a sub-culture they don't understand, while hate-filled protesters gather on the steps outside to wave placards that condemn the 'infiltration' of mutants into schools, churches and society at large. Sound familiar? This interpretation may not have been the central focus of the original comic strip, but Singer's intentions are so conspicuous, and so heartfelt, it's a miracle (and, frankly, a blessing) he was able to get away with it at all. Is this the world's first $70 million dollar 'gay' movie? Not quite, but it provides plenty of food for thought. Followed by X2 (2003)."

","Comic books have always been more about surrealism than action. When Jean Paul Satre wrote about being chased around Paris's streets by giants crustaceans they gave him a Nobel prize for literature, but if you write a story about a person who dresses up as a spider or a bat to fight crime you are considered somehow low brow.<br/><br/>X-men was the first comic book to change that. It arrived a time in American history when issues such as race where still being debated seriously and the future of humanity was first seen to be in the balance.<br/><br/>The X-men, who were mutants with powers were doing what humans do, making choices about how to use their new power. Do they use it for good or ill. Even if you have read a lot of other comic books you will see this exact same story line copied over and over again.<br/><br/>So the movie X-men starts on the moral heights, by showing us the depth of human depravity; the Nazi death camps for Jews. Here we meet Magneto and there is little more that needs to looked into to understand his character.<br/><br/>The brilliance of this movie continues. Particular by focusing on Wolverine, one of the most loved characters in the X-men series. He is like many of the favourite comic book characters, he doesn't really want to take sides. However he is not a bad person and will fight for those he cares about, rather than causes and purposes. He is most like us in this respect.<br/><br/>Through his eyes we learn about the X-men and what they hope to do. He is a fun character and gets all the best lines. All the hero work and best fights are down to him as well.<br/><br/>I love super hero stories because it is the great metaphor for the scientific age. We are now gods and we have to choose to make the world better or maybe we can spend our time caring about whether we have cool clothes and an i-pod.<br/><br/>Having read the original movie script online I can see the difference between the final product and the original. It is a pity they didn't put as much time or effort into X-2."

His performance in BFO was outstanding and he won the much coveted Tony award for his outstanding performance together with other awards - The Fred Astaire award for dancing for example. He was also nominated for the Lawrence Olivier award for Oklahoma.<br/><br/>However, I digress - I was only able to obtain a DVD player last Xmas and my son gave me quite a stack of films to watch with all top notch actors. However, knowing I did like science fiction he pointed out that I would really enjoy X-Men and X-Men 2. So I thought okay I will watch that first - after all Patrick Stewart was in it. Well I nearly fell off my chair - rubbed my eyes - and watched all over again. There large as life was Hugh Jackman in a film, shows you how dozy I was I had assumed he was a stage actor visiting England and involved in Broadway only BIG MISTAKE I MADE. Look what I had been missing for ages.<br/><br/>What a great evening that was for me and I thoroughly enjoyed the film and say that it was very well put together and the stars acted their roles with conviction. But, Hugh Jackman with his great talent did more with Wolverene - very clever on characterisation is our Hugh - and gave us many faces to this character like love, humour,with good one liners, the tortured mind of not knowing who he was and why he had become the way he was - he made me think that he was in fact a good guy completely taken over by evil but would not quit till he found out who he was and how he would put his life back together again. The fighting scenes were excellent -but I do hope that the directors out there give him a fair chance - he leaps out of the screen and makes you notice him either with strength or gentleness, dramatically, pathos - you name it.<br/><br/>Well off I went and bought as many of his films as I could - which was not easy but I only need Paperback Heroes and Standing Room Only and I am waiting for his next film which I hope will give him the box office acclaim he so richly deserves<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing this young man in some exciting roles that can test his acting strengths - and he will deliver and we will not only have a mega star to watch but a damn handsome fella as well.<br/><br/>Deadly Hedley"
"andrew6g","9","0","0","23 October 2004"," Could be worse, but could be so much better (SPOILERS)
","X-men is an interesting enough movie, but unlike movies like batman and spiderman it has to focus on the whole team, leaving individuals slightly down-sized. There are a few interesting action sequences like at the train station and at the Statue Of Liberty. sadly though, for a movie about mutants, they don't show off their powers much. The casting of Magneto and Xavier was a master-stroke but the other characters just don't work out the same. Storm is seemingly almost completely ignored and sadly stays the same in the sequel.<br/><br/>Overall: Could have been worse, could have been much better. 2.75 out of 5."

","I'm a big fan of everything Marvel, so I had high hopes for the X-Men. Needless to say, it live up to my expectations, though apparently not to those of many critics. <br/><br/>It had its strong points. I always enjoy when there's a strong verisimilitude, that is, the integration of fictional elements into a very real feeling world. These were particularly strong with the opening scene, as well as Senator Kelly's speech. And the special effects were perfectly satisfactory for the film.<br/><br/>One issue people may have had was how much more there was of a story and less usage of their powers, etc. Well, I feel that the X-Men is really more about the human element, and the powers are not so much gifts, but curses that they have to learn to live with, just as the people who are anti-mutant have to learn to live with mutants. <br/><br/>If there was one weak point, it was the running time. But for a potential Saga-starter, it seems almost perfect. Not too long, just enough to give us a taste and leave us wanting more, then swoop in with an exceptional sequel and fulfill our desires. I highly recommend this to comic fans and movie fans alike."

","I learnt to read on Xmen comics (not cartoon for Pete's sake!). I can see you rolling your eyes at the statement, 'how can she be objective', right? Well... when I learnt they were finally shooting it after talking about it for years, I decided I wouldn't go see it! A bunch of muscle men and models in tights fighting bad guys around... no thanks... I've seen Batman! To me, no one could or would make the effort to capture the essence of what set Xmen comics apart from others anyway: the family spirit within the team, the metaphoric crystallization of hatred and intolerance as a defence mechanism thru the 'mutants' storyline, deep three dimensional bad guys.<br/><br/>When I saw the trailer, I was... mildly curious. No tights, no 'widely known faces', the action seemed reasonable but not designed to overrule the story. After I saw it, I thanked whatever God is responsible for Bryan Singer and his remarkable translation of the characters and story on screen. Sure, Rogue could kick ass a little more but using her and Wolverine to introduce the audience to the mutant world (with skepticism and subtlety) was a great idea.<br/><br/>Casting is nearly flawless. Jackman is tough and expressive. With few lines and a rather small part, ex-model Famke Janssen proves yet again she is a real actress (who will hopefully explode in X3 as the Phoenix). Stewart and McKellen give life to the memorable old friends/ennemies relationship. My only regret is Halle Berry in the part of Storm. Angela Bassett would have made a Goddess out of the rather simplified movie character in no time.<br/><br/>It was believable, touching, entertaining and left you wanting more! What else can you ask from an action movie?<br/><br/>Kudos Mr Singer!"
"timmyfish","8","0","0","25 September 2004"," action sci-fi, with a twist of human interest
","As an X-men-enthusiast from Holland, I find that people underestimate the message that something so clearly unrealistic can convey. Sure, the science of it all is nonsense, nothing about it is real. Except for the characters. A good writer can take an unrealistic story and turn it in to a reflection on the human condition, like Orwell and Huxley. X-men is essentially about racism, bitterness, the corrupting influence of power, and the fact that altruism isn't easy. People will not hesitate to judge you before they know you, despite your personal efforts. The first thing that I liked about the movie was that it succeeded in shedding the comic-book image. The characters were neither pretentious nor over-the-top, they gained a dimension. Ian Mckellen's role as the bitter, machiavellian mutant, is a brilliant creation. If you were oppressed, wouldn't you try to prevent it from happening again? Even if that means oppressing or killing someone else? I've never been in his shoes, but his ""by any means necessary""-attitude is not helping mutantkind. Let alone the world. He is a man who believes in what he's doing, because he thinks that if he doesn't, the world will never be a safe place for mutants. He's not a villain out to conquer the world, he thinks he's saving his race. I like to think this is a subtle reference to the understandable, but utterly counterproductive feud between the Israeli and Palestinian peoples. Perhaps a call to end all wars based on historical retaliation? Hugh Jackman is great as the lone man without a past, Wolverine (his snappy one-liners come across, even with the bad hair day!). I also liked the fact that Anna Paquin's Rogue is not the token Southern Belle with the Superman-act like in the comic, but a shy girl, as one would expect. Being handicapped myself, it's nice to see a guy in a wheelchair run the show. After seeing Kevin Spacey in the Usual Suspects, Bryan Singer is my hero, the patron-director of all those, who are physically impaired! Jean-Luc... eh, Patrick Stewart IS the Big Wise Guy. It's always interesting to see how the bad guys outsmart the greatest psychic in the world, too. Like all characters, ""Wheels"" is just a human being, in spite of his awe-inspiring feats of mind- control. Now for the embarrassing part. Storm is supposed to be a leader, a bad-ass chick who knife-fights, and rips out hearts if she has to. Sorry Halle, but the one-liners do NOT work for you. That is the only thing I wished they hadn't changed. The rest of the adaptation really added depth to the universe of X-men. All of the other Marvel-movies are eclipsed by this milestone in Superhero-cinema. And the sequel was even better!"

","Mutants with all sorts of powers like lasers that come out of their eyes and claws that come out of their hands are set loose in this fantastic comic book adaptation. I would normally yawn at this type of film but I actually really enjoyed it. It must have been because I liked the characters; in some films the characters just can't be related to, so it's difficult to enjoy the film. X-men has a fantastic cast too, with Hugh Jackman as a fine Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as a fine Professor X. Halle Berry is adequate as Storm and Ian McKellen is a sufficiently malicious Magneto. It is also worth seeing this film for its climatic action scenes and appealing special effects (look out for Mystique's transformation powers too). All in all I think that Bryan Singer has done a very good job, and has made a very watchable film. Enjoy! 8/10"

"whizkids","8","0","0","7 September 2004"," Great movie. Just be careful. (spoiler)
","This is an awesome ride. The movie has great characters and actors to play them. Ian McKellen as Magneto was very good, and Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier was a very smart thing on their end to do, I think. Hugh Jackman played the role of Wolverine to very near perfection. (ending with the list of characters there)<br/><br/>The action is great, and the effects are decent. They have this one part (spoiler here) where they pit Wolverine against Mystique while in Logan's (Wolverine's) form. They did that so well. However, the whole movie is not innocent. Besides the action and typical profanities in movies today, there are some other problems. There is some crass mention of male genitalia. Logan uses one of his claws to give Cyclops the finger (while this may fly over the heads of many people, those who do catch it may have a problem with it). Toad also has some gross powers. Like when he throws that stuff Jean's face, those who know what it is (check out its color) may get a little queasy knowing just how sticky and strong it is. But the biggest problem in my opinion is Mystique's figure. I know that scientifically speaking, this is more sound then what the comics have, but she is very nearly totally naked. They put on just enough prosthetics and had most of her scenes dark enough so as to get by with PG-13 rating. Barely, though. <br/><br/>So overall, I still love this movie. It's a great action/sci-fi/fantasy movie (fantasy because evolution is an unproven theory and it's a bogus theory). But just make sure you watch out for the crudities of this movie."

"LunaRaven","Null","0","0","5 August 2004"," My comments on X-men, the first movie.
","As you may know from reading my Spiderman 2 review, I am not very fond of comic books besides Batman. But I have to admit this movie was okay. I am not new to the X-men universe nor have been for a while. Like I said, with two comic book crazed sisters(X-men in particular)you can't help but pick up a few things or little shards of information. The visual effects were okay, I didn't hear much music, but for me the plot was a bit dull. I was not very fond of the whole 'mutant' thing. But, now that I have gotten into it more it truly doesn't matter to me. I think they could have started it out a bit differently, maybe have gotten a better actress for Rouge. For me the biggest error was the newer in-correct toad and the Bobby/Rouge romance. Also, I'm not saying Halle Berry is a horrible actress but she just wasn't the right one for Storm. The best actor choices were Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen. I love seeing scenes with both of those brilliant actors in them. Overall out of ten I'd give this movie a seven. The best thing I can say about this is that most of the errors go away when you see Ian Mckellen play our favorite villain Magneto."
"colonel_green","9","0","0","9 August 2004"," The start of a new era of comic book movies.
","In the year 2000, the comic book movie was all but dead; the but being the ""Blade"" movies.  Director Joel Schumacher, in making the spectacular flop of ""Batman and Robin"", had seemingly doomed the genre.  But a new champion arose, a Marvel champion, in the form of director Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"". Long had Marvel been bequeathed the short end of the stick, with DC Comics making all the successful movies.  The box office success of ""X-Men"" opened the doors to sequels, adaptations of ""Spider-Man"", ""The Hulk"", ""Daredevil"", ""The Fantastic Four"", ""Punisher"", and spurred DC's efforts to revive its ailing ""Batman"" and ""Superman"" franchises. Singer, more of an arthouse filmmaker than a commercial one, had assembled an all but perfect cast to play his legendary comic book characters. Patrick Stewart (a personal favourite, since I count myself a diehard Trekker) as Professor Xavier, the mutant who sought cooperation; Ian McKellen (soon to play Gandalf) as his opposite number Magneto, who believed mutants must make their own way; breakout star Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, haunted by flashes of his unknown past; Anna Paquin as Rogue, the girl for whom physical interaction with others was impossible; Famke Janssen as Jean Grey, Xavier's telekinetic right hand; James Marsden as Cyclops, the brave field commander of the X-Men; Bruce Davison as the misguided McCarthyite Senator Kelly, who saw the light before his end; Rebecca Romijn as Magneto's henchman, Mystique; and, perhaps the only fly in the ointment, Halle Berry as weather god Storm. And for all of this, X-Men is only an average film.  It isn't nearly as action-heavy as most comic book movies, and it is burdened by introducing so many characters.  I rate it a 7/10. But for all its flaws, it revolutionized the comic book movie genre, making the making of greater films (like its sequel, X2) possible."

","One of the best comic book movies created. This has since spawned a superior sequel but this really set the scene. There is a great bunch of interesting characters played well and in Hugh Jackman Hollywood has a potential new action man who can also act. While the action can sometimes not have the punch many fans would like it is still good and fairly big scale but you can't help feel that the makers were reigned in for this outing. The story is interesting and the characters are likeable. Ian Mckellan is superb and he makes his lines very memorable with his delivery. Patrick Stewart is perfectly cast and also like Mckellan really gives the film a class that many comic book adaptations lack. Hugh Jackman is superb as the charismatic and interesting Wolverine while Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin also impress. Many fans may feel disappointed at Cyclops miscasting and limited role, although he is somewhat rectified in the sequel. The ending doesn't quite thrill as much as it could, but this is still a worthy movie to watch. ***"
"fj202","Null","0","0","12 July 2004"," Final scene pure genius - here's why!?
","The emotionally powerful introduction in the concentration camp is matched by the finale which confirms there was more to this film than just green screen acting and CGI. The film deals with the treatment of minorities in democratic societies and this is singer's most explicit demonstration of his philosophy. Magneto is clearly the Malcolm X character here and Xavier is the robust Martin Luther King. The finale scene is pure genius, and heres why. Before this film neither actor (Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart) knew how to play chess. Singer hired a local chess master to teach them - in order to symbolize Xaviers superiority over his rival he employs whats known as a pawn assault (gaining check mate using only his weakest piece) - Singer's mastery of the technical and emotional side of the story is the key to this films success."

","Having never seen a comic book adaptation at the cinema, I settled into my seat and expected a few hours of pretty soul less antics. Many had tried to put one over the greatest comic book movie of all time, Superman The Movie, but where that film had heart, verisimilitude and great effects. Most of the others only seemed to succeed at the 'great effects' part. How this presumption was shattered. Right from the get go it calmly faded in to a World War 2 camp and we see Eric (Magneto) as a child, using his powers. The look of horror on the faces of the army men is subtle, yet brilliant. Then we go to the present day and the film just gets better and better. With Wolverine, we have one of the best movie characters of all time. Hugh Jackman is absolutely superb. Anna Paquin is wonderful too, playing a teenager who's tormented by her changing bodily functionssomething everyone can relate to when growing up. Overall, this movie simply kicks ass. I came out of the cinema and it was the first time I had ever left the auditorium and wanted to walk straight back in for the next showing. It was that good! Since the release, many have complained that the action scenes don't really deliverbut the beauty of this film is that first and foremost, it makes you care for the characters. When these are put in the tiniest bit of peril, you want them to succeed. So although the set pieces may not be as hard core as some people had liked. It didn't really need them to be and when you take into consideration that the budget wasn't exactly large, it shows that the director had his priorities right. 5 Stars out of Five!"

After ""Spider-Man"" had really impressed me and I had learned that ""X-Men"" had a ranking of 7.3 on IMDb I decided to give it a chance. Well, it paid. Unbelievable that this was done by the same director who also made ""Trainspotting"". The characters were very believable (for comic characters) and the story was quite thrilling. Anyway, if Hollywood listened to what I say, I'd tell them to stop here and not continue the recent comic book-movie-overkill. Unfortunately, Hollywood never listened to what I said."

","I know I'm probably in the minority with this view, but I found the original X-Men movie more enjoyable than the second outing. I find it better because of the introduction to all the characters and a more rounded storyline. When one of the lead characters bites the dust at the end of the second movie I couldn't help thinking that they'll be back in X3 so why should I really care.<br/><br/>Anyway back to X-Men which is set in the present day and focuses on a new breed of humans who have mutant powers. The mutations take various forms which means the mutants have just about every power you could imagine. The ""normal"" humans are somewhat uncomfortable and take the forlorn decision to marginalise the mutants. The mutants themselves are split into two bands the goodies being led by Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the baddies led by Magneto (Ian McKellen). Most of the action is focussed on Wolverine (Weaving) and the film is good fun. 8/10"

While they tried, they fell short of what I would deem acceptable in this area.<br/><br/>Other than that, this movie was very well done. The action sequences were rousing, the portrayals given were a good start in the right direction.

"eamon-hennedy","10","0","0","17 November 2003"," Fantastic Adaptation!
","Adapted from the most popular comic book on the planet and starring two Shakespearian actors, a virtually unknown Australian and directed by a man better known for a dark, edgy crime thriller, this really shouldn't be good, but it is. In fact it is fantastic. From beginning to end Bryan Singer makes what has to be one of the best comic book adaptations to hit the screen in years, perhaps the finest since Tim Burton brought Batman to the screen in 1989. What works so well here are the factors that should bring the film crashing down. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is fantastic, showing what a great star he could make. His perfect American accent and the wonderful dark edge, mixed in with humor and sincerity for Rogue make him the most perfect choice for the character.<br/><br/>In fact casting here is perfect, which is a miracle for a comic book that is not made up of one primary superhero like Superman, Batman and Spiderman are. X-Men is an ensemble and Singer casts actors perfectly in their parts. Patrick Stewart is undeniably the only actor who could play Professor X, likewise Ian McKellen as Magneto. Anna Paquin shows what a talent she can be in her more older years as Marie/Rogue, while Famke Janssen adds the glamorous as Doctor Jean Grey. The remaining X Men characters of Scott/Cyclops and Monroe/Storm are played well enough by James Marsden and Halle Berry, but don't really get a chance to shine in the same way as the others do, mainly due to the fact that the script has to accommodate so many characters, but that's why this film works so well. Singer and writer David Hayter have saw fit not to bombard the film with action sequences and flashy special effects, they let the characters come to life, have the audience care for them and when they have done that, then they bring out the action in the shape of the Statue of Liberty finale.<br/><br/>As the first part of a movie series, X-Men works a wonderful treat. The script is strong, the acting is first class and Bryan Singer's direction of the actors is fantastic as are his visual touches, which are very similar to comic book framing. Actors are film to one side of the frame while the remainder is taken up with the background. Touches like this show what a great director he is visually. Even better the action is brilliantly handled. The Liberty finale features a storming fight sequence between Logan and shape-shifter Mistique, who has taken the form of Logan himself. It is a fun sequence that is also gripping.<br/><br/>Scarcely a foot is put wrong in this superb film which ranks as one of my favorite comic book adaptations."

","This is a pretty decent film, though I probably wouldn't have enjoyed it so much without having seen the second one first.  Director Bryan Singer tries too hard to explain the characters to what he must assume is a very confused audience--for example, after Mystique has already established that she's a shapeshifter (by doing exactly that), Magneto mocks Senator Kelly by smirking, ""I've had Mystique here to keep you company.  She takes so many shapes.""  This isn't really necessary--and I'm speaking as someone who knew next to nothing about the X-men.  The other issue I have with this film is that Sabretooth is boring and Wolverine is an irritating jerk.  Yes, I know, he's supposed to be--but couldn't he have been rude without being so annoying?  All in all, it's a halfway decent movie--not nearly as great as X2, which focuses on plot rather than backstory."

","X-Men succeeds where so many other movies that are based on comic books fail. They don't stay true to the original story or look. Although this is hard to do with a film, Bryan Singer and the cast of X-Men have done it. X-Men may not feature all of the X-men, but those that do make it to the screen do not fail to impress. The best mutant and best acting by far is by Wolverine as played by Hugh Jackman. Jackman makes the character his own and I can't see anyone else playing the role. Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, Ian McKellen, and Patrick Stewart all turn in flawless performances, lending depth to their characters without decending into camp. The special effects are dazzling and the cinematography helps make this film candy for the eyes. With the success and quality of it's sequel and no end in sight, I smell a franchise on the way. Bottom Line: X-Men is a great movie hands down. You need to have this in your collection if you like comic books or action/Sci-Fi movies."

","Bryan Singer and an exceptional cast far exceed my expectations with this big screen translation of the famous comic. At first I had serious doubts about the look, the actors and the script. But once I saw the movie I realized that certain aspects of the comic had to be sacrificed for the story to be believably set, in film, in our reality. Yellow spandex wouldn't work(as cleverly pointed out in the movie). Ian McKellen, while my favorite actor, wasn't my first choice. However he excels at his role. As always.<br/><br/>
If everyone wanted this movie to exactly mirror the comic, then it should have been a cartoon. As it is, this was supposed to be ""real life"" and certain realities had to be maintained. All in all, an excellent movie that far surpassed my expectations. Cheers to the cast and crew."

","Stan Lee's adaptation of the famous comic book series has come to life in bigger ways than ever imagine. Throughout the years, the X-Men, like any of the Marvel comics have touched people in a way that we recognized: Discrimination. As mutants, they are discriminated for who they are without people giving them a chance to live in society.<br/><br/>The film starts in Poland of 1942, the beginning of the holocaust where as many of the Jews are being sentenced to live in concentration camps to die, a young boy by the name of Eric discovers that he can control metallic objects with his own hands as he tries to reunite with his parents but after years of being torture and escaping the holocaust, he grows up to be Magneto (an older Eric played by Ian McKellan) who wants to tell his old friend and rival Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) that he wants to destroy mankind after what humanity has down to him and those of generations.<br/><br/>Later on through the film fans are introduced through the following characters: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman); Storm (Halle Berry); Cyclops (James Marsden); Jean Gray (Famke Janssen); Rogue (Anna Paquin); Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); Mystique (Rebecca Rojimn Stamos); and Todd (Ray Park).<br/><br/>The film itself plays true to the comic book where mutants are fighting to survive in a world of prejudice and anger. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) is the head of Westchester Academy, a school for the gifted and talented, but a school for the young who have special mutant powers; from a girl who can walk through walls, a boy who can manipulate with fire, and another student who can turn objects into ice. His former students (Storm, Cyclops and Jean Gray) assist Professor Xavier in teaching those kids who can't afford to be taught by normal people. Professor Xavier also takes in a new student, Rogue (Paquin) who was abandoned and taken in by Wolverine (newcomer Hugh Jackman) who was attacked by one of Magneto's own mutant named Sabertooth (Mane). Yet, Xavier makes a promise to Wolverine that he will do whatever it can to find out what Magneto wants with him.<br/><br/>Magneto (McKellan) has his own team called ""The Brotherhood"" consisting of evil mutants (Mystique, Toad and Sabertooth) where he wants to kill all those who treated humanity evil, especially Sen. Kelly (Bruce Davidson) who wants to run the registration on mutants where they would be targeted down to death.<br/><br/>The film itself is incredible, the cast is hot, and I was glad to see that somebody brought the idea of X-Men to live and with all of the actors being true to the characters."

"jaywolfenstien","Null","0","0","18 June 2003"," Good Live Action Comic Book
","As I said in my Spiderman review, making a film based on a comic book is like shooting yourself in the foot.  Do you cater to the guys who not only know all the X-men's storylines, they also know the issue, the artist, the writer, and all the personal stats with given staff.  Or do you cater to the guys who've never heard of the X-men?<br/><br/>Usually the best bet is to shoot somewhere in the middle . . . give just enough for newcomers to grasp the plot and characters and lace the rest of the film with subtleties and references that the hardcore fans will pick up on.  This is where the X-men film falls, and Bryan Singer has found a pretty good blend of the two.<br/><br/>The other major issue is changing things while crossing over from one media to another.  Films don't have the luxury, liberty, and scope a comic book universe has.  Liberties have been taken with the X-Men world, some a little disappointing (Rogue's inability to fly and strength, Sabretooth's role) while others are appropriate (we don't have yellow and blue spandex outfits).  Typically, things have been left alone wherever the filmmakers can get away with it on this medium.<br/><br/>The casting was very well done.  Though people I didn't like ironically are for characters I never liked (Cyclops for example).  Ray Park surprisingly makes Toad an interesting character, even though I've never really cared much for his character enough to read too deep into his character. Jackman, Mckellen, Stewart, Jensen, fill their roles well.  I personally loved seeing the live action standoffs between old friends/rivals Magneto and Xavier; i've always been fascinated with that conflict for some reason, and it is very accurately reportrayed for the film.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's direction and visual style, while definitely comic-book oriented, it's not ""campy"" or ""cheesy"".  It's surreal, but it's as though the real world is only tinted to a slightly different perspective unlike Batman and Robin where the spectrum is screwed over and the word ""CAMP"" is practically written across the screen the full 2 hours.<br/><br/>
Special Effects are pretty decent, mutant powers pretty well accounted for (though, not to the extent as they are in the books . . . but again, different medium).  The plot I think all people can pick up on, and I think hardcore fans can see these characters playing it out.<br/><br/>
And music provided by veteran composer Michael Kamen, whose themes surrounding Magneto, Rogue, Wolverine, Cerebro, are haunting with a romantic flair that few composers can tap into.  Kamen really taps into the heart of the conflicts, and doesn't go overboard with a cheesy X-men theme.  It's heroic, but not over the top.<br/><br/>Overall, this production does really good with what it has.  Definitely worth looking into.  The only real flaw I have with the film is the kiddie nature of it--""I have claws that come out of my hands, but I never really kill anyone with 'em and you never really see any blood.""  Kinda like the old A-Team shows where there'd be lots of gunfights but no one ever gets shot.  Make the movie for adults, and it'd be as perfect as a comic book film can get."
"alainenglish","Null","0","0","18 June 2003"," Good balance of character and action (spoilers)
","Having now spawned a hit sequel (the first, so it has been said, of many more), the original ""X-Men"" film possesses a solid balance of action sequences and well-rounded characterisation.  Director Bryan Singer has cleverly crafted the story as an allegory for prejudice and racism that still exists in modern America.<br/><br/>The film begins in World War II in a Nazi concentration camp where a young boy, segregated from his parents by German soldiers, causes hysteria when he discovers an ability to manipulate and weld metal with his bare hands.<br/><br/>Flash forward into the near future, and the US Senate is debating a motion detailing the segragation of 'mutants' - human beings born with special abilities or powers.  Overseeing this debate is Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), an aged telepath who believes that mutants and humans can peacefully co-exist.  The good Professor runs a school where young mutants learn to develop and control their unique abilities.  Also keeping watch is his old friend Erik Lensherr/Magneto (Ian McKellen).  Magneto does not share the Professor's beliefs and is all too aware of the corruption and cruelty of the human race, as experienced during his time as child prisoner of the Nazis.  In this, he devises an ingenious plan which he hopes will teach humanity a lesson...<br/><br/>The storyline and writing are excellent, taking the Professor and Magneto as two individuals conceiving two vastly different solutions to the same problems of fear and prejudice.  Where as the Professor believes in a peaceful resolution and contented co-existence, the bitter Magneto practices hate and revenge.  Loosely tied in with this is the role politics plays in creating the kind of atmosphere and social climate that produces individuals like Magneto.  The story is carefully laid out and structured and the ending leaves more than one loose thread hanging for tying up in future films.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are all enjoyable and distinctive.  Patrick Stewart is quietly dignified as the Professor, and Ian MacKellen gives a very sympathetic portrayal of Magneto.  You do feel for him, in spite of his actions.  Australian Hugh Jackman plays Wolverine, who heals fast and sprouts slashing metal blades from his hands.  Wolverine is a hard-bitten but sympathetic loner with a mysterious past who functions as the film's answer to Han Solo, providing a line in both sex appeal and wise-cracking humour.  Anna Paquin is Rogue, who can drain the life out of anyone she touches.  Paquin conveys well the confused and vulnerable aspects of this character.<br/><br/>Other notable characters include Famke Janssen as telepathic Jean Grey and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as seductive, chameleonic mutant Mystique, although we could have explored James Marsden's Cyclops and Ray Park's Toad a little bit more.  ""Star Wars"" fans will be quick to spot a nod to Park's turn as Darth Maul in ""The Phantom Menace"" in this movie.<br/><br/>Special effects and action sequences are kept restrained but good set-pieces include a fight in a bar, a sequence at a train station and the finale atop the Statue of Liberty.  The sequences make good and convincing use of flo-mo and CGi effects.<br/><br/>Along with ""Spider-Man"", released two years later, this is a fine modern example of how to make a fantasy action picture entertaining and exciting without compromising the need for characterisation.  A pity this film's sequel did not follow it's predecessor's example."

","Having never seen a comic book adaptation at the cinema, I settled into my seat and expected a few hours of pretty soul less antics. Many had tried to put one over the greatest comic book movie of all time, Superman The Movie, but where that film had heart, verisimilitude and great effects. Most of the others only seemed to succeed at the `great effects' part. How this presumption was shattered. Right from the get go it calmly faded in to a World War 2 camp and we see Eric (Magneto) as a child, using his powers. The look of horror on the faces of the army men is subtle, yet brilliant. Then we go to the present day and the film just gets better and better. With Wolverine, we have one of the best movie characters of all time. Hugh Jackman is absolutely superb. Anna Paquin is wonderful too, playing a teenager who's tormented by her changing bodily functions.something everyone can relate to when growing up. Overall, this movie simply kicks ass. I came out of the cinema and it was the first time I had ever left the auditorium and wanted to walk straight back in for the next showing. It was that good! Since the release, many have complained that the action scenes don't really deliver.but the beauty of this film is that first and foremost, it makes you care for the characters. When these are put in the tiniest bit of peril, you want them to succeed. So although the set pieces may not be as hard core as some people had liked. It didn't really need them to be and when you take into consideration that the budget wasn't exactly large, it shows that the director had his priorities right. 5 Stars out of Five!"

","*** out of ****<br/><br/>I used to be an avid reader of the X-men comics.  Every month, I'd dash to the comic book store, eager to purchase the newest issues (the X-men had two running series) of this clashing team of mutants.  Like everyone else, I had my favorite characters; Wolverine, for his interesting anti-hero but honorable qualities, and Psylocke, who simply oozed sex appeal, intelligence, and could alternately kick any guy's ass in hand-to-hand combat.  What more could you want from a lady?<br/><br/>But I wasn't completely sold on the movie when I first heard of it, particularly with unknown Hugh Jackman in the lead. So it was with cautionary anticipation I approached this film.  Hell, I was so cautious I didn't even see it until it came out on DVD, but in the end, this was an enjoyable hour-and-a-half diversion, and probably the best comic book to film adaptation since Tim Burton's Batman.<br/><br/>As expected, X-Men spends a large portion of its running time as a set-up, for both its characters and future plotlines.  But for those curious, Patrick Stewart stars as Professor Charles Xavier, virtually the world's most powerful mutant with the ability to read and control minds.  He heads a school to teach other mutants to develop their powers, the heads of the classes being Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), and Storm (Halle Berry).  Two newcomers arrive after an attack in the woods, Logan AKA Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paquin).  Their enemy is Magneto, a powerful mutant who wishes to make the world a place safe for mutants, even if it means the destruction of the human race.<br/><br/>Almost all comic book adaptations are action/adventures, and while X-men certainly qualifies as such, many might be surprised that the movie spends more time developing its characters than placing them in dangerous situations.  I was pleasantly surprised, and given that these characters were interesting, the pacing never flagged and the build-up to the action-packed finale kept the film moving with surging momentum.<br/><br/>In a movie like this, the cast is probably the most important aspect of the production, and the two most important characters to cast were Professor Xavier and Wolverine.  Screw up casting these two roles and the whole movie might have been in jeopardy.  But thankfully, the producers didn't screw up, and these two parts were casted perfectly.  Patrick Stewart makes for an honorable and gentle Xavier, exactly the way everyone imagined he would be (it's not as if though casting Stewart was ever question of if, but when, he actually looks like Xavier).  Hugh Jackman is the real find, totally cool and badass as Wolverine, but also with a down-to-earth quality that makes him so appealing.  I think we're all glad production on M:I-2 ran overlong, or else we'd have seen Dougray Scott in this part.<br/><br/>Though I did mention the film spent most of its time developing the characters, the fact the cast is so large leaves a lot of them adrift, most particularly James Marsden as Cyclops and Halle Berry as Storm.  Janssen is a passable Jean Grey, though she seems a bit too old for the part.  Anna Paquin, however, is very good as Rogue, a teen who finds herself coming to terms with her powers.  She and Logan have this daughter/father relationship going, which means she also has the double role of the character Jubilee, who's actually nowhere to be seen (which might be a good thing, I recall she was incredibly annoying in the comics).<br/><br/>The villains don't fare as well, each of them barely given any dialogue except for Magneto.  As the master of the metal, Ian Mckellen is fine, but looks hilariously silly in that costume and helmet of his.  Tyler Mane has the physique for the part of Sabretooth, that's about it.  Ray Park has the role of Toad, who's a bit different from how I remember him in the comics (didn't he secrete gunk from his hands?), but it's only slightly less lame. Rebecca Romjin-Stamos is in blue make-up for all her screen-time as the shape-shifting Mystique.<br/><br/>The action sequences are exciting without ever being truly memorable.  In fact, some of the fight scenes could have been staged and filmed a bit better, but it's understandable why filming such fights would have been difficult, considering these mutants battle with a variety of powers.  The wirework during the Wolverine/Sabretooth battle is...lacking, maybe a little too Matrix-ish for my tastes.<br/><br/>The only real problem I have (and it's a biggie) with X-Men is how unbelievably short it is.  Most comic book adaptations focus on one character and run for over two hours.  This one's got over a dozen, and it's barely an hour-and-a-half (sans credits) long!  Too much feels left out, too much is left unfinished, but I guess that's why we have sequels."

But this film certainly has made me enjoy the X-men more.<br/><br/>It wasn't until earlier this year that I came to like this movie. See when I first saw it in the theaters and pretty much everything in the film had been shown to me from numerous ""making of"" specials in TV and I was angry because I beleved a rumor that there was 45 minutes taken out of the film. So I thought the film was OK. But over the years I saw this movie in the theater once again and then a few times on video. I finally bought it on DVD and then it all clicked on how to look at this film. This film is basically a semi-serious sci-fi film, using comic book material.<br/><br/>When the film first came out it was kind of odd to see such serious themes of prejudice and love triangles in comic book films. But with the new wave of comic book films like Spider-man and Daredevil, applying real human themes to people with superpowers isn't odd anymore.<br/><br/>Now when I watch this film I notice how good it actually is. The fact that it can even balance and hold so many lead characters is a marvel (no pun intended). The actors were supurb and in the little suttle things they did we could tell so much about their characters. There are no one-sided characters for those who look. I give most credit to Anna Paquin who portrayed the sad story of Rouge, who do to her powers would never be able to physically touch anyone again.<br/><br/>I also love how the film is filled with unexpected ""cameos"" from other mutants. You can have a lot of fun trying to guess if that girl with the yellow coat in the background is Jubilee or if that fat kid is The Blob.<br/><br/>X-men should be credited with not only being the film that started the new wave of comic book movies, but also as one of the most entertaining films to be based off a graphic novel."

Patrick Stewart was excellent too, the director of casting did a great job, nobody could have done that role better than him. Hugh Jackman was pretty good as Wolverine too, just like in the comics, a bad-a$$ guy with a bad attitude, but with good intentions.  Anna Pakin was great as Rogue too, she was still insecure of her abilities and she shows her emotions (fear, insecurity) very well.  James Marsden was ok as Cyclops, he could have done way better though.  <br/><br/>I was a little dissapointed not to see some of my favorite X-men in the movie, like Gambit, thus movie would have been even better if Gambit would have been in the story.  <br/><br/>Well the plot is great, the dialogs are even better, some people say they were cheesy, I really don't think so, or maybe it was that the performance was so good that I don't even noticed.  The music was very good too, and also the direction.<br/><br/>Well I definitely loved this movie, it's one of the greatest movies that come from a comic (especial mention to Superman I & II, Batman I & II, and Spider-man).

It deals with the fact that these mutants are outcast from society and considered dangerous, second class citizens by the majority of the non-mutant society. While really they are just people trying to cope with their differences and trying to make it in an unaccepting world. Throw in a couple of bad guys and it makes for some good action.

","I was satisfied when I saw X-men, I was expecting more but was satisfied with this first live action film. Just for once I wish they would just say to hell with it and make it a rated R flick like it should be. Why because most of the time PG-13 action can get rather boring. For example, when Wolverine fought Mystique(the longest fight in the entire movie), it didn't have that impact as in the comics but the sequences appeared rather slow and dull. It's disappointing of how they misrepresented Wolverine who in the comic long before he even met the X-men was a warrior and assassin but in the movie as a weak untrained fool. The movie started out pretty interesting then it dragged, and the ending wasn't that great either. I think they should've stuck to the original comic team of Cyclops, Beast, Archangel, Jean Grey, Iceman, and Wolverine. Better to have the original instead of nitpicking and trying to fit in characters who don't even belong in the same place and era like for example Rogue who happens to look like a teenager! Also Sir Ian M. is a little too old to be playing Magneto. I just hope the sequel will be a major step up with longer more intense fight sequences and less boring chit chat. 6 out of 10."

","""X-Men"" is the long-awaited film adaptation of the highly popular Marvel Comics characters about two rivaling groups of mutants. The first group is led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart). He is a sort of humanitarian as he believes that there is a way for mutants to coexist peacefully with normal humans without the threat of violence, who have since come to fear them. He runs an academy where mutants come to learn and control their extraordinary powers. The other group of mutants is led by Erik Magnus Lensharr a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellan). Magneto, who is a survivor of the World War II holocaust, believes that mutants should rise up against the oppressive and fearful human population who resent him and other mutants like him. The films main plot revolves around two new mutants: the first is Logan, better known as ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman) who carries a long-burning hate for the world, as he is also the font of intense anger and his primary weapons are razor-sharp claws that come out of his hands; the other is Rogue (Anna Paquin) who can absorb the powers of other mutants and has run away from home after a particularly disturbing incident with her boyfriend. Some of the other mutants include Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who has the ability to read minds; Storm (Halle Berry), who can control the weather; Cyclops (James Marsden) who wears a visor to control the powerful beam of energy that is emitted from his eyes; Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) who has highly feral instincts; Toad (Ray Park) who gets his name from his abnormally long tongue and green skin color; and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who can alter her shape at will.<br/><br/>""X-Men"" remains to be an astonishing adaptation of the comic book. Though I have never read the comic books, I grew up on the animated t.v. series, video games and memorabilia such as trading cards and action figures. Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) shows here that he is a truly great film maker and I am looking forward to the sequel that is going to be released on May 2.<br/><br/>9/10"

","As a fan of X-Men I was very surprised at how good it was. After seeing how much they changed the costumes and which X-Men they were using and how they pretty much changed the real comic history I was a little nervous, but this movie blew me away. It had great acting, especially from Hugh Jackman who nailed Wolverine dead on, great special effects and a thought provoking story. What I liked about this too was the fact that the bad guy wasnt a true bad guy. Magneto, though a true villain, wasn't like your Joker or Green Goblin or anything like that. He wanted equality, though he wanted it in a very foreceful way, he wanted everyone to be equal in a land of intolerance. It was a great way to set up the saga of the X-Men. It wasnt like your regular comic movies where it's part of the movie discovering the powers of these characters and the rest is non-stop action. This story has the action, but more story telling and drama than anything. Bryan Singer's approach was great and I am anxiously awaiting X2 next month. Thusfar this one seems great and has a very thought provoking story. Next to the original Tim Burton Batman movie X-Men has to be the best comic movie ever made."

","X-Men is by far my favorite movie. I myself, was never a big X-Men fan. I knew a few facts, but I never really watched the show or read the comics. Bryan Singer has done an excellent job with mixing the comic book world with our world, making it near believable. Keep in mind that this movie was not solely made for the X-Men/Comic Book fanatic, but also for the general public such as myself. However, there are people out there who will be pissy and nit-pick at every little detail. X-Men has also evolved over the years, so they can't complain that every little thing isn't consistant. This is just another link in the X-Men's evolution. The actors picked for the parts were amazing. Who could have been a better cast? You couldn't picture any other actors playing these parts. The movie was excelent, I have watched it again and again and I have only spotted one flaw. I am VERY anxious to see the second one. This movie is a must-see for anyone."

"Silverzero","Null","0","0","28 February 2003"," Comic strip superhero caper which manages to be very enjoyable and highly imaginative.
","X-Men is a very entertaining adaptation of the comic book/ cartoon series with appeal for X-Men fans and non-fans alike. The film isn't as bright or exuberant as I thought it would be but it does keep you thoroughly entertained for it's 95 minute running time. <br/><br/>The cast works well together for the most part. Patrick Stewart is the most obvious pic for Professor Xavier and does a good job bringing some class to the film. Sir Ian McKellen is brilliant as the X-Men's archenemy Magneto. Newcomer Hugh Jackman closely resembles the hero of the bunch, Wolverine, and manages to be a `superhero' without wearing yellow spandex.<br/><br/>
Strangely, I imagined someone older like Meryl Streep or Jessica Lange in the role of Storm, as she did look middle-aged in the comic. Thankfully, Halle Berry is a very welcome addition, taking on the role of the character. Anna Paquin is the teenage heroine Rogue. She doesn't look like much of a heroine and is more suited to the melodrama genre but she does well in her role. I'm not going into any more detail on the rest of the X-Men, but they were all pretty good in their contributions. <br/><br/>The film tries a bit too hard to avoid camp. While it was very enjoyable, it could have been a bit better if it was more colourful. Much of the film was taking up with introducing the characters, so the end battle scene was only a taste of what will come in the sequel, X-2, which is due out later this year. `X-Men' aims for a lower note of popularity than Spider-Man and Superman did, but it's still every bit as enjoyable. At an hour and a half the film is a bit short, but what the film is good at well overshadows its minor faults. <br/><br/>Overall, X-Men is a great and distractive little movie. Definitely the best blockbuster of Summer 2001. Very enjoyable, highly entertaining, effortlessly re-watchable, what else can I say. 7.4/10."
"perfectbond","8","0","0","26 February 2003"," An excellent comic book adaption
","The X-Men is great motion picture entertainment. With its restrained pacing and devotion to character development, it also moves beyond mere entertainment and explores deeper issues such as tolerance. For the most part the special effects are convincing. An exception is a scene where a ship landing on water clearly appears to be a model. The cast is first rate but Jackman's Wolverine clearly steals the show. Now that Halle Berry has become a bigger star, her role in the sequel will no doubt be expended. My favorite scenes were the philsophical exchanges between Stewart's Xavier and MacKellan's Magneto. This movie was great on the big screen but the impressiveness of its panoramas and special effects diminish somewhat on DVD, even on a big screen TV. Still a terrific movie that provides more than escapist entertainment, 8/10."

As you can see as much as I liked this movie there were quite a few characters and its short running times meant you really couldn't dwell on anyone to long.  And as good as this one is the next one sounds as if it will just to many characters period.  The people who made this one though were smart enough to focus on Wolverine and he was the best character in this one.  I was disappointed to see Iceman a student at Prof X's school seeing as how he is one of the founding members in the comic book, but this movie, unlike Spiderman doesn't really follow the comic book much at all except for their powers and in some cases not even then."

","I have very interesting tastes in movies.  But among my favorites is one called X-Men. X-men is the story of mutants with mainly some sort of psychic ability. The story revolves around Rogue a run-away who teams up with Wolverine. Rogue as the unique ability, that when she touches someone's skin she sucks the life force right out of them. The evil villain in this sci-fi movie is Magneto who can control metal. He plans to make all humans mutant.<br/><br/>All in all the acting could have used some work but the fact that the story line totally rocked made up for that fact.

"Brian2887","9","0","0","17 November 2002"," An excellent introduction into a franchise.
","This was a decent movie.  There is really no other way of putting it.  It wasn't the best it could be, but it didn't suck either.  It was a good attempt.  I'll warn you now of possible spoilers listed throughout this review.<br/><br/>With a sequel being filmed as I right this, and a director already in talks for a part three, X-Men has the makings of a very successful franchise. The first was essentially a trailer, a sign of things to come for Marvel's mighty mutants.  Bryan Singer shows off a pure talent in this film.  With a short shooting schedule and a lackluster budget, Singer managed to create a film truly worth watching.  He took the X-Men's central theme and well, centralized it.  Throughout X-Men's long comic book history, the theme of tolerance has been lost to flashy costumes and over-the-top villains. Singer brought this theme to the forefront with a thought-provoking movie that entertains on multiple levels.  What could have been a campy mess in the hands of most directors was made into a down-to-earth, serious movie. What could have been a special effects extravaganza without a plot was instead made into a character-driven story.<br/><br/>The movie itself could have been better, but what movie couldn't?  A little more action wouldn't have hurt, not to mention a longer film.  With such a short movie, you have very little time to care about a single character. Only the characters at the story's nucleus, Professor X, Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine, are given personalities.  The rest of the characters are seemingly just there.  The plot was interesting enough, although it too took a backseat to Wolverine and Rogue's father/daughter like relationship. Magneto's cheesy plot was actually not as corny as it could have been. Having survived the Holocaust, you could see why he wanted to make the world's powerful like himself.<br/><br/>The cast was nothing short of exceptional.  Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. There is no other way to say it.  He truly nailed the role.  McKellen managed to display so much in his comparatively small amount of screen-time. His eyes displayed the pain and anger felt by the character of Magneto. Patrick Stewart portrayed Professor Xavier as I had always imagined him to be in ""real life"".  Honorable mentions to the rest of the cast who came together well in such a short period of time.<br/><br/>In short, X-Men was a decent stand-alone movie, but an exceptional start to a franchise.  Kudos to Bryan Singer and the cast for bringing us a realistic science-fiction movie, if there is such a thing.  7/10."

The characters come alive well, it's well directed by Bryan Singer. And well acted by everyone including Patrick Stewart has Professor X, who plays the part with a lot of charm and compassion. I first thought James Mardsen was a bad choice for the Cyclops, but he played the part pretty well. Famke Janssen was just quiet in the role of Jean Grey. Halle Berry should have had better lines playing Storm. Ian Mckellen was excellent has Magneto. But It's Hugh Jackman that clearly steals the picture as Wolverine, his performance has the charming rebel is very well acted. The special effects were awesome.

","I gave this movie a ten.. this ten is based on many grounds. I will start with the musical side of the movie, which I found to be perfect for every scene involving the music. The score to this film if well worth buying as a soundtrack. Another major factor in giving this movie a ten, was the casting. I have looked over many of the comics and stills fromt he cartoon to figure out what they looked like. And I must say that I found the casting thorough and impressive. I think the only character in this movie who didn't look like the original comic-character was that of Toad, but his make-up and outfit was well put together and made disgusting, yet sexy in some way. I've heard many a complaint about the original comic-costumes not being used, but I figured that if the original dress-code had been followed, it would have ridiculed the movie. To put out a specific hurray to the cast, then it would have to be two characters in particular. Patrick Stewart as Prof. Charles Xavier, and Hugh Jackman as Logan / Wolverine. This movie feels like, for me, like a springboard to the next. An introduction if you will. Put alone, it makes no sense, but seen in the bigger picture, (together with the forecoming X-films) it will undoubtedly make an even bigger success, than it already is. See this movie!

","I've seen X Men like ten times on TV and I regret not seeing it on theater. The FX, amazing. The performances are superb, specially for a Sci-Fi/Action/Comic Book film with a shining MacKellen. The cast itself is remarkable, mixing hardcore action performers with award-winning actors. Bryan Singer is a not-that-young talent, I've seen most of his movies (X-Men, Stephen King's Apt Pupil & the best crime movie except for the Godfather of course, Usual Suspects) and he shows his good taste for the visual here. <br/><br/>If you don't like the fact that sometimes it doesn't follow the comic book or the beloved cartoon, Screw You. Or don't like the plot, blame Stan Lee. But the plot, while not *intelligent* or *subtile* is very real, after all it's nothing else than Martin Luther King vs Malcolm X; ironic, isn't it, the fact that Magneto is Malcolm and not Professor X. It's a tremendous film that deserves a sequel, oh, right, it'll have one, no surprise, after all it left everything prepared for one.<br/><br/>By the way, it DID HAD character development, I can come out with some sort of profile about 'em, those who didn't see it have no perception at all. Screw You Too. <br/><br/>And the silver and gray lighting in some parts of the movie are delightful to the eye. Special mention for the X Women: Famke Jansen, Halle Berry & Rebecca Romijn are in my hot list of the hottest chicks. That adds a couple of points to this film's rating.<br/><br/>Oh, don't forget to see the sequel so that it becomes a sheer success and we may have X3 & X4; it actually looks darker (not the lights, the plot and violence/action) and will luckily bring us a better prospect 'bout the X World and the X Guys themselves (it'll be great to see more mutants than the first one, shame they still won't bring my favorite, Gambit, yet).<br/><br/>Rating: 12/10 (yeah, I gave it a 9 before, but to be faithful to the comments...)"

"Skeletors_Hood","10","0","0","7 August 2002"," Comments from a comic book nerd!
","I happen to be a very avid reader of comics, and I have leaned towards the X-titles as well over the years, and though I never dug deep into the soap opera that is X-Men, I had a firm enough ground that I knew the characters and where they came from.  People criticize this movie because they say it isn't faithful to the comics.  HOW?????  The only thing that wasn't faithful to the comic was Hugh Jackman's hair wasn't standing two and a half feet off his head, which, mutant powers or not, I don't think that it's possible. Even hair bands in the 80's couldn't pull that hairdo off, and I'm certain a few of them are mutants (Poison, David Bowie, etc.).  Okay, Jean isn't a doctor in the comics, but other than that, the characters were faithful to their comic counterparts.<br/><br/>THe story, while not taken from a comic story arc, was just as good as any story that the comics could come up with.  I respect the fact that someone wrote an orginal story for the movie, because if they had taken from an actual story, such as the Phoenix saga, then the hardcore fans would have nitpicked the movie to death.  I'm a comic book geek, but I know how to lighten up and let a movie be a movie.  The movie was more or less like a Year One story arc, introducing the movie audiences to the characters.<br/><br/>The actor choices were great as well.  For years, I always said that Patrick Stewart should be Professor X, hands down.  I was so happy when he got the role, because he did a great job.  Hugh Jackman played an awesome Wolverine, and Ian McKellen and his cohorts were perfectly cast as well.  My only question mark was Halle Berry as Storm.  She could have done so much better in her character, especially with that horrible accent she used.<br/><br/>This movie helped to redefine Marvel movies, and it's about time too.  After the Punisher, Howard the Duck and the Fantastic Four movies, X-men showed Hollywood that Marvel can do it, and they continue in with the Spider-man movie.  Watch the film, and even if you aren't a fan of the comics, it's still a fun and enjoyable movie."

","I saw these movie many years after watching the entire animated series -I was a fan of it- and wasn't dissapointed at all by these film. The big problem about it is that it has too many character and too short time. Every character of the X-MEN has a very, very big story behind them, and it forms their attitude. For the person who has to write the script is very difficult to put in one and a half hour the life, way of acting, problems and powers of what? Nine characters? You may focus in a couple of them, but all of them need their moment on the screen and that is why this kind of movies can result in disapointment. <br/><br/>The movie is good because its loyal to the characters' origins, but then it also has the artistic originality a film should ever have. Anyhow, that just isn't enough to those who know the characters to the bottom of themselfs. I liked it, maybe because in that year most movies sucked, but nevertheless it is more than acceptable."

","This is what has started the comic adaptions of the Twenty-first Century. But what this great comic adaption has done is spanned the existance of the god-awful SPIDER-MAN. And since they are making a sequel, that makes it even worse.<br/><br/>But, let's talk about this movie. The cast is great, no one could have portrayed the X-Men better. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, Patrick Stewart is Professor X, Ian McKellan is Magneto, Tyler Mane is Sabretooth, Ray Park is Toad, and Anna Paquin is Rogue. And let us just thank whoever it was that had the idea to make the cast wear black instead of the pathetically designed costumes of the cartoon series. The action sequences are pretty intense and some of the younger fans might want to stay away for a few more years, because for some reason they find it all way too scary. Even with the laughable SPIDER-MAN, some children found Willem Dafoe as the Green Goblin somewhat frightening. Hugh Jackman perfectly portrays Wolverine. He looks exactly like the cartoon character. The sequel will probably ruin the great reputation that this film had and so will the sequel to the horrid SPIDER-MAN. But perhaps the greatness of X-MEN will keep it from being dismembered by the sequel in a few months. But until it is, let us all enjoy it while we can. X-MEN gets 5/5."

","This film is absolutely brilliant. Bryan Singer has done an excellent job, remaining respectful to the original material but still managing to give the story and the characters a unique flavour.<br/><br/>Singer puts together an amazing cast, led by two British greats. Patrick Stewart plays Prof. Charles Xavier, teacher and leader of the X-Men. Sir Ian McKellen plays Prof. X's alter-ego, the master of magnetism, Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto. They are joined by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Famke Janssen as Dr. Jean Grey, and Halle Berry as Storm.  The good thing about the casting in this film though is that it also includes relative unknowns such as James Marsden (Cyclops) and Tyler Mane (Sabretooth).  Singer employs Ray Park, the stuntman who found fame as Darth Maul in ""Star Wars Episode 1: The Phantom Menace"" and later as the Headless Horseman in Tim Burton's ""Sleepy Hollow"", as Toad, the model Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, and the largely underrated Bruce Davidson as Senator Robert Kelly.<br/><br/>The storyline is brilliant and believable. Singer has managed to make a film that is really entertaining and which includes all the best Marvel traditions, with amazing special effects, dazzling locations and a witty script, as well as creating a story that is thought-provoking and quite intellectual. McKellen's Magneto almost becomes an anti-hero (as the beginning shows him as a young boy in Auswitz, watching his parents being carted off to the gas chambers.  Obviously this sets a mind-set within Lehnsherr's psyche, which drives him to desperate measures when he sees the kind of prejudice directed against mutants (of course, he's a mutant as well as a Jew) by people such as Sen. Kelly.  <br/><br/>The extreme nature of Magneto's beliefs are illustrated by the opposing view of Lehnsherr's old friend, Prof. Xavier.  The storyline tells us (and anyone familiar with the comic will know) how Xavier and Lehnsherr were once close friends but were pushed apart by their increasingly differing views on how to approach the hostility towards mutants.<br/><br/>The story is well crafted and the script clever. The characters are well-rounded and interesting and Singer draws well from the Marvel comics, remaining very true to the essence of the characters.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an excellent film and I highly recommend it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"chrisbrown6453","8","0","0","19 June 2002"," Having never read the X-Men comics, I can't say whether this movie was faithful to the comic, but as a movie, I thought it turned out to be pretty good.
","Unlike other recent comic/film crossovers like Mystery Men, this latest foray into turning a popular comic into a movie had a nice balance between being an action movie and being a comic book movie. <br/><br/>Taking place in the not so distant future, the movie follows the exploits of a group of mutants known as the X-Men. Mutants are people who have evolved over time and have special powers. One group of mutants, the X-Men, led by Professor X (Patrick Stewart), believe that they can co-exist with the human race. Another group of mutants, led by Magneto (Ian McKellen) believes that a war between humans and mutants is imminent. He has an evil plan to rid the Earth of humans, and let the mutants dominate the world. It is up to the X-Men to stop him. <br/><br/>Along with Professor X, who has the ability to read and control peoples minds, there is Dr. Jean Grey, who has telekinetic powers; Storm, who has the power to control the weather; and Cyclops, a man who has the power of energy in his eyes. On the side of Magneto, who has the power of magnetism, there is the barbarian Sabertooth; Toad, a man with, well, a large tongue and the ability to hop really far; and Mystique, who has the power to shape-shift into anyone. We also meet Rogue, a girl who takes the energy of any person who touches her skin, and Wolverine, a man with amazing regenerative powers, and claws that come out of his hands. Professor X believes that Magneto wants to kidnap Wolverine, but can't figure out why. But he soon realizes that it's not Wolverine that Magneto wants, it's Rogue that Magneto needs, in order to carry out his plan to rid the Earth of the humans. <br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the movie has a nice balance between being too cartoony, and being a solid action film. Obviously this is no ordinary group of people, so making it into a regular action movie wouldn't work. And if it's too cartoonish, you end up making a movie that seems really cheesy (thank god they didn't have Wolverine in his yellow and black spandex). So I applaud Bryan Singer on his ability to mesh both worlds. I found the story to be simple, but I think that was necessary. This movie is more about the characters than the story. For those of us un-initiated in the ways of the X-Men, it was a good way to get to know who these people were, and what they could do, rather than throw them into a convoluted story line that would have had to make you think and not pay attention to the heart of the people on screen. I had heard of Wolverine before, but I really didn't know much about any of the other characters, so it was nice to get a little background on them, and see what powers they had, and not have to be worried about some strange plot that would take away from the movie. <br/><br/>I thought the special effects were good, but that is the one thing I was expecting from this movie. I thought that the special effects would be good, that there would be some cool hard-core type music, but that's it. What I found was a movie with characters I cared for, and music that was actually kept to a minimum. Generally I find that in these types of movies, whenever there is a big fight scene, or something cool happening, there is always loud music punctuating the scene. Here I found a few scenes where there was silence in the background, which actually punctuated the scene more than any piece of music could. I thought the sets were nice, especially the giant room that Professor X used to try and track down mutants. And I thought the actors did a good job with the characters. I had my doubts about Hugh Jackman playing the brooding Wolverine, but he won me over with his performance. So overall I thought X-Men was a pretty good movie. Not as good as the original Batman, but a whole lot better than most, if not all, of the other comic book movies made in the last 10 years. It had a lot of cool scenes, very cool characters, great special effects, and some good fight scenes. It kept a very even tone throughout, not too serious, not too funny, and the story was there to help the audience get to know the characters, so that we will all go back and see the inevitable sequels in the years to come."

","Years of anticipation had finally come to an end. I was so excited to see this movie, and I thought it was just great. An all star cast that did not disappoint too much and a director that held the project with high regard. Each actor to me did a splendid job with their character. After years of following the story line in the popular Comic Book series, I was happy with the resulting movie and series pending. Sure really die-hard fans may be disappointed with a few details, but the way I see it...Imagine if there was a real group, or similar issue in the world, and they made a movie or comic book about it. Now imagine what you see in this movie as the real and the comics and cartoons as what was done with them. Marvel has finally come through with great films."

","When I first heard about an X-men movie being made, I was sceptical that any film studio could take it serious enough to make a good film. The last movie I liked made from a comic book was the first Superman made in 1978. After seeing X-Men though, I was pleasantly surprised.  Bryan Singer did a wonderful job turning one of my favorite comic books as a kid into what is now one of my favorite science fiction films.<br/><br/>The only flaw I saw was the casting of Halle Berry as Storm. I think Singer knew this too because she only has two lines in the whole movie.<br/><br/>
I can't wait for the sequel next year. Hopefully, my favorite X-men character, Pheonix, will make an appearance. Now I just wish Singer had done this years Spiderman. 7/10"

","All my life I've watched exactly one episode of the X-Men. But when I heard that a live action film was being created, I wanted to see it. The special effects are quite nicely done, and it's the kind of movie where you can be yelling out loud at the characters(and if your anything like me you appreciate that) Although the movie was enjoyable, it offered far too little in the way of closure. that was disappointing, now I'm going to have to see the sequel. But I can't help not wondering if maybe the answers to the questions that were left open in the movie have already been established in it's more animated forms. I will probably never take the time to see, so perhaps the sequel is being filmed for people like me."

","The real standout are Wolverine and Rogue. The story is simply about mutants getting along with humans. Professor X is trying to make a better world with humans and mutants. Magneto wants no parts of this! He wants everyone to turn mutant and be on his brotherhood of mutants! I really loved this movie and I thought every actor gave it all to there character. Especially Hugh Jackman(Logan(Wolverine). I really thought they went to far off base with the actor but Hugh fit Wolverine perfectly! I really mean that. The movie is colorful and full of action! The fight sceens are flawless, and when Wolverine put outs his claws I was very impressed! The movie is funny at times and very real to the comic book. Real life actors on the big screen protraying comic characters. It's really great. Bryan Singer is the only one I know that could keep this francise going. I really love this movie!

","I saw this film last night and have to say that it was appalling.  After reading everyone elses comments on here I thought I'd check it out. It is safe to say that everyone who ranted on about the god damn X-Men being good has clearly never seen a good movie, and for that fact would know one if Wolverine smashed it into their collective X-Men obsessed skulls. Retarded direction from Singer who was the main reason I watched this film after The Usual Suspects.  The scene where Wolverine crashes his mobile home and lands in the snow, has a fight and is rescued by a member of Abba and Cyclops was so shoddily done that it made me laugh.  The one redeeming feature was Hugh Jackman who deserves to be a star, granted the special effects were stunning, but what the heck was going on.  Slow, slow, slow storyline, you may of well as put Wolverine on a John Deere Lawnmower and told him to visit his dying brother.  At least the straight story was exciting. I feel as though the cult following this film has got, especially after the readers nauseating insights about the characters means that this film will be seen again and again, allowing the X-Menophilles to invade there own space well into the next year awaiting the sequel.  Word to the wise, how do you think Wolverine got hairy palms.  Point Made."

","Well, I saw the X-Men movie early the night before it debuted in theatres (employee showing at Main Place).  I didn't want to say this... I mean I really didn't want to say this... but the X-Men movie is pretty good. Let me clarify that I was expecting a steaming heap of the horrid, and so my expectations were low.  I still believe it's pretty good, though! I really only went to see it because my two favorite Actors are in it (McKellan and Stewart) so I couldn't pass it up.  I was pleased though! Hugh Jackman did a good job as Wolverine.  Now, he is too tall for the role (remember that Wolverine is supposed to be Five feet Two inches tall), but his facial expressions, and his attitude were right on!  His martial arts were good, and he held his own acting wise.  They never got in to his bezerker rage, and he was cuddly enough to befriend the children (onscreen and in the audience), but that didn't make the character suffer.  He was still gruff, and slightly (only slightly) foul-mouthed.  Even the hair was close! Many have criticized Rogue, but they did her quite well!  The actress (Anna Paquin) is among the youngest Oscar winners ever (The Piano) so naturally her acting was good!  I have the first appearance of Rogue, and this was pretty close to the young Rogue.  Right down to the green riding hood! They eliminated some elements of her past... but that helped the story stay clear... not convoluted. Patrick Stewart IS Professor X.  Perfect!  Cerebro was likewise dead-on! Ian McKellen was amazing as Magneto.  He was just perfect.  I never was comfortable with the bulked up Magneto of the nineties.  He's tough, but looks his age! He played the part with dignity, and actually looked right even when flying around.  His costume is sort of a combo of the original, and his X-Men Costume (does anyone remember that Magneto was the Headmaster of Xavier's School, and the X-Men's leader for a time back in the '80's?). Even that helmet is practical... it's not a super-villain thing... he uses it to block Professor Xavier's powers. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (SP?) made a good Mystique... I was skeptical, but she was fine! The team is only unofficially called X-Men.  Basically they all wear uniforms and battle fatigues with the Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters symbol on it.  Somewhere along the line the kids started referring to them as ""X-Men""... makes it more grown up, no?   In fact, these folks are treated like action heroes, not superheroes.  They seldom even wear the uniforms.<br/><br/>The story isn't perfect, and won't win any awards for best screenplay, but is pretty tight.  There is the occasional scene where I found myself saying ""WHY?"", or ""That was pretty contrived!"", but for the most part I was pleased.  I won't reveal any details, because I don't want to include any spoilers!  I will say  that occasionally the slow-mo fight scenes got irritating... luckily this technique was rarely used. Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake (or should I say ""Ice Boy"") was ALL wrong... why even have him in the film if he was going to be a bowl of nothing?<br/><br/>The rest of the X-cast (I.E.: Cyclops, Storm and Marvel Girl) was good. They made a fine ensemble without falling behind the main leads.  The other villains (Sabretooth, Toad) did well.  I liked Sabretooth almost in spite of myself.  I didn't like his lion roars, but the presence was there!  Toad was pretty funny.  It was nice to hear Ray Park's voice for once, and it was cool to know that at least one of the actors did their own stunts!  Of course he had in contacts again!  Will we ever see his true eye color? The directing was great.  It certainly had that Usual Suspects feel without being derivative.  I think Singer is another great one. Again, without McKellan and Stewart it might not have been so good!  But if you're interested in seeing a good action movie, see this one... hey, it's less comic-bookish than The Patriot!"

The special effects were awesome. Especially when Mystique changes into other people or things.<br/><br/>The only quarrel I have with this movie is that from the very beginning I could tell that there was going to be a sequal, and it seemed like that the only reason X-Men was made is so that their could be a sequal. Don't get me wrong I like sequals Austin Powers 2 was a great sequal, but X-Men Left too many things open or unexplained.

","I don't know what it was but something about this movie just disappointed me. I've been reading the comics since 1991 and have watched every single episode of the old Fox cartoon and I have also read most of the TPB's from the 80's. So it can be said that I was realy anticipating this movie. Sadly it left me disappointed, Cyclops who is my favorite character wasn't really fleshed out as much as he should've been and in my opinion had no chemistry with Jean which is a big no no. Jean and Storm were a joke compared tot heir comic book counterparts. Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine were my only favorite characters in this movie and i'm not really a huge Wolvie fan. They were the best written characters and also the most close to their comic counterparts. I did not like what was done with Mystique, Sabretooth and Toad at all. I've never really liked Toad but Sabretooth is a character with SO MUCH potential and one of my favorites in the books here he is reduced to a dumb witted lackey which totally goes against everything the character stands for just like Bane in Batman & Robin he was severly butchered. The direction was alright and I've always been a supporter of Patrick Stewart as Professor X since the early 90's although he really shows his age in this movie and i've always pictured the Professor as someone in his late 40's not someone in their 60's. This is one movie in which the Sequel NEEDS to be a serious improvement over. I hope they finally nail it with the sequel. Unlike ""Superman II"" and ""Batman"" which are two of the greatest Comic movies i've ever seen this movie has problems fleshing out it's villains and even it's main characters so there is no one to really root for. Like ""Batman"" however the Action scenes are very poorly filmed and sometimes even hard to follow. I don't know but I was seriously hyped for this one maybe that is why I felt so let down. All faults aside I'm still buying the Special Edition DVD when it is released."

My parents own a movie theater, so I worked there that summer. I preveiwed it the night before it came out and LOVED it. I went to go see it a second time the next day. Whenever I went upstairs to make popcorn I would watch it, and I would go see it when I was of duty. I saw the movie 7 TIMES in the theater and the day it came out on video I bought it. I know your thinking major dork, but I can't help it. All the characters were made for the part, exspecially Patrick Serwart, Hugh Jackman, and Ian McKellen. They all look and act the sAME AS IN the tv show, and comic book. The guy that wrote the comic book..(forgot his name), watch Mall Rats to see him. Is a really good comic book writer. So is Kevin Smith, also Mallrats, Clerks, Dogma, and cHsing Amy. Anyways, getting off subject. Let me tell you alittle about the cast.<br/><br/>
Patrick Serwart(Profesor X): You may have seen Star Trek, I think that's where most people know him. He has been in lot's of other movies to though. He was sooo perfect for the part of Prefessor X. Ian McKellan:(Magneto) A long time great actor. My grandma really likes him, so you can see how old he has been an actor. ANd a very good one at that.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman:(Wolverine) We come to him, who is my favorite. If you don't know him from X-Men, you may have seen Someone Like You or Swordfish, which Hallie Barry was also in. He has won many Best Actor Awards in Australia. He was in Oklahoma and he was Gaston in Buety and the Beast. Look for him in the the fall for his new movie with Meg Ryan called Kate and Lepold. Also he was in People for one of the 50 most beutiful people. He wouldn't sit by Tyler Mane when they had lunch, so he could build up a tension between them. James Marsden:(Cyclops) You may know him from Gossip or Disturbing Behavior. Those are the only two I've seen him in. He had to be lead around the stage sometimes because he couldn't see very well. Rebbeca Roman-Stamos:(Mystique) She is a model, and of coourse everyone knows her husband. John Stamos, who played Jessie on Full house. It took 8-10 hours to put on her costume. Hallie Barry:(Storm)You might have read about her when she got in her accident. Her most recent film is Swordfish. Ray park:(Toad) Of course everyone knows him as Dauth Maul from Episode 1.<br/><br/>Famek Janson:(Jean Grey): Look for her in Men in Black 2, in summer of 2002.<br/><br/>Tyler Mane:(Sabertooth) I don't know anything else he has been in. He still did the part very well though. Anna Paquin:(Rouge) She won an Acadmy award for The Piano and she was in Fly Away Home. Well that's all the characters, they all did a great job. Personally I think..if you have seen the extra footage at the end of the tape..they should have used that footage. It went into more detail and told more about Jean Grey and the love triangle going on. For evryone to know, the sequel is coming out summer of 2002. Hopefully we get more about Logan's past. Brian Singer is still directing it. YES! All the charcters that didn't die in the first one will be in the second one also. There is also plans if the sequel goes well to make a third one. I know everyone got goosebumps, when Wolverine risked his life for Rouge, and the music that was playing was so touching. lol Of course I was SO happy when he didn't die. Of course not, he was the main character. Some poeple will say that the movie was to much about wolverine. It may have been, but the sequel will be about someone else. I think it was good he was the main character, because it really gave his careor a boost. If no one noticed, some other x-men in the movie were Kitty and Jubille. Gambet was also going to be in it and Beast but wasn't. I think they are going to be in the second one though. Anyways, I know I've gone on to long. PLease e-mail me if you have any questions about any movies, or if you just want to talk about them. I know that half the poeple that go to this site won't even read this thing. I'm just glad I got to write about it. I think everyone should see this movie. It's very quotable, I should know, I know every word of it.  Thanks for reading. Bye."

","Alright, I started writing this review and it was pretty bad, but I'm not intending for this to be a bad review. X-Men was a very good movie. My only problem is the fact that it's a very good movie, for someone who hasn't been loyally giving their money away on X-Men comics, merchandise, etc. for the past almost ten years. I, as a fan for a while of the actual comic book felt almost betrayed by how they portrayed the characters (they being writers, screenplay people and what-not, the actors I believe did a fine job with what they were given). They were so very untrue to the characters but I do understand why. I understand that you can't pack alomost 40 years of character exploration into and hour and a half. I also understand that they were trying to open the X-Men up to new audiences. But to me this kinda feels like people who don't already follow the X-Men don't matter, it's all about getting new people in. *shrug* But what can you do. I would definitely recommend this movie, while I admit I whine about the falsities of it, it was very good, but hard core X-Men fans should know that it wasn't very true to the books. I for some reason was expecting it to be. Now something were very accurate. (which I would mention but I don't want to spoil it.) But there are some VERY inaccurate points to the movie. I was very suprised though, I thought the actors did a great job. I know I couldn't have made the movie any better, and I know they did the best with what they could, but hopefully the sequel will side a little more on the already true fans side. And maybe have more than, 5 X-Men in it, and maybe have the budget to let them use their powers more than once, or twice. It's a good movie, check it out, but be warned. :) That's all for my ramblings."

","The pondersome task for the folks at Marvel and 20th Century Fox, is to produce a movie that will satisfy the fans of the comic, and those that haven't the foggiest notion of what the story is about. This made for long and protracted explaining all throughout the screenplay. This also meant that a lot a times, the action came to a deadening stop, more often than not. Movies have to give the audience breathing room, but this film gave too much, to the point where things started getting...well...dull. The performances were okay, with Halle Berry being the standout as ""Storm."" Patrick Stewart underplayed his role to the point of casting a wooden pall over the character. Ian Mckellan was good in his role as ""Magneto."" He showed wonderfully sublime self-control, as his character could have beened hammed up badly. They made a wise choice using Sir Ian in this role.<br/><br/>
A mention might go out to parents, who are contemplating bringing the kids. There's a few scenes that are more than slighty graphic in their violent content. I was frankly astonished to see parents with toddlers in their arms, in the same theater. Some scenes could be a tad unsettling.<br/><br/>Overall, while the film did not live up to its far-flung hype (which ones do?), it isn't terrible either. Just a bubble over average."

","I am huge fan of Rogue and Gambit, but I was quite disappointed with Singer's protrayal of the Mississippi Maurader. I understand that he wanted to show her as a teenager, possibly to connect with teenage fans, but nobody really knows what she was like at that age! Everybody knows her as the strongarm of the X-Men. And when the sequel is made, with Gambit in it by the way, how is their relationship supposed to work, unless the Ragin' Cajun is a young'n' too! But other than the misrepresentation of Rogue, I thoroughly enjoyed the movie. I especially loved the tension between Cyclops and Wolverine! :-) And the addition of ""one-liners"" added solely for X-Fans (""What would you prefer, yellow spandex?"") made it just that much more identifible! The story was well written (* could have been better if Gambit was in it), and the cast (except for Ms. Paquin as Rogue) was SUPERB! I could go on about the praises... but let me just say... the sequel is highly anticipated!"

"ShannonAmidala","Null","0","0","20 July 2001"," Awesome special effects, plot very disappointing ***spoilers***
","This really is a great movie. I saw it a long time ago, but decided to rent it. Unfortunately they didn't have it for rental (WHAT?!) so I just bought it. It figures, hehe.<br/><br/>When I first saw this (about half a year ago), I thought it was really disappointing and just ok. Which is half-true. I can't lie to you- the plot really stinks in this movie. It's a major drawback, but the awesome special effects make up for it. The costumes on the characters were fabulous- ingenius! I was very impressed by the style and overall appearance of the movie. It was very classy, very hard-core, very intense. Now that I've seen the movie again, I have to say that it's better than when I saw it the first time. I didn't really want to see it the first time, but now that I went out and got it voluntarily, I have retained a sense of open-minded-ness.<br/><br/>
Hugh Jackman, as Wolverine, is destined to be a star. Heck, he already is one. He's been in three movies I adored: this one, Someone Like You, and Swordfish. With a handsome, roguish, dashing look about him, charming good looks and charismatic persona, he's bound to be on the cover of ever magazine in the near future. Girls are already crazy about it him, and he has a strong fanbase. It's not hard to see why. As the strong, intense, never-let-your-guard-down Wolverine, and the distinctly more human Logan, he's just oozing with sex appeal. I can't think of anyone else who could have played Wolverine better. He said in a quote that it was either him or Val Kilmer. I was like ""They were even considering someone else!?"" ;)<br/><br/>Anna Paquin, while sincere and very real in her emotions, really disappointed me. I'm not a big fan of hers in the first place, except for her cute role in Fly Away Home, but I didn't see any magic onscreen while I was watching this movie. I really don't tap into the chemistry between Logan and Marie. All I see is a brother/sister type relationship- nothing more. While she is a very human, very sweet girl, I don't think we deserved to see that much of her in the movie.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen- WOW. Loved her. She's such a controlled actress, it's scary. You don't see much of her in the movie (to which I'm very mad about), but the scenes you do see emit such a poised, passionate, heroic, yet restrained woman who has a lot of back history I hope we explore in the sequel. Famke is a gorgeous actress, and is very direct and very honest. I wish they gave her more screentime. The love triangle among Logan, Jean Grey, and Scott was something I'm glad they went into (and if you have the tape, at the end you can see an expanded version of that scene in Logan's bedroom). This is one of the most interesting storylines in the movie, and I'm eager to see how Rogue gets thrown into the mix, if she does at all (I'm thinking she might). Personally, I love the Logan/Jean Grey pair. I know that the storyline will probably turn out to be Scott/Jean, but I'm very content and proud of my couple shipper fetish. :D<br/><br/>James Marsden, great role for him. He, like Famke, doesn't get much of a chance for screentime in here, but hopefully he will in the sequel. I don't like him much as Scott (look to the ""love triangle"" diatribe), but he did play a good part as Cyclops. I loved the throw of words he shared with Logan (""Stay away from my girl""). He's a great actor, and very handsome too. But I do have a slight hostility toward his character (getting in the way of my Logan/Jean, lol).<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart, exceptional! Who could've played Professor X better? Nobody! I'm so glad they cast him. He shares many of the same traits as Famke (ironic, since in the movie they share the same type of power)- poised, intelligent, and controlled. Such a great actor, who's able to look at you and direct an emotion so powerfully.<br/><br/>I liked this movie when I saw it a second time. The action scenes were phenomenal, but I felt the movie had something missing. Perhaps we will see whatever it was in the sequel."

"Shiva-11","7","0","0","16 July 2000"," Holy mutants Batman! A good comic book movie.
","X-Men:  The next phase in human evolution has given rise to a select group who possesses a wide range of unusual abilities: telekinesis, super-healing, and morphing are only a few examples.  Unfortunately, there is a movement among the ""normal"" people - afraid of what they do not understand - to have these ""mutants"" register so they can be identified, tracked and their powers documented.  Two mutants emerge as leaders with radically different agendas - one seeks peaceful coexistence with the rest of humanity - the other domination.<br/><br/>Whenever a book is adapted for the big screen there is bound to be controversy over casting or content - legions of fan were livid with the choice of Tom Cruise for the role of Lestat in ""Interview With a Vampire"". To a lesser degree, this has also applied to comic book adaptations (""Spiderman"", ""Superman"", we won't even touch ""Batman""), but none approaching the level of debate which raged over ""X-Men"".  It was not just a question of who would be cast, but which characters should be included, what they should wear (people were livid that the characters would not be clad in body hugging spandex), how close they should be to the comic book characters, etc.  Consequently, I would be stunned if anyone is totally happy with all the characters - I know I wasn't.<br/><br/>Toad gets far too much screen time and his prehensile tongue schtick quickly grows tiresome, Sabretooth isn't very menacing (they couldn't find a bulked up Behemoth with a little more screen presence? Kane (?) from the WWF comes to mind) and the May/December relationship between Jean Grey and Cyclops doesn't jibe.  I did however think Hugh Jackman was superb as Wolverine, delivering the right balance of pathos and rage.  Patrick Stewart's Xavier is a cool as ice (he got a lot of practice as Captain Picard on Star Trek), soft-spoken diplomat.  Finally, Sir Ian McKellen is almost regal in his portrayal as Magneto the wonderful gentleman villain with a nasty disposition (but couldn't they have given him a better hat?  I bet that's why he has such an attitude problem).  But you're probably wondering ""What about the movie itself?""  All in good time <br/><br/>Rather than go for a gaudy ""comic book"" look (""Dick Tracy""), or a decaying and depressing landscape (""Batman""), ""X-men"" has a realistic feel: it takes place a few years in the future in a recognizable New York.  The story is engaging and accessible, examining the concept of intolerance - although here it is not skin color (in most cases) or religion that is the focus - which captures headlines everyday, and is quite simple to grasp.   Just to ensure that the movie doesn't get too heavy, there are quite a few clever puns and one-liners sprinkled throughout to provide some levity.   And let's not forget the action.<br/><br/>There are several excellently choreographed action sequences, most notably the battle between Mystique and Wolverine.  The experience is heightened by excellent cinematography, stop motion and slow motion photography, and impressive special effects (morphing technology continues to improve). <br/><br/>
X-Men will not satisfy everyone, but it does deliver a finely crafted story, good acting and is without a doubt one of the best comic-book-to-screen translations to date. <br/><br/>And there will be a sequel."

","I have to confess, ""X-Men"" has never been my favorite Marvel comic book-I prefer ""Thor,"" ""Silver Surfer"" and ""Fantastic Four"".  And there have been so many bad movies based on Marvel's characters that I skipped seeing ""X-Men"" in the theater.  But I bought the video and watched it five times over the holiday break.  Now I can't wait for the next one. 	A decent script, a good director-Bryan Singer-and an excellent cast make this my favorite superhero movie since the 1978 ""Superman"".  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen embody Professor Charles Xavier and Magneto, respectively, so well that I can't imagine anyone else playing these roles.  McKellen plays Magneto as both villain and victim-a man who was made a monster by monsters, and now wants to remake the world in his own twisted image. Stewart's Xavier, the archetypal teacher and father figure to his school of young mutant outcasts, is wise, witty, and caring. Oscar winner Anna Paquin brings the vulnerable waif Rogue to such vivid life that I don't mind the script changing her to a teenager.  And Aussie newcomer Hugh Jackman so perfectly captures the spirit and personality of Wolverine that his height (6'3"" vs. Wolvie's 5'3"") was not an issue for me. All of Paquin and Jackman's scenes together are wonderful-two remarkable actors with an extraordinary chemistry between them. And that's the most remarkable thing about this movie-the quiet dialogue scenes between characters stayed with me long after the big action and fight scenes.  Halle Berry's Storm holding the hand of a dying man, Xavier's first confrontation with Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine riding in his truck or on the train-I could go on and on. As far as I'm concerned, practically every change from the comic was an improvement.  The only things that I really missed were Beast, Nightcrawler, and the Danger Room-but, hey, they have to save something for the sequel, right?"
"teejayniles2345","10","0","0","15 July 2001"," Where were the Canadian token X-people?
","I am one of the mild fans of this Bryan Singer film; it is amazing and amusing but I have a question for the diehard fans:  where are the Canadian folks in this movie that dashes around Northern America?  The two Mutants at the top of the Good versus Bad pyramids: Dr. X versus Magneto were portrayed by British Shakespearean veterans who sort of look age 60 + or so.  However, if the setting of the storyline is supposed to be distinctly in the ""near"" future, wouldn't such a hero and villain (Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, respectively) both be 70-75 years old to have survived the 1944 Concentration camps and the immigration past Miss Liberty in 1949 as adolescents in full bloom of their mutant psychic powers?  Those two talented actors' pronunciation and diction still isn't quite generic to most people's ears but both veterans have carried major Studio/TV credits so we can understand that casting.  However,  Australian Anna Paquin and Brit Hugh Jackman as well as the actor portraying Toad are also a bit heavy on the accents in my opinion.  The trucker and the Canadian bar patrons in early scenes seemed to me mere ""generic"" gladiator/WWF crowd versus any representative inclusions of those ""north"" of the US border. In other USER COMMENTS previous to mine, several are asking about sequels and omission of favorite characters.  For me, the germane question isn't about who'll be featured next, why Singer or executive producer Stan Lee chose these particular X-persons (good and evil), or was enough attention to believable special effects equipment/fight scenes paid.  I want to know if and when the U.S. Senate bans mutants or herds them into Konzentration-Kamps, will they flock to the Canadian Rockies where Wolverine seems to have been shifted?  Rating 8 of 10; violence- mild; offensive language - minimal; disturbing events - moderate for under 12 age group."

","The movie ""X-Men"" has a few changes, but for the most part it remains true to the comics. Some changes are: Cyclops is younger in the movie, Wolverine and Sabretooth don't know each other in the film (In the comics, they worked together in Team X.), St. John Alerdyce is a student of Professor X' in the movie, but not in the comics. As an avid X-Men fan, I appreciate the director's keeping the characters and plot believable to comic fans and making changes to keep the characters from looking stupid (i.e. leather costumes instead of spandex).

"courtjester","7","0","0","1 July 2001"," Flick is nice, but classic comics are better
","Bryan Singer said that this movie was driven by characters rather than by action.  With that in mind, I was surprised to discovered that the film was more impressive and faithful to the original comics in regard to the action scenes than it was in regard to characterization.  Despite the modest budget (by blockbuster standards), X-Men manages to deliver well choreographed action scenes reminiscent of the comic book. It is often visually impressive, though the score is pretty weak.<br/><br/>The characterization ranges from great to poor.  Ian McKellen performance is the best and truest to his character (Magneto). Berry's Storm is uninteresting.  Stewart's Xavier and Paquin's Rogue are two-dimensional compared to their complex comic counterparts. Jean Grey, Cyclops, and Wolverine are at times as multi-faceted as in the comics.  Ray Park is surprisingly good as Toad.<br/><br/>My advice: if you like the movie, buy some reprints of the X-Men comics of the 70s and 80s to see the X-Men at their best."

","This was an entertaining film, but one that could have been better.  While it didn't seem short, if they added some character development for some of the characters who just take up screen time.  And either develop the perfunctory love triangle, or get rid of it.<br/><br/>  The story itself is rather simple as well.  People hate mutants, and want to pass a bill forcing them to register themselves.  The mutants are divided into two camps.  The first group believe in peaceful coexistence, while the second believe that people must be destroyed.<br/><br/>  The performances range, but that is as a result of their parts.  Berry, Marsden, Jansen, and Romain-Stamos are limited by their roles, but still give a solid go of it.  Anna Paquin as Rogue, while doesn't disappoint, isn't incredible.  Rogue is not a teenager, so her character isn't completely 'true'.  It also limits the flirtatious relationship between her and Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman.  The film belongs to him.  He's great to watch.<br/><br/>  Fun, while not incredible (though it should have been nominated for an oscar in the Sound and make-up categories)."

X-men lays the foundation, a bit like Superman, but whereas Superman 2 was a step down, X-men 2 should blow away the original.<br/><br/>The X-men has interesting Super-heros, they have powers which have a bad side, they are not perfect. I really like this idea, it makes the films franchise last longer, and the potential of sequel ideas is infinite.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is excellent, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is excellent, steals the show in my opinion. James Marsden and Halle Berry didn't have a lot of meat in the picture, I think the sequels could sort this out.<br/><br/>The editing of the picture was the major disappointment, the 2nd act was disjointed and the progress of the picture was hampered.

Given that this IS a COMIC BOOK adaptation, I'm willing to cut Singer some slack, seeing that I'm not exactly expecting Citizen Kane material here. plus there's A LOT of set-up so to speak, so maybe Singer will do better in X-Men II.<br/><br/>
Same goes for characterizations, or lack thereof. With the exceptions of Prof. X (Stewart), Wolverine (Jackson), Magneto (McKellen), and Rogue (Paquin) everyone else comes off as movie set extras, with their one-dimensional demeanors (especially Toad, Sabretooth, Cyclops, and Storm) coupled with flavorless one-liners. Speaking of which... Storm's (Berry) ""Do you know what happens to a toad..."" line fell flatter than a mat dropped from a ten story building.

","A true rarity - a big budget, overblown sci-fi movie that actually makes sense, works pretty well and doesn't bore you to death.  Taken from the Marvel Comics classic series about super-hero mutants protecting society from the bad guys (which include evil mutants).  Patrick Stewart anchors the leads as Professor X, and Anna Paquin gives a very understated, very attractive turn as one of his new finds.  Only two complaints - a pointless sub-plot involving the abduction of a congressman; and a sort of antiseptic or formula quality to the story that prevents real emotional involvement (Paquin excepted).  But the fact that it passes muster in other areas puts in well ahead of most of the genre."

","X-men has been one of the biggest comics to ever hit the super heroe industry.  To make a movie about it great idea, though to ruin it, bad idea. The movie takes the story of the X-men and totally destroys it.  If a movie is based upon some other story it should follow that story not make up little other things because of money complications.  And if you can't live up to that story because of money then don't make the movie.  Also they got to remember that they're making movies here, not comics.  I don't know how many x-men movies they plan to make, but they're starting off pretty slow and it could lead to many sequels.  So why not just make the a little longer but also include some other enemies, and other good guys and make some good fight scenes.  Not like the crap, horribly coreographed fight scenes in this movie.  Also the wolverine and sabretooth fight at the end should have been 10 times cooler."

","I did not look at the reviews before I watched this DVD.  I came to the conclusion that it was f a r better than I anticipated it to be.<br/><br/>For a start, it was well-paced, and not crash-bang-wollop from the start, as some ""super hero"" movies tend to be.  Neither was it tedious or dialogue-bound (like Mission to Mars).  Overall, there was a quite serious feel to it, but it was well tempered by tongue-in-cheek moments and the unavoidable camp overlay.<br/><br/>Wolverine was by far the best character - a sort of old fashioned, no-nonesense, cowboy character.  He echoed my view of Cyclops, who appeared glib and overconfident.  Talking of Cyclops, we could have done with seeing more of his special ability.  This was my favourite character in the 60s comic mags, but was more mature and aloof than the slick college-type we saw in this film.  Storm's effects were more a sort of ""storm in a teacup"", and as for Rogue...pleeeeze! (a sort of wild-card, and handy for the plot).<br/><br/>The ""baddies"" had some interesting characters.  So Magneto was a survivor of a WW2 concentration camp?  An interesting, if not obvious analogy between Jews/undesirables, and modern day mutants.  Didn't think much of the snarling dude, but Toad was brilliant!!  I'm not sure how he could have a stereotyped London accent when brought up/hatched in North America, but what the hey.  His demeanour (and accent) made him a sort of Dickensian villain - almost loveable.  The part where he did a little jig during a piece of naughtiness, was excellent.  The way he was dispatched was pathetic.<br/><br/>Yes - not a bad film.  Get the popcorn in, some nice cold pop/beer, sit back, mutate and enjoy...       7/10"

","The movie here is very refined, there is less action than I hoped and less complications, it's just like a feature length translation of a cartoon episode but in the compilation only.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman in the lead role is a standout but more credit should be given to the two veterans Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. After the dodgey turn of the Obi Wan role in spawn and the rather lacking performance of Kris Kristopherson in Blade it is great to see two such respectable actors as McKellan and Stewart commiting so much quality and belivability to something this trivial.<br/><br/>The story is extremely concise but all round the performances make this more a character based work. It was great to see Park staying present in his off the wall job as toad (did you notice the pole move he did at the top of the elevator shaft, an evident reference to his previous and most famous film role as Darth Maul, he has 3 hits to his name now, though his casting as the headless horsemen can almost be taken as an insult. He does not get half the credit he deserves for his talent of mixing action and character.<br/><br/>I wanted more Wolverine action, easily the best character of the series, I suppose the lack of fight scenes in general though made this more a kids experience and gave more light to the characters. I look forward to sequel, I suspect they did with this what was done with the Toy Story pair, have just enough of a good thing in the original to make the sequel twice as entertaining, I suspect they will toss in all the action scenes and enjoy greater success with Part II. The latest craze seems to be beating originals, M:I 2, Toy Story 2, Star Wars I, Hannibal and The Mummy Returns has already topped it's originals domestic tally and is showing strength overseas.<br/><br/>X-Men deserves a 7.5/10"

","When I was about 6 or 7 years old, I collected X-Men cards, comics, and toys.  I even watched the cartoon.  I loved it because it was such a great original idea.  Therefore when I saw the first preview of the movie, I was thrilled.  Everyone was perfectly cast in their parts.  The acting was great because everyone was their parts.  I mostly enjoyed Famke Janssen as Dr. Jean Grey and James Marsden as Scott Summers(Cyclops).  Famke is just a great actress whom I admire for her ability to play people of all trades. You may remember her as Evelyn Price in House on Haunted Hill.  She does great in all of her movies.  And for James, this movie is a great stretch for him.  He has almost the fewest lines, I believe Ray Park takes the fewest, but even without lines his acting is great.  He too can play many different types of characters.  <br/><br/>The movie is about a young girl, Rogue(Paquin), who, after discovering her powers, runs away from home.  While on the road, she meets a drifter, Logan/Wolverine(Jackman), with similar problems as her.  They are alike in the fact that they are gifted.  So after getting on the road and after having a proper aquaintance, they run into some trouble.  They are taken to a safe place where they meet many people with gifts.  While there, Rogue comes familiar with Robert Drake/Iceman(Ashmore).  Logan meets the creator, Professor Charles Xavier(Stewart), and his ""task force"", including, Scott Summers/Cyclops(Marsden), Jean Grey(Janssen), and Ororo Munroe/Storm(Berry). It is explained to him that their nemesis; Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto(McKellen) and his confidants Raven Darkholme/Mystique(Romijn-Stamos), Mortimer Toynbee/Toad(Park), and Victor Creed/Sabretooth(Mane); believe that there is a war brewing between mutants and humans and it is there duty to keep balance with humans and mutants and stop Magneto. <br/><br/>
Overall it's a great movie.  Perfect acting, perfect casting, everything was perfect.  All of my expectations were met and even conquered.  There are a few in-jokes that relate back to the comics.  Hilarious.  Everything is believable about this movie.  This is one of the best movies of the summer.<br/><br/>-A++"

","I say ""relievingly"" because there's always an inner fear that lies silent in our hearts when a piece of pop culture, especially comics and novels, is put on the big screen. X-men doesn't disappoint as others have. It's a truly good movie. I suppose for avid X-men fans, which I am not, the movie may lack certain key characters or twist facts. Nonetheless, the movie was great in its own right without judging it on preconceived ideas and notions. What I loved most was that the director took the movie seriously so adults could enjoy it---with or without the kids. Brian Singer scores well in taking fantasy and putting it in a ""real life"" world so we could relate to it better.<br/><br/>So overall a solid film.

","I am a devout follower of the X-men in comic form and was thoroughly excited when I heard of this film. X-men are one of the best comics ever produced by Marvel, and certainly the first choice to lead Marvel back into the film industry. Yet this film still wasn't perfect. Many of the scenes were impressive, a lot of good acting and familiar charcters that die-hard fans will recognise. All-in-all this film was designed to introduce the world to the X-men. It doesn't have a lot of the deep story or plot threads that are evident in the comics, but it provides the base for a sequel (whoich will inevitably come). Considering that this was done on a smaller budget than usual, this is a good film. The use of little-known actors helped (can you imagine some big name star i.e. Keanu Reeves, as Wolverine?) though the story seemed to be centred too much around Wolverine and Rogue. Good start for Marvel I think."
"dover","8","0","0","15 July 2000"," Plenty of bang for your buck
","This movie is the perfect example of a summer blockbuster done right. All the elements were in place. There was a well-developed storyline 30 years in the making, and director/co-writer Bryan Singer (from ""The Usual Suspects"") spends enough time on character development and story that the movie does not adopt the feel many sci-fi/action films do of simply being a vehicle for destruction.<br/><br/>The action is good, but not overwhelming, and the better parts are based on the interpersonal relationships between the characters. The acting is very good. The movie has one actor from about every other extremely popular sci-fi movie series: The two leading mutants are Patrick Stewart (a.k.a Capt. Picard), who is perfect for this role. Ian McKellen (Gandalf in the upcoming Lord of the Rings trilogy) is also quite good as the evil genius Magneto. I really liked Ray Park's (also Darth Maul) character ""Toad"", the only bad guy other than Magneto with any personality.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman are very good as Rogue and Wolverine, the central characters here, though if you're a familiar with the comics, Paquin will look a little strange until the end. Rogue is portrayed as too much of a kid here for my tastes, but it doesn't detract largely from the story. The other are fine as well. The relationship between Wolverine, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen, from the Bond series while I'm at it) provide the wittiest dialogue. Halle Berry's Storm is sort of removed on a personal level from the other X-Men, and her dialogue is the worst among them, but the makeup and appearance of her character more than make up for it.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a really enjoyable movie, well worth the two hours it ran, and has me looking forward to the sequel."

","As far as comic book adaptations go, there seem to be two kinds of film: the good ones (Tim Burton's Batmans) and the hideously bad ones (Superman IV, Batman Returns, Batman Forever etc). The 2000 adaptation of X-Men belongs in the former category, thanks to some excellent casting and a well thought-out story.<br/><br/>People have criticised the film as deviating too much from the official X-Men canon. I kind of suspect these people are the same ""geniuses"" who levelled the same criticism at Batman, so I will run the following question by you all: suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace. Would you be running around in multi-coloured spandex, parading around like a hero, or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other people's fear. As a sufferer of a present-day equivalent of the mutations shown in this film, I know what my answer is. <br/><br/>The modification of the story to show Rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke. Not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are (more so than the normies in this film, as a matter of fact), but casting a delicate, intelligent young woman like Anna Paquin in the role was a perfect capitalisation on the writing. Coupling this with the way Wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiement who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea, too. Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for the role. As a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters' histories in a more figurative sense, I found these two actors utterly believeable in all respects.<br/><br/>The only thing wrong with the movie, in my view, is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written. Mystique, Toad, and Sabretooth just don't have the same level of character development allocated to them as Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm. Mystique gets one line in the whole film (the rest are her pretending to be someone else), and Toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots. Capping that off is the fact that Magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the Nazis. Granted, he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants, but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for Magneto to become so like his real enemy.<br/><br/>Aside from the uneven development of the characters, however, this is another near-great modern adaptation of a comic book. It works on numerous levels and is extremely pleasant to watch."

","This movie was like a glass half full.<br/><br/>As much as I do not enjoy debating whether a glass of milk is half full or half empty, in this case, I have no choice but to join in and declare that this movie is like a glass half full as we were only able to catch glimpses of what this movie is fully capable of showing us.<br/><br/>Personally, I believe the decision to move the story along at a brisk pace with hardly any pause has cost us in that we are unable to get to know any of the mutant heroes in depth  and there were lots of them.  They were therefore reduced to cardboard mock ups providing thrills and spills at the whim of puppet handlers and the movie suffered as a result since the story was now completely plot driven and relying on set pieces none of which were ingenuous or original.<br/><br/>There was great potential for characterisation in this movie as well as great potential for a much stronger theme.<br/><br/>Instead the theme appears to have been buried and forgotten much in favour of putting bums on seats and I mean twelve-year-old ones.<br/><br/>Take the case of Wolverine for example, a character begging to be explored in full.  Instead we were teased a lot about his past but learnt nothing. . . .Or Professor Xavier, or Rogue.  I am not impressed with the reason Magneto turned bad either.  I understand his paranoia, but it is no justification for his subsequent actions.  I expect the real reason is probably on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>I have not read the comics and I hate it when comics are adapted for the movies as virtually no one would be fully happy with the final outcome. But even though I never heard of X-Men before the movie, what I saw here was great potential but suffering as a result of the commercialisation of Hollywood.  I long for the old days of Hollywood when movies were work of Art that could entertain for generations.  X-Men isn't one of these movies. I suspect a reworking of the movie and its underlying theme could benefit us but not the moneymen."

","First I must say that I have never read an ""X-Men"" comic, so my critics refer only on the film...<br/><br/>At the beginning, the entrance sequence in the concentration camp, I though I was in ""Schindler´s List"", but not in a Sci-fi movie and I waited in vain for an explanation for that phenomenon. And there are some more problems that ran through the whole film: ""X-Men"" is no typical popcorn movie, because the suspense is too low, there is too less action and there were better special F/X in other films. It is also no final speech for more tolerance towards minorities, because this aspect stays surface, and although there is always the talk about war between humans and mutations the plot stays empty. And finally, this film takes itself much to serious: there are no jokes, no gags, no sense for dark humor as we have seen it in ""Blade"", for example. And then the so-called GREAT cast... Well, the actors do a solid job, but great..? Patrick Steward performing the leader of the bunch is nothing else but playing Captain Picard in a wheelchair. Ian McKellen is a great actor, that´s right. But if you wanna see great performances watch his other films! I don´t know why Halle Berry stays in the background with her role and otherwise why Wolverine´s part is so important, although Hugh Jackman is a much better actor then Russell Crowe! From the rest of the cast - Famke Jansen, James Mardsen, Anna Paquin... - you get the usual quality you would expect, but none of them has deserved an Oscar for their roles!<br/><br/>Now, there are also some good points about ""X-Men"": it´s very difficult to make good comic adaptations without compromising yourself to much and being ridiculous. Director Bryan Singer has definitely made one of the better comic adaptations, although this film is still too overrated in my opinion. (6/10)"

","There was so much pre-release buzz surrounding this movie.  As a result, I think that going into the theater I expected too much from this movie. I thought this was going to be a movie that would rival ""The Matrix"". I thought that I was going to walk out of the theater feeling so inspired by the movie that I'd want to go to a store and purchase X-Men action figures (and I'm 25 years old). Well, I wasn't disappointed. It just wasn't as good a movie as I had hoped it would be. What can I say about Hugh Jackman as Wolverine? He did a great job, he was excellent in that role. I liked seeing Ian McKellen as Magneto. It was great to see him play a villain. I also liked seeing Patrick Stewart as Dr. Charles Xavier. They both were perfectly cast. I especially liked their chess-playing scene together. I didn't like Halle Berry as Storm though. She had little screen time and ANY attractive black actress could've played that character. I didn't like the Mystique character all that much either (and why cast Rebecca Romijn in the role?). Although she kicked some butt, she was just basically there to be looked at and to wiggle her nicely-shaped body. I wish Anna Paquin's character, Rogue, would've been given SOMETHING to do; all she did was spend her time moping. I would've liked to see her extract the energy from one of the villains. But I liked seeing Anna all grown up. She has come a long way from the cartwheeling little girl in ""The Piano"". I also think that the Jean Gray character should've been given a lot more to do with her telekenesis (but I certainly enjoyed seeing the very beautiful Famke Janssen in that role). Much was said about this movie's special effects prior to the movie's release. I found the visual effects to be rather fake-looking. They were certainly disappointing--nothing that we haven't seen before. In fact, the fight sequences themselves (the moves that the characters had) were a lot more notable than the visual effects. The movie's biggest plus? That for an action movie, it actually had a story, and that the director focused on the story. I thought that the ending was very interesting, and so was the music that accompanied the final scene. Overall, ""X-Men"" is good as a summer movie, and it's a good way to spend two hours. It did rekindle my interest in comic books (reading them, not collecting them). Hopefully the sequel will be much better. I would like to see a different set of ""mutants"" with superhuman abilities that are even more amazing. It's going to take a lot to top ""The Matrix""."

X-Men the film succeeds in placing interesting characters in stunning settings while facing disturbing social problems.  It also succeeds as a highly imaginative action flick.<br/><br/>This film includes a very strong performance by Hollywood newcomer Hugh Jackman, well supported by superstars like Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, and fellow rising star Anna Paquin who is perhaps best known for her childhood debut in Oscar-winner The Piano.  X-Men's visual effects are stunning as expected.  But the one thing that really surprises me is the near-prefect casting.  Famke Janssen is beyond perfectly cast as Jean, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem born for the roles of Professor Xavier and Magneto, and the naturally radiant Halle Berry is wonderful as Storm.  The scenes shared by Jean, Jackman as Wolverine, and James Marsden as Cyclops are very human, and the script and direction manage to inject a lot of clever and light-hearted humor into a relatively dark plot."

Oh, yeah i forgot there is going be a sequel! So the result is that X-men are not a self-containted movie, because Singer was strugling to make this a franchise! So, there is no point in making this film without a sequel. But this is a very well directed movie, it has the greatest art direction since the Terminator 2 film. Wolverine is played very nice by Hugh Jackman. Magneto is played very good and Professor-X too, but Singer is strangely very attracted by Magneto, so in all the movie although Magneto Kicks Asses, he is consider to be a sociopath!

I guess Bryan Singer really did a good job here.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine, and I could not imagine him playing other role, nor another person playing this role. Wolverine is not my favorite character though, but obviously he's the director's favorite because the whole movie revolves around him.<br/><br/>James Marsden is the perfect Cyclops, unlike other people's suggestion. He would be great playing Spiderman too, but somehow the role goes to Tobey Maguire.<br/><br/>Other casts also suit perfectly into their alter-egos. I don't see any flaws in this area.<br/><br/>The storyline is perfect, not too ordinary, not too draggy. It would be hard to achieve the same standard should they decide to come up with a sequel (or sequels...)."

","Good comic movies are few and far between, and none of them have ever really been Marvel-based.  Sure, ""Blade"" wasn't too bad, but it was nothing like the original ""Superman"" or ""Batman"" movies.<br/><br/>Well, ""X-Men"" has changed all that.<br/><br/>I was excited about this movie, but not expecting too much. However, as I sat through the movie, I felt that goofy, fanboy smile creep across my face as I realized that this movie got the point what the X-Men were all about: Not a good mutant/bad mutant battle, but individual people and the prejudice mutants face.  Every doubt or concern about the director's previous lack of knowledge of the series or even casting choices for certain characters faded as I took everything in.  They got it all right.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was a perfect Wolverine, as was Patrick Stewart for Professor X.  Actually, the entire cast really played their parts well, and seemed to understand their character's personalities.  Even the Cyclops/Jean Grey/Wolverine love triangle was added, as was the Cyclops/Wolverine rivalry.  Everything from Wolverine's ""bub"", to cameos from Iceman, Jubilee and Shadowcat kept me satisfied.  I so wanted X-Men to be taken seriously, and it was, and finally, a new comic movie has finally been given respect. The special effects just added more to the overall excitement, and the plot and dialogue sounded like a comic book entry. (Take that last comment as ""authentic"".) <br/><br/>I know they have sequels lined up for the future, and I pray that those new movies will be shown as much care as this one.  Still, this one is a fun ride, and it gives me hope that a Spider-Man movie might actually be decent after all.  I can't wait to get this one on DVD."

","X Men reminded me so much of Mystery men but without the comedy ! This is no critisism because both film are good and have there own merits. X Men is about the struggle between battling mutants who all have super human powers. Patrick Stewert is the leader of the good mutants and Ian Mckellen plays the bad guy. (why are  the bad guys always English?). The Story is fairly good although you cant help but think this is just a pre-curser to a sequal because it takes a fair chunk of the movie just to explain who the mutants are and what their supernatural backgrounds are. Special affects are very good as you would expect and the sound is quite amazing. As long as you dont take X Men to seriously you should enjoy it. 7 out of 10."

Yes, The Beast wasn't there (Although I was a little disappointed with that ommision).<br/><br/>But if you look at the movie from a neutral view, I thought it was a fanastic movie.  To take a movie and rip it apart because it isn't ""true"" to what has been laid before it for canonical reasons is ridiculous.<br/><br/>
I went into the theater not expecting anything.  Because if I did go in and started to compare the movie with the comics and the animated series, I feel I would have lost the whole point of the experience. The Special Effects are just that - special.  No huge CG stuff (except for Mystique's shape changes), but the SFX we subtle, I actually did double takes on some of the scenes.  Come on, didn't you kinda freak out when the girl walked through Professor Xavier's door?  It's Visual Effects like that that make a lasting impression on movie-goers.<br/><br/>I have yet to see a movie that takes a book/TV Series, and does it justice on the big screen (with the exception of ""Hunt for Red October"").  But this movie comes awfully close."

This premise was great because its difficult to disagree with the villain, Magneto, on his stance, and his bitterness is understandable.

Also rogue was nothing like the sassy suthern gal' of the animated series, rather she was a whimpering puppy. I suppose if you have never heard of the x-men, then this is a worthwhile introduction, otherwise I would wait for a sequel with more characters and a half-decent plot.

","I'd been looking forward to this movie for months before it opened, due to the casting of Ray Park alone. And then one day I woke up and suddenly realized, ""Holy crud, this is going to be a *comic book* movie!"" and until opening day I had an uneasy lump in the pit of my stomach telling me that all comic book movies are doomed to suck. But X-Men actually succeeded in breaking the curse and turned out to be rather intelligent and extremely engrossing. The acting is excellent on all accounts but one (that means you, Halle Berry), and combined with good special effects and great directing on the part of Brian Singer, manages to overcome a fairly weak plot (Magneto's going to unwittingly kill the world's leaders? Oh no! Why not just ask him to postpone another year until Dubya's in office and everybody is subsequently happy?). Overall, a great movie that's even managed to get me started watching the cartoon and reading the comics."

","A certain amount of scepticism was my first reaction when i heard of the making of this movie. It has been tried several times to bring comic-characters to life, and somehow it's never been a big success. When i heard of the casting of actors like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen to play the roles of Xavier and Magneto, I also became aware Singer was trying to bring some real acting in this movie, and not trying to make comic-book copies only. The result is even better than i expected. Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin and the two great actors mentioned above make this movie worth watching. The story and plot haven't disappeared amongst the special effects and even some characters are deepened and you feel the tension and involvement with characters, story and people. All in all not the best movie in the world, but due to good acting, a fairly good plot, a nice story, and some beautiful scenes as well as not too much and too heavy aggressive scenes this movie has become one of the better comic-book films and guarantees almost two hours of fun and entertainment. Four stars out of five, i would say."
"popland","8","0","0","5 February 2001"," Now if they could start people reading the comic books!
","I began reading comics again in 1982, after completing my 2-½ year national service and entering law school. It was the X-Men that revived my interest, having picked up Paul Smith's final issue (the one with Mastermind on the cover) at the corner shop back in the days before speciality stores even existed in Singapore. I have stopped reading X-Men for a long time now (though I did check out Chris Claremont's disappointing return to the book that made his name). That title has failed to excite me since the 80s but thanks to Bryan Singer, that sense of wonder has returned! The X-Men movie has been talked about for too long, as the best-selling comic book of all time, the weight of expectation was considerable. Furthermore, as the comic industry as a whole is in a crisis, much has been invested into the X-Men movie as the event to 'save' comics. No doubt about it, X-Men is an unqualified success! Given the inherent difficulties in putting together a plausible film dramatisation of super-heroes, Singer has managed to deliver a movie guaranteed to please both fans and casual moviegoers alike. Much of this success is clearly owed to Singer's clarity of vision, to be faithful to the universe (as the young director himself stated in an interview). Thus, we are spared cringe-worthy moments that dragged down the Superman & Batman movies, not to mention the risible movies previously attempted on Marvel characters (Reb Brown as Captain America, anyone?) In this respect, the casting has been superb. Notably the rather fortunate circumstances by which Aussie Hugh Jackson ended up as the Canadian X-Man, Wolverine. Originally, the role had been won by Dougray Scott, but an accident on the MI-2 set forced Scott to withdraw leaving the way open for Jackson. Having witnessed Scott's tepid performance in MI-2 and Jackson's dynamic turn as Wolverine, it's fair to say that the X-Men movie lucked out! Patrick Stewart & Hugh McKellen bring their wealth and talent to the meaty parts of Charles Xavier (never Professor X) and Magneto. McKellen is particularly memorable, consigning to history the awful comic book movie villains of yore: Hackman's Luther & Nicholson's Joker. The plot is tight, the motivations logical and the effects are incredible, Ray (Darth Maul) Park's Toad has to be seen to be believed!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast perform their scenes competently without fuss (except maybe for a sorely under-used Halle Berry, she does look good though with Storm's patented white hair) but it's Jackson and McKellen who steal the show. Matrix proved last year that movie-goers could assimilate comic book concepts and storytelling (that's what it was, folks), X-Men establishes that the source material can certainly stand on its own. Now if they could start people reading the damn things"

","There are three rules for movies that are adapted from comics:  First, the movie must spend time covering the back story of its characters for newcomers such as I, before it launches into its first adventure.  But, secondly, the movie must do this quickly enough that it doesn't turn off long-time fans of the comic, who are likely to be the movie's greatest critics.  Thirdly, the movie must serve as a flagship for sequels.  That means it has to leave us wanting to know and see more about the characters.<br/><br/>X-Men succeeds all three accounts.  Although there are more characters than in most super hero movies, writer-director Bryan Singer and writing partner Tom DeSanto introduce good guys Professor X, Dr. Jean Grey, Cylops, Storm, Rogue and especially Wolverine efficiently and satisfyingly.  They do a similarly good job helping us get to know the chief villain Magneto, but less so with the other bad guys.  We'd like to know more about Sabretooth, Toad-and particularly Mystique-but, alas, there's not enough time to do so. Finally, the film left me wanting to see to see a sequel-particularly to find out more about Wolverine.<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is good.  Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto) are both strong presences.  Famke Janssen and James Marden are fine as Jean Grey and Cyclops, respectively, but Halle Berry's looks horrible as Storm, and her acting matches her looks.  Anna Paquin is nice as Rogue, but we sense we'll see a lot more of her in the future. The breakout star of the movie, however, is Hugh Jackman, as the feral Wolverine.  <br/><br/>X-Men, like most comic strips, strives for something deeper than just super heroes doing their thing.  The theme of the movie is intolerance.  That's evident from the first scene, set in a Nazi concentration camp, to scenes of Sen. Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) trying to pass laws requiring mutants to be registered.  The movie's point is that, like other humans, there are good and bad mutants.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad start for what is likely to be a long-living franchise."

I could imagine the moviemakers wandering all over the map without focus, making a real hash of things. <br/><br/>What a surprise when the movie proved my fears groundless. What could have happened (an unfocused mess) didn't happen, and the chief thanks belongs with the screenplay; it made the movie.  It's tight, well crafted, and focused. It's not played for camp, but straight up. With lots of help from a talented cast, and direction, ""X-Men"" makes for a very entertaining fantasy film.

","X-Men felt more like the pilot episode of a TV series than a feature-length movie. This may because the movie basically introduces the characters and doesn't do much beyond that. There's very little story here what story there is ends so quickly that you can't help but wonder where the rest of it is. In truth, this story, with its ensemble cast, would probably be better suited for TV where, over a number of episodes, they could get into all the characters. This movie focuses mostly on Wolverine and Rogue and avoids the other X-Men. Cyclops and the rest seemed more like extras than stars.<br/><br/>As for the translation of the characters to the big screen, Hugh Jackman is excellent as Wolverine. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan do pretty well as Professor X and Magneto but some of the other characters don't translate so well. Toad and Sabretooth (Chewbacca?) didn't look too threatening as villains. As for the other X-Men, they looked okay but I'll have to wait until the next movie when they actually do something."
"eshuroger","Null","0","0","24 January 2001"," Better than the comic.
","Yes, I've read X-Men, but I'm not a hardcore fan, and hardcore fans will undoubtedly have problems with the movie.  I thought that most of the changes were well thought out and beneficial to the movie though.  Rogue's powers that were stolen from Ms. Marvel don't appear in the movie, and neither does her constant whining about being forever denied the simple joys of human touch.  Anna Paquin makes the character more real by getting the tragic part of the character through to the audience, but not hammering it into them with the overblown melodrama the comic has been known for. Rogue is a much more likeable character in the movie than she ever has been before, though the name ""Rogue"" is still stupid, being a holdover from her days as an evil mutant, and so named because she ""steals"" powers from others.  It made little sense in this context, but if they didn't call her Rogue, your average X-Men fan wouldn't have known who she was.<br/><br/>Storm was also made likeable in this movie, a herculean feat to be sure. She lost all of the melodramatic lines that made her stale in the comics and came across as more of a real person.<br/><br/>The special effects were great considering the limited budget they had to work with.  They didn't overdo any of the power effects, and chose to use them sparingly, but use them effectively.  The scene where Cyclops blew the roof off of the train station was beautiful, and the fight on top of the statue of liberty has got to be one of the best movie fight scenes ever, just for the setting if for no other reason.<br/><br/>On the other hand, I didn't feel that Mystique was changed in a positive way.  I don't know what the deal was with her costuming, and no mention was made of her relationship with Rogue.<br/><br/>Wolverine was well done, though this comes from a guy who has never much liked Wolverine.  Hugh Jackson certainly looks the part, and plays it well, though he is too tall.  One is left to wonder why his claws are straight at the end of the movie, after Magneto has repeatedly twisted and bent them. It's clear that Wolverine doesn't like Cyclops from their first meeting, but what isn't clear is why.  The rivalry between them could have been expanded on, and explained a little, though the love triangle is still basically there.  I have always said that Jean's real mutant power is the ability to make all the male X-Men fall in love with her, and it seems that hasn't changed.  The point is that Cyclops doesn't seem to really do anything to make Wolverine dislike him, which causes Wolverine to come off as a jerk, but then, maybe that isn't all that inappropriate.<br/><br/>Cameos from Kitty Pryde, Bobby Drake and Jubilee were appreciated by the comics fans, though I was hoping to see their involvement expanded.<br/><br/>I understand that Singer wanted to include Nightcrawler, but budget limitations made it difficult.  Maybe the sequel will throw him in.  I can only guess that the Hellfire Club will be the adversaries next time around.<br/><br/>Anyway, I thought that the movie was as true to the comic as was efficient, and the changes that were made were mostly good choices.  Hardcore X-Men fans are being a little hard on it."

The reason is that the world of _X Men_ the comic book / animation series is, let's admit it right now, one of the most elaborate science fiction universes this side of ""Star Wars"".  How can you possibly please the ""newbies"" and yet not alienate the long time fans?<br/><br/>And this isn't meant to stereotype, but you *know* how dead-serious sci/fi fans can get.  I should know, sort of being one myself.<br/><br/>Well, it turns out that nobody needed to worry.  Amazingly, this is not only one of the better movies of the year (a phenomenal year for high-profile bad movies), it's also one of the smartest.  I like how they focused on character development, as that is the strength of the original comics as well.  And I liked how several characters from the comics were given ""cameos"" of sorts.<br/><br/>Two little details I have to pick at here.  I'm not sure that I liked how they killed off the most interesting antagonist (and in an unnecessarily gruesome scene at that).  Also, make sure that you get to watch the bonus scenes at the end of the video.  They clarify a lot of the various subplots, so I can't think of why they were cut out at all.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this movie was excellent and I highly recomend it even if you don't like ""comic book movies"".

Also, I missed some classic players as Gambit, Beast and (my other favorite) Jubilee. Now, although I understand that Gambit came after the Original Xmen, Beast was Professor X's 1st mutant.

In fact, Cyclops made a joke about the yellow spandex that many of us wanted to see.  Instead of appearing modern and futuristic, the X-MEN came off as cheap and pathetic.  The real disappointment was that of Rogue, who was portrayed as a mewling weakling barely out of a training bra.  Rogue, whose powers include flight, superhuman strength, and the draining of powers, couldn't even free herself from the seat of a car.  This is not the fault of Anna Paquin, whom I feel acted just as her part was written.  Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) was also outstanding in his role.  He managed to show the wang leather of Wolverine, along with the caring side usually reserved only for those he trusted (Morph and Jean).  James Marsden (Cyclops) played the jackass to a T.  However, Jean and Storm couldn't have been more useless had they stood around and played pattycake.  In her fight with Toad, Storm quickly walks away and pauses to hold up a hand as if she were expecting a high-five instead of a boot to the head.  Jean uses her powers to float a needle across the table and to shut a closet door.  Oooh.  All of the women, save Mystique--who could scarcely be called a woman with her lizard-like appearance--were pathetically, well, pathetic.  Also, the movie was lacking the spice that was provided by characters such as Gambit, Nightcrawler, and Beast.  There was more chemistry between Jean and Wolverine than that of her and her husband.  This movie was carried by the appearance of Patrick Stewart, whom I felt was the obvious choice for the all-seeing Professor.  Fifteen minutes into the movie, the only reason I had for watching was to count how many mistakes were being made.  And I lost count."

Further, the entire effort came off as a bit forced to me. Everyone seemed bored just being there and if you're a fan of the comic, there are far too many holes to allow.

However, I was anxious to see ""X-Men"" the movie, as it had received a lot of publicity during it's theatrical release, and the trailers for it looked enticing. After watching the movie on DVD, I was impressed with the special effects, and the surround sound employed, but the story left much to be desired. The idea of a race of mutants living amongst us, and possessing extraordinary powers has a lot of potential. I felt however, that a much of that potential was wasted by the seemingly lacklustre story. It certainly seemed as though the premise of this film was simply to introduce the characters and then create the setting for a (hopefully better) sequel. For me, the lack of resolution in this movie, made it seem too much like a 'part1', rather than a movie capable of standing on it's own merits. Watch it and see for yourself.

One of the major problems is<br/><br/>""How do you create an hour and a half long movie, which has to incorporate about 30 years of comic book characters, making it all understandable to people who have never heard of the X-men, but keeping it true to the comics, all the while having an interesting plot line ???????""<br/><br/>Somehow this got done.  Admittedly if you are a massive fan of the comics, some of the introduction is just repitition to what you already know, but this can't be avoided.  There are a few references to the comics (""what would you prefer - yellow spandex?"") refers to the comic book costume, but this doesn't take anything away from the movie if you've never seen a comic book before.<br/><br/>The actual casting is terrific.  It does seem that Halle Berry who plays Storm is just in the movie so X-men lovers don't complain ""where's torm""  - She doesn't actutally have a lot to do, and what she does do in the movie could easily have been given to another character.<br/><br/>Framke Janssen does very well in portraying her relationships with her teacher (Prof X), her lover (Cyclops) and her ...... well whatever Wolverine is to her.  Interesting to note nothing mentioned about Phoenix - possibly setting up for a future part in a sequel.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, it seems very likely that a sequel will be done, and after using this film to set up all the characters, hopefully a more established plot can be made.<br/><br/>Anyway, well worth seeing unless you hate sci-fi / fantasy / action films, or if you love the comics so much you'll hate seeing Rogue as a young girl instead of a woman."

","Marching orders for the director: Make an entertaining, action-heavy live-action version of the X-Men comic book.  Spend a lot of money on costumes, make-up, and even more on special effects.  Be true to the comic book as much as possible.  And above all, take it seriously.<br/><br/>What's really amazing is that director Bryan Singer succeeds, but the movie is still not the A+ adaptation that was possible.  ""Batman"" gave us the kind of re-invented, action-packed movie we were really after.  And X-Men, while a very, very good film, is by no means a GREAT film.  The only reason I can conceive of is just that Singer is no better than his script.  The screenplay for ""The Usual Suspects"" won an Oscar, and it was a great film. The screenplay for ""Apt Pupil"" was amateurish and not at all thought out or researched, and the result was a below average film.  ""Public Access"" made little sense to me, either.<br/><br/>Future generations may have their own opinion of this movie (or none at all), but it's nice to see someone made a decent movie out of these historical characters.  Considering the alternative (""Spawn""-- whoops), I've gotta give these guys an A for effort, but their movie's a B.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Now this is what a comic book movie should be like. Action, adventure, fight scenes, special effects, sweet superheros with awesome superpowers. X-Men has lifted the curse from Marvel Comics. This film was amazing. This is what Star Wars: Episode 1 was looking for in introducing characters to the world but we all know it fell short. Story runs like this, Mutants are outcast to the world and a Senator Robert Kelly(Bruce Davison) has taken it upon himself to be the leader in getting rid of these mutants. Trying to breech the gap between mutants and humans is a professor Charles Xavier(Patrick Stweart) who runs a school for mutants. But his best friend, a mutant named Magneto(Ian McKellen) wants to rid the world of humans and for mutants to rule the world. So it's up to Xavier and his X-Men team to stop them. This is totally a comic book film from the get go. The CGI opening, the special effects, the costumes, the high powered action, it's like the pages were glue to a movie screen. There are great performances too. Huge Jackman is well on his way to Hollywood action star. Thank you John Woo for running the MI:2 taping past when it was suppose to be done. I liked Dougray Scott in that but I don't think that he would have done Wolverine respect like Jackman does. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is very cool as Mystique. She doesn't say much but has on-screen presence, she looks gorgeous and she can fight. This film lives up to and blows way beyond the hype. Finally we have a film lives up to it's word. This is a comic book fantasy that goes down with Superman, Batman and Blade as one of the best comic book films of all time. X-Men is phat and a great thrill ride."

In this movie we get a strangely compassionate, watered down, milk toast version.  Like everyone else in this movie. The movie wanted to sell merchandising, appeal to fast food restaurants and teenagers.  It never wanted to explore the darker side of the comic.  The part that makes it distinctively X-men.

That was a challenge, that only a serious, competent and talented director will ever accept. In other words Bryan Singer. Bryan does a hell of a job in this masterpiece of cinema. He introduces you into a very particular universe, and makes you really ENJOY it! The first two scenes are impressive! He takes you into a very dramatic and complex world. And you like it. Then he takes you into a school, that is full of mutant teenagers, and you enjoy it. He takes into a very actioned, FX and fun world, and you Like it! Thanks to a very competent crew, that knew how to shoot the scenes, the light, the actors, the director of photography really knew, and understood the X-Men.

","X-Men is a great Sci-fi Action film! I am a fan of the comics and I did watch the incredible X-Men cartoon series from 1992-1998. Bryan Singer did a great job at staying true to the comic as best he could, like the fact that he kept in the bitterness between Scott ""Cyclops"" Summers and Logan ""Wolverine"" over Jean Grey. There were a few things I didn't like, like how Rogue was a teenager with just the ability to absorb others memories and powers, instead of the voluptuous women with also super strength, invulnerability, and the ability to fly, which I hope they solve in a sequel because Rogue is my favorite super hero out of them all besides just X-Men. I also think they could have chosen a better set of villains besides like Toad. But that's really minor and I don't care to much. Nonetheless I thought the casting was incredible, Patrick Stewart is the spitting image of Professor X, so was Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halle Berry as Storm, basically everybody was.

","I've not seen a comic hero from my childhood brought to the screen with this kind of devotion to the original since Superman (1978).<br/><br/>Making the X-Men real was equally difficult, more so in many ways. It's darker, edgier, and certainly more political. They had to handle the balance between reality and potential without getting lost on either side. All this, while injecting the sense of human issues that were at the heart of many X-Men sagas. The series was never black and white; it was all about shades of gray.<br/><br/>The film creates a believable present day (or near future) controversy on which to hang an 'us versus them' battle. It introduces the characters in a way that people who don't know the stories can get swept into things while leaving those with some background information confused about what, where and why (it's a comic book, within three minutes everyone knows the who and has some idea of the how).<br/><br/>It was very well cast with the exception of Halle Berry. As Storm she is just not sufficiently emotional. Unfortunately, she's also left to handle a big ""let's make a point"" scene of the issue... err movie. We're left not really feeling her pain about being an outcast mutant which makes it impossible to feel much one way or another from Senator Kelly's apology. I also had a feeling in a couple places that Patrick Stewart might have suggested some changes, making the dialog a bit forced at times.<br/><br/>Many people have commented in a negative fashion about the ending. All I can say is, they don't know or appreciate comic books. It's a comic book picture and has a true comic book ending.<br/><br/>Comic books have served as Philosophy 101 for our nations youth for many, many years and this film does justice to this series and its values. Comic series based on Superhero's were nearly always about the conflict of 'good versus evil', and while the battle was nearly always won, the war was far from over. That meant that most (or all) of the high echelon bad guys were dealt with, but the progeny of evil often skipped away (most often hurt in some way) to surface again in a later issue (or against some other hero). Occasionally, the hero suffered a serious setback, just to keep the whole game appearing honest. The ending wrapped up this battle in a rather tidy way, leaving the war far from decided."

This movie had the potential to go further, but they didn't.  104 minutes 9 of which they devote to credits.  If you view the DVD version it lets you add 10 minutes if you want.  But unlike many deleted scene's I've seen, these scenes at least some of them I'm glad they did delete because they didn't integrate too well into whatever plotline there was.  The plotline was so thin I coulda written it.  Lets see Magnito plans to turn us all into mutants. The ending sounds like a rip on X-Files.  Lock the bad guy in a plastic prison. They didn't really miscast anyone except my brother who is a X-Men purist whined about Paquin (Rogue) that Rogue should be in her 30's.  But how are legends created?  A little variant is needed from time to time.  Like William Wallace and bolts of lighting from his a*se.  It was nice to see Paquin (The Piano) again.  Looks to be the next Claire Danes at this rate. Jackman was beautifully cast.  Can't find a better man for the role of Wolverine.  Berry was fun as Storm.  That scene she had with the rather wet Senator was rather fun. But again this movie was too short.  All they really had was one plot and that was too thin of a plot.  You shouldn't be making a single comic book into a movie.  Combine a few of them will ya.  At least they got Judge Dredd right on that one. Rent/Buy the DVD obviously.  You can't watch these types of movies anymore on VHS because all the goodies have been sent to the DVD's.<br/><br/>

Director Bryan Singer truly captured the themes of loneliness and isolation that many experience in society today, even without mutant abilities. The struggle against prejudice was also another key element in this remarkable film. I was amazed by the haunting opening scene, as well as its continuing effect on the rest of the film. Also compelling were the relationships between the characters, and how in a remarkably brief amount of time, they had formed genuine bonds. The performances of Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman? truly stood apart from the rest. Finally, I think that this film demonstrated than anyone can find acceptance, all they must do is find the right group of people.

I came away impressed.<br/><br/>The acting was top-notch. I'm a big ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" fan. When I heard that Patrick Stewart was to portray Professor Xavier, I had mixed feelings. I had no doubt that he would do an excellent job in the role, but I was concerned that he might end up being an otherwise excellent actor in a lame movie (a la Sean Connery in ""The Avengers""). I was therefore very pleased to watch the movie and find that wasn't the case with X-Men. Stewart gave a stellar performance, opposite the equally excellent Sir Ian McKellen (""Magneto""). Other good performances were put in by Hugh Jackman (""Wolverine""), Anna Paquin (""Rogue""), and Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly).<br/><br/>Turning a comic book into a movie is a dangerous endeavor (again, look no further than ""The Avengers""), but X-Men pulled it off just right. The movie takes itself seriously (but not too seriously), and--from what I've heard--it remains pretty faithful to the existing X-Men story, without alienating the uninitiated. It also makes the viewer think about important issues, such as racism, instead of just being a brainless, explosion-filled, ammo-laden action movie. Yet the action is there, and movie never gets too heavy or preachy on the issues.<br/><br/>Visually, X-Men is stunning, featuring some really slick computer animation, particularly Wolverine's claws and the scene where Xavier uses the mind-machine to find Rogue.

","When I first saw the previews for this movie last year, I thought it was going to be another mildly entertaining Batman-like movie,with corny special effects and costumes, that would never fully make the transition from comic strip to film. Therefore, I was extremely surprised when this turned out to be both an excellent film and a visual masterpiece. Development of all the characters was done extremely well, from Rogue's first experience with her powers, to Wolverine's mysterious and haunting past. The acting was also excellent, with Australian newcomer Hugh Jackman doing an excellent portrayal of Wolverine. I found his and Rogue's emotional chemistry to be poignant, and showed a more caring side of his character. Also in the cast are such notables as Patrick Stewart,(Xavier), Halle Berry, (Storm), and Famke Janssen, (Jean Grey). The special effects are eye popping and imaginative, and include a final showdown on the top of the Statue of Liberty. The only thing that slightly varied from the comic strip, was Anna Paquin's portrayal of Rogue as a stoic, waifish teenager, instead of the voluptuous, firey bombshell. In spite of this, X-Men left almost nothing to be desired. This movie deserves a 9.9 out of 10."

Watching mutants fight each other using their different powers is of course fun to watch, but it`s little more than an eye candy super hero popcorn flick, not something to stimulate the intellect, like others have said.

Anna Paquin (who plays Rogue) constantly seems to have something large in her throat which means that she keeps gulping and gagging and distorting her voice. Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, and James Marsden were all wooden, and did not portray their characters too well. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, and Hugh Jackman were pretty good, though.<br/><br/>2.

"FlickJunkie-2","7","0","0","4 December 2000"," Spectacular form with little substance
","Though highly imaginative with astounding visual effects, `X-Men' explodes onto celluloid much the same way as most of the other comic book films, with a weak and predictable plot and characters as two dimensional as their paper counterparts.  This is not to say that it isn't entertaining because it is. It is very high on filmmaking `coolness' and the action is intense and impressive.  However, it suffers from excessive form and very little substance.<br/><br/>The science in this so-called science fiction story is laughable.  If we are to accept the premise presented here, suddenly, over a period of about 50 years, man takes a quantum leap in evolution and dozens of people develop superhuman powers with none of powers duplicated in any two mutants.  There is no explanation as to what triggered so many drastic mutations; it is just a sudden acceleration of evolution.  Well, evolution doesn't work that way, not even close.  Major evolutionary changes are generally separated by thousands or millions of years and it will usually be a single change in a species that elevates the whole species.  So the concept is really more fantasy than science fiction.<br/><br/>`Lighten up', you say.  `Who cares if it is science fiction or fantasy anyway?  It is just an awesome movie!'  That's a good point.  However, even fantasy films need a plot.  `X-Men' trots out the same tired storyline; good superheroes battle to save the world from bad superheroes as mere mortals helplessly look on.  There is nothing remotely novel or interesting about the story.<br/><br/>The film tries to make itself socially relevant with platitudinous comparisons between social injustice in human history and the persecution of the poor superhuman mutants.  However, the comparison is inapt since true persecution always flows from the strong to the weak and not vice-versa as depicted here.  Feeling sorry for the mutants is like pitying wealthy corporate executives because everyone fears and despises them.  They have the power.  How much sympathy can we have for them?<br/><br/>At the risk of inducing a lot of impassioned e-mail, I have to diverge from popular opinion about how great this film was.  This film was all sizzle and no steak.  There was only one character with a shred of substance and that was Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).  The rest were just cardboard cutouts.<br/><br/>In 1995, at the age of 29, wunderkind director Bryan Singer directed a brilliant and exquisitely complex film called `The Usual Suspects'.  He then burst into flames with `Apt Pupil', a dreadful film about a boy who became enamored with an elderly Nazi war criminal who was trying to live out his life quietly in the U.S.  After that disaster, he went underground until `X-Men'.  This film showed that Singer is a stickler for detail and he knows how to make a stupendously vacuous action flick, but it shows not a shred of nuance that would earn it the right to stand in the shadow of `Suspects'. That film showed that he has a certain directorial genius, but we are not likely to see it emerge again if he keeps taking lucrative, but shallow projects like this.<br/><br/>The acting; well, there wasn't much acting to be done.  Anna Pacquin and Hugh Jackman had the only parts that weren't utterly superficial.  Both of them did a good job, actually conjuring up some emotions other than resolute righteousness.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos looked about as sexy as a human being could when covered in reptilian body armor, and she said all six of her lines like a true professional.<br/><br/>I'm being overly hard on the film.  It wasn't bad.  It was very enjoyable. It just didn't deserve the raves that were doted on it.  I rated it a 7/10 on the strength of the visual effects and the action sequences.  These areas were an easy 10/10.  The screenplay was about a 3/10.  It's definitely worth seeing, but leave your brain at the door."

","I hear people saying that this is a movie that will intellectually stimulate them, and all these great things. Now, it`s a fun movie to watch (mutants exercising their powers on each other), but it`s really just a superhero movie that rushes from one thing to another with little flow to it. The plot is, a mutant named Rogue runs away from her house after finding out that whenever she touches someone she takes away their energy. She meets Wolverine, some mysterious character who has knives that come out of his hands and instant healing. They get rescued by Storm and Cyclops from Sabretooth, and then they meet Dr. Xavier who put Rogue in his school and Wolverine joins the ""Team"". Anna Paquin who plays Rogue seems to constantly have a huge gob of mucus in her throat, which means that she keeps gulping and distorting her voice. Wolverine is too mysterious to connect with, but Hugh Jackman did a good job playing him. Cyclops and Jean Grey`s romance was pretty strange since Jean Gray is old enough to be his mother. Patrick Stewart was okay, but he and Magneto did not really generate their characters well. The sfx were good, but it was mostly just a preview with a little subplot to show fights, which were pretty good. I give this movie a 7.5"

","This was a very well done film.  As a comic book afficionado for years,  I was excited when I heard the X-men were coming to the big screen. However, I had reservations about how the general, non comic-book reading public would take to it. As is obvious by the success of the film, my fears were for naught.  They did an excellent job of preserving the feel of the characters from the comics without making them too cartoony for a serious movie.<br/><br/>The plot development was well done, also.  Starting in the concentration camps made it easy to see how Magneto got set onto his path.  Many times, cartoon/comic-book villains are needlessly over-dramatic.  This wasnt the case with this Magneto.  You could even sympathize with his cause, although his lack of respect for human life made it easy to cheer when he was defeated. Focusing on Wolverine/Rogue also provided a nice continuity to the film that would otherwise have been absent.  The film-makers did an excellent job of portraying Logan and keeping the character as true as possible to his comic book version."
"Buddy-51","Null","0","0","3 December 2000"," surprisingly profound comic book derivation
","In the world of movies, profundity often creeps up in the most unexpected and unlikely of places.  Let's face it; one does not instinctively turn to the super-hero genre if one is searching for films with great thematic meaning and philosophical depth.  Yet, `X-Men' provides just those qualities in the context of a thought provoking, intelligently written and superbly executed tale of `mutants' searching for acceptance, tolerance and affirmation in a world filled with frightened and often even hostile inhabitants. <br/><br/>Much more than just a mere action film, `X- Men' broadens into a study of the effects of prejudice, done in almost allegorical terms.  Often when a theme has become played out through over exposure, it takes a fresh approach to make it come alive again.  Yet another movie chronicling the injustices done to blacks, Native Americans, Jews, gays, the handicapped and a host of other routinely aggrieved groups probably would not have the same impact as this film does.  By creating an entirely fictional group to serve as the target of intolerance, the filmmakers allow us see the issue from a novel perspective, stripped down to its barest essentials as it were.  Since none of us brings to the film an innate prejudice against a group that doesn't exist in real life, we are all free to see the irrationality, fear and idiocy that serve as the basis for bigotry in any of its forms.  How many movies of any genre can one say THAT about?<br/><br/>The film begins, appropriately, with a scene recreating a factual example of bigotry in one of its most recent and darkest forms  as a family of Jews in 1944 Poland is marched to its doom in a Nazi concentration camp.  We discover later on that the young lad has survived the experience and that he is actually one of the first of a new breed of `mutants' being caused by a sudden leap in the human evolutionary cycle.  It seems that these mutants begin manifesting their various differences around the time of puberty, and that as the 21st Century progresses and more and more of these special people begin to reveal themselves, the world finds itself grappling with the issue of whether or not they should be denied equal rights and equal citizenship and even whether or not they should be allowed to remain integrated with the rest of society.   In many ways, I imagine that this film speaks with particular significance to the gay community, since in contemporary terms, that seems to be the group most often targeted with the kind of ignorant, vitriolic claptrap we hear coming from the outraged `normal' citizens and opportunistic politicians in the film.  The X-Men are a group of mutants (women included, by the way) with super-human powers whose twofold mission it is to prevent the world's lawmakers from passing legislation against them and to simultaneously fight off some renegade mutants who have decided to take matters into their own, less diplomatic hands.  Kudos to writer David Hayder and director Bryan Singer for daring to explore such a profound theme in such an entertaining format.<br/><br/>For make no mistake about it:  `X-Men,' for all its profundity and thematic richness, is, first and foremost, a stylish and enthralling comic book action thriller.  Even though the mutant heroes are essentially two-dimensional characters, at least they don't undercut the seriousness of their purpose by indulging in the customary wisecracking, adolescent antics that have diminished so many earlier super hero characters in previous films of this nature.  Most impressive is that the `villain' possesses not only a credible motive for his actions, but even the seeds of some long dormant goodness that allow for the possibility of his redemption somewhere down the road.  (And it is indeed obvious that this film provides a dandy setup for a potentially lucrative series of films to follow).  The first-rate action stunt sequences and state-of-the-art special effects contribute greatly to the entertainment level of the film.  Of the actors, the standout is Patrick Stewart who, as the mutant dedicated to building a bridge of tolerance and understanding between the mutants and the outside world, brings just the right note of comforting civility and rationality to the role.<br/><br/>Yet, for all its technical virtues as an action film, it is the depth and breadth of its vision that separates `X-Men' from so many other films of its genre and makes it truly worthwhile viewing.  As grateful moviegoers, our appetite is whetted  and we eagerly await our next serving."

","X-men is the first attempt to bring Marvel comics best selling title to the big screen. Directing the movie is Bryan Singer who made ""The usual suspects"". Unfortunately there are several problems with trying to make a movie like this. First of all the budget was very limited and due to the target audience the movie had to be toned down both in sfx and in aspects of violence.<br/><br/>When 2 characters that are supposed to be the ""personification of violence"" according to the comic squares off without really inflicting any damage on each other you could say something was lost in the translation.<br/><br/>Trying to make a movie based on the x-mens 30 year old history would be impossible instead we have a plot that is designed to guide newcomers into the world of the x-men. Unfortunately the plot that finally made it into the movie is quite stupid and somewhat silly.<br/><br/>There is nothing spectacular here at all: The villain and his followers are all simply evil and most characters don't ever develop any kind of depth.<br/><br/>There was also a shortage of time in making this movie and it shows. The special effects are quite patchy and a lot of times it is painfully obvious that the action scenes are made using wires.<br/><br/>The casting is also imho wrong in most cases.<br/><br/>Instead of having Wolverine as the scary ""pint sized psycho"" he is the Hollywood version: Tall dark and handsome with a bit of attitude. Hardly distinguishable from hundreds of similar movie characters so he is a bit of a cliché.<br/><br/>Any chance of taking the characters or the plot seriously is effectively destroyed by having everyone dress in tight leather outfits.<br/><br/>All in all considering who was making it and the potential a very disappointing movie.

The different characters were incredible - I was constantly looking forward to seeing what special powers the next one would have, and thinking, ""Wow, I wish I could do that!"".

The biggest problem I had was that I wanted it to last longer - I wanted to know more about the characters, but there probably wasn't enough time for all of that.  The plot was basically very interesting and even sort of deep.  It really gave you a sense of internal struggle.  Professor X was playing the X-Men version of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and Magneto was playing Malcolm X! My suspicions of this were confirmed when I heard Magneto say ""By any means necessary."" It was that kind of conflict.  The bad guys really weren't that bad, you could understand how their oppression made them feel the way they did.

Apart from the fact that a few of these complex personalities are reduced to cardboard cut outs (like Cyclops, man. He is not a teacher's pet like they've portrayed him.), there's something REALLY ironic about it all: Notice how all the GOOD guys are young, sexy, pretty-boys and -girls, and the BAD guys are disfigured freaks of nature (ok, Mystique was darn sexy, but she's BLUE, yah?) And this is a film that's supposed to attack prejudice! Make a little switcheroo - make the good guys pug ugly and the bad guys DiCaprio look a likes, and see what difference that will make. Aside from one brief paragraph from Mystique, none of Magneto's lackeys uses prejudice as a motivation to join the other side. In effect, they just seem like horrible monsters bent on destruction. C'mon, people, give them some more human, realistic motivation.<br/><br/>I also didn't like the action. Not once did my adrenal gland have to start pumping. Ho Hum. In general, the artistic direction was sub-par. I absolutely loved Singer's ""Fight Club"" which had cinematic deviations galore. In ""X-Men"", it was all formula stuff, and very flat formula stuff.<br/><br/>
And the script. Ok, you can't do much for two hours, but... but: ""DO YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENS TO A TOAD WHEN IT'S STRUCK BY LIGHTNING? JUST THE SAME THING AS EVERYTHING ELSE""???? It's prolly not verbatim, but I'm sure I've made an improvement on that line, which happens to be the WORST ONE LINER IN MOVIE HISTORY!

It's got character, story, a good plot, and there really are some symbolic shots etc..  I say go see this movie.. I'd like to tell one thing though.  I think it's time that Hollywood realizes that the audience realises when it sees a BADLY MADE 3D computer animation.  I mean, the special effects weren't that good.  Especially, I couldn't stop laughing when I saw Volverine's summersault at the Statue of Liberty.  (Which also exists in the trailer)  However, apart from the special effects, I enjoyed the movie.."

","X-Men achieves what so many other films of it's genre fail, intelligence, style and a sense of morality, yet the film always manages to retain an essential humour. The cast is well placed, especially Hugh Jackman as a moody yet likeable Wolverine and Patrick Stewart as the sensible, Martin Luther King Jr.of the mutant world - Dr. Charles Xavier. The film stays true to the original comics & cartoons, the general story is relevant, the cinematography is beautifully executed by Newton Thomas Sigel and both cast and direction strong, but there is something missing. The script builds the film up & up, the audience wait in teeth-grinding anticipation as the big finale rolls on upon the Statue of Liberty, NY, but the big finale ain't so big and leads to somewhat of an anti-climax, that leaves film-goers asking 'What the h**l???'. Also, the story is very much centred around Wolverine & Rogue and leaves little for the other mutants to display. Sure the film is generally good but it lacks spectacularism. However, the one thing that left me hunting for Bryan Singer is the very ending where we find that Magneto has lived and a movie that screams ""Sequel Ahoy!"" I hate when they do that!"

","Did anyone really watch this? I mean, REALLY watch it? Or was everyone just so captivated by the special effects that they failed to see what a bad movie this was? In all my days, I have never seen such great visual artistry put to such waste. No characters got any sympathy from me. Not even Wolverine, who was nicely played by the Aussie find Hugh Jackman. His character would have been great if the screenwriter had developed one for him. Instead we get another mad mutant guy with a troubled past, and blah, blah, blah... All the good guys fighting the bad for world domination and blah, blah, blah... I even saw this movie for free and I feel I've been ripped off.

","Most of us wanted to be super heroes when we were kids. In super hero world ranking is extremely difficult. Superman has powers, so in that respect he's cooler than Batman who has gadgets. Almost all important characters in Batman are some sort of split personalities and their world is much darker. The X men are a happy hybrid-- cool, and yet sometimes terrifying powers and the sense of alienation. So, 1:0 for them.  :) The special fx are great. 2:0   :) Now the funny thing. Wolverine-Jean Grey  thing (Thank God they didn't insist on that) and Rouge-Wolverine thing  might seem familiar, but for some reason i really didn't mind them. Singer skips the danger of potentially cheap tricks, and leaves  me not only impatiently waiting for the sequel, but actually wanting me to go back and see it again. I cant remember when that happened last time. And I've seen many, many, many , many movies. Many. 3:0. Great casting. Read somewhere that Jackman's performance reminds of a young Clint Eastwood.

","This first of what will most likely be many 'X-Men' flicks revolves mainly around Wolverine, played by Hugh Jackman, but still manages to include the other favourites like Cyclops, Strom and Jean Grey. Casting crews did expert jobs in casting the roles for the movie (except maybe for Rogue and Magneto). Otherwise, the X-Men we have come to know and love have been faithfully adapted when moving to live-action.<br/><br/>The studios did take some artistic license during the crossover from comic to movie. They made Rogue, at least, 15 years younger; they made Mystique naked; and Magneto's screen-self is somewhat less imposing than the original magnetic tyrant is.<br/><br/>However, it is very easy to look beyond these trivial changes to see what could become one of the most profitable movie franchises ever. With some subtle in-jokes and flat-out funny parts, 'X-Men' combines humour, adventure and action to fantastic effect."

","""This review nay contain spoilers"". From the first moment you watch the movie you get caught in it, visually. It catch your eyes and never let you go. I was very happy with the approach the film has, which reminded me of the one ""Batman""(1&2) had, which means that although the film is based on a comics book it's not necessarily has to be silly and aimed for children.This is a very enjoyable and entertaining movie but it's not flawless.A lot of things are simply left unexplained. For example: why and how the ""bad mutants"" joined Magnet and not Prof. X? or the fact that Mistuiqe manage to pose as one of the boys in Prof.X school and no one seems to notice there are 2 of them, and I can point out some more things like this. However I admit that maybe it's better to leave it as it is, because if you ignore these things you cab enjoy the film more.I also think that while the good Mutants are more 2 dimension the bad ones remain in one dimension. One last thing. A sequel is unavoidable, let's just hope that Fox will retain the same approach as in this film and will not try to cash on it and by that destroy it as WB has done with the ""Batman"" films(3&4). Go see this movie it probably the best summer blockbuster you'll ever see this year"
"Klaatu-18","8","0","0","15 July 2000"," A comic book movie with depth
","One of the things that made the Marvel comics special back in the 60s was their quirkiness.  Spider-man agonized about the same stuff that other teenagers did.  Maybe not acne, but problems with fitting in to the adult world. Superheroes with problems.<br/><br/>The X-men have problems, too. They may have some phenomenal powers, but they're outsiders.  They look human, but their powers put them on the outside.  Feared and misunderstood, they are targets.<br/><br/>Targeted by a Senator as a threat to humanity, they face the sort of persecution that supposed ""Reds"" did at the hands of Senator Joseph McCarthy and HUAC.<br/><br/>They are also the targets of the super-villain, Magneto (Ian McKellan).  He feels that there will be a war between humanity and mutantkind.  But he has a plan to swing the tide.  All he needs is one special mutant.<br/><br/>Magneto is aided by a trio of mutants: Sabertooth, Toad (""Episode I's Darth Maul: Ray Park) and Mystique.<br/><br/>Opposing them are, of course, the X-men. The main group this time are Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops and Dr. Jean Grey. Others make cameos this time around, like Iceman.<br/><br/>But what makes this movie more than just a special effects romp is the subtext.  That has to do with fear and prejudice. Magneto feels that the mutants will be treated in the same way that his Jewish mother was during WWII: despised, imprisoned and killed. (Explaining to my six-year-old nephew about concentration camps was one of the toughest and most frustrating things I've ever done)<br/><br/>Great performances from Patrick Stewart (Prof. X) and Ian McKellan (Magneto) also lift the film above the usual comic book movie fare.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes might be a little intense for youngsters. My nephew had his eyes covered during some of the scenes (like the Senator's final scene), but very little overt bloodshed.<br/><br/>Good stuff.  Looking forward to the sequel which they left ample room for.<br/><br/>Eight stars.  Uncle Steve says check it out."

","Before seeing this movie I've read many reviews of X-Men: The Movie and they were all about how this movie sucked. Some critics even described it as a plastic heap of overrated garbage. Well, I strictly oppose.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie had a quite decent cast - Patrick Stewart was right in his place and Hugh Jackman added a bit of freshness into the movie. Ian McKellen, however, was not as good as in his previous roles (Apt Pupil) as his character appeared somewhat too calm or even sedated. But still the dialogue between him as Magneto and Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier were quite vivid and sarcastic.<br/><br/>I also have to say that the effects were satisfying and from the middle onward quite surprisingly well fitted into the movie. Not too much, not too little. Just to support the plot. But the plot is another thing. It is the only thing that seemed only a bit over the average. Intro was O.K. But somewhere in the middle the initial line of mutants fighting for equality was quickly replaced by mutant fighting mutant fighting human.<br/><br/>Directing and editing were average, but most people would say that is not important in action or sci-fi movies - Matrix, Odyssey 2010. Apparently not.<br/><br/>I am a fan of the comic book and therefore I can see that the adaptation is quite good. The costumes are portrayed brilliantly (look at the descriptions of the suits in the comic books and you will notice this). Personalities of the characters are a bit two-dimensional (that does not go for Jackman and Stewart), but the interaction is, though rare, quite humorous.<br/><br/>To put all into place, I give this movie an 8 out of 10. Anybody should see this movie and you may find yourself getting interested into the comic book or wind up owning the movie, like me.<br/><br/>BTW: Viewing the DVD version is a very good idea...all you fans, don't miss it!!!"
"willow-46","8","0","0","14 November 2000"," This movie doesn't deserve a rating more than 7.5
","Blame it on the media or whatever, but I REALLY looked forward to see this movie. I even bought a $13 US movie magazine just because it featured it before it even came out here. If I didn't have such HIGH expectations, it might seem better. But I walked out of the cinema feeling a little ripped off. And here's why:<br/><br/> 1. It is so damn short! How could they do this to a huge blockbuster? It should have been between 120~150 minutes, but not merely 104 minutes! The story is way too much to be told in less than two hours. This fault is forgivable, at least they are making sequels.<br/><br/> 2. I know I shouldn't really say this, since I've never heard of The X-Men comics before, but I think the movie might have worked better with even fewer main characters: look at Batman and Robin. Enough said.<br/><br/> 3. Bad, bad acting! Okay, just Storm, no-one else. I have to mention, 50% of my intention to see this movie was seeing Halle Berry donning a white wig. Too bad I didn't realize HOW was she bad. She was so wooden and her 'woodenness' probably won't be so noticeable if she wasn't so damn beautiful.<br/><br/>That's it, really....I'm quite impressed with Anna Paquin and I could really relate to her situation, not in 'that' way, of course. And Hugh Jackman and Famke Janssen were really pleasant surprises, too. Ah...I'll never forgot the naked Mr Jackman! ( he should be with Rogue, IMHO)<br/><br/>Now that I think about it more, it's just a little more than average with good visuals which proves to make the fans smile. I'd love to see a more active (and sexy!) Rogue in the sequels. The studio should have allowed Bryan Singer more time, and I think it was the main reason why this movie was incoherent in places and looks hastily made. Still I look forward to sequels and I hope by then, they'll make something that lives up to my expectations."

","Although I'm very interested in the science-fiction genre, prior to watching this movie I knew almost nothing about X-Men at all. I went to the film expecting much; afterall wherever Patrick Stewart acts, he always adds that magical spark, but the movie really exceeded my expectations ten times... It's quite basically one of the most successful science fiction films I've ever watched!<br/><br/>Be it acting, scenario, or special effects, this film is well equipped to please the audience in all areas. I also liked the way X-Men were introduced: since I knew nothing about them (and for the likes of me) certain information was necessary. However an unbalanced introduction could have caused the veteran X-Men readers to get bored perhaps. The movie manages to keep both newcomers and old readers satisfied.<br/><br/>Perhaps some may argue about acting, for usually there is not enough space left to act in science fiction movies (which by the way is not what I think at all. Just the usual comment I keep hearing now and then.) I really liked certain mimics of characters, most especially Wolverine's. When it's the fiction genre you're talking about, and again when you're dealing with characters who have plenty of super powers, you have to balance the information of what they can do, with enough data about their personality. Here, the body language is a great tool, and certainly it has been of a great assistance for providing a good insight about the heroes of this movie.<br/><br/>The film at one point reminded me of ""Blade"", which is also based on comics. Both of these films use similar techniques (in my humble opinion) to re-create the atmosphere on the silver screen. And it works pretty well.<br/><br/>Well, Patrick Stewart is... well he is a living legend for sure. And in this movie, he is as incredible as ever. But for me, the star of the movie was Hugh Jackman. And most of the storyline revolves around him. (Wolverine). I am hoping to see equally successful sequels to this movie with the same cast.<br/><br/>The drawbacks? None!... It's flawless, it's beautiful, it's entertaining.. An all around adventurous trip in 100 minutes and gets my both thumbs up. 11 out of 10!"

","First of all, I'm NOT a reader of the comics. I know most of the characters and some basic storylines, I've seen the old animated series and I will watch Evolution and I've read some issues, but I don't read the comics. I'm kinda new in the comic scene, but I know enough.<br/><br/>My favorite X-Man is Wolverine and I can't wait to see Hugh Jackman back in part two. Man, was he good! I also saw the original Wolvie, Dougray Scott, in M:I2, and although he was good, he couldn't have been better then Hugh. So in a way, M:I2 has done something right in the end.<br/><br/>Wolverine is without a doubt the main character of the movie. Singer has improved the concept of his claws: coming out of the knuckles and being bigger, they look staddier. Good job.<br/><br/>For the rest: not the best plot ever, but in this movie, the plot's not important. It's the characters that come to life, the great music, the strong cast and fantastic special effects. This movie is about the best comic book adaption ever and it's the start of a new line of such movies. X-Men 2 and 3, Spiderman, Spawn 2 (come on, part 1 sucked, it should've been more like the comics), Blade 2, Fantastic Four, etcetera. What I really mean is that the Stan Lee-style was not in this movie. I don't mean to disrespect Stan Lee, after all he created it, but his characters are always a little bit unreal and too happy and the uniforms look colorful and unrealistic. That's why I like the new X-Men suits.<br/><br/>What I also liked, were the references and quotes: humor. Toad imitating Darth Maul and thus imitating himself, the yellow spandex, Logan's disbelief about the names, and so on. Some details from the comics may have been changed or lost, but the result is great.<br/><br/>Conclusion: X-Men is an amusing, fascinating and good movie that's made for a sequel. If you haven't seen the movie yet: sorry for spoiling it, and now get the hell outta your chair and go see it!"

","X-Men isn't just a ""kill 'em all"" action flick with extravagant special effects. The X-men comic (originated in 1960) is probably the comic where the characters' personal growth is one of the most important parts of the storyline. The characters in the movie has to suffer from ""racism"" from humans and protect them all the same.<br/><br/>You needn't be an avid X-Men fan to understand the movie - everything is carefully planted into the plot. Of course, for those who are X-Men fans, this movie will be a delightful feast. The characters are brilliantly portrayed and true to there nature. Fans who remember Toad from the comic, will find his character a bonus.<br/><br/>Although not all the traditional X-Men (Beast, Jubilee, etc.) are present, there are a few surprises for observant viewers. Rouge's friend Bobby can turn anything into ice - Robert Drake (Iceman) from the comic. In the scene where Wolverine is in Xavier's laboratory, there is a girl that walks THROUGH the door. Could it be Shadowcat?<br/><br/>Even without all the analyzing, the movie is still tremendous fun - some of the scenes were just so X-cellent, I actually got goosebumps!

","Well, I had a lot of fears about this one, because it's so easy to do a mess of something you really really liked as a teen. To anyone who read ever the comics: it's PERFECT. They just changed or removed or modified some characters, for pretty obvious reasons (we have a teen Bobby Drake / Iceman, for one) but the ones being there are excellent. Those under spotlight, especially Wolverine, Magneto and Professor X, are wonderful (Prof. X is possibly BETTER than the original, horray to Patrick Stewart). No spoilers, no plot, just enjoy the story. Oh, and for those who didn't read the comics: I'm so sorry for you... Why don't you give them a try (after the movie)?"

","I am beyond shocked at the reviews this film is getting here at the IMDb.  It's no wonder the big studios feel comfortable putting out junk like this film because about 750 of the 770+ reviews of 'X-MEN' are all glowingly positive.....WHY?!?  This film is yet another example of a promising concept butchered but bad writing and even worse directing.  Regardless of what anyone might say, Bryan Singer is a BAD director.  Now before you go off saying, ""But 'The Usual Suspects' was an excellent film...."", I will go on record in agreement with you; but it wasn't the directing that made that film, it was the writing.  Bryan Singer just got lucky with that one, and to prove it, just watch his 2nd film, 'Apt Pupil'....gee, wasn't that an excellent film (note the thick layer of sarcasm).  A good Director can take a poor story and make a great film, as evident with Steven Speilberg's 'Saving Private Ryan'.<br/><br/>In any case, moving on to the 2 hours of celluloid garbage (otherwise known as 'X-MEN: The Movie'), how can anyone say they honestly liked this film??  Beyond their names, every character had absolutely nothing in common with their comic book counterparts (which, last I checked, was the basis of this film) and there is not ONE reviewer of this film who can argue otherwise.  Is this fact alone not enough to condemn the film?  I've heard of artistic lisence, but COME ON!!  You're supposed to use that in art design and (most importatnly) Directing, not in TOTALLY re-writing the foundational history of the Marvel Universe!!  But what could you expect, after all, Bryan Singer HIMSELF said that before a friend of his pitched this idea to him, he had never read a page out of an X-MEN comic!!  AND IT SHOWS!!!  Bryan Singer doesn't know what makes the X-MEN comic series what it is, and a lot of it is critical to the timelines and circumstances in which each 'X-Man' is introduced to one another.  'X-MEN: The Movie' completely re-writes this timeline and character introductions, in essence, chopping its own legs off before it has a chance to stand up and run.<br/><br/>What about those who have never heard of the X-MEN Universe?  Read on, for the rest pertains to you as well.<br/><br/>Next is the action sequences.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but are not action sequences, by definition, supposed to be exciting and entertaining eye-candy?  If you agree, then you CANNOT like the action sequences in this film.  Part of the reason they stink so bad is (again) the Directing: BORING!!  Bryan Singer does not know where to place or move the camera to properly catch an action.  Coupled by the fact that this is perhaps one of the most terribly edited films in history, you are left at the end of an action sequence saying, ""What the heck?!?"", when you should be saying, ""Wow!""<br/><br/>Plot?  WHAT PLOT?!?  Those of you who say this is a ""smart plot"" should re-check your IQ's.  You want a smart script, go and see 'The Matrix', now there is a good movie.  But don't get me wrong, I'm NOT saying that 'X-MEN' should have been more like 'The Matrix', only that 'The Matrix' is heading in the right direction as far as comic book adaptations should go (yes, 'The Matrix' was a comic series), and 'X-MEN' is a step backwards.....back even past the horrible adaptation of 'Spawn'.<br/><br/>The characters?  EVERY ONE OF THEM SUCKED EXCEPT WOLVERINE!!  If Hugh Jackman was not as good as he was, this movie would be rated in the negatives.  Important too is the fact that Wolverine's power was the only one effectively depicted in the film.  The rest was just bad lightning effects and cable-work.  The effects in this film are VERY OBVIOUSLY sub-par.  And the costumes?!?  Need I repeat what I said about artistic lisence??  Many people mock the ""cheesy spandex costumes"" when all they have as reference in their minds is Christopher Reeves in the original 'Superman'.  What about 1989's 'Batman'??  That suit was beautiful.  And even that old short-lived TV show, 'The Flash'....his suit was excellent!! Bottom line, they should have kept the original comic's suits; after all, if we as viewers are expected to suspend disbelief and accept the world of X-MEN, then why is it so far fetched for them to wear THOSE costumes instead of the black leather in the film??  As for the rest of the cast, Patrick Stewart is the ideal choice for Professor X, but unfortunatley his part was terribly written.  Ian McKellan is a poor choice for Magneto....too old and feeble looking.  Famke Jensen is a good Jean Grey, but fell to the same fate as Patrick Stewart.  James Marsden as Cyclops??  Since when does Cyclops look like a teenager?  How in the heck can we buy that he is involved with Famke Jensen??  He looks to be more in Anna Paquin's age bracket; which brings us to her as Rogue: the WORST casting of the entire film (almost as bad as choosing Bryan Singer to Direct).  Too young and pouty look-at-how-many-ways-I-can-distort-my-eyebrows type of performance and overall look.  Halle Berry as Storm; physically, she fits the part, but again, same fate as Famke and Patrick.  Ray Park as Toad....I don't even know why he's called Toad since his character is completely different than the Toad in the comic.  Same with Sabertooth.  Toad, along with Tyler Mane as Sabertooth (the second worst character in the film), are basically throw-aways in this film when they are so intergral in the comics....especially Sabertooth and his relation with Wolverine (which is non-existent in this film).  As for Rebecca Romijn Stamos as Mystique, she certainly has the physique for the part, but why is she nude?!?  Again, with the costume issue.<br/><br/>Is there ANYTHING good about this film?  Yes, two things:<br/><br/>1) Hugh Jackman is an excellent Wolverine, and 2) The movie does end.<br/><br/>An interesting piece of information that most people are unaware of is that although 'X-MEN' had a big opening weekend gross of over $52 Million, it had one of the biggest second-week fall-off rates in history of 52%, grossing only $25 Million.  Unfortunately, the studio still sees this as a strong showing and has no doubt begun work on a sequel.  What's worse is that they will probably get Bryan Singer to Direct it again.  This is going to be the same as the scenario with 'Batman Forever' when it grossed big numbers on opening weekend and then sharpy fell off on week two, and Joel Schumacher was granted the go-ahead for 'Batman & Robin', which, as history shows, was finally recognized as a piece of crap and bombed at the box office.  This will happen to 'X-MEN 2' unless they get their act together and tend to these aforementioned problems.<br/><br/>Just imagine, if these viewers give such good reviews to junk like this film, they'll be speechless when they see ""My 'X-MEN'"".<br/><br/>LET'S GET IT TOGETHER PEOPLE!!  START RECOGNIZING THESE FILMS FOR THE JUNK THEY ARE AND PERHAPS THEN THE STUDIOS WILL START MAKING BETTER FILMS!!!<br/><br/>Rating:  2 out of 10<br/><br/>(because of Wolverine and because it was filmed in Toronto where I live and my friend worked on it)."

However I can say that this film lived up to my expectations in just about every single way. The characters were as I remember them (except for Toad, I dont remember him) and Magneto and Professor X were both picture perfect. This film is how I used to remember block-busters being. Where heroes would do heroic things and bad guys were all powerful except for one thing, and a rousing music score would be playing at all the dramatic moments.

First, the good things: 1) cameos of random X-men... Collossus, Shadowcat, Pyro, Cannonball, Jubilee, Iceman... yay to them.  2) Stan Lee. An absolute must. 3) most importantly, the movie was well done.  It wasn't a joke or a flop like previous Marvel movies.  It did well at the box office, it didn't use ridiculous spandex, corny jokes (well, not many), or cheesy special effects. Bravo to Marvel for actually making something decent.<br/><br/>Now, onto my main point.  THE MOVIE DOES NOT PROPERLY REPRESENT THE X-MEN!!! Firstly, the X-men are not that dark!!! There were far too few scenes that involved sunlight or even very much color...<br/><br/>Secondly, while I realize that spandex would look bad, the X-men DON'T WEAR BLACK Leather!!<br/><br/>Third, and most important of these ""cons"":  the continuity is completely wrong.  Those who see the movie before reading the comic will get the wrong impression of who these people are, how they met, etc.  The movie continuity, in my opinion, is not canon; it is not an alternate continuity; IT IS SIMPLY COMPLETELY WRONG...<br/><br/>oh, also, I feel that it was incredibly wrong to change Mystique and Toad in the comic to better match their movie counterparts.<br/><br/>EVIDENCE! Here we go:<br/><br/>1) Rogue's name is not Marie.  Her real name has never been revealed in the comic.<br/><br/>2) Rogue's gaining the white streak after touching Magneto is also wrong. She always had it.<br/><br/>3) Rogue was supposed to be a villain first.  She was raised by Mystique... and joined the X-men only after acquiring her super-strength, invulnerability, and flight powers.<br/><br/>4) The roster was wrong - the timing/order in which people joined was wrong...  if Cyclops and Jean are adults and are X-men, why not Iceman? he's only a few years younger...  Pyro shouldn't be there at all...  if Storm's on the team, Wolverine should already be, too. They joined at the same time...<br/><br/>5) Magneto and Mystique and Sabretooth were never on the Brotherhood together<br/><br/>6) Erik (Lensherr) is not Magneto's real name - it was revealed that he used that as an alias...<br/><br/>7) Mystique does wear clothes. and she's not scaly<br/><br/>8) Toad does not have this strange tongue thing... nor the green goop stuff<br/><br/>9) Henry Peter Gyrich (the guy Mystique impersonates for her attack on Sen. Kelley) is a red-head.. also his name is mis-spelled ""Guyrich"" in the credits<br/><br/>10) It just doesn't fit in continuity! If Jean barely has any telepathy, and doesn't even have a code-name (like, um... Phoenix), then Jubilee shouldn't be there...  if Kitty (not Katie!!!) is there, then where's Lockheed.. on the other hand, i find myself asking that rather often...<br/><br/>
Um... I think that's enough kvetching for now.  Go see it, go enjoy it... but keep in mind that THE MOVIE IS NOT ANYWHERE NEAR AN ACCURATE REPRESENTATION.  Go buy some comics :)"

","When I first heard about X-Men I wasn't surprised that Hollywood will make another trash just to get some money, but when I heard some people saying (my friends,neighbors, etc.) that it's a good movie and I should watch it in the cinema as it has very good special effects. So I watched it and I liked it very much. Before I watched the movie the only thing I knew about X-Men that it's a comic series as well as a cartoon and it didn't fascinate me very much till I watched it and it made me almost a X-Men freak. It has a mysterious start introducing the past of the bad guy and the other characters and their abilities. Whoever wrote the screen play he can have a good mark for making such an elaborate character description. The plot is quite good but has an impossible part i.e. genetic mutation every hundred years (or may be I misunderstood this part) but not counting this little 'mistake' the plot is acceptable actually better than M:I-2's. The movie 'asks' a few questions at the beginning and leaves them not answered at the end and it made me to feel quite puzzled, but may be the screenwriter and the producer thought of a/some sequel(s) for this movie and they will 'answer' in the sequel(s).  It has stunning special effects that almost made my eyes fall out of their place. It was very astonishing to watch our heroes and villains using their special powers to fight with each other. The action sequences where also good but not as good as Matrix's, but we don't have to compare every movie to the best one in the genre. I could see that the director tried to reach that level by making a few 'slow-mo' effects and some good camera angles. The action sequences were quite short for me as I suspected better, like the Matrix. But the Matrix is a different situation and that is X-Men is a comic adaptation and Matrix is a cyber/sci-fi/action copying a few from its ancestors while X-men only from the comics and the cartoons. I have watched all the Batman and Superman movies made till now and i think X-Men is the best one among them. I can bravely suggest to anyone to watch this movie at least once and I promise that those who watch it won't make a mistake. Briefly this movie is exciting, spectacular and a 100% action movie (may be the best one along with the Matrix)."

","I must admit, as an 18 female I was a little bit apprehensive about his movie. I had a little knowledge about the comic book characters from listening to hours & hours of my brothers chats about his fave comic book series. I think I even caught a episode or two on video, but I wasn't exactly what'd you'd consider a fan, just hadn't paid very much attention to it and so the idea of going to see this movie didn't exactly thrill me. So I went to see this movie, trying to be as open-minded as possible and guess what? Turns out I really liked the film. It was good, pure action, and not just junky special effects. It had an exceptional story (for an action film), interesting characters, solid acting (Hugh Jackman was THE stand-out), and a very, very original plot (which as you know, is a rarity these days). Above all else, it was a fun and entertaining movie. I watched it very comfortably with my two young cousins and didn't see or hear anything that upset me. There is some sparse profanity and one semi-obscene (but very common) finger gesture, and of course since it's an action flick there was some violence, but nothing too scary gruesome for younger viewers. I'd say this movie is suitable for the average pre-teen, just don't expect the grandparents to enjoy this one, it'll be over their heads. {:o) Bottom line, if you want action, skip MI:2 and check this flick out instead. It's definately worth a rental or two."

","It is a good thing when you don't walk disappointed from the theater. I guess X-Men succeeds at this, giving the audience thrill, visual/sound effects and beautiful people (this applies much more to the male audience, having cast Rebecca Romijn-Stamos). At no point it underestimates the viewer's intelligence, keeping a somewhat coherent plot for such a genre. The ""unbelievability"" factor is not that high. Pure entertainment which doesn't require a complete cerebral turn-off."

","When I first heard that there was to be a full length feature film of The X-men, I was skeptical.  When I read the cast list, and saw only 1 name I recognized (Patrick Stewart), I was more skeptical still.  But... my whole family loved this movie.  It had villains and heroes, and loyalty, and just a tinge of love and romance on the edges.  My husband usually doesn't like ""kiddie"" adventure shows, but he liked this one, and said it had great special effects.  The scenes between Wolverine and Rogue were my personal favorites, because I like to see the gentle side of a rough character exposed.  But there were plenty of other good parts, and the casting was very good.  My husband also said that Hugh Jackman was really too young to have been cast as Wolverine, and strictly speaking, that may be so.  But he ""did what he does"" pretty enough that it stole my heart, and that's not an easy thing for an actor to do in these days of ""pretty boys"" like Brad Pitt and Leonardo Di Caprio.  It is acceptable for kids, with no nudity and very little bad language.  Kudos to the cast for a job well done: and invitations to those of you who haven't seen this movie: in a word: Go!"

","Just got back from seeing this film with my 5 year old daughter, who, thank the gods , loves movies as much as myself. And she loved this movie. Especially the fact that there were almost as many female mutants as male ones. Also, the fact they kicked almost as much ass. Though personally, I felt they were a little underused.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman(Wolverine) is a revelation. He has the intensity, physicality, and the sheer presence to practically carry this film by himself. Fortunately he had the great Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart to give him some truly inspired support. I would of liked to of seen some more development with the other X-Men and even Toad ,Mystique, and Sabretooth. Find out there individual backgrounds, but with time constraints, I suppose some thing has to be dropped.<br/><br/>The plot itself is pretty basic, but what it lacks in intricasies, Bryan Singer and the cast more than makes up for in just plain, old fashioned, good story telling.<br/><br/>One thing of note. Most northern Albertan towns don't have cage fights in there bars. Also, there are not alot of mountains in northern Alberta either. I was half expecting to see a sled dog team go by or possibly an igloo at the side of the road. I suppose this is a Hollywood film.

","When I first read that they were going to make an X-men movie  I thought: ""It will never work, there are too many characters, too many plots..."". I thought that the only way it might work was to restrict the number of characters, but...which ones? And what about the story? I discussed these issues with some friends of mine: Wolverine, Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Xavier, Magneto, Sabretooth, Beast, Gambit, Mystique, Rogue and Iceman were the most wanted characters. And the story? It had to be Wolverine-centered, after all, he IS the world´s favourite X-man. I was extremely nervous when I went to see the movie, most comic adaptations to the big screen had completely disappointed me with the exception of the two first 'Batman' and 'Blade'(even though I liked 'the crow', its ending has nothing to do with the original comic-book). As I watched the film the only thing I could think of was ""This is great!!"". Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Wolverine, Stewart and Ian's interpretations are really cool, and the others...awesome. Ok, some might say ""what about Beast, Gambit, Colossus, Nightcrawler, etc.."", well that's what sequels are for...Bryan Singer did a wonderful job (even if the character of Rogue isn't exactly what I expected)and i just hope that the sequels will be as good or better than this one (I hope to see more of Wolverine´s mysterious past...and see the x-men hunted down by yuo know who)."

What grabbed my atention the second time I saw it, was that the conversion from the comic book to the real deal was excellent. The suspense is really nicely built up, and the dialogues (especially the ones with Patrick Stewart) were good.<br/><br/>Compared to another sci-fi movie such as the Matrix, it just doesn't quite hack it.

Every actor was perfectly suited for his/her role. Two actors stood above all, Patrick Stewart as Prof. Charles Francis Xavier ""Professor X"" as the leader of X-MEN, trying to save humanity from disaster(shades of Jean Luc Piccard??)and the enigmatic Sir Ian McKellen,simply superb as the archetypal villian, the all powerful ""Magneto"". <br/><br/>The others were well suited for their roles, especially Anna Paquin as Marie ""Rogue"" and the gorgeous Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Raven Darkholme ""Mystique"" the seductive but deadly shape shifter.<br/><br/>Fmke Jenssen was quite good as Dr. Jean Grey, one of her better roles since Goldeneye.(does anyone remember the ghastly ""Deep Rising"")<br/><br/>The movie did however manage to convey a two very simple messages:<br/><br/>1. that people who are ""different"" are not outcasts to be shunned for the differences, but excepted for what they are.<br/><br/>2. One should never judge all, because of the actions of a few.<br/><br/>A movie that everyone of all ages would love to see over and over again."

The precision timing that was executed was very impressive to watch.<br/><br/>3) I can't forget Special Effects, and oh man, were they ever good, the weather sequences from Storm, the train tearing apart and the gun sequence with Magneto, all scenes with Mystique, and who could forget the statue of liberty scene.<br/><br/>Finally, the most important is no. 4:<br/><br/>4) The overall message that the movie conveys is important to admire, appreciate, and point out as well.

"Cyber Cat","10","0","0","13 October 2000"," In 4 words: Waiting for the sequel!!!
","What a great movie! We've got everything here: Action, comedy, plot, insider's jokes, great acting, great directing and amazing visual effects.<br/><br/>A few years back, ""X-men"", the 1992 animated series started broadcasting on TV in Israel, and I was hooked since episode one. That's where I know X-men from, I never read the comics. You could imagine my surprise and excitement when I heard they were making a movie! I've waited a long time, and finally, yesterday was the premiere of the movie in Israel. Of course, I went to the premiere. You think I'll wait to see this movie, even one more day, if I don't have to? Waiting for the commercials to finish 10 minutes after the designated starting time, I was full of expectations for the movie of the year, and might I say  it fulfilled all of my expectations.<br/><br/>The movie started with the most beautiful computer graphics I have ever seen in my life. 5 seconds into this, and I'm thinking: ""They should make a screen-saver out of this!!!"".<br/><br/>Not much of the action-part in the beginning of the movie, it's more of the introduction of the characters Magneto, Rogue and Wolverine. There is the introduction of the plot as well, and I'm happy to say this is not one of those plot-less action movies, in style of ""bang, boom, credits role"".<br/><br/>
Not to worry, though, the action will come. The fight scenes in this film are so great because of two reasons. One, the SCI-FI reality of X-men allows the director to go all out when it comes to what the characters can do. What makes the fights so awesome is the originality of the moves. Sure, you could have a great scene with Sylvester Stallone punching/kicking a guy. But isn't it way cooler when you see Storm strike her opponent with lightning, or watch Cyclops fry a villain with a laser beam shooting out of his eyes? The second thing that makes the fight scenes breath-taking is that the producers saved no expense with visual effects, without which all the mutant super-powers would not have made it through the screen.<br/><br/>Now, what I love most about a movie is it's ability to make me laugh, even while I'm in awe in the face of the effects. The script handled this beautifully, letting each and every one of the Wolverine-Cyclops exchanges be a hysterical comic relief. They talk, I laugh. They look at each other, I laugh. Humor, that's what I like in my men!<br/><br/>Which brings me to the actors. All the villains were hate-able, and all the heroes were loveable, but to one exception: Rogue. What can I say? I didn't like Rogue one bit. In the animated series Rogue was my favorite character, due to her much adored girl-power. Kick-ass chick with enough puns to go around, it's the Rogue I know and love. Where is she in this movie? She is obviously younger here than in the series, helpless and insecure. The way Anna Paquin acted her out, she reminded me more of Claire Danes than of Superwoman.<br/><br/>Have you noticed how James Marsden (Cyclops) had bristles on his cheeks to make him look older. I don't deny it, that babe does have a baby-face look, and it's what I love about him. Too bad he was hidden behind glasses throughout the movie, except for the occasional accident of dropping them and closing his eyes before he fries everything in front of him to the ground. Well, I guess that's just the price we have to pay to see this cutie as Cyclops.<br/><br/>Now I have nothing left to say except for my hopes for the sequel (may it come to us as soon as possible): 1. Rogue as an adult, played by someone else. 2. Gambit (my favorite male character) and his explosive cards. I also want him to take immediate interest in Rogue, because they were always my favorite couple. 3. More romance in the Cyclops-Jean Gray-Wolverine triangle. There is definitely much to be explored in that story. 4. Beast would be interesting to see in the movie, where was he in this one? 5. James Marsden, James Marsden, and more James Marsden. I just can't get enough of him! 6. More insider's jokes in the style of ""What would you have prefered? Yellow spandex?"". That line cracks me up every time I hear it!!! 7. More sequels!<br/><br/>Bottom line: Not just for X-men fans, but for anyone who likes action and science fiction."

All of the actors capture the personalities of their comic book counter-parts (with the exception of Mystique, who in the comics was the second leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants).  The story line does not follow to an overly predictable conclusion.  A special treat was cameos by X-Men standards like Kitty Pryde and Bobby Drake.  This is a very good movie, but it does suffer from one flaw.  Its way too short.  Certainly I would hope that more time could have been spent developing Prof. Xavier, Storm, and Cyclops, without taking away from the obvious stars of the film, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman is AWESOME), Rogue, and Magneto.  And, for a comic book movie, it was a little light on the action. It is well written, and Wolverine is the natural choice to be the center of the film.  Overall, a good film.

","Nowadays most of the summers movies leave nothing much to talk about, this one however is different, for it does leave plenty to think about. The reason for that is that most of the summers movies are made out of effects and nothing more. No script, no characters and so on. Others however do tend to have a good script but do not have the right length or pace to be truly great. We have had a share of both of these kinds of movies in this summer and the ones who obviously fit into the first category are: Mission Impossible 2, The Perfect Storm, The Nutty Professor 2: The Klumps. Having neither seen The Perfect Storm not The Nutty Professor I can still give the reason all 3 became blockbusters. It is because of their explosiveness, their effects and their BIG stars. This does not mean they are not good. I mean M:I 2 is good due to it's explosiveness, The Perfect Storm is good when you watch it on the big screen, for the effects are overwhelming, yet when you'd see it at home it would suck. As for The Nutty Professor 2, that is just a piece of trash. Of the latter category I have only seen one film so far, being Gladiator. Now that was a film which could have been great, if the director had approached it differently, but due to too much politics and a few slow parts in the film it was only' good and only' one of the summers best. This film though is not the same as any of the film's mentioned above, for it accomplishes something I have not seen for quite a while. It combines good characters and emotions with great special effects. I think the last time I saw anything like it was in 1997. Wondering what movie, well yes (I'm sorry) Titanic. I bet now you are wondering what makes X  Men so great well here it comes:<br/><br/>
First of all I really must credit the director, Bryan Singer, whom many of you know, I guess, from his BIG breakthrough movie The Usual Suspects. I must thank him, for he is the only director after Tim Burton to make a truly great motion picture out of a comic book character. This does not however mean that the two directors can be compared, for the theme of the movies and the nature of the characters are much too different. Still they can be compared to both having had a great vision on something already made and imagined. Bryan Singer did not only bring in great music, good camerawork and great special effects (something he had not done before), but he also brought to us a tight and fast paced story without loose ends in which not the effects had the upper hands, but the actors, who supplied the movie with emotions and jokes. This accomplishment is always due to the director and the writers (who let the actors play their vision), the people who cast the actors and last but very far from least the actors themselves, who I might add here are no BIG stars but still known, appreciated and capable actors.<br/><br/>
First of all there is Magneto (Ian McKellen), who is a villain' unlike many others, for he is neither wicked like Darth Vader or The Emperor from Star Wars nor a psycho like Norman Bates from Psycho or something like that. Instead he is a mutant who acts out his knowledge that people who are different' will be stereotyped, loathed, maybe even feared and as a result of that will be oppressed or even killed. He is a villain' with a motive and can therefore be understood and is not likely to be hated or despised by the viewer.<br/><br/>
Then there is Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who is the latest mutant to join the X  Men in the fight against Magneto. His addition to the group however is somehow overshadowed' by a rivalry between him and Cyclops in which Wolverine delivers some good laughs. Wolverine however also has a couple of nice moments with Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) and Rogue (Anna Paquin). Plus he is in some cool fighting scenes with Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) and Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) and therefore is my favourite in this movie.<br/><br/>
The coolest fighting scene' however is the one in which Storm (Halle Berry) uses all her power to fight Toad (Ray Park), who I think has, in the last two years, played the coolest villains on screen (Darth Maul and The Headless Horseman). It really is a pity that we did not see more of his cool moves and fighting, but hey he was not the main villain in this film.<br/><br/>
Someone I really must not leave out of this ode is of course Anna Paquin, for she performs her character, Rogue, with class. This however is not the only reason I must mention this character, it is also because her character is the one that has the most depth and the one I could identify most with.<br/><br/>
Last but not least there are Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Dr. Jean Grey. Patrick Stewart delivers a good performance, playing a character he appears to have been born to play. Famke Janssen delivers a good performance too and is very likeable and believable as a doctor.<br/><br/>
Wrapping this up, I must say, I can not wait to hear the people behind it are to making a sequel. I feel that way, because I truly believe that with X  Men, a comic series has been brought to the cinema, that does not only meet the expectations of the true fans, but that it also is a film which satisfies the normal' viewer. So please, go and see this if you can,  I swear you will not regret it.<br/><br/>

","I entered the cinema expecting to see a good movie because I had read most of the reviews. I emerged from the cinema hall, I emerged stunned!!! The movie was amazing!!!<br/><br/>The acting was very good. Patrick Stewart and Sir Ian McKellan are veterans of cinema and play their characters very well. Stewart especially is extremely well suited as Professor X. However the real stars of the movie are Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Anna Paquin as Rogue which is probably because they have the meatiest roles. The rest of the cast do a great job as well.<br/><br/>The only drawback is that it is slightly short at 104 minutes. The mind-boggling special effects and the truly spectacular stunt work however, make this movie an absolute must-see for one and all."

","This film was enjoyable from minute one. The story played like a slightly dark cartoon and I thought this was the best style to use as it stayed close to the original comics. The special effects for the mutant powers were spectacular, but not over used. It was also interesting to see the potential for sequels and the future developement of the story, especially after showcasing the young mutants at the accademy. The sly sense of humour came through in places and helped to lighten the tone (e.g. Logan and the metal detector and the comments about the uniform).<br/><br/>My only slight negative is that it might have been a bit on the short side but the story did seem to flow and there wasn't and place were you thought than an obvious addition could be made.<br/><br/>The predjudice of the mutants and the actions of some of the human characters should have struck home with people who realise that this film also carries a message."

","Well, I've only waited six years for this movie and I was not disappointed. This is the best comic book movie since Batman! Sure there have been some good ones like Men in Black and The Mask but they were based on lesser known books. That means there are fewer fans to please. Well, Bryan Singer pleased me just fine with X-Men. I knew there was almost no way it could be bad, but I dared not hope it would be this good. A few complaints I foresee people making and why they won't matter - 1. Not enough development of Cyclops, Storm and Jean. True, but if every character had been given as thorough emphasis as Wolverine and Rogue received, the movie would have been two-and-a-half or more hours long and no one but big-time X-fans would have been entertained. Cyclops and Jean were handled well, we got a good fell for them. Storm was the only one who really suffered, but her battle scenes were reminiscent of Storm kicking butt in the comics. 2. The X-Men weren't powerful enough - Storm and Jean didn't have the same umph! they do in the comics, but let's not blow out the budget. Their powers were accurate and the movie probably couldn't go as over-the-top as comics do (that's why we still have comics!) 3. Backstory omissions - Sure, Rogue's connection with Mystique and Wolverine's relationship with Sabretooth in the comics didn't make it into the film, but so what? Both the villains were well done and more subplots would have slowed things down too much! And by the way - Hugh Jackman was a perfect Wolverine! Can't wait for part 2!!!!"

"waltflannagansdog","10","0","0","22 September 2000"," This mutant-fest is that rare beast, a classic piece of summer cinema.
","While Bryan Singer's X-MEN has received what can only be described as a thumbs up among critics and a slightly more wavering response by the audiences I feel most have missed out on it importance. Leaving the cinema on a hot summer night, I recognised a strange smile amongst the males that exited with their satisfied but less than impressed girlfriends, the kids, boy or girl did not have this almost uniform smirk either. The men, who have grown up on STAR WARS, INDIANA JONES and BOND, seemed to recognise something they'd long been missing. I can only describe it as akin to the feeling explicated at the end of FIELD OF DREAMS by James Earl Jones. It may not of had the John Woo inspired chaos, or the Bruckenhiemer orange filtered cool, it lacked the set in stone star power machismo of a Mel, Bruce or Nic, and it wasn't plagued with a critical case of referential irony. While I certainly enjoy all these in a movie (except the latter as you might have guessed) X-Men had something the blockbusters of late had lost in the brew or just plain didn't care about. It had a story, it had characters, it had ideas and best of all it wanted to present them as well and as intelligently as the summer action seat filler would allow. This was the reason we went to see JAWS all those years before high concept was branded on the arse of every piece of cinematic entertainment. Sure the shark was cool, we went to see the effects and the action and jokes, but what made us buy another ticket, what made us recommend it to our friends, what made us queue around the block for a third viewing, what made us hum the theme tune in the local lido, what made us watch it on TV, video and DVD year in, year out? I'll tell you what; an incredible piece of story telling with characters who actually seem like people as opposed to archetypes from other films. And in recent years the most we could hope for is the star gets some choice wisecracks and the action is half as exciting as it was in the trailer. Comparing and contrasting with recent examples is a futile exercise. The two most successful blockbusters of last summer, THE MATRIX and THE PHANTOM MENACE, don't deserve as near as much the adulation they received and continue to gain. They both suffer from the same problems that the X-MEN miraculously lacks. They both set up over-complicated plots. The essential premise is understandable from the trailer but they still find it necessary to bog the section after the opening action sequence down with an hour of exposition. THE MATRIX for all it camera tricks and location changes essentially has Lawrence Fishburne lay down the plot for over forty minute of cleverly shot talking heads. Where is the spectacle in that? STAR WARS I is crippled by even worse pacing and expositional problems. It needs to set up all the characters for the next two films but also have a story within this one. So while all the future relationships get their first meeting scene, it's hard to feel excited about any of the paths joining as that's all that happens. For a film that opens with standard rolling introduction titles to brining us up to date, all we basically chalk up for the following two hours is movie of scene setting for later installments. Yes, Obi Wan and Annakin do meet but little occurs between them, the same can be said for the mother of his future children. As Andrew O'Hehir concluded in his report at the time of its release, ` This installment feels less like an opening chapter than a stammering, parenthetical preface.' X-MEN should ail with same defect. It is the opening part of a franchise and worse still has thirty years worth of idolised comics to condense into two hours. Unlike BATMAN which not only had huge audience recognition from non-comic readers due to the camp TV series and only one lead to introduce, X-MEN has a diverse cast to acquaint as well as a world that is obviously different from ours despite parallels. To deal with the huge roll call of introductions the scripting team of Tom De Santo, Singer and credited writer, David Hayter, have gone for what I'll call the Star Wars approach (A New Hope, that is.) Establish one character and then have them promptly meet up with everyone needed on his quest. In the same way Luke Skywalker briskly picks up the droids, the sage, the pirate, the muscle and the plucky heroine on his journey he also has plenty of adventures on the way, culminating in one big dénouement. This way the plot is peppered with action that effects the proceedings and all the characters are introduced both in time to have purpose in the last act but also for future episodes. The mission still propels the story but it also requires that the whole gang is assembled. X-MEN follows Rouge and Wolverine as they discover who they are, what their powers are and what their place in society is. Like the hierarchy set up in Star Wars where the characters understanding of the mystical force sets the characters social standing, here the more control a character has of their mutation the higher their ranking in the group. Clasical actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen take the roles of leaders of each side but also the Alec Guinness' role in Star Wars of swiftly explaining the complicated mythology in simple but legendary sounding terms. Here mythology is replaced with political import. The science introduction that hears Stewart booming about evolution and mutation should, if the producers have any sense become the regular opening for all entry in the series but apart from that most of the old hands speechifying is used to show their strange relation. Singer far prefers to show everything visually. Whether it be Wolverine's ability to smell danger, Cyclops' power, people prejudices of mutants or what Magneto's doom machine does. By keeping dialouge for character as opposed to signaling plot changes we have a far quicker, fluid reality created.<br/><br/>In nearly all press interviews Singer has explained what drew him to the project he knew little about was the comparison to Malcolm X and Martin Luther King. We sense that Magneto and Xaiver have history merely from the casting. When Magneto, says `By any means necessary,' this doesn't seem like clumsy misuse of a historical slogan or tacking on importance via historical events. Taking events were people lost lives to add verisimilitude is probably the hardest (and half-witted) thing to achieve as a director, Spielberg can be hit and miss and James Cameron's focus on a pair of stroppy teen in TITANIC was insulting. X-MEN uses it's history deftly; Ellis Island, Civil Rights, Gun Control, McCarthyism and most risky of all Nazi concentration camps work together as evidence to supports the reality these mutants live in. X-MEN is probably the most distinct cinematic allegory since HIGH NOON. It's subject is political intolerance. It's brave and skillful inclusion of a tragedy like the holocaust to open the film, setting out its stall not as merely popcorn fodder but as a piece more interested in a human side than car chases. It wants to show how these characters developed their ideals not their powers. Magneto is presented as someone so obsessed with equality he's willing to turn everyone into someone like him. Interestingly, the starting point to this particular battle is a vote grabbing Senator who is riding on people's fears to pass a witch hunt law against mutants. After Magneto's plan fails, one of his hench mutants actually disguises herself as the now dead Senator and turns the vote around. How's that for two opposing side causing moderation? The bad guys actually stop the bill because the good guys stopped their far more nefarious scheme. It's a more pertinent message on modern living than `We need guns. Lots of guns.' Nearly every blockbuster of the last decade has been as flawed, so it really is unfair to pick on the Wachowskis' and Lucas's successes to this extent apart from the fact they've had such special treatment compared to everyone else. X-MEN earned a favourable review and an in depth article by Kim Newman in film magazine of record Sight and Sound. Newman's piece however was concerned with the process it took to get the film from the funny-book into the can and the review still felt like it was selling tickets as opposed actually judging whether the film would have any after life apart from sequels. This is the cackhanded way all Hollywood summer juggernauts are brushed aside by the university degree press, and Sight and Sound is more than guilty of this. Perhaps this will go some way to redressing the balance. These movies are the most watched, have the most effect on the economics of the movie business and really do make or break careers. The fact that Singer has once again proven himself to be the master storyteller, as he did with The USUAL SUSPECTS, and made a movie that displays all the merits of big budget entertainment should be of note enough. The fact that it could have more import than a thousand worthy documentaries on modern day prejudices should be celebrated."

Two mutants, Wolverine (tortured by a forgotten past), and Rogue (a young girl with uncanny powers) stumble upon the world of Professor X. He runs a secret school whereby mutants can learn to use their powers, unplagued by the prejudices of an intimidated modern society.

","Comics adaptations are inevitably bad, and a source of great pain to comics fans, so I really expected this film to be very, very bad.  The in-production coverage for X-Men screamed ""Batman meets The Matrix"", too many corridors, too much grey-toned scenery, sculpted grey plastic costumes. Imagine my surprise, then, that it turned out to be the second best fun movie I saw all summer.  It was all lean, no-fat non-stop action.   The plot was dumb, starts pretentious then slides into an animated X-Men conclusion, but the breathless style carried it off.<br/><br/>It has its faults, true, but like the comic these come from its strengths. Wolverine is the only real character, the coolest and sexiest in a very dull bunch, and this is the only part with any meat or development.  The other X-Men you've heard of show up, ""do powers"", and leave, prototypes for the action figures they hope your kids are buying by the truckload.  The women have breasts, which is nice, and one is basically body-painted butt nekkid, to bring in the arrested-development demographic.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, grand old exports of English theatre, bring personal gravitas to underwritten parts, and regardless of how well the film works McKellen remains hopelessly miscast.  The bad guys are bad, but what can you expect from a wrestler and a stunt man?  Toad is one of the dullest villains in comics history, and the movie just keeps throwing ludicrous new powers at him in a vain hope he'll seem less lame.  Please say they're not in the sequel.<br/><br/>For the sake of the effects budget, I'm sure, most of the fight scenes take place in fog, snow or shadow.  Sadly, hiding the strings also makes what should have been absolute show-stoppers difficult to follow.<br/><br/>Its a great blueprint for future franchise efforts, which we can be sure everyone else with a superhero film on their slate will ignore."

You cheered for Superman, you cried in some sad scenes, you enjoyed the ride. But nowadays, you don't get that feeling any more.X-Men came in just about the right time, with its old-fashioned story, in which the main characters, and not just the special effects, have the spotlight.In X-Men you will find everything that makes a movie so great- a terrific director (Brian Singer is the guy responsible for films like Apt Pupil and The Usual Suspects), a brilliant story and great acting by a talented cast, Anna Paquin is so beautiful and great here!she changed a lot since The Piano,the only thing that didn't change is her powerful talent!congratulations for the cast directors for giving to Hugh Jackman the role of Wolverine, this is the part he was born to play, and he is such one hell of a good actor that I am certain that he has a brilliant, stellar future on Hollywood!watch X-Men, and discover again the pleasure to watch a beautiful and old-fashioned story!"

","Times are really changing. I'm old enough to remember fairly regular announcements of my favorite comics characters preparing to leap to silver-screen glory, only to fall dismally short, usually mired in abusrd circuses of litigation. I'm also old enough to recall the slide of the ""Superman"" series into camp hokum, as well as the period in the mid-80's where former Marvel honcho Stan Lee apparently went insane, selling his company's entire character catalogue to the schmucks who made all those Chuck Norris movies. I don't have the room to go into the results, even if I wanted to.<br/><br/>After all that, to watch hopefully as Tim Burton saved the comics world in '89 -then to watch in disbelief as Joel Schumacher turned the character into a Sydney Mardi Gras float- drained me of my enthusiasm for comic-based films by the time ""X-Men"" was finally greenlit.<br/><br/>Well, I always enjoy a film that manages to surprise me! I finally caught a matinee of ""X-Men,"" and it did indeed surprise me. I won't waste words on a play-by-play synopses, if you've seen it, you already have an opinion and if you haven't, I'll simply say you wouldn't be wasting your money or time on this movie. What more can you ask for these days?<br/><br/>It's a simple enough story, told quite effectively; instead of simply hashing over your basic good versus evil spandex grudge-match, Singer and Co. give us an intelligent yet fanciful picture of warring ideologies with the stakes at their most extreme. In the X-Men themselves, we find heroes whom -despite their awesome powers- are as paradoxically complex and ordinary as we are. Even the villains are afforded a strangely refreshing tragic dignity beneath their grotesque surfaces.<br/><br/>Naturally, a great deal of the credit for the success of this film has been bestowed upon Patrick Stewart and (Sir) Ian McKellen, and they do deserve credit just for agreeing to appear in a movie the more effete critics will see as beneath them. Mr. McKellen is to be commended for rising Erik ""Magneto"" Lensherr above a villain, into an angry and misguided victim exploiting his special talents for a most ironic revenge. The film's bedrock, the role of Charles Xavier is obviously no strain on Mr. Stewart's talent, but he deserves gratitude for never playing down to the film or its audience.<br/><br/>Still, it's the supporting cast -all relative newcomers- whom the die-hard fans will turn out in droves for, and they shouldn't be disappointed. I don't claim to be an expert when it comes to the history and characterizations of the X-Men, but I was pleasantly surprised at how accurately they were portrayed, as well as how well they were portrayed. Mr. Jackman and ""The Piano's"" Ms. Paquin in particular provided welcome surprises in their respective pivotal roles as the semi-feral misfit Logan and the lonely, sensitive runaway who calls herself Rogue. Famous covergirls Fammke Jansen, Halle Berry and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, as well as teen idol James Marsden, also contribute solid, dimensional performances in their surprisingly well-scripted parts. Pro-wrestler Tyler Mane, as Victor ""Sabertooth"" Creed, does well with what little of the film he is given, as does red-hot stuntman Ray Park -whose Darth Maul stole the show in ""Star Wars: Episode 1""- as the incredibly agile Mortimer ""Toad"" Toynbee.<br/><br/>In a movie like this, one would normally expect the pre-requisite over-indulgence of special visual effects to glaze over any weaknesses or inconsistencies. Wisely -and thankfully- the filmmakers chose to throttle back substantially on the visuals, which are confined mostly to the battle sequences, and used sparingly throughout the rest of the film; mostly to illustrate the extent of the powers of Xavier's youthful charges. And frankly, I'm pleased to report there aren't really many serious weaknesses or inconsistencies in the film to warrant such glitzy excesses.<br/><br/>Given the generally somber tone, and themes of the storyline (fanaticism, alienation, militant philosophy), ""X-Men"" will probably never achieve the revered classic status of 1978's ""Superman: The Movie"" (ironically, Richard Donner is one of this film's producers). But thanks to its razor-sharp production style and quirky humor, it will likely be every bit as influential, if not a fair bit smarter than Tim Burton's 1989 ""Batman."""

","I'm going to go out on a limb here and predict that Hugh Jackman is going to go on to become a huge Hollywood star. Jackman plays Wolverine in Bryan Singer's silver screen adaptation of Marvel Comics super-group the X-Men. The story is set in the not so distant future where genetic mutation has created what mankind comes to know as mutants, a person born with special abilities or powers. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) is the leader of a group of people that fear the ""mutant menace"" and is championing the introduction of the Mutant Registration Act. Senator Kelly fears for mankind should the mutants ever decide to strike out in anger against the rest of society. Meanwhile, on the other side of the coin there is an ongoing battle between the two major factions in underground mutant society, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men, and Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his Brotherhood of Mutants. Xavier is in favour of a peaceful co-existence between man and mutant and Magneto favours the idea of ruling the inferior homo sapiens. When Magneto's brotherhood attempts to kidnap two newly discovered mutants, named Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine, the X-Men have to intervene. Wolverine and Rogue are offered asylum inside Xavier's School for the Gifted which serves as a window dressing for a school where mutants can learn to control and harness their powers. The school is also the base of operations for the X-Men. Xavier is troubled by Magneto's apparent interest in these two new faces. What could he have in store for them and what would the implications be on the future of mutantkind. Singer directs a wonderful film that concentrates more the characters and the story than the action but never ignores the need to spice up the plot just a little. Setting the tone here is Jackman in his first major film role and what is sure to be a breakout role. Stewart and McKellen deliver powerfully restrained performances as the leaders of the two mutant groups, never appearing too campy or over-bearing. The rest of the supporting cast was simply X-cellent in their respective roles including Ray Park of Star Wars fame as the menacing mutant Toad and former supermodel Famke Janssen as the beautiful Dr. Jean Grey. Long time fans of the Marvel Comics series will take special interest in some of the cameos made by their old favourites and new fans of the story will marvel at the complexity and humanity of a wonderfully crafted story. So in the immortal words of Wolverine, ""Hey bub, get your ass out of that chair and go see my movie!"""

Simply put, there is something here for everyone; there's the obvious story (which is excellent, by the way) which can be taken at face value and will be the attraction of the wider audience, and then there is the allegory to ponder for those who choose to go the distance (sorry, folks, no clues; you have to do it on your own, it's part of what makes this movie so good).  Just be advised, there is a whole lot more to this movie than meets the eye, and it's so well done and delivered, from the directing to the outstanding performances to the dazzling special effects.  Singer has done a superb job of bringing this all to the screen; his pace and timing couldn't be better, and he seems to have an innate sense of what makes this material work, and how to put it across.  This film could so easily have become just another sci-fi `B' rated throw away in the wrong hands, but with Singer at the helm, and with such a great cast, it doesn't come anywhere near sinking to that level.  There is also a restraint in the use of the special effects here that makes them all the more spectacular, and again, Singer must be given credit for that as well. <br/><br/>	As far as the performances, this movie should launch the relatively unknown Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) toward stardom.  He's charismatic and has a magnetic screen presence; he's given Wolverine real depth and credibility and emerges as the star of the show.  Anna Paquin (Rogue) also stands out, creating a truly empathic and sympathetic character that makes her accessible and allows her to connect with the audience.  Other notable performances are turned in by Patrick Stewart (Professor X) and Ian McKellen (Magneto).  The supporting cast includes Halle Berry (Storm), Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Bruce Davison (Senator Kelly), Tyler Mane (Sabretooth), Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) and Ray Park (Toad). 	There is a depth to this story of mutant's living among us that comes, quite frankly, as a pleasant surprise.  The dialogue is believable, and the characters are distinctly drawn and avoid stereotype.  Again, there is nothing about this movie that can be dismissed out-of-hand; even the mutant's names are cryptic, which adds yet another level to the story. Whether or not it was the conscious intent of the author and creator of the X-Men is open to speculation; what is important is that it works, and makes it all that much more engaging.  `X-Men' is destined to become a huge success, and will no doubt spawn welcomed and eagerly anticipated sequels. This movie is further evidence that since `The Matrix' came into being, the genre of Science Fiction has risen to an unprecedented height, the progression of which began with George Lucas and `Star Wars' in 1977.  Since then the cinematic Universe has never been the same, and `X-Men' is proof that it will only continue to expand in the future.  I rate this one 9/10."

","Whenever I hear there that a comic is made into a movie I start to cringe. As a comic fan I have seen a lot of blasphemy. Crying Freeman is the only comic movie that stayed true to the comic. All the other comic movies always have a story differing from the comic. That bothers me but sometimes some comic movies get of the hook. The Punisher and Blade didn't follow the comic but they were good. X-Men surprised me a lot though. The effects were great. There was not a lot of action but somehow the story of Rogue and Wolverine captivated me more, although I think Rogue should have been Kitty or Jubilee. Hugh Jackman is megacool as Wolverine, something that I didn't expect at all. Hugh reminded me of Clint Eastwood though. Don't know why. Maybe his facial expressions or his hair are the reason. I really liked the movie it surprised me. If you like science fiction or comics X-Men is the movie for you. There were 2 negative points though. Mystique looked worse than the Mystique in comics and Cyclops was really a wimp, unlike in the comic where he is a real leader and a likeable character."

","Good sci-fi drama, yes, you can hardly call it an action movie lookin past some sequences. As expected the effects were brilliant, and cool actors that suited their roles.

","First time I saw the trailer I already knew that I had to see it and it was very hard to wait until it finally started in Germany, where I lived at that time. Now I am living in Denmark and yesterday the film started here.Of cause I had to see it again this time in English with subtitles.Having seen the comic strip on television as a youngster and read the comics I was not disappointed at all. My great respects go out to Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). He really is the incarnation of the comic hero.He is the most charismatic and sexy man, with the most incredible screen presence I have ever seen. I am very glad that this other guy, that was supposed to play Wolverine's part was occupied. Brian Singer was lucky to get Hugh to do it. Now the hard time of waiting for the second part starts. But without any doubt an new star is born and his name is definitely Hugh Jackman!!!!!"

","This is without a doubt the best comic to film adaption ever. It is a movie that focuses just as much time on the characters as the action. And the action! Lets just say it is worth seeing for the fight scenes. But still the action scenes are my only gripe! Its not that they're bad, it's that they're short. they don't spend enough time during some of the scenes. I was hooked on the movie as soon as the film introduces Wolverine. The cage scene was just plane fun to watch. And I loved the arguments between Wolverine and Cyclops. They were prettty funny. Bryan Singer(great director)stays very true to many of the characters. Accept couldnt Rogue fly? I was a big fan as a kid and I remember her flying. And whoever casted Hugh Jackon was brilliant. He was the greatest thing to watch while he was Wolverine. He really embodied the character. I hope this film makes him a star(I bet it will.) And the sequel will be great too. If they get the same cast it'll be good. I read that Keana Reeves wants to e Gambit. That should be pretty cool. Only thing I'm worried about that is The paycheck. 9.5/10"

","X-MEN does so many things right for all the right reasons. Bryan Singer and his screenwriters took a comic book property, owned and operated by Marvel Enterprises ( a company that has driven all of its best titles to creative extinction, particularly their X-titles ) and produced a textured, iconic movie.<br/><br/>The comic book characters of Wolverine and Rogue, Magneto and Professor Xavier, the film's main players, are magnificently realized by the actors involved. Whereas the comics' versions of these characters are thin, mechanical props for a corporation to feed off of, the film's actors create histories, motivations, and passions by being earnest, and real, in their portrayals. Hugh Jackman in particular, as Wolverine, is able to take his tough-guy sneer or cocky walk and excellently, almost within the same scene, display kindness and intelligence and a humanity. This kind of acting job is rarely seen in action cinema, and because it IS action cinema, Jackman's accomplishment is nothing short of astounding.<br/><br/>Every scene of X-MEN is fabulously designed by director Singer. Only what is needed is shown onscreen, with excess verbiage and plot boiled down to essentials, but what is there is elegant and powerful. Even with the unfortunate influence of Hollywood's summertime moronics ( the post-elevator ""revenge"" of Storm, a push to get something cool out of Halle Barry, ends up hollow and anti-climactic compared to the life and death struggles around hers; and the hit-and-miss musical score of Michael Kamen stick out ) X-MEN's detailed acting and superb direction obliterate Hollywood's kiss of death. X-MEN is a great movie, with weight and substance stemming from creator talent and passion for the story. An achievement by everyone involved."

","As an old fan of the comics, I have to say that this movie is even greater than those. I stopped reading the comics about 8 years ago(I was ""too old"" for it), but this movie got me thinking that I should start reading it again! This is a not a traditional superhero movie, and thats a good thing. It has depth, a story that can be applied to todays society. It handles issues such as racism, prejudice and genetic-engineering. Of course the movie is no Schindlers list in the way it handles the issues, but I´d say this movie has more depth and thought put in it than some other of the years blockbusters like Gladiator and The Patriot, with no thru and thru ""good"" or ""bad"" side.<br/><br/>The only dissapointment about the film is that it ended, I would still have been glued to my seat if it would have been 3 hours. I cant wait for the sequels, please make them quickly!"

","""If you see one movie this year...."" the old adage has never been more apt than for this brilliant example of action movie making.<br/><br/>  Joel Schumacher take note, when you are bringing comic book characters off the page, this is how you do it! <br/><br/> The key elements in this film are realism, keeping the humour to a minimum,(so that it doesn't descend into farce) and a strong band of key characters, led by established actors that know what they are doing. This movie has all of this and more, with Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen as the base, and Hugh Jackman, Halle Berry, and Anna Paquin making the story come to life.  The special effects were amazing, and the naked Mystique kept cinema goers glued to the screen throughout!  How they didn't let anything slip was incredible!!<br/><br/>     The film is very open for a number of sequals, especially the closing line from Xavier  ""Wherever you go, we will be right there to stop you... old friend"" Bryan Singer, keep it coming, as the other pretenders to the superhero genre have nothing on you!<br/><br/>

","I really was positively surprised about the much talked about X-Men movie.<br/><br/>The characters have been brought on screen in a wonderful way - especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Halle Berry as Storm were fantastic in roles as super-heroes. The whole atmosphere is very dark and gritty, which fits the movie very well in its attempt to show a society scared of mutants.<br/><br/>
The way in which many small tidbits from the comic books were thrown into the movie was really a joy to see - characters like Kitty Pryde and Iceman or Rogues famous white hair as well as Cyclops remark about yellow latex costumes were just perfect to make this movie a real experience..."

","Director Brian Singer has a good track record, as the writer/director of the utterly superb Usual Suspects.  This is his first foray into blockbuster summer action movies.<br/><br/>For a newbie, he's not done too badly at all: X-Men is one of the best action films of the year.  It's well-written and generally well-acted. Standouts are the previously unknown Hugh Jackman, who is awesomely charismatic - expect to see more of this man! - and Anna Paquin is highly sympathetic as a young mutant whose mere touch is potentially lethal.  Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart are as reliable as ever as the two conflicting mutant leaders.  The rest of the cast don't get much of a look-in, although Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is memorable (admittedly not so much for her acting as for the fact that she spends the whole film naked save for some strategically-placed blue paint).<br/><br/>X-Men is surprisingly short for a summer blockbuster - only 104 minutes - and in some respects is perhaps *too* short.  The plot can be summed up on the back of an envelope: Act 1 - what is Magneto up to? , Act 2 - so that's what Magneto's up to, we'd better stop him.  Not exactly War and Peace!  In some respects it's actually quite refreshing to have such a crisply plotted film, but on the other hand it's very obvious that there's a sequel on the way; important plot arcs are left unfinished at the close of the film.<br/><br/>This film will no doubt be the start of a profitable franchise.  It's an enjoyable film with rather more gravitas than most summer popcorn movies and it well deserves its success."

It probably won't satisfy hard-core fans but it was rather enjoyable for people like me. Hugh Jackman was amazing as Wolverine as was Anna Paquin as Rogue.

"matzucker","7","0","0","6 September 2000"," Would be better as a TV series.
","X-Men was entertaining, yes. But the one thing that was claimed made it into more than the average comic adaptation was the character development that, in my opinion, doesn't exist. There are simply too many potentially interesting characters here to explore them all in 95 minutes. Hence, except for Hugh Jackman's and Anna Paquin's characters, all others get short shrift. <br/><br/>As opposed to many other (made from comic) movies, the characters here leave you stunningly detached. No wonder- with this little time, one might say. But that also seemed to be the case with the actors. None of them seems to take great interest in differentiating their roles through their portrayal. But how could they? The narrative squanders aimlessly, the dialogue is probably as bad as it gets, and a little irony towards the material (as displayed in the Superman features) would have gone a long way towards preventing ""X-Men"" from total cheesiness. Well, it's not cheesy throughout, mind you, but at least once too often. <br/><br/>Besides, as I expected, the film is nowhere near as clever or important as it has often been claimed: the message of tolerance is a good one as a concept, but because of the script (which is less than stellar, I might add. Couldn't Christopher McQuarrie have done it?) and foremost the sheer haste with which Bryan Singer sweeps through the story and past any REAL drama, the film ultimately sabotages its own point. The heroes are heroes. The villains are villains. Good is good. Bad is bad. But please, live together peacefully! Any shades of gray get lost somewhere between the ten or so main characters. Pity. This really could have had a point to make.<br/><br/>That said, I must, however, admit, that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. As popcorn entertainment, it's great, and certainly more worthwhile than any of the latest Bruckheimer action flicks. And I'd personally embrace any movie featuring Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Anna Paquin altogether. But somehow, it all left me a bit disappointed considering the hype about how different from other comic adaptations this was supposed to be. As a result, X-Men might have been a lot better as a TV series pilot. With that cast, those FX, and that huge pool of characters and story possibilities, don't you think it'd do great on a weekly basis? I sure do."

If your a fan of the cartoon series and the comic books, then X-Men is the one to watch.<br/><br/>Fans of special effects will also love this movie. There are some great scenes in X-Men where special effects are put to good use.<br/><br/>
The action in this movie is also very high. Infact there's never a dull moment in X-Men. <br/><br/>9/10."

","[This comment contains what some people might consider SPOILERS]<br/><br/>First of all, I had never heard of the X-Men comic book before I heard about Bryan Singer directing this film, I've never read the comic and I haven't got a clue where to find copies, so this comment is written from an ""uninformed"" point of view.<br/><br/>""X-Men"" was better than I expected. It had a good plot, a very fascinating story indeed, good actors (Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen need I say more?), and nice visual and special effects. My main complaints, though, are: Toad -- he is just too close to the ridiculous -- and the fact that it is too short. I don't mean too short as in ""Bryan Singer wasn't able to tell his story in that short amount of time,"" I simply mean that the film was so darn entertaining that I wanted it to go on for at least thirty minutes more. Nevermind. To get back to the acting: Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are the stand-outs of course, but Anna Paquin was much better than I expected and Hugh Jackman was brilliant as Wolverine. And Wolverine God, if he was around I'd swoon just so that he could catch me in his strong arms. Jealous of Jean Grey [Famke Janssen]? Me? Certainly not! :-) As for that cute little semi-love story I really think that Wolverine should wait until Rogue (Paquin) gets a little older. They would be a great couple. Of the X-Men there are two characters who are let down by the script: Cyclops and Storm. Cyclops walks around looking cool, not much more, and though Storm is indeed stunningly beautiful I really hope that she gets more room in the inevitable sequel. And of course, all the villains, except for Magneto, are also only shadows of what they could be, but I guess that we will get to know them when the sequel arrives (with that ending there just *has* to be a sequel).<br/><br/>In short: Stewart + McKellen + WOLVERINE + fascinating story + good direction/ing = wicked film!!

","To be honest I've never read ""X-Men"" long enough that it would make me a true X-Men fan. However I was stunned how serious this film brought the comic to life. There also were many quotes and moments that become even better, if you know the comic. I don't think it is a good idea to make movies out of comic books but this time and with one or two Tim Burton movies, too, it worked very well. Anna Paquin, Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are absolute convincing, justifying every modification made on the character. Even ruce Davison was great and let no doubt about the sincerity of his action occur. The only thing that bothered me a little was that - at least in the german dubbed version of the film - small touch of ""arrogant right hand"" put onto Cyclops but here, too, I think fans of the comic book now better. Although he always said to be no fan of the comic, Bryan Singer seemed to have made a film full of love for the material making that over the top characters like Magneto or Sabretooth appear serious and true. ""X-Men"" stands way above the usual superhero flicks in character and plot development but also doesn't try to look more real through cutting superpowers to a more realistic level. And for the visual expressiveness, seeing someone carrying a tray with glasses of champaign in Wolverine's dream or Professor Xavier graciously standing up from a chair inside Kelly's memories are just two little details of many, where the action movie grows to be art. I surely can't wait to see Beast or Gambit in action but for a sequel it would also be an idea to concentrate more on the characters that are standing on the side line in the first movie like Storm or Cyclops. After all ""X-Men"" is a great piece of film, fun to watch and almost flawless in portraying some of the greatest comic heroes of all times and lets recent superhero flicks like ""Batman & Robin"" look even more hollow than they already are. I hope, their will be more films like ""X-Men"" in the future but I also hope, that Marvel understands that there is a big difference between the movies and the comic books and don't repeat the mistake of letting a film change an already existing comic like they did with ""Blade""."

","A vibrant action comic book translation with a eye to future sequels.It unfortunately travels the easy ""genesis"" path of why and how the heroes originate. Its about time that film makers realised that most of their audience knows the why's and wherefores. They could then concentrate on producing a movie with a strong independent storyline involving the characters.<br/><br/>A film about the Vietnam War does not need an explanation of the political and economic factors creating the war.

","I was expecting much from this film and (surprisingly) I wasn´t disappointed. Most comic book-based films are badly made and just plain silly, but this one was an exception (like Batman 1&2). Director Bryan Singer has made a serious film, with only a few light gags -which all fit perfectly into the film. The story centers around Wolverine and Roque, who both are introduced as newcomers to rest of the group. The big story is about stopping Magneto´s plans, but it´s somehow of lesser importance than the relationship between Wolverine and Rogue, which doesn´t bother me at all. This is an action movie but the talky parts are better than the action -something that is very rare in a blockbuster!- and I think it´s all the better a movie for it. The acting is great: Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine, he´s a marvel to behold; Anna Paquin is great as the tragic Rogue; Patrick and McKellen are great as usual and the rest of the cast looks great (especially the ladies...) but have little to do. This is certainly a beginning for a saga and it doesn´t bother me, because in the long run, I´m sure it will work nicely with its sequels. A great, original film. Go see it!"

","I have never been a fan of X-Men in my life. The characters always seemed dumb in the cartoon series on Fox Kids, and I've never read the comics of it. I wasn't very psyched that that they were making an X-Men movie, but then I found out that Bryan Singer was directing it. That seemed very interesting, because Usual Suspects and Apt Pupil (both great films) had little to no action in them. Then I also found out that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were starring in it, along with a bunch of young actors with no really major credit (besides Anna Paquin with The Piano). That got me more interested, and once I saw the preview I knew I had to go see this movie. I'm glad I did. X-Men has so much to offer in an hour and a half, and as I was sitting there watching Toad walk on walls, Professor X use Cerebro, Magneto floating through the air, and the climactic battle scene of Wolverine Vs. Sabretooth on the Statue of Liberty, I was thinking, THIS is what you go to the movies for.<br/><br/>And not only does X-Men have fantastic special effects, great stunts, and X-ceptional battle scenes, it also has a good story and good characters. I know some of them deserved more screen time, but they still were such great actors who really portrayed the fact that the X-Men weren't all happy best friends. I loved the tension between Logan (Wolverine) and Cyclops. You can tell that they didn't like each other from the start. And the story was not built around special effects and fight scenes (unlike a very overrated movie starring Keanu Reeves), but it had substance. I could tell Bryan Singer really wanted to prove that a movie based on comic books could be more than a comic-book movie. And of course, this movie had the COOLEST villains in it. Mystique was a purely evil and sinister spy and had the coolest morphing ability (her power was probably the coolest out of all the mutants), Toad had a wicked sense of humor and was great to see in battle using his tongue, slime, and leaping ability to fantastic use, Sabretooth was a badass mutant with strong senses of smell and had sweet fight scenes with Logan (especially the fight on top of Ellis Island), and Magneto was played SO well by Ian McKellan you could just FEEL his presence throughout the movie. He also had such an awesome power. I'd love to be able to control all metal objects.<br/><br/>All in all, X-Men was one of funnest movies I've ever been to in a long time. It will never bore you and will keep you captivated with it's phenomenal special effects, awesome fight scenes, great humor, exciting story, and characters you can grow to love. Now I can't wait until the sequel. 10/10"
"dbost-2","Null","0","0","1 September 2000"," The #4 Superhero Movie of All Time
","Allow me to introduce my inner geek.  I own Spiderman #3 (first appearance of Doctor Octopus).  I keep it in a mylar case, and I display it prominently in my home.  I collect comic books.  More specifically, when I was a kid I collected Marvel comic books.  People who didn't collect might not understand the distinction, but let me explain: Marvel published Spiderman, the Fantastic Four, the Hulk and Daredeviland Marvel published the X-Men. And as long as I read X-Men comics, I dreamed of an X-Men movie.  So, this past Sunday, it was not without considerable emotional baggage that I plunked down my $9.50 to watch the movie version of the X-Men.<br/><br/>
Let's back up a second.  Following are the top 10 comic book super-hero movies ever:<br/><br/>1. Superman (1978)<br/><br/>2. Batman (1966)<br/><br/>3. Superman II (1980)<br/><br/>And that's it.  4 through 10 are a no-show, because the rest of those super-hero movies rot-including (and especially) the recent Batman movies. But then there's X-Men'.  Honestly?  I think X-Men' is #4.<br/><br/>
The tone of the X-Men movie is grim, but not humorless.  It takes the outrageous comic book conventions seriously enough that we believe they believe.  It's not burdened with the need to ironically joke about how stupid the very idea of superheroes is, and, as a consequence, the movie takes itself seriously enough to be fun.  And the movie's themes, about bigotry and human rights, aren't profound, but they're there.  Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is to Martin Luther King as Magneto (Ian McKellen) is to Malcolm X, if you can believe it.  As directed by Bryan Singer (Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil), this comic book movie actually has some interesting ideas in it.<br/><br/>Okay.  The set-up: for reasons nobody understands, some people are born with strange super-powers they're mutants.  But, just like there are good lawyers and bad lawyers, there are good mutants and bad mutants.  The X-Men are good.  Magneto is bad.<br/><br/>Magneto is a powerful mutant with a dastardly plan: to expose all of the world's leaders to dangerous levels of radiation, turning them into the things they fear most: mutants.  Once they've been mutated, it stands to reason they'll have to defend their own rights as mutants.  It's actually a great plan, not the usual super-villain grab for power.  As much as he can in a story like this, Singer takes conventional good-vs-evil stuff and twists it.  Magneto isn't evilhe's a Holocaust survivor who sees mutants as the next persecuted minority.   As my friend Jeff said, this may be the first movie ever where the Jew in the concentration camp is the bad guy.<br/><br/>We don't get to know most of the characters in this movie, but anybody who's allowed real screen time is engaging-which is why Wolverine and Rogue are the most interesting X-Men.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) is, hands down, the best X-Man here.  He was even sexy enough to elicit whistles from womenand maybe menin the theatre I was in.  Wolverine is first seen making money in bar-fights and fighting off anti-mutant bigotry with his retractable claws. We're told his skeleton is made of metal, and we can hear his knuckles clang when he lands a punch.  Wolverine takes runaway teen Rogue (Anna Paquin) under his wing, and here the movie wisely merges two comic book characters, Rogue and Kitty Pryde, giving Wolverine a powerful little sister to protect (I told you I was a comic book geek).  Enough is hinted at about Wolverine's past to ensure he'll be back in X-Men 2: Electric Boogaloo'.<br/><br/>As for the rest, the X in Professor X's name apparently stands for xposition, because that's all he gets to do.  Cyclops ought to be called Cypher, and Storm and Jean Grey just fade into the background.  The villains -- besides Magneto and super-model super-villain Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), are pretty dull, but then the X-Men never had great villains besides Magneto.  It doesn't matter muchMagneto and Wolverine provide enough kick to get this movie series off to a strong start.<br/><br/>Well, wait.  Maybe there were some other good villains.  The Sentinels? Arcade?  Huh.<br/><br/>I'll have to get back to you after I check my collection."

Therefore, the true fans of the comics will enjoy this film, but for others you will like the action but will find the movie's plot to be average"

The acting was very satisfying, New Zealander Anna Paquin in particular gave another sparkling performance. The writing and screenplay were very good, Bryan Singer put lots of effort into this film.

I was extremely skeptical, but agreed to go along since I like Patrick Stewart (Dr. X) and will see almost anything with him in it. Just in case I would be totally lost, my boyfriend gave me a 5 minute overview of the premise behind X-Men.<br/><br/>Turns out that his prelude was totally unnecessary - although there was one reference to ""yellow spandex"" that confused me until it was explained to me. The movie was wonderful - the characters had a lot of depth (although I'm told some of them are slightly different from the comic) and the acting was superb, especially from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen (Magneto). Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) was wonderful, but Halle Berry (Storm) was somewhat miscast. The story was interesting and the makeup & special effects were amazing. There are very interesting issues raised by the premise of X-Men in general. Maybe I'm reading too much into it, but it's one of the few movies I've seen where the ""bad guys"" aren't necessarily evil in the traditional sense - their *means* may be questionable, but their *ends* are actually quite noble.<br/><br/>A great movie - I can't wait for the sequels!"
"theo47","9","0","0","15 July 2000"," Best comic book adaptation ever?
","X-MEN, besides being the best comic book adaptation since the original SUPERMAN, works nicely as a cultural allegory and is directed with a confident hand by Bryan Singer. The story, with its climax on the Statue of Liberty, is, admittedly, a bit comic book-y, but - do I really need to say this? - it IS based on the Marvel comics. However, the movie captures the comics' tone perfectly, and has its tongue-just-far-enough-in-cheek to acknowledge the absurdity of the situation without giving in to camp. Perhaps most refreshing is the movie allowing itself to spend the first hour getting to know each of the X-Men (and their counterparts, The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants) -- their personalities as well as their powers. The movie's central theme - growing up feeling different - plays out amongst the heroes: Professor X as a father figure to the X-Men, Wolverine as a big brother to Rogue, Cyclops as the son trying to make Professor X proud, etc. This new ""family"" manages to gel enough to challenge the evil mutants' plans at the end, with the fireworks and fisticuffs you'll expect. Some of these scenes suffer because of a (relatively) low budget and a studio which rushed a movie to summer that was supposed to come out at Christmastime (or perhaps, ""X-Mas""?). Once Fox counts up all the profits from this movie, I would hope they would spend enough on ""X-Men 2"" to replace some of the unconvincing wire work seen here with those do-anything CGI effects. Another smart move would be to replace Michael Kamen (whose last project was conducting an orchestra with Metallica) with pretty much anyone else, and giving that person time enough to write a decent score. With 30-odd years of X-Men history, there are plenty of additions and subtractions that could be made to the cast of the sequel. However, each charactor in ""X-Men"" merits a return, in smaller or larger ways. The most important ingredient is obviously Singer, who has a firm grasp on just how to translate that long history to film, and how to do it with style."

Of course, we've got the addition of the US Government scientific research.....

"Steve_loughran","4","0","0","28 August 2000"," mindless but with reasonable FX
","With the basic concepts of 'strange powers appearing at puberty' and 'reaction of society to the perceived threat from within', it is easy to envisage a movie embracing and exploring the concepts of youth alienation, discrimination in modern society and even how brittle 'civilisation' is in respect to perceived internal threats, from race to communism -or capitalism, depending on your economic system.<br/><br/>The X-Men is not such a movie. Instead the post-pubertal characters hide from society, appearing only to wage war on an enemy called 'Magneto'. Somehow my willing suspension of disbelief is unwilling to suspend itself at the sight of a character seemingly straight out the depths of the Flash Gordon universe, which kind of restricts one's enjoyment of the show.<br/><br/>The other item which somewhat hampered my willing belief suspension was the use of a supersonic vertical take-off and landing fully-stealthed aircraft as the X-men's transport. If they can build those without needing the infrastructure of a military jet manufacturer -why waste time with minor special powers when they could go into business selling such aircraft at $2 billion a throw?<br/><br/>Apart from those foibles, it is mostly harmless fun, although it leaves itself suspiciously wide open for sequels. This may be no bad thing -the batman series certainly got darker and more thoughtful when Tim Burton took over. Of course, using Batman as an example one is forced to point at the Joel Schumacher followups, including the widely despised Batman and Robin. X-Men is nowhere near that bad, but the sequels could go either way."
"The_Movie_Cat","7","0","0","27 August 2000"," ""Mankind has always feared what it doesn't understand""
","I don't really know if X-Men is the greatest superhero movie ever made, but it's certainly the coolest.<br/><br/>The comic series was the ultimate in style over substance, and very chic it was too. It originally stiffed as a Stan Lee/Jack Kirby alternative to Marvel's own range of Fantastic Four/Avengers/Spiderman, et al., almost coming close to cancellation. An idea of how relatively unsophisticated these early issues were reveal that the ""X"" in X-Men originally stood for ""Xtra"". A five-strong team, only two of them really make it through to the movie. Angel, a winged playboy, is wholly absent, while plans to include the acrobatic beast were dropped after his later transformation into a blue-furred creature proved too extensive an undertaking. Bobby Drake as the Iceman does get a small role in the form of Shawn Ashmore, though this is as a young student, and not the same age group as Cyclops or Jean Grey. Jean Grey (codenamed ""Marvel Girl"" in the comics, one of the series' less inspired inventions, and absent here) appears with James Marsden as the guy who can shoot lasers from his eyes.<br/><br/>When the comic became cool was when it's allegorical issues (mutated humans as oppressed minorities) were scripted by Chris Claremont in the mid-seventies onwards. He totally reworked the team into largely what it is on screen. (Though the popular Nightcrawler is missing, and I didn't spot Colossus, played as a bit part by Donald Mackinnon). Debatably the most popular superhero of the Marvel range, Wolverine was also arguably the first short superhero, his 5'3 frame here being transformed into the 6'2 build of Hugh Jackman. Jackman is magnificent, his cynical, taciturn view emerging from the seedy bars and fighting clubs he frequents, later being used to prick the more absurd elements of the plot. His adamantium claws are truly impressive on screen (the special effects being used, as elsewhere, to serve the plot, rather than being the plot. George Lucas, please take note), and he even gets to use them on Cyclops as a new form of ""giving the finger"". His sniping, macho relationship with Cyclops provides some of the better sequences, and Jackman's timing means that these elements always seem spontaneous, not bog-standard retorts written to order. Best line? After emerging from a battle with the shapechanging Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) who assumed his form, he finds Cyclops ready to blast him, just in case. ""Wait, it's really me"" he urges. ""Prove it"", he's told. ""You're a dick"" comes the reply. Cyclops can only nod in agreement. Perhaps less successful is his love for Jean Grey (Famke Jannsen) which, while again being true to the comic, isn't that well developed on screen.<br/><br/>Wolverine gets all the best lines, all the coolest things to do, and is one of the three main characters involved, the rest just peripheral to greater or lesser extents. Patrick Stewart gets a fair chunk of the earlier part of the film, doling out exposition as Captain Jean-Luc, er, Professor Charles Xavier. It must be disheartening for some of the cast that Stewart is such a good actor without having really to try, and there is evidence here that's he going through the motions. Halle Berry gives a great effort as Storm, yet doesn't really impress. Maybe she's miscast, as I always imagined Storm with a bit more attitude, sort of a Grace Jones type.<br/><br/>Then there's Ian McKellen as Magneto, unused to the SF franchise lark, and so managing to outact Stewart by a considerable margin. His character is still fraught with the odd problem, mainly, his origins. The X-Men series is, of course, foolproof, as no real ""origin"" is needed. There are no cosmic rays, no gamma blasts, and no getting bitten by arachnids of radioactive properties. They've got the powers from birth/puberty and that's all there is to it. Yet the film casts McKellen as Erik Lehnsherr, Jewish victim of the holocaust. This is still reasonably true to the comics, and the sequence is brilliantly shot, lashings of rain making it look like a Kurosawa wet dream, yet this does take something away. The whole idea about the X-Men is that it's allegorical (later sequences allude to, but do not directly represent, the McCarthy witch trials), yet the idea of the lead villain being a persecuted Jew is spelling it out. This comes across as similar to a scene in ""Beneath the Planet of the Apes"" where we are shown chimpanzee war protesters. Allegory and literalism are two separate elements, and should not be mixed. Again, McKellen is ideally suited towards this sort of thing, being homosexual in real life, though it's all-encompassing reference to persecution of minorities is somewhat offset by the generic good looks of the cast.<br/><br/>Characters are reasonably well drawn, the script is literate, and there's a real sense that the people involved cared about what they were making. There's nice little in-jokes (a reference to Wolverine's comic book ""yellow spandex"", whereas here the group wear cool black leather) and cameos from mutants that don't have a real part to play, though not introduced to casual audience distraction (Ariel/Shadowcat in particular getting a nice throwaway appearance). There's even a great explanation of how Rogue (Anna Paquin) gets the white streak in her hair.<br/><br/>But this isn't a film for comic book fans, it's based purely towards casual audiences who may never have even picked up an issue. Some argue that it's too short, but for a superhero movie it sensibly neglects the dragging two-hours plus duration and goes for the 104 minutes slot. It has three clear acts and leaves you wanting more. Note how Wolverine's mysterious origins are not revealed, but left hanging, rather than the neat sewing up of loose ends that left Batman with nowhere to go after he avenged his parents' death in the first Tim Burton movie. Also notable (if not necessarily commendable) is that the X-Men kill their enemies, and it's not just Wolverine doing the slaying.<br/><br/>I don't know if this film will stand up to repeated viewings. In five years' time it might be hopelessly outdated, or it's funky, slick style and stylish - though not ostentatious - direction might be lost on me. I suspect it really contains very little substance at all, but it's snappy, yet realistic dialogue and ""wow"" super-powered fight scenes are clouding my reasoning. Who needs one Batman when you can have a whole army of mutants? No, in just a few years' time I might wake up and see this for what it really is. But for now, X-Men is the best summer blockbuster film of the last ten years."

","I'm the first to admit I'm something of a purist in my comic adaptations. I don't look for absolute faithfulness. I accept that the movie is in an alternate reality, but I do want each character to act reasonably within the bounds of their comics persona. That said, I'd say the X-Men was about 70% there.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a fairly good script with decent dialogue (although it certainly slips occasionally. Listen for Storm's closing remark to Toad for a particularly odd line). Without the inaccurate characterizations bothering me, this movie would rank much higher, though there are still some plot holes you could drive a Mack Truck through.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, and Ian McKellan are all outstanding in their respective roles. Most of the rest of the cast is acceptable to good, with the notable exceptions of James Marsden (Cyclops), Ray Park (Toad), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique). It's not really the actors' fault in the case of the latter three; they're just miscast and mishandled. Marsden is too young to play Cyclops and he plays him as an unlikeable little snot. One wants to see Wolverine skewer the jerk. Cyclops is a straight arrow; he's not a snot. Mystique isn't mute, reptillian, or a nudist, nor is Toad a wise-cracking, hip, young tough with tongue-flicking, goo-spitting action. All these characters have lost what made them special in the comics.<br/><br/>The movie plays like someone did their homework on the source material and then someone else willfully ignored it.  There are some great cameos (watch for Iceman, Jubilee, Shadowcat, Pyro, the New Mutants and probably others), but there are also problems. The filmmakers went to the trouble to include Henry Peter Gyrich, but then spell his name wrong in the credits.  A major plot point also hinges around Rogue being able to steal Magneto's powers, when it's an explicit fact that Magneto is the only known person resistant to her powers.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad effort at all. I've seen much, much worse. But there's still room for improvement."

I mean, how many times could one man smash the might of Hitler's war machine.<br/><br/>Then they arrived like manna from Heaven for a comics nut.<br/><br/>Looking back now, they seem to have cascaded onto the newsagents stands.

But by and large, whatever disapproving teachers and psychologists would say, they helped to broaden my imagination.<br/><br/>
To date,though, with the exception of the (for me) insipid and disappointing Incredible Hulk TV series and the admirable Surfer animation, that is where they have remained.<br/><br/>So you won't be surprised to hear that I was looking forward to this one.<br/><br/>While I had religiously gone to ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" big-screen interpretations, (and I still swear by ""Batman Returns""), Marvel characters will always be pre-eminent for me.<br/><br/>And while its less than a week since I've seen the movie I will have to say that this is one time where I'm grateful for the use of computerised graphics in the cinema. In its depiction of titanic battles between the wonderfully-realised mutants the film scores almost all its plus points as, in many other respects, it seems to me film-making by numbers.<br/><br/>Rope in a few 'distinguished' British actors to lend gravitas as the opposing mutant leaders, introduce some attractive-looking B-list actors to offset the special effects budget overruns, and sprinkle the script liberally with wise-cracks. Oh, and take time to introduce all the characters individually. With an eye on the series, and the attendant merchandising spin-offs. Of course the plot involves a battle to save civilisation as we know it.<br/><br/>I don't know why I'm complaining. I'll probably be queuing for first-run showings of the remainder of the series'. Even if Bryan Singer continues as director.<br/><br/>Singer has gone on record as saying he was never a fan. I would have to say I'm not really surprised as the movie ultimately seems first and foremost a computer-animation project which serves as an introduction to the world of X-Men. Of course I'm speaking as one of the seemingly few who wasn't bowled over by his ""Usual Suspects"". In any case that movie depended to a large extent on the quality of the performances and its a safe bet that there will be no Oscar nominations here.<br/><br/>I'm not sure was Tim Burton asked to direct. Perhaps the money-men wouldn't tolerate his excesses.

","It is really hard to review a film based on a novel without being disappointed by the necessary changes a director has made.  It's even harder to be objective when the movie is based on a piece of literature that has been adding new chapters every month for over 30 years. <br/><br/>""X-men"" is based on Stan Lee's ground breaking comic book about the persecution of Mutants, humans who have evolved into a new powerful race called ""Homo Superior.""  Despite being persecuted by normal folks, a small group of mutants band together to protect humanity from the evil mutants who seek to destroy them. It has been for many years the largest selling American comic book, mixing all the elements of a great adventure novel with pictures of people in shiny yellow spandex.  The film has tried to create a delight for long time comic fans, while not not totally confusing the general public with no idea of the X-mens' 30 year long backstory. So here are a few of the good, and not so good characteristics of the film. I'll do my best not to make comparison to the comics.<br/><br/>Good.<br/><br/>Acting.   Hugh Jackman, as Wolverine was fantastic.  Surly, feral but with a heart of gold, he was the star of the film by a mile.  Even my comic-illiterate companions enjoyed his performance, laughing at every one liner, and gasping as Wolverine performed his tricks with his personal Ginsu knife set, the unbreakable metal blades that shoot out from his knuckles. Anna Pacquin showed real emotion as Rogue, the teenage girl risks killing everyone she touches and there were also fine performances by Ray Park as Toad and James Marsden as Cyclops in small supporting roles.<br/><br/>Directing.  Bryan Singer obviously worked hard on this. You can feel the great moments. The love triangle between Marsden, Jackman and Famke Jansen as Jean Grey is one of the highlights, as are the little touches of humour. After being admonished by team leader Cyclops, Wolverine retracts his knuckle blades slowly, leaving the middle blade standing defiantly up in a one finger salute.  However in trying to please every one , Singer has left the product a little empty.  The confrontation between the two mentors of the good and evil mutants, Xavier and Magneto, only sparkles for an instant outside a train station, and fails to deliver for most of the film.<br/><br/>The Bad.  Well, its what is missing that lets the film down. Not enough action, little character development, and the fact that the best villain, (an evil bigoted senator called Kelly) explodes halfway into the film, really disappointed me. It reminded me of a Milk Dud hidden in a bowl of broccoli. You had to wade through too much horrible, boring stuff to get to the good stuff"

I hate them, they're too crass and 'Sunset Beach'-ish.Thankfully what I witnessed on the 24th of August was not a comic translation of camp superheroes dressed in Superman's leftovers. The X-men themselves defy logic, as does this film.<br/><br/>The plotline is far, far more potent and substantial than most so-called dramas today - a clear battle of hatred and fear shown in society today represented not as a good ol'fight between bad and evil but a complex delve into human motive.<br/><br/>The plot however remains light and accessible for its 12+ ( UK ) rating. The running time was short and sweet leaving the audience in anticipation of a sequel - take a note John Woo, Tom Cruise etc,..<br/><br/>Pivotal performances from Stewart and McKellen form the basis of the film's underbelly whilst a remarkably Russell Crowe-like Hugh Jackman is the perfect rogue hero. And on that note the real life Rogue, Storm and Cyclops are well played by the stupendously gorgeous Halle Berry and rising stars Paquin and Marsden. The villains say little and are basically Magneto's stooges but their excitable ones at that. Park, Mane and Stamos all adding to the flavour.<br/><br/>This film was a welcome additon to a summer of not quite blockbuster proportions given the early part of the year. However I have one warning. Bryan Singer has moulded the film into the perfect launchpad for cult-status away from the picturebook geek squadron. When the sequels come which they surely will, please,please,please keep the format and cast, crew. It is very rare that a series of films swaps key roles succesfully ( Star Wars ), most keep the linchpins ( Indiana Jones )and those that fail... well, we all remember Batman and Robin don't we comicbook fans."
"Shalamar","Null","0","0","24 August 2000"," Yet more drooling over Hugh Jackman
","I'm yet another person who never read the comics, watched the animated series occasionally, and yet saw the movie.  Why?  Two reasons.  Number One is that I'm married to a rabid fanboy who's collected the comics since he was a kid.  Number Two is that I may not be an X-Men fan per se, but I am definitely a Wolverine fan.<br/><br/>Back in February my husband told me that Dougray Scott had to bow out of ""X-Men"", and that a newcomer named Hugh Jackman had been hired in his place. My response was probably not unique:  ""Hugh WHO?"".  So I looked him up on the Internet, and I was not inspired by what I saw.  A handsome, dark-haired man with a pleasant smile.  THIS guy was going to play Wolverine, the biggest badass to ever strut out of the Frozen North?  (I'm a Canadian too, by the way.)  Yeah, right!<br/><br/>Then I saw some publicity stills in Entertainment Weekly, and I started to wonder.  The hair ... looked pretty good.  It could've looked silly, but they managed to get the DA style with the two trademark points just right. The claws looked pretty damn good, too.  Maybe this guy had possibilities, but just because he looked the part didn't mean he could play the Canucklehead.<br/><br/>Then came the previews and the TV special, and I found myself starting to become convinced - especially when I saw the shot of him leaning against a wall, in full X-Men getup, flipping out both sets of claws like switchblades (when I saw the movie I realized that this was just before he goes toe-to-toe with Mystique).<br/><br/>Then I saw the movie.<br/><br/>Is it perfect?  Hell, no.  The budget was slashed (pun intended), and Singer was forced to have a summer release date rather than a Christmas one. This hurt the movie, no question.  Is it a good movie nonetheless?  I think so, and the main reason is Mr. Jackman.  If he had been a less-perfect Wolverine, the movie would have gone down the tubes faster than you can say ""snikt"".<br/><br/>Ladies, if you haven't seen this movie yet (and I'm sure there's still one or two of you who haven't) ... GO.  Even if you think comics are dumb (I don't, I just don't read 'em is all), you'll love Wolverine.  He's sexy, he's menacing, he's dangerous, and dammit, he's protective of the women in his life.  What more can you ask?<br/><br/>P.S.  Memo to Jean Grey - I've thought this for years, and now I'm convinced - you're nuts to stay with Cyclops.  At least give Wolvie a tumble.  This guy is aching for you, and you're saying no?  Cyclops need never know - you're the one who's psychic, not him!"

","""X-Men"" was one of the films I was excited to see this summer.  After having been assaulted by the previews and promotion, I went to see this adaptation of the Marvel Comics classic.  As the titles came up, my heart beat rose with fevered anticipation. At the end, all I could say to myself was ""Man! That was totally non-climactic!""  ""X-Men"" was such a disappointment. Something was severely lacking... a plot!!!  The film relied too heavily on explaining the superpowers of the X-Men.  Dull!!!  I mean, sure, we have to understand such things to get the complete picture, but couldn't they have done it in a more interesting manner?  The action sequences in this film were average at best.  The big finale at the Statue of Liberty was, well, not that great.  Bryan Singer is not an action director and it shows. I wish he'd go back to making great films like ""The Usual Suspects"".  Still, I have to say Hugh Jackman was the perfect Wolverine (although X-Men purists complain he is too tall... get over it).  I wish that they had worked as hard on establishing the other characters as they did with Wolverine.  All in all, X-Men was o.k.  I hope they make a sequel to explain everything that was left unanswered.  It's so obvious the studio planned for a sequel, which is why the ending of this film ends as a first chapter rather than as complete movie.  I'll probably go and see the sequel when it comes out, but I pray they make a film that stands on its own."

","I thought the film X-men was brilliant. As a fan of the cartoon and comic books, I was really looking forward to seeing the motion picture. The parts were played well and I believe the correct actor for each part was chosen and that they played to the best of their outstanding ability. Fans of the cartoon will notice that favourite characters such as 'Beast', 'Gambit' and 'Jubilee' did not make profound appearances in the movie. At first I was shocked and annoyed that they had thoughtlessly left out these parts. However, now I can see some reasoning to it I appreciate the action taken. As this will undoubtedly be the first of at least one sequal, we can be sure to see our favourites in later editions of the series. An opener to a series, such as this film was, would obviously have to be a mere introduction to the plot, characters and general story. Therefore, I hope to see my personal favourite, 'Gambit', in the next film as, I'm sure, do many. If the sequal is only half as amazing as the first then I'm sure no one will be disappointed."

","I expected the best, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Being a fan of the X-Men since my childhood, I was hoping the movie didn't corrupt the spirit that was on the comics. I wasn't too afraid as I saw Stan Lee Himself was involved in the movie - but Stephen King was also involved in poor movies from his novels. Actually, the characters were quite close to those from the comics, and the storyline followed the spirit of Stan Lee's.<br/><br/>I was surprised concerning the order of appearance of the super-heroes: Angel and The Beast are not there (what a shame) and Iceman is still a child when Wolverine is recruited. Collossus is not there either, but he might have arrived later in the comics (my memory is not that good).<br/><br/>Concerning the heroes' behaviour, I was surprised by two points: evil characters seem stronger and/or good ones weaker, and the ""girls"" lost a part of their abilities.<br/><br/>Anyway all the 'small' adaptations have been made to the profit of the storyline and this is not the same universe than the paper one: this can be seen as a parallel universe where nothing will be the same again.<br/><br/>If you missed this movie, you did lose something interesting. Try again. You won't regret it.<br/><br/>X-Men is the best ever adaptation of a comics to the screen."

","After years of reading the X-Men, and hoping for a quality movie, my prayers have been answered.  Thank the Goddess that Dougray Scott was tied up on MI:2, because I don't think anyone else could have played Wolverine like Hugh Jackman.  If this role doesn't make him, nothing will.  The movie focused on the characters, instead of the action, and we got to know why they live in a world that hates and fears them.  Logan was our voice of disbelief, and echoed our questions.  The action sequences were well scripted, and fit in with the tone of the movie.  I think that all the actors did a great job with the material and getting to know their characters.  The only problems that I saw were Storm, and the music.  Storm is a much stronger person in the comic book, and was portrayed as timid in the movie.  Perhaps she will have time to grow into the character that we all love in the next movie.<br/><br/>Overall, this was a great movie, and the best of the ""superhero/comic book"" genre that have come out in recent years."

"myrtyle","Null","0","0","21 August 2000"," Trash. Good Trash
","Being a (moderate) fan of the X-men comics, back when the Beano was losing its appeal and superheroes in wild outfits with unexplainable powers were having more of an impact, I was waiting with (eager) anticipation for the new movie that had been such a huge success in the U.S. ( let's face it, the American cinema going public get excited about anything these days ). The prospect of a relatively unknown cast, no big names (other than maybe Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan) and a director responsible for one of the best crime thrillers of the 90s ( Bryan Singer, The Usual Suspects ) added to the excitement.<br/><br/>The summer was crying out for a big action, dumb, popcorn eating, Saturday night slice of tongue in cheek comic book nonsense. And that is exactly what it's got, except that is was a Thursday night preview, the popcorn ended up on the floor of the row behind us and we never got to eat any. With everyone instantly forgetting MI2 ( the other 'summer blockbuster', if that phrase isn't too much of a cliche ), the X-Men has taken centre stage. But despite the presence of RSC actors Stewart and McKellan, this is one stage that doesn't see much Shakespeare ( I knew that pun wouldn't work ). They do, however, put in a couple of remarkable performances mainly due to the circumstances in which they find themselves. It would normally be difficult to play the leader of a bunch of out of control, lightning summoning, metal claw wielding, lazer beam directing mutants with a straight face, but the thought of where they are and what they are doing never seems to cross their aged faces. Stewart plays the magnificent Professor X, wheelchair bound mentor of the good guys and McKellan heads up the bad guys as the metal influencing Magneto. Silly names aside, McKellan never looks or sounds out of place, even whilst levitating with powers of...well...levitation ( strange as he seemed to develop this ability out of nowhere somewhere in the middle of the movie ).<br/><br/>The other character of note is Wolverine ( or Logan, he never seems to make up his mind ), who is the key to the entire story. One thing Hollywood has learnt over the last few years: If the movie starts to get silly, have the most cynical character point out how silly things are and the audience instantly forget that they are watching a stupid movie. Job done. Or not... the movies biggest drawback is that the kitsch is played a little too straight. The characters are made to be very real and then pasted onto the page of the comic. Just as you learn to relate to them, you remember that you are watching mutants with super powers. I think, a background in the comics can be an advantage here. And also a major problem. You immediately know whom you are dealing with and the relationships that develop. You know the characters and what they can do. But accuracy is not too important. Only geeks are going to say things like... 'But he could never fly' and 'She didn't have blue hair' and nobody is going to care... The movie has been made for people who haven't even picked up an X-men comic. That's the advantage - not caring who these people are. The rest of the cast, with the exception of Toad ( played by the guy who was Darth Maul ) and maybe Rogue ( she gets more screen time than the others ), are just extras. Toad is brilliantly portrayed, unlike the woeful Storm, the wooden Cyclops and the annoying Sabretooth.<br/><br/>I would like to say that the plot is non-existent but it isn't. The good guys have to defeat the bad guys. The underlying story is based around the idea that mutants are bad and should be controlled, or locked up or destroyed. The political aspect is not as predominate as everyone has been saying. In fact you could quite easily forget about society altogether and just watch the light show. The movie starts with a seemingly blatant attempt to attribute the plight of the mutants to the horrors of the nazi concentration camps as we view scenes of Jews in war torn Poland. If this is the subtext, it is horribly misjudged and in poor taste given the feel and atmosphere of the rest of the story.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie lacks an incredible amount of flow and consistency. Professor X goes missing for most of the story. Wolverine has a great build up that just stops. Things happen just because they look good and it seems to make sense at the time. A better script with a few more words would have been nice and a Statue of Liberty that didn't look like it was made of plastic. What it also lacks is more suspense. The battles between the two sides are pretty weak and are just a few minutes of people beating the s**t out of each other. None of the characters show any grit or determination or concern. The movie oozes complacency.  Out of all the characters, only Rogue shows any kind of fear and vulnerability and that's just because she's a girl. A bit of empathy wouldn't have gone a miss.<br/><br/>Sorry Bryan, must do better next time. And there will be a next time. The movie is only an hour and half and way too short. But thats what happens when you try to cram 100 comics worth of stuff into a movie you want kids to sit through.  I actually thought the end battle scene was the middle of the story and that there was going to be a huge confrontation between Wolverine and Magneto. Instead, it just ends, somewhere in the middle after another light show. Expect (several) sequels.<br/><br/>5/10"

"UnCritic","8","0","0","20 August 2000"," Another Bryan Singer coup
","Singer is probably the best Hollywood director when it comes to films with lots of characters, as he proved with The Usual Suspects. Here again he weaves an exciting tapestry of character interaction, origin stories, plot points and allegories.<br/><br/>Viewers expecting to see a blockbuster action movie such as ""Terminator 2"" or ""Die Hard"" may be let down. The movie is more about character interaction and plot twists. Additionally, the budget for this film was something like 75 million (a fraction of what most big action movies cost these days), which was no doubt significantly doled out to the likes of Patrick Stewart and Ian McClellan. But it's a terrific film, the kind of movie that has the viewer remembering scenes and quotable lines long after seeing it.<br/><br/>I have talked to comic book fans and those who never read a comic book and everyone I polled (except many critics, go figure) thoroughly enjoyed the film.<br/><br/>The success of the movie should also be credited to Ian McClellan's masterful Magneto, and to a slightly lesser degree, Patrick Stewart's endearing Professor Xavier.<br/><br/>If you're like me, you'll wind up watching it 2 or 3 times."

","First of all, I must say that I am a female who is totally NOT into comics of any sort.  Therefore, when my husband talked me into going to see this movie, I was extremely skeptical.  I expected it to be another one of those movies where if you weren't on the ""inside"" and hadn't read the comic books (yes, I was dragged to see ""Spawn"" and I had no clue what was going on) that you would just be bored out of your mind for about 2 hours.<br/><br/>Boy was I surprised about X-Men.  I must say that this film was written very well.  You really needn't have ever read the comics to fully understand the plot of the movie.  Sure, there were a couple of inside jokes (eg.  the yellow spandex jumpsuit reference, which I had explained to me at a later time), however, I'm sure that those were for the purpose of entertaining the comic book fans and in no way did they detract from the plot.<br/><br/>I thought that the special effects were fabulous and that the characters were all very personable.  Also, in the character of Wolverine, just enough humor was added to make it enjoyable to watch.  Therefore, to all the females out there who are dreading the possibility of being dragged to this film - don't.  It really was pretty good!"

","Hello, OK so I saw it last night and here's a quick run down on what I thought of it.<br/><br/>I'm gonna address many of the points people have made in the many reviews I've read for this film one by one as to whether I agree or disagree with them.  OK, here goes:<br/><br/>Q  Is the film enjoyable? A  Yes, I found it very enjoyable, why?  Cos it was nicely directed, had a few funny jokes in it, it had the superbly hot Famke Janssen (or is it 2 Ns, one S) wearing nice night tops, Halle Berry's wonderful breasts (yup, subtlety there) and even little Anna Paquin has grown up to be a rather attractive large breasted young thing.  Top-notch birdage all round.  Oh and of course Mystique has a fantastic body, shame it was blue and scaly.<br/><br/>Q  Does it screw up all the X-Men timeline stuff? A  Oh yes, all the storylines the film is based on have been screwed to b****ry.  Examples include the fact that Cyclops and Iceman were supposed to be the same age and should have joined the academy at the same time, however Cyclops is a mid twenties member of the team whilst Iceman is an adolescent school boy in the classroom.  But hey, I didn't actually care much cos I've forgotten almost the entire plot from the comics and it was only Alex that reminded me of most of it.<br/><br/>Q  Are the FX nice? A  Oh yes, lovely stuff. Nice CGI, nice Wolverine claws, yeah, t'was good.<br/><br/>Q  Is the plot of the film too lightweight and does it think its being all serious and great when its actually not? A  Yup, the plot stank.  Overall premise was fine (after all that's the whole point of the X-Men) but it had a lot of holes in it.  And it all seemed a bit TOO much like the first film of three.  For example, The Matrix knew it was gonna be a trilogy but it answered pretty much most of what it asked.  However this film has dream sequences, underdeveloped characters and whatnot and its handled in blatantly obvious ""we're gonna build on this in the next one"" manner.  OK, so that fine but it was there for everything. Nothing was explained!<br/><br/>Q  How well is Wolverine used? A  I thought he was pretty well used.  He was nice and aggressive and didn't really do all that much really but what he did was nice, like the first time you see his claws and he pins this large bloke against a wall with two of them and slowly extends the middle one towards his neck whilst slicing the bartender's rifle in half with the other hand.  Wolverine has the best lines from the film (the best of which I would love to spoil for you but I'll let you hear it for yourself when we go see it :) ) on both the macho front and the humour front.  Oh and there is a beautiful piece of direction when he's swinging round a prong on the Statue of Liberty by his claws and the camera follows his claws round all four sides, spinning slowly until its completely cut off.  OK so I can't explain it but you'll like it when you see it Leigh :)<br/><br/>Q  Is Ray Park a gay stank ass? A  NO!  For the first time in cinema history we hear Ray Parks real voice! YAY!  It's just a normal London accent actually, but it suited Toad well enough.  Oh and I did like his character cos his fight scene was very nicely done and he even did a Darth Maul joke by grabbing a metal bar that was holding a lift open, spinning it in the exact same way he did with the light sabre and doing the arm to the side stance, lifted directly from Episode 1. Oh but instead of a snarl he does this really cheeky grin and it was really nicely done.  Could have been a really crap joke but he pulled it off well. He doesn't get to do much martial arts but being able to jump really, really high he does some lovely Blade-esque landings.  :)<br/><br/>But anyway, this as turned out to be a far too long review so I'll sum up now.  X-Men is a very lightweight movie, the plot sucks and the timeline it's based on goes completely out of the window.  But it is a very nicely directed film, the acting is mostly very good (and yes, Ian McKellen and Patrick Stuart do add the required gravitas to their roles, any scene with both of them in really did sparkle) and there were a few very funny little jokes in it (like Wolverine using the middle claw to flip off Cyclops). So in all, I thoroughly enjoyed it (Adam and Alex thought it sucked by the way) and will, hopefully, be seeing it again and yes, it shall be DVD'd.<br/><br/>Score:  7.5/10  (so I'll give it a 7 on imdb)<br/><br/>Oh yeah and it has this one really superb death scene in it where a bloke literally melts away to nothing, it was sweeeeet."

","Finally, we can say that a film has reached the level of the comic-book version. First was Superman, that in its first film started the comic adaptation pictures. The 4 sequels that followed it were poor and quite sad.<br/><br/>Then the Batman saga came. Tim Burton did a great effort to create the creepy & dark atmosphere of the flying hero. And the first and second part were ok, kinda interesting film. But the third and forth, created by Joel Schumacher were as bad as hell.<br/><br/>So the level was incredibly low, a perfect opportunity for Brian Singer to create a well-done, thrilling action with brilliant sfx production.<br/><br/>And X-MEN combines these three things: action, incredible visual effects and good plot, setting the film like the best comic-book adaptation I've ever seen.

I'm a big fan of the ol' Canucklehead, and Jackman enbodied him.

","Hollywood often goes for the easy option - make an action movie with tons of brilliant action sequences or sfx and forget about the plot or background story.  X-Men doesn't do this, instead it is a very intelligent, and well founded story packed with enough action to make you sit up and take notice.<br/><br/>The film's premise is acceptance and tolerance - and our attitudes to other things other than the ""norm"".  However it doesn't seem to question ""what is the norm, and whom defines the norm"".<br/><br/>A brutal example of this is where the film starts out in Poland 1944 - where we see Magneto as a child being ripped apart from his loving family and his family sent to the death camps, this was pretty dark and gritty - yet it didn't have that real kick to it that it needed.<br/><br/>It has Magento played by the maginficent Sir Ian McKellen - sigining McKellen as Magento was a master stroke - but alas his on-screen scenes with Stewart (as Professor Xavier) were far and few between, I wanted more of them.<br/><br/>The film, although a tad silly does have brilliant SFX, sometimes you hardly notice it - your not meant to, your meant to sit back and enjoy this film - and I did.<br/><br/>It was a shame that Ray Park's fighting skills were not on screen as they were in Phantom Menance - and its a shame we weren't told why Sabretooth hated Wolverine or why Magento didn't realise his brain was scanned when sexy Famke Jannsen was using that mind enhasing machine...<br/><br/>Apart from this the film is a good intelligent film - its a shame they were little holes in the plot or script, and its a shame that the end scene's on the Statue of Liberty were never the climax it was meant to be - its a good film, but its an action film, no more - no less."

","The X-men  is a movie that will please both Comic readers and contemporary audiences alike. At first i had my doubts like the millions of other fans worldwide, over things that have been discussed over and again [The dark costumes being the major player in this]. This, quite simply is probably down to the fact that most people not too fondly remember Batman and Robin [1997], and dont want to see a similar movie. Well, if you havent seen the X-men yet, i can tell you to rest assured this movie topples the entire Batman franchise tenfold. I went to see the movie at a special preview 17/8/00, and as soon as i entered the cinema i knew the movie was going to be a hit. We had previously been refused access to a different cinema because it had sold out on X-men tickets. We got the last two at this cinema and it was a huge relief. As i looked around i saw what i believed to be a non X-men audience. Normal people wanting a slice of something different, and i didn't see one disappointed sole. Everyone loved it. Cheered the heroes and booed the villains. At the end everyone stood up and applauded, and i felt proud. At last a Comic Book movie had delivered, at last i was satisfied. The whole thing looks slick and fantastic. Special Effects can sometimes swamp a movie, but these endeared it. The SFX were eye popping from the word Go, and the whole cinema was thrilled. In the three main characters in Professor X, Magneto and Wolverine, we are treated to spot on characterization and acting. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan were relishing there chances and done superbly. Hugh Jackman, well, after seeing him i couldn't imagine anyone else in the role. Surely a good candidate for the role of James Bond when Pierce Brosnan hand up his holsten? Jackman IS Wolverine. Everything from his caring for Rogue [excellently played by Anna Paquin] to his at odds nature with Cyclops, Marvel Girl and Storm [again a top notch cast] is how the comics make it fell. Bryan Singer gets it right with his direction. And the Music was wonderfull too. In Michael Kamen there is surely one of the most under-rated American composers. O.K. there isnt a theme tune but were is the need for one with all the special effects, good acting and marvellous action? Mr Kamen does well and deserves special praise. So go see this, you will LOVE it. Before this, i used to think wouldn't it have been great to have seen Star Wars when it first came out? It must have been special. Well now i know what it was like because i have seen X-men."

","After all the reviews and the hype I was expecting something fantastic from this movie.  Unfortunately it seems to be let down in several major respects.  I will confess now to knowing next to nothing about the X-men, so a lot of the things I would have liked purists will probably hate.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint is the way that the whole film seems to play like an introduction.  All the time we are expecting something climatic to happen, and it never does.  The film doesn't so much leave potential for a sequel, it leaves the plot completely unresolved.  Also, the subtext is a little too sub for my liking.<br/><br/>When we do finally get to a fight scene it looks so completely unnatural that it just doesn't carry the drama that it should, The action seems so broken that it is almost feels like frames in a comic book.  I would have said this was really clever, and a good thing (it is a comic adaptation, after all) if it weren't for the fact the it is so pronounced you are expecting 60's Batman style ""POW""s to appear when someone throws a punch.<br/><br/>My other gripe is about the characters.  Superheroes should radiate cool (see Burton's Batman, The Crow or The Matrix) but these just don't seem to. Possibly Wolverine was a bad choice for a lead, he seems that he should be a much darker character than he appears, and he talks to much.  Rogue was a big wet, but hopefully this will change in the sequel when she has got over the shock of being a mutant.  The only character who seems to have this innate coolness is Storm (probably something to do with those white eyes), but she is let down by Halle Berry's poor delivery of every line she speaks.<br/><br/>Overall, it's fun for ninety minutes, with good effects, good sets and at least a vague idea of saying something worthwhile.  It's just not what I had hoped."

He couldn't have done a better job. Right down to the scene when he walks through the metal detector <chortle>.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was sufficiently dark and stylish with some top special effects (but thankfully relying more on the characters to carry the story).

","This is a very good comic-book/ sci-fi/ adventure movie. It is also the first dead-on adaptation of a mainline Marvel superhero comic book series. (Blade and Punisher, etc, I do not consider in that genre). Some of the critics are opining that is is not up to the standard of the first 2 Superman and Batman movies, but they miss the point to comics fans. This movie is as different from those as Marvel Comics are to DC Comics (home of Superman and Batman).  Marvel comics, from the 60's on , were darker, denser, and more layered than DC's.   This movie catches that, as well as you can in an hour and a 1/2. There are more heroes to be introduced in this movie series, and I am looking forward to that.  This initial installment was fun, and well done. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine shouldered the weight of his character, which really carries the movie, despite the presence of bigger stars Stewart and McKellen. Gotta go get my Sir Ian - Magneto action figure!"

He even sneaked in a little ""bub"" while fighting Sabretooth. I think something more should have been made of their prior relationship - maybe have Sabretooth mention their days in the CIA together just prior to getting thrown off the statue. Still, I suspect that will be handled in the sequel, judging by the direction of the closing scenes.<br/><br/>Rogue was also well handled - some say she is too young, but I think her age makes her seem even more vulnerable; she is at the age where she needs someone to rely on and Logan fills that role admirably.<br/><br/>The plot - standard X-Men fare as far as the comic story goes, but for a first movie you can't overwhelm non-fans with established lore. Perhaps in the sequel we'll see a widening of the scale to include larger-than-life villains like Apocalypse or Sinister? Xavier and Magneto had great chemistry, their intimate scenes bookending the film, summing up the whole situation.<br/><br/>Overall, definitely worth your money, fan or not. Who knows, maybe this film will sway you? And if not, well it's still an entertaining romp with great costumes, good looking actors and sexy special effects."

","I wasn't expecting much out of another ""comic book"" movie. Afterall, Batman has become a tired cliche with me after the  first film. I was a passing fan of the X-Men comics with Wolverine as my favorite X-Man.<br/><br/>I must tell you that when leaving the theatre that night, I knew I had seen one of the best sci-fi/drama/action movies of 2000. How? My eyes were hurting from bulging out I was so intensely staring at the film! With the ""wonder from down under"", Hugh Jackman as Logan, I was visibly shaken and stirred by his powerful performance! Anna Paquin definitely accentuated this genius cast ensemble! It was wonderful to see how she has grown as an actress and as a beautiful young woman since The Piano. And the perfect touch...Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as the two mutant adversaries, they brought class to this film.<br/><br/>I am already anticipating the sequels...if any of the main characters from the original film fails to appear in the sequel(s), it will not be a worthwhile movie. I've seen the X-Men three times and will make it four very soon! I highly recommend this film to all ages and tastes. Blood factor is rather low, just be mindful of some scenes with Wolverine if you're squeamish or you have little ones in tow. I look forward with great interest in Hugh Jackman's career.

","I grew up reading the X-Men comics, watching the cartoons, and since the tender age of six I have waited for a big-screen adaptation.  When I heard the news that it was finally on its way, I was more than just a little excited.  The trailers were all great, and even despte the hardships on the set, I knew that this would be something special.  The movie was everything I hoped for and more.<br/><br/>For a start, the performances were stunning.  Hugh Jackman brings Wolverine to life like no one else could.  He has a real bezerker quality that you just wouldn't want to mess with.  Anna Paquin is excellent as frightened runaway Rogue, whose power means she can never have contact with another person without killing them.  Ian McKellan plays Magneto with such conviction that we almost sympathise with him, and his motives seem justified.  Patrick Stewart captures the look and manner of Charles Xavier so well that you barely noticed he isn't onscreen for as long as you would like.  The few confrontations he has with Magneto are tense and briliantly acted.  These are men with a history, with beliefs, and they are both out to show their views by whatever way they think is best.<br/><br/>The writing/storyline is excellent.  We are presented with a real world filled with these strange people, yet the underlying themes of racism and discrimination make them seem as real as they ever could.  The film never shoves these views down your throat, but lets you digest them in whatever manner you choose.<br/><br/>And then, of course, there's the action.  And when the claws go *snikt*, there's certainly lots to be had.  The fight sequences are brilliantly played, some of them brutal, others almost balletic.  The sequence that takes place on the crown of the Statue Of Liberty with Wolverine and Sabretooth is superb, and the finale will leave you screaming for more.<br/><br/>The film ends perfectly, with every character being where they should be in order for a great sequel.  Credit to everyone involved for making this one work and work superbly.  This is honestly the best movie I have seen, and I can't see another one coming to knock it off the top spot.

Fans seemed to have it pegged to be this year's ""Lost World"" or ""Phantom Menace"" (although I think the latter was a let down yet fun to watch). But truly, Bryan Singer and company did a bang-up job of not only capturing the essence of classic and beloved characters but also brought something new to the screen.  Not only did it dodge common comic book cheese, they also steered clear of terminal seriosity (yes, I know that's not a word).  Cut and cheek but never close to anything RESEMBLING Superman III.<br/><br/>The movie's only flaws lie in, actually, the plot.  Magneto's scheme to turn world leaders into mutants may play out better on film than on paper, it's still rather cheeesy.  The movie's primary flaw, however, is it's length. I wanted more!

","I enjoyed this movie even though my knowledge of the comic book version is very limited.  Usually comic books don't translate well to movies (due to incompetent directing and scriptwriting) but I have to give this one a thumbs up.  They did the right thing to introduce only a few mutants, because there are too many mutant characters in the X-Men comic.  To put them all in the movie would be silly.  With a few central characters, we can focus more on the storyline than mere mutant-plethora eye-candy.  Filmmaking is different from comics, after all.<br/><br/>The cast delivered satisfying performances.  Professor X is just spot on and looks like the actual comic character.  Wolverine is very convincing, and Magneto has presence.  The other characters are also played very well, like Jean Grey, and Rogue who is given a sensitive performance.  My only minor quibble is Storm. Halle Berry is very good-looking, but somehow her acting is wooden and is made obvious that she is just play acting.  It's no big deal though.<br/><br/>But the real goody comes at the end.  I just LOVE how open-ended the ending was!  It screams out that a sequel is in the making, which made me to look forward as how the story continues ... just like 'Back To The Future' trilogy.

","I'm not sure why only extremists ever post user comments. It seems that only people who REALLY, REALLY loved or REALLY, REALLY hated the movie ever post, when most movies fall in between.<br/><br/>For the record, I am a fan of the X-Men and use to collect the comics until Jim Lee left.<br/><br/>So what do I think about this movie? It wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be, but I think that I could've written and directed a much better one. I don't want to sound big headed, but I believe that if you're going to go through the trouble of adapting a comic book, you might as well take as much from it as you can. Otherwise, create your own heroes. Only somebody like Alfred Hitchcock could make an adaption that is not only strikingly different, but a masterpiece, and Singer ain't no Hitchcock. (Although I did like the Usual Suspects.)<br/><br/>This is a change of subject, but I think the world has yet to see a superhero comic book come to life. Superman (which was the closest of the superhero bunch), Batman and all the others tried to add too much realism and thus create an unbalance between comic book fantasy and reality. Why bother? They should just dive and take as much as they can from the comics. Take a look at Dark City, the Crow, and Dick Tracy. I would really like to see a movie that is as faithful as possible to the comic books.<br/><br/>Now as for the movie, I would've gotten rid of all those students, casted somebody else for Cyclops (he's too much of a twerp) got somebody for Colossus (who is one of the top 6 favourite X-Men among fans) and chosen brighter costumes. If you're not going to go with the original ones (which would be stupid) at least don't become a Matrix ripoff and have them all wear the same thing. As for the cast and crews saying things like, ""the costumes wouldn't translate well into real life?"" If you say things like that, you shouldn't be making movies.<br/><br/>I just hope the next one is better. (Or they hire me.)"

","Movies based on comics nowadays are few and far between, nevertheless it is rare to find a bad one.  X-Men keeps this tradition alive, it's a smart and funny film, which is sometimes hard to find in the action genre of movie.Action based movies tend to suck the plot out and fill where it should have been with action. But the action in X-Men added to the plot and made the story as a whole come together and in the end making the action all the more enjoyable. My only complaint SPOILER ALERT!!! SPOILER ALERT!!! is the ending, that old cliffhanger of an ending though it may not be considered a total cliffhanger in X-Men it is still (drumroll) a cliffhanger. I loved the movie, hated the end. A cliffhanger is fine but I like something, anything to end when the words ""the end"" shine in all their glory on the movie canvas. As you know they are probably making a sequel, but topping this one off would have gave a little more closure to the viewer.

","WARNING: SOME SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>I had a strange curiosity in watching ""X-Men"" because of the fine reviews it was receiving. But I had many doubts about it. 1) I have never, I mean NEVER read an ""X-Men"" comic book. I had already watched some episodes of the cartoon, but didn't understand a word of it. Maybe the words would sound to me like Chinese. But, man, I was wrong! 2) If you watched ""Judge Dredd"", ""Batman Forever"", ""Batman & Robin"", ""Superman 2, 3, 4..."" or 90% of comic books adaptations, you know what it means- crap, brainless, Razzie Awards... I was afraid that ""X-Men"" joined the list. But, man, I was wrong! 3) I do not appreciate summer blockbusters very much. There are exceptions of course (""Gladiator""), but the majority is pure crap. ""The Mummy"" is one of the worst films I've ever seen, and I had an unpleasant experience in the movies last week watching the infamous ""Gone in 60 Seconds"". ""X-Men"" could have joined the list very well and would be a perfect meal for the Razzie Awards. But, man, I WAS WRONG!<br/><br/>In fact, ""X-Men"" is one of the best blockbusters I've seen in a very long while. It's very far from a perfect movie, but it has everything you need for your perfect summer flick: thrilling action, terrific special effects, cool characters, good soundtrack, amazing scenery. And for my taste, an above the average character development.<br/><br/>This could have been just another action flick, or something worse. But the difference is a good screenplay (a rarity on the genre) and a decent director, who (thanks God) didn't know anything about the X-Men. The man is Bryan Singer, who had already directed two other films: the great ""The Usual Suspects"" and the mediocre ""Apt Pupil"". He teaches us everything (or almost that) we, outsiders, should know about the X-Men. The film starts in a Nazi field on the World War II, showing Magneto when he was a child, starting to use his powers and, maybe because of that, separated from the rest of the jews. Now, in the near future, there is a weird segregation in the society: the homo sapiens (us, of course) and the homo superiors. These are mutants who have to learn how to use their power, and they really suffer with that. They are divided in two groups: the ones led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart)- the X-Men, who wish that the society accepts them, and the ones led by Magneto (Ian McKellen), who want to start a war against the homo sapiens. These two characters were compared by Singer with Martin Luther King and Malcolm X. The X-Men are Dr. Jean Grey, Cyclops, Storm, among others. They are receiving two newcomers- Rogue, a girl who kills people who touch her, and Wolverine, a very strong man with bad mood and those metal knives inside his hands. Magneto's men are Sabertooth, Mystique and Toad, all of them really nasty. I understood well what all the characters represent, and I thought this was a great job by the screenwriter.<br/><br/>I got even what I didn't expect- some depth. Wolverine is the most well-developed character, but we will know more about him on the sequel. Magneto is a very interesting character, ambiguous and not just plain bad. I really liked the way the movie treated the good and the evil, but I still wanted to know a little more about the rivality between Magneto and Xavier, about Storm, Jean Grey and Cyclops. I think everything will be more explained in the sequel. This movie lets the door wide open for the sequel: what is the secret of Wolverine's past? What will happen now that Mystique has turned into the Senator? What will be Magneto's plans now? What will happen to Rogue? Let's wait for the sequel- and I hope they make a good sequel, as good as the original.<br/><br/>Overall, ""X-Men"" was a very pleasant surprise in many ways. It is a good choice if you are tired to see things as ""Gone in 60 Seconds"". And it destroys the myth that every comic book adaptation is awful. Along with the first ""Batman"", it is there the prove the opposite.<br/><br/>I thought they put $75 million dollars in the right place. ""Gone in 60 Seconds"" costed $90 million, ""The Patriot"" costed $110 million, but ""X-Men"" is much better. It's fun, stylish, smart, amazing. Not perfect, but very good.<br/><br/>8 out of 10 = EASILY RECOMMENDED"

Bryan Singer directed 2. Patrick Stewart was in it 3. There was absolutely NOTHING worthwile showing in theatres. Guess what? I liked it. I liked it a lot. As long as you accept the premises - superheroes, saving the day, yada yada yada - it's a great film. Not ""The Seventh Seal"", obviously, but possibly the best adventure I've seen since ""The Princess Bride"". (And Star Wars, but the good films are older than TPB.)<br/><br/>Granted, expectations aren't so high for this kind of film. We're lucky if they have a storyline. This one did. Also some fantastic characters, directing and. okay, special effects, but I'm a girlie, I'm not supposed to care. I loved how the mutations were both a gift and a curse - three of the heroes (Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops) get into situations were they risk killing someone they care for because they can't control their powers. The social aspect could have been used better, it was a little obvious at times (I for one have seen to many Nazis in popular movies), but again, just having one was great.<br/><br/>Main characters Wolverine and Rogue were well done and acted, you really came to care for them. Although, I must admit, I have had it with broody rebels with no past, I didn't mind so much when it came to Wolverine, because he was simply great. Also, he was funny. (""Sabretooth? Storm. What do they call you, Wheels?"") Rogue was endearing facing the fear she had for herself. Good/Bad leaders Xavier and Magneto were exactly as well done as one could expect when acted by a couple of long time pros like Stewart and McKellen. Also, I was taken in by Cyclops. (Those of you who question my motives can please think over your own motives for liking Mystique.) Sure, he was a total 90210 preppie, but he was *recognized* and dissed as a such in the film, causing some grins from yours truly, and there was more to the character than that. For one thing, if this had been 90210,<br/><br/>Cyclops would have been the popular hunky guy and Wolverine would have been the badass that mothers tell their daughters to stay away from. In this film, Wolverine can sit in a train full of people comforting Rogue, and nobody raises an eyebrow. Cyclops smiles at a kid and its mother hurries to take it away. Preppie is the *only* one of the heroes who can never pass for ""normal"". Sadly, they never develop his character much, and this cocky-but-insecure control freak disappears into the background. Same goes for the last two heroes Jean Grey and Storm - the latter is so underdeveloped I can't even tell whether she was well acted or not.<br/><br/>One thing that really bugged me, though: While the good guys are all cool and have fantastic abilities, Magneto is stuck with a pair of unbelievably lame animal people called Sabretooth and Toad. Sabretooth makes me long for good ol' ""Beauty and the Beast""-Vincent who was a philosopher between the ass-kicking. I doubt that Sabretooth is even housebroke. On the other hand, there's Mystique, the shapeshifter, and her powers are so interesting I'm willing to overlook that her real shape looks like a wet Playboy dream.<br/><br/>The other main flaw is that the film is not enough to satisfy, it leaves you hungry for more. Not only is the storyline set up for a sequel, but it hints lot of things characterwise (Wolverine's past for one thing) that it never shows. I don't mind seeing a sequel, but I don't want to be *forced* into seeing it. X-men is a little bit too much like the first book in a fantasy series where you have to read the rest. Only, all books in a series tend to be made by the same author. What if they replace the director and the next film turns out bad? That could happen. It's not like 15 more minutes would have spoiled the film. So, big :-( for that and the henchmen, big :-D for the rest of the film."

","Overall, I have to say that I'm waiting for the sequel.  This movie was just a set up for the Sequel and I think it'll make more sense for those of us that know nothing about the X-men.  I do recommend the film.<br/><br/>The special effects are alright.  They are trying to be over the top. It's like a comedian that's trying to be funny....you want to laugh, but you just can't give it to him.  That how it is with me and the special effects.  I want to praise them, but I can't.<br/><br/>Ray Park (Star Wars Episode I and Sleepy Hollow) has an actual speaking role in this.  It's interesting to see him not behind a mask.  It's too bad his career out of a mask is over.  We shall see in the years to come though."

","As a devoted fan of the comic book when I was younger, I expected this movie to be a real flop.  I expected my critical eye to be overworked spotting flaws and unnecessary deviations from character.  I've seen other comic book adaptations and they never translate well.  The best was the first Batman movie, and it could hardly be said to have been particularly true to the comic.<br/><br/>X-Men was MOSTLY true to the comic.  Obviously any movie is going to have time limits and as such cannot portray hundreds of issues of story in that time.  Given these limits, the essence of the characters and origins were all as sound as they could be.  In fact, a few of the changes made were improvements over the comic book.<br/><br/>The only thing I expected this movie to be good in was effects.  Given the high bar set by movies like the Matrix, I expected a strong effects and stunts show.  This was really the one place where X-Men was average.  Many of the stunts flopped, failing to capture the speed or essence of what they were trying to portray.  You could tell which stunts were done with wires, and which were cgi.  It was very transparent, which in this day and age is unacceptable.<br/><br/>There also were no particularly stunning camera angles during the stunts like Matrix had.  They tried once or twice, but none really came off as they should have.  It may seem unfair to compare ANY movie to the effects wizardry shown in Matrix, but this movie and subject matter was perfect to exploit such dazzling effects work, and it was very disappointing to see how poorly many were done.<br/><br/>By no means do I want to imply that the stunt work was BAD overall, nor that is substantially detracted from the overall strength of the movie.  It was primarily a minority of the action that had these problems.  This one is worth seeing.  I was merely disappointed by the missed opportunities to do something truly spectacular when the movie opted for simpler, less dazzling effects, and on the rare occasions when it reached for the stars, it was executed poorly."

","I absolutely LOVED this movie!!   It was wonderfully done and I was quite impressed.  Hugh Jackman is the only person who can play Logan/Wolverine!! James Marsden was excellent as Cyclops, and Patrick Stewart was amazing as well.  I liked how they did Iceman, especially when he made the ice rose for Rogue.  I also really liked how it began with Magneto's memories of the concentration camps. I could and would definitely see it serval times and I can't wait 'til it comes out on video.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin was no Rogue, she's talented, but not Rogue.   Rogue was done badly, but Rogue is a hard charcter to re-create.  Mystique wasn't done well either, she looked far too reptilian.  I also was displeased that Gambit, Beast and Angel/Archangel wasn't in it."
"fjhuerta-2","6","0","0","13 August 2000"," Uneven pace, but well made
","* Warning: 2 spoilers in this review *<br/><br/>Every summer the same thing happens: a new blockbuster film appears. Sometimes the result is astoundingly good (Batman, Matrix), sometimes it is so bad it's not worth even mentioning it (The Phantom Menace), and sometimes it's a mixed bag. X-Men is that mixed bag.<br/><br/>Good points: excellent photography, dark and murky in the mutant fighting scenes, light and airy in the ""human"" scenes. Nice special effects, although not in the same league by any measure as those in The Matrix. Also, Anna Paquin's character and acting are the best of the bunch.<br/><br/>Bad points: the special effects sometimes actually *detract* from the enjoyment of the film. As an example, Ray Park's fighting scenes are almost non-existant (definite bummer) because his character is always enhanced by SFX in some way or the other. At least in Phantom Menace his lightsaber duels were always visible on screen. In ""X-Men"", you get to see him leaping from wall to wall and hanging for dear life with his tongue, but not much more. Also there are some continuity issues throughout the film. For example, in the final sequence *SPOILER AHEAD*, Wolverine´s makeup is uneven, and it really shows. When in the scene with Rogue, he sometimes appears scratched, then healed, then scratched again. <br/><br/>But the worst problem with the film is its uneven pace. It starts slow, then tries to catch up only to slow again. *SPOILER AHEAD* When the climax was over, I was wondering whether this was it or if there was any other scene. It wasn´t a climax, really. The action sequences are too few and far between, and it is very difficult for someone who isn't a fan of the X-Men to be interested the whole film. It is simply not compelling enough (if you are not a fan). And this shows also in character development, where you never really get to know the principal characters or their motivations (Wolverine, Charles Xavier, Cyclops, Storm, Toad). Seems like the producers wanted to concentrate on the esthetics of the movie instead of deeper meaning, thinking that fans would already know the basics.<br/><br/>
I would have to say a far better example (although similar in many respects, such as photography) of a ""comic book"" movie is Tim Burton's Batman. This movie has very, very strong principal characters (Joker and Batman, whose life and tribulations are made known with subtle hints), amazing sets (Gotham City's nightmarish landscape beats New York any time) and a dense, complex plot. I am sure this last opinion will be debated, but only time will tell which is the greatest comic book movie. I can hardly wait."

","You don't even have to be a hard-core X-Men fan to enjoy this action packed, eye-popping sci-fi picture.  A cast of virtually unknowns, with the exception of Patrick Stewart, add to the overall luster to the whole film. Patrick Stewart (Prof. Xavier), is excellent in the role that he admittingly never heard of. Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), a former Bond beauty, is perfect in her role as a woman with telekinetic abilities.  Relatively new to the seen, Hugh Jackman explodes onto the screen as Wolverine, definitely the best of all X-Men. Ian McKellen is great as the misunderstood Magneto. Sure this movie is full of eye-candy, but there is a very well written story there.  The X-Men are a group of mutants that together try to put an end to the war between humans and mutants. Grab the kids, head to the theater, grab a big bucket of popcorn, extra large pepsi, and sit down and enjoy this great sci-fi/action movie."
"Shecky J. O'Pootertoot","9","0","0","10 August 2000"," One Hell of a ride
","Okay, the movie that I thought would be the biggest flop of the summer is actually pretty damn cool. I admit it, I was wrong. Mr. Singer, cast and crew, I apologize, I shall never doubt you again (except for that idiot Halle Berry, thank God she barely has any dialogue here). Actually, this movie is much better than it has any right to be. The potential for embarrassment was huge. We have a director who has never directed a commercial hit-special effects film before, a cast of mostly unknowns and a bunch of super heroes in leather suits with goofy powers. And lets not forget a final battle taking place on top of the Statue of Liberty. But I'll be a son of a gun if Singer didn't do it, and do it well.<br/><br/>After an opening sequence that is  as moving and dramatic as anything I've seen all year, I knew I was in for something special. I've been reading the book for about 15 years now, so I'm one of those types that the media was focusing on as the movie opened up around the world. Yes, it's all true, we are all pale friendless virgins who obsess over every little detail of the book (sadly, this IS true for many of the books readers. Comics just seem to bring out the anal-retentive types). So it's safe to say that I had some interest in how the movie would come out. Wolverine is my all time favourite character, and after seeing this, all I can say is that Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine! It was uncanny. I just sat there thinking, ""This guy is Wolverine! Could this be any cooler?"". Others may not have this reaction, mind you. If Jackman plays his cards right after this, he could become a major star in Hollywood. Keep an eye on this guy.<br/><br/>Something that really surprised me was how well the relationship between Xavier and Magnus was handled. The few scenes that they share are some of my favourites. McKellen and Stewart are the two thespians of the cast, so this should be no surprise, but they captured the unusual friendship they share very well. Magneto is and always will be the Malcolm X to Professor Xavier's Martin Luther King in the fight for peace between mutants and humans. They other villains have mostly non-speaking roles, but they do their jobs well. I hope Ray Park fans noticed the little homage he did to Darth Maul in one scene. Cute. The good guys get a little more screen time, the standouts being Jackman, Stewart and young Anna Paquin who is adorable as the cursed Rogue. She's a scene stealer in this one, and the relationship she has with Wolverine is very sweet (a part played by Kitty Pryde and then Jubilee in the comic). Famke Janssen provides sparks (and is easy on the eyes. Yum!), and James Marsden is pretty cool as Cyclops, a character who is usually hard to do anything with. I also thought the scene involving Xavier's journey via Cerebro to the psi-plane was very visually interesting. They took something that had always been rather obscure in the comics and made it look very simple yet fascinating on screen.<br/><br/>No real complaints here. The third act leaves a little something to be desired (I thought the end battle was maybe a little unspectacular), but otherwise this was great. The movie has the same problem that the book often faces, which is, ""how do we get rid of Xavier before the final battle?"", because when you think about it, when you have the most powerful psi on the planet on your side the rest of your team seems a little redundant. From the sounds of things this one will make one hell of a DVD, with a rumoured 45 minutes worth of cuts made before it was released to speed it up (some say at the character's expense). We are witnessing the birth of a franchise here. They could probably release an X-Men film once every two or three years like the Bond films. The story possibilities are endless, if they wanted they could just lift them from the comic. They have the Dark Phoenix Saga, The X-Cutioner's Song, Inferno, The Mutant Massacre, The Phalanx Covenant and so many more. If they want new villains, why not use Mojo, Mr. Sinister, Apocalypse, Onslaught, The Hellfire Club, The Shadow King, etc. Unlimited potential, really. I very much enjoyed this one, and it deserves a 9/10 stars for impressing me so much. G'night!"

","X-MEN should engender hope in the hearts of long-suffering comic book aficionados. Perhaps this film will raise the bar for this long-abused genre. Maybe the key is to have the screenplay written by a fan of the original comics, as was done here. Whatever the reason, X-MEN is a winner. This is a character-driven story that never sags, but just marches through from opening scene to the credits, skillfully incorporating just the right amount of action, dialogue, and scenery. There are plenty of great special effects shots, but they never overwhelm the characters. The quality of the fight scenes is also excellent, and they also don't overwhelm the story (in contrast to just about any action-adventure movie in recent memory).<br/><br/>Special accolades go to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine; perhaps this is a breakthrough role for him. This is not to detract from the other actors, all of whom handled their roles perfectly. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, having to work through tons of makeup as Mystique, still projects humor and personality into her character. I wish we had seen more of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, but unanswered questions in the story, combined with what appears to be enthusiastic viewer response, assures us of a sequel featuring both of these journeyman actors.<br/><br/>Rating **** (Scale * to ****)"

","With X-Men 3 about to be released in less than a month, I had to bust out my X-Men DVD and give it another watch. What a great movie! Even now I'm blown away with how well the movie was made, it's truly fantastic and there's almost nothing I would change in the film. From the opening scene at the concentration camp you know this is going to be a well done movie! The characters are absolutely fantastic and handled so perfectly. The relationships and chemistry are all very well written and truly felt by the audience. There are so many scenes that make me grin like an idiot because it's so well done. Particularly the first scene with Professor Xavier and Erik Lensherr (Magneto) discussing philosophies. Then there's the scenes with Marie (Rogue) and Logan (Wolverine), Logan (Wolverine), Scott (Cyclops) and just about all the others for that matter.<br/><br/>The story is nothing short of brilliant. Basically, humans are being born that are different than the ""normal"" human and the normal humans are naturally fearful of these mutants. So...there are two camps of mutants, those who want to work to live in peace with humans (The X-men) and those that feel they are superior to humans and will eventually dominate the earth (The Brotherhood of Mutants). And thus the premise is set and story flows from there.<br/><br/>Of course, you have to mention the special effects in a film of this nature. I can safely say that the special effects are perfect in this film, there isn't a single scene that is badly done, most of the special effects are rather subtle and rarely in your face and never over-done. This is truly what a sci-fi movie should be; special-effects that serve a story, not the other way around.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this film by now, I really don't know what you're waiting for. This is truly one of my favorite films of all time and definitely deserves a view (or two, or three). I strongly urge you to give this film a chance.<br/><br/>Can't wait for X-Men: The Last Stand, I hope it's good."

In that respect, I wasn't disappointed. I also like the interplay between the characters.<br/><br/>However, one things left me feeling not quite right about it.  If I recall correctly, Cyclops and Jean Gray were two of the original X-Men, appearing in issue 1.  Another original was Iceman.  He and Cyclops should be basically the same age, and if they are young, the school should be empty except for them and a couple of others.  Yet we've got a child Iceman, a young-ish Cyclops, and a very well-established school.  Call me nitpicky, but I *hate* it when movies muck around with established timelines.  That definitely detracted from my experience."

They are generally feared and thus hated by the ""normal"" people of the earth.

I was also sad to learn that Gambit, my personal favorite, wasn't in the movie.  Oh well, maybe he'll show up in the sequel.

Of course, it has always been a battle against discrimination for Mutants in the comics and cartoons, which parallels many aspects of our own society.<br/><br/>IF you are a fan of Wolverine, you'll really like this. He gets more camera time than most of the others. Hugh Jackman does a great job with this character.<br/><br/>All the characters are great, save maybe Cyclops.

It doesn't have the power behind it that I would have expected (thank the cartoons for that.)<br/><br/>I really liked Rogue. Anna Paquin was a great choice. She had a great southern accent.

","I was very impressed with the opening scene. Bryan Singer seems to have a very good understanding of what Nazism/Totalitarianism is all about: enforced equality. <br/><br/>The movie is excellent, truly: I expected either a bunch of special effects aimed at people who prefer ""Reader's Digest"" (>90% of summer movies, take a pick) or something self-absorbed to the extent of anesthesia (Star Trek comes to mind). What I got was high-grade directing, tolerable script and very good acting (Jackson and McKellen). <br/><br/>Here's the big question of the day: (this is not a spoiler, but if you'd rather not know anything at all about the movie, skip the following three paragraphs). <br/><br/>Why does the X sign on the Xmen uniform look so suspiciously like the swastika? <br/><br/>Why does Professor X wear a small golden encircled X as a necktie pin -- again, it looks exactly like the golden swastika that Hitler (and highest-ranked) Nazi party members wore on their neckties.<br/><br/>
I mean, Singer, who filmed Apt Pupil (a movie about an SS officer) could not ""miss/overlook"" these strange similarities. Could it be that the school of Xavier is not ""good to the last drop""? ...As I was leaving the movie theatre, I overheard a woman (about 35) talking to her husband (older, tired) and her two kids (about 7 and 10): ""I liked it -- but, you know, I wanted more"". <br/><br/>I agree: the film is about 10 minutes too short. The ending also was tepid. I'd rather see Magneto looking at Prof X and saying something like ""You don't know what he (Wolverine) is about to find.

","""That didn't suck!"" These were the first words I heard from an X-Man Comic fan after leaving the cinema. Considering the standard level of satisfaction with comic book to big screen conversions, I think this is a shining review. As someone who knew almost nothing about the X-Men Comics, I think the movie was great. It will well presented, well paced and well written. The characters were understandable, as was the situation they were in, and they were portrayed in a way that contributed to the story rather than detracting from it. The special effects were excellent, which is normal these days. Though some of the subtle effect, such as those when Magneto used his power, were excecuted so well that I was impressed even though excellent effects have become the norm. All of the acting was appropriate, though I have to admit no performace shone in my eyes. The biggest problem with the movie was it's length. At only 92 minutes of movie, I thought it was a bit short. The figures are made up for by the end credits running over 10 minutes, but I consider that to be a cheat.

","With any movie coming from a source this ingrained in its fans, there's always the danger that the result will be totally incomprehensible to the public at large.  Miraculously, 'X-Men' almost completely avoids this pitfall, with the few forgivable (almost mandatory) exceptions of minor in-jokes that don't distract in any way.  I have only a surface familiarity with the background comic, gleaned mostly from hearing other people talk, and had no trouble understanding and genuinely getting into the film right from the start.<br/><br/>I really liked this movie.  It's got great characters, main and supporting, a great setup, a great general introduction to the concepts, a nice balance of special effects, a respectable plot that effectively sets up the main characters' relationships, and hints at what the next step in the story's development will be-- and then it just stops.  Great, I can't wait for next week's thrilling second installment!  Except in this case it'll be a year-plus before a sequel's out.<br/><br/>I had a few minor quibbles with this film, especially over the way the straightforward plot seems to have been severely edited for time, but the only real problem was that the film seems to lack a real effective climax and conclusion.  It honestly feels more like a terrific TV pilot episode than a stand-alone movie, and I have the suspicion it would have benefited impressively from the extra running time it might have gained on television. Luckily the rest of the movie is well enough done-- especially in the way it manages to independently develop characters with decades of history behind them in a ridiculously short amount of time-- so that I'm willing to wait to see where the story's going next.  With a setup this engaging it'll be a crying shame if the follow-up doesn't prove to be twice as good-- and that ought to be really impressive to see."

Even incarnations of Batman, whether it is a live-action movie (like the first one) or a cartoon movie (Batman: Mask of the Phantasm) are better than this attempt at X-Men.<br/><br/>There was so much promise, but it fell short of immortality... even for a mutant."

The mutants and their powers were so unbelievable that my suspension of disbelief was broken almost instantly. Batman and Superman work as movies, at least somewhat, but when a live actor can control the weather or shoot lasers out of his eyes, it just becomes too hard to believe. Now I was  never a fan of comic books, but I was a big fan of the television cartoon series that was around several years ago. I loved that show, and besides Batman: The Animated Series, there wasn't a better cartoon series around. Super powers, when used by real human actors, seem incredibly fake. Used by cartoon characters on the other hand, and they seem more believeable. Also, as a television series, the cartoon allowed characters to develop.

While it was the most purely enjoyable summer theatrical release I have seen in years, I wish I wish I WISH it had just delved a little more into the world in which it was set!  I'm not asking for a brooding diatripe on the injustices of society, but more mention of said injustices would have made these characters into characters, the likes of which I might have been a lot more interested in.  My favorite line in the movie was Mystique's only line as Mystique: ""It's people like you who made me afraid to go to school."" Suddenly, we were not looking at a soulless villain headed towards a rightfully deserved death, but a real character who had had a rotten childhood and was taking it out on others in a confused attempt to get even. From that point on, I found myself overlooking the obvious heinousness of her crimes, and actually gladdened that she survived and went about righting the Senator's wrongs in his guise.  It just takes one extra minute on screen to turn a the flattest character into someone you'd like to know...  oh, and I didn't appreciate the way that the entire background to the film was explained in a five minute monologue, rather than slowly revealed throughout the film's course, and how such trifling details as Xavier's possession of a Blackbird, underground research facility, and ""psychic-atrium"" or whatever the hell that was were left completely unexplained.

I was particularly impressed with the way that the excellent special effects were used to advance the plot and the characters and did not completely take over the film's humanity.  There was great adventure, good character development and the film even dealt with issues in a way that was stimulating to the intellect (okay, it's not Shakespeare, but for an action/adventure/sci-fi it was much better than most).  You would have to be trying to dislike the movie not to find something to enjoy.  A special note on actor Hugh Jackman.  For an Australian I was a bit worried that he was given the part of Wolverine.  I had previously known Hugh Jackman as a guy who sang the national anthem at football grand finals, so I wasn't sure that he would be able to do justice to a disturbed character like Wolverine.

","It was no doubt daunting to the makers of ""X-Men"" that there were hundreds of thousands of X-MEN fanatics who were as likely to vilify it's latest incarnation as embrace it. Fans of the comic book need not have worried; this flick will not disappoint. But those countless millions who don't know an X-man from a Y-chromosome may feel otherwise. For all its earnestness and technical competence, ""X-Men"" is a classic case of cinematic 'deja vu'. Whatever vivacity Tim Burton was able to inject into 1989's wildly popular ""Batman"" has long since dissipated--witness the disappointing reception to its last sequel and the recently cancelled resurrection of the ""Superman"" franchise. ""X-Men"" does little, if anything, to raise the bar for the genre--it's little more than a 'good mutants versus bad mutants' tale with a little quasi-racism thrown in for flavor. Plus, too little is made of the oppression suffered by mutants in a mortal's world, just as too little is made of the too-few characters in this plotline. Yet even after apparently distilling the ""X-Men"" pantheon of mutants into a handful of characters for the movie version, scant use is made of the many serviceable actors hired. It's seems ironic to see so much one-dimensionality in a movie based on a minimally two-dimensional source. But the in-bred success of ""X-Men"" will no doubt beg a sequel, not to mention inspiring even more comic-borne adaptations. Come to think of it, ""Spider-Man"" starts production this Fall."

However, I did see some of the animated series (a good one, too), and gained some knowledge of the characters involved.  Then I learned of the X-Men movie from a trailer while waiting for ""Mission:  Impossible 2"", and noticed that Patrick Stewart was in the movie, so I decided to check it out, partly to see how good he was (my boss really likes him.)<br/><br/>Well, not only was he great, but the movie was great too, even for those who have limited knowledge of the movie!<br/><br/>In the not-too-distant future, people are developing unusual powers, and as a result are feared by normal people, especially Sen. Robert Kelly.  He wants to create a mutant registration program, and both Professor Xavier (Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan) don't like it.  But while Xavier still holds out hope for the humans, Magneto, thanks to a horrific experience as a Holocaust survivor, does not.  He wants to force humans to accept mutants -- by turning humans into mutants!<br/><br/>Magneto has created a machine that can do so, but it weakens him severely, so he needs Marie/Rogue (Anna Paquin), a mutant who has the unfortunate gift of absorbing the lifeforce and memories of anyone she touches (and in the case of other mutants, their powers as well), meaning she could kill a person.  When Magneto kidnaps her, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), who has befriended her, goes to her aid, as do the X-Men -- Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halley Berry), and Jean Grey (Famke Janessen).<br/><br/>I loved the movie!  It had neat characters -- to me, the worst was Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), and he was still okay, -- fine action, and a good message about the evil effects of prejudice and intolerance to boot.  Plus, it had two relationships that were handled well.  The first was between Professor Xavier and Magneto, and Stewart and McKellan handled that friendship very well.  They may be on opposing sides, but their friendship prevents them from killing each other, which helps Magneto's characterization especially.  McKellan plays Magneto as someone with good reasons for what he does, but sadly misguided.<br/><br/>The second relationship is the paternal one (or is it a big brother/little sister one?) between Wolverine and Rogue, and it works wonderfully.  The relationship helps Rogue feel safe and accepted, while it humanizes Wolverine.  I especially love the scene where he willingly gives Rogue his healing power to save her.  It is my favorite scene, because it is proof of what good relationships can do to people.  Kudos to Jackman and Paquin for their portrayals of Wolverine and Rogue!<br/><br/>In short, all fans of the series must see ""X-Men""!

","It's a growing genre, super hero movies. And this one is by far the best I have seen. Complete with the graphic novel feeling and scenery and with a wonderfully relieving sense of humor, X-Men reaches far beyond the fans of the comic - I have never read one single panel of the X-Men comic.<br/><br/>Comedy is essential when making movies of this kind. Without it, there would only be a dumb plot with geeky super hero personalities (""Mystique"" smells nerdy male fantasies a long way), but by taking itself not too seriously, this film is irrestistible. I was so amazed by the interaction between the good guys (""What do they call you? Wheels?""), the smart humor (giving the finger in an entirely new way) and the not-too-violent action makes up very well for the, to put it mildly, oddball science and the somewhat brainless plot.<br/><br/>Also, it's refreshing to see a sci-fi flick that has almost no ""gadgets"" in it. Apart from the aircraft (if that qualifies as ""gadget"") and Cyclops' weird glasses, it's all man versus man (or whatever).<br/><br/>Another clever touch is showing how Magneto once was sent to a concentration camp during WW2 - symbolizing the future fate that he and his mutant brothers and sisters are about to suffer: the mutants become modern day jews, and the ordinary humans become their Third Reich torturers. It also explains the strong hatred that he feels towards the human race - he is being reminded of his traumatic childhood.<br/><br/>Wow...I never thought I would be able to analyze a super hero movie in that way...<br/><br/>The bottom line is: go see it, even if you haven't read the comic and, like I did, had very low expectations.

","...or homoerotic, for that matter.  Finally, a director has decided to not only make a movie based on a comic book, but also has decided to take it seriously.  Many past directors have always seemed almost embarrassed of the fact that their main character is a man that dresses like a bat or a pretty boy in blue and red spandex.  The people and stories are then treated as these campy jokes.  It's insulting to anyone who reads the comic, and to people who expect a high-flying action flick and get cheesey one liners. Brian Singer is the first director that doesn't seem embarrassed by his subject, and it helps.  I am not a ""fanboy"" or at least I wasn't before the film, so I had no reason to feel betrayed by the little differences.  But even the most hard core comic fans have to admit that no one was shamed in this movie.  All the characters were treated with respect.  Some were under-used, but that is not the same thing.  There were no groaners as far as the dialog goes (with the possible exception of Storm's ""do you know what happens to toads that get struck by lighting?"" line.  what was that?), and the villains didn't dance around screaming ""I'm so eeeeeeevil"" a la Batman. I think the comic fans should rejoice! Plus, not for nothing, but don't you think it is a bit daunting to include 30 or so years of backstory into one movie without tweaking information or consolidating characters?  I think they did a fine job.  Just thought I'd give my two cents on a great little movie, simply cause I can.  God bless the internet."

","Bryan Singer knows what he is doing and what he is doing is creating an excellent franchise. This film leaves you wanting more and more and is just amazing. Hugh Jackman may have only been big ""down under"" before this but now he is king of the world. His portrayal of Wolverine was perfect and he showed he is a fine actor and a bad man. Mardsen did a fine job and really gave Cyclops that preppy leader with the hot babe I always envisioned. Famke is hot and a great actress who created a hotter than imagined Jean Grey. Patrick Stewart was excellent and proved he was Prof X. I had my doubts about Mr. McKellan but he proved me wrong and I'm glad. Halle struggled as Storm but could easily tweak her role for the sequel. No one did a bad job except the score composer.

","I absolutely loved X-Men. I seriously think it was more entertaining than all the Batman and Superman movies put together. I am only an occasional reader of the comic book, but from my viewpoint the movie was as faithful to the comic as it needed to be, or could be expected to be in order to appeal to a wide audience.<br/><br/>The casting was absolutely terrific from top to bottom. The action scenes and special effects were spectacular. The dialogue was witty yet appropriately restrained, unlike the endless barbs that go back and forth during every fight in a Batman movie. The plot was interesting, involving, and directly related to the core X-Men theme.<br/><br/>Can't wait to own it on DVD and to see the sequel!"

","Being a comic-book fan, I have never been caught in the ""trappings"" of the X-Men fanaticism, but have been left to enjoy a story of theirs on occasion, putting me in a position of being a less critical judge of the movie and it's character rendition than many others. In a nut-shell, everyone did a fine job portraying their designated characters, the specials were very good (but when aren't they?), the action was quality stuff, etc. So what's my beef? Rogue dragged the movie down. Did Anna Paquin have a special deal with Fox or something? I enjoyed the synergy between Rogue and Logan in the beginning but it wore thin a little too quickly. W/O giving away the story, I just want to finish by saying that there must have been some other feasible way for Magneto to make his point or seek his revenge than beating an otherwise tired character to death."

"keihan","Null","0","0","1 August 2000"," The next step in the evolution of the action film
","""If you want a picture of the future, imagine a boot stomping on a human face--forever.""--George Orwell<br/><br/>I think the above quote suggests that the esteemed Mr. Orwell may very well have been able to appreciate ""X-Men"". Human bigotry, after all, is as old as human existence. Though the trappings seem to border on the preposterous, can one really say that the film's premise is as outrageous as at first glance?<br/><br/>I'll be frank. I wasn't expecting anything from this film. Though I am a long-time comic collector, I've learned to hate all things X-Men as time rolls on. There were so many times and so many moments were the film seemed to be on the edge of going down the toilet. Heh...guess I should have had more faith. What I've seen this night is the next step in the action-film revolution begun by ""The Matrix"".<br/><br/>Though the X-Men were created in America, the storyline, science fiction elements, characterizations, and outrageous action actually have their roots in both Japanese anime and the German Expressionist film movement of the 1910's and 1920's. These two seperate schools began to merge in the live action arena with the underacknowledged gem ""Dark City"". The neophyte movement finally began to hit overdrive with ""The Matrix"" and, with ""X-Men"", has finally begun to hit it's stride. I'm not sure what one could call this movement in film (Roger Ebert's term of ""visionary filmmaking"" is way too vague to be considered definitive), but hopefully, it will define the action genre for the 21st century.<br/><br/>Granted, none of this would mean a thing if the acting or writing weren't top-notch. David Hayter's script is notable for it's lack of verbosity. Taking a cue from the German Expressionist movement, most of the drama is conveyed in images (the shattered gates in Poland, the ominous floating guns during the train station stand-off, Logan holding Maria tight in the hopes of keeping her alive). The dialogue can only be described as adequate. One is not likely to find that many memorable one-liners, but it never becomes so terrible that one winces as he occasionally had to during some of the clunkier lines of ""Star Wars Episode One"". That said, there are at least a couple of good jokes in the script and Logan sticking out his center claw after setting off (and ""turning off"") the metal detector is probably the best visual joke. While the plot sets things up for a potential sequel by leaving more than a few loose ends, it doesn't feel forced. Real life is a very messy proposition, after all, and not every square peg is going to fit in the round holes.<br/><br/>There's nothing wrong in the acting department by a large margin. Patrick Stewart's Charles Xavier is every bit as commanding as his Capt. Picard ever was. It's a credit to the man's presense that his impression on screen remains formidable even if he is bound in a wheelchair. Sir Ian McKellen offers a believably chilling Magneto, a man burning with old hatreds and the need to do something about them. But the central figure of this saga is undoubtably Hugh Jackman's Wolverine/Logan. He plays the role like a hunted animal, barely civilised and totally reliant on his instincts. Close to him in this center is Anna Paguin's Rogue, a frightened young girl with a power she can't control or understand. Her purpose is to reaffirm the humanity in Logan that he hasn't realized he's been missing. The others make less of an impression, mainly because they're restricted to the use of their powers and their interactions with Logan. Still, James Marsden's Cyclops makes a nice verbal sparring partner for Logan and Famke Janssen's Dr. Jean Grey sets the stage for a potential romantic triangle down the line.<br/><br/>I never thought that I would say this, but I now do hope for a sequel to this film...only, of course, if they can follow up with the same high level of quality displayed here. I X-pect no less."
"Bree-7","Null","0","0","1 August 2000"," If you're a fan of the Comic.. the movie bit.. otherwise..
","As a life long fan of the comic book series, I found this movie to be completely lacking in character development, totally opposing the lives set up for the characters for the past thirty years, and completely against everything I grew up knowing about these people.  The character of Rogue was utterly destroyed.  She was turned into a whiney, snivelling, scared little teenager that turned my stomach.  She was weak and useless and bore absolutely no resemblance to the character that I have spent the last fifteen years in awe of.  The character of Scott Summers was a total pretty boy.  He was a buffalo with his visor, and was nothing but annoying.  I never particularly appreciated Cyclops in the book, but if the character were to have been like Marsden's Summers, well, I'm glad he's dead.  Jean and Storm were completely useless.  They did absolutely nothing the entire movie through.  Storm was no longer clausterphobic which was a severe part of the character's personality.  And beyond which, Halle Berry continually dropped her accent, and Storm would NEVER cower in fear from any opposition, much less Sabertooth and Toad.  Magneto was a frail old man, and not much of an opposing force.  Xavier was Captain Picard in a wheel chair, and had no business messing with Wolverine's head.  The real Charles Xavier would never terrify a man like that when he's so new to the school.  The only redeeming force in this movie is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  He found the essence of that character and brought him to life.  Kudos to Jackman, the rest of the movie bit.  Some of the children in this movie acted better than the famous so called professionals they had in the parts of these characters.  Halle Berry should have been dropped off that part faster than Wolvie's claws go ""SNICKT!"".  I can only hope the next movie will be an improvement, because I was totally underwhelmed by this part."

","I thought I would be disappointed in Anna Paquin as Rogue (Rogue being my favorite X-Man) but I am happy to report she did a smashing job of it.  I was also happily surprised by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. He sizzles on the screen both in ferocity and sex appeal (am I right ladies?)!!! All of the cast seamlessly brought their characters to life but Wolverine has become my favorite movie X-man.<br/><br/>The special effects are well done and the costumes are wonderful.  The choice of all black uniforms rather than the colorful and varied ones of the comics / cartoon is the only real departure from the X-Men we grew up with and does not hurt the image of the X-Men at all (there is a reference to Wolverine's cartoon uniform in one scene where he questions their choice of uniform).<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you are a die hard fan or meeting the X-Men for the first time, you will be hooked.  A must see for fans and first timers alike."
"NolanSorrento","6","0","0","1 August 2000"," It's a fun movie, but ends up being to plot driven (spoilers)
","Let me start off that yes I understand that nothing can be directly translated from one medium into another without making a few tweaks here and there (Leather and Vinyl does look better than spandex on the big screen). I also believe that comics get  no respect in the film industry compared to an actual book, I don't really understand this, when a books translated, people always complain that they left so much out, and then proceed to tell everyone that the movies a horrible adaption, but when it's  a comic, any changes seem to be overlooked, why?  Comics will have more stories than any series of books could hopefully wish for, the X-Men have been around since the 60's but nobody seems to mind all the weird things that happen in the movie.  Okay, now onto the reasons and the SPOILERS, so stop here if you haven't seen it yet.<br/><br/>The whole movie seemed to center around Wolverine, if they where going to go this route, they should have made a movie called Wolverine and then make sequals called the X-Men.  Thru out the whole movie you get to see Rogue's powers and the fact that people go into a coma like state when she uses it, so why is it that Magneto is still up and going in the last battle when Rogue has just ""zapped"" him?  Magneto even states to Sabertooth that he will be in a weekend state and needs his protection.  Storm is really underplayed in the movie, she's truly is my favorite character in the comics, do you remember the scene where Sabertooth grabs her by the neck, why didn't she shock him? Why was he able to knock her around until they got outside? Mystique has the ability to imitate anybody's appearance but not their powers, yet in the movie she has Wolvie's claws and appears to be just as dangerous with them!  The writers and directors saw it fit to make the big screen Jean Grey from two characters in the comic, Moria Mctarget and Jean Grey.  There's a character name Bobby Drake (the one who gives Rogue the iceflower) who was one of the  original X-men, so that would actually put him closer to Cyclops and Jean Grey's age.  I really found all this really fustrating, if you can't relate, think about how Jurassic Park was for all you people who really enjoyed the book, and think about how the movie and the book really differed, and you'll understand my fustration.<br/><br/>
Okay, now I'm sure all of you are reading this and saying I'm being to picky, but the point of this all is, is that the movie became really plot driven, in a way that they decided to change the way the characters function during the climax just to help the story along i.e. Storm vs. Sabertooth and how Rogue's power did not effect Magneto, this is usually considered really bad story telling but for some reason people don't seem to mind in this movie, I guess special effects are really what matters now from what this movie is scoring."

","I have been an X-Men fan since I was probably five until I was ten. I always wanted them to make a movie because I wanted to see real people act out their parts. When I heard about X-Men becoming a film, I got real excited. (I have started to write screenplays, and if someone else didn't do it, I would have.)<br/><br/>X-Men centres around Hugh Jackman's performance as Wolverine. I saw him on a talk show, and I wouldn't have known such a calm person could play the part so well. X-Men's highest quality is its cast and performances. Good acting good movie! Anna Pacquin (Rogue), Ian McKellan (Magneto), Scott Marsden (Cyclops), Halle Berry (Storm), and my personal fav Ray Park (Toad) give great performances.<br/><br/>I think that the special effects and the story line could have been done better - way better. It was great that they incorporated a lot of the X-Men, but not as stars. The director gets two thumbs up. X-Men is well-done!"

","I just saw X-MEN last night and it totally blasted the hell out of me. Ray Park was among the audience, what a nice fella, he's a very kind and funny person. Well, as you have already read from all the postings here, the movie relies more on the feelings that this group of mutant misfits have to deal with, than with any other aspect of the comic series. I recall someone stating that you can't believe that such beautiful people could be mistaken for freaks. Enter Rogue. Anna Paquin is a beautiful woman. Her image hasn't been exploited the same way as Janssen's, Berry's or Stamos', but you can't help fallin' in love with her. She's so desperate and confused. Her sadness really beats Wolverine's seek for a past. Hugh Jackman is indeed a great actor, and he portrayed Wolvie in a pretty cool way, with the attitude and the looks. But believe me, you will feel Paquin's performance more than any other. Specially in the dream sequence - you'll know when you see it - Man I almost cried during that one.  Ok, back to Earth. X-Men is a great movie, you should go and see it."

","This was a particulary stunning summer action movie in a summer mostly filled with silly comedies and pointless dramas.  It will certainly have more effect than any other movie this summer, as it is far and away the best sequel opportunity.  It practically begs for one.  And I honestly hope they do make one, several even, if they're going to be like this.<br/><br/>But no film is perfect, and this one's flaw is rather large: The character of Marie/Rogue is constantly being used. Not as a character, but as a plot device.  Rogue is a very powerful mutant, and was, before this movie, a very powerful woman.  By having a child play her as a victim and something of a weakling at every turn made for a huge drawback.  The result was that she, despite being a main, perhaps -the- main character, came off as unrealistic, while all the other actors were excelling."

","I enjoyed the movie quite a bit, and felt it worked on its own terms as a special-effects laden summer action movie, but it could have been so much more.  The producers clearly didn't have much faith in its audience, keeping the film to 95 minutes and sacrificing story and character development in favor of action and visual effects, and doing everything short of flashing ""Coming Soon: X-Men 2"" in purple neon at the film's conclusion.  The critics seem to think it is too overcrowded, but i actually felt there should have been more characters.  It felt odd watching a team of essentially four X-Men (this isn't the Fantastic Four!)  I hope they bring more in for the sequel. I'd especially like to see Gambit and Nightcrawler, or maybe more of Kitty Pryde and Iceman, who only make brief appearances in this film.  Hopefully there will be more character development.  If they just slow it down and actually tell a story, they could have something really great and meaningful on their hands.  In other words, a real film, as opposed to a popcorn flick. The romance between Cyclops and Jean could obviously be expanded.  They don't even so much as kiss in this movie!  They seem oddly ill-suited, for she is obviously several years older than him.  Still, i was pleasantly surprised with the casting choices, with all the actors surpassing my expectations.  On the other hand, their performances make it all the more plain that they need a stronger script, one with more emotional and intellectual power.  They can clearly handle it as actors, even Halle Berry, who is gorgeous but only occasionally gives good performances.  She is just right as Storm, and Anna Paquin is terrific as Rogue.  All i can say is, they got a good director in Bryan Singer, so please, PLEASE, get a top-notch writer to equal him for the sequel."

"jazaragoza","9","0","0","29 July 2000"," X-Men packs a punch
","This review contains spoilers for the film, so read at your own risk.<br/><br/>X-Men is an action packed Sci-fi, drama.  The film begins with a comment by Professor X, about the history of mutation, and then we jump to a Nazi concentration camp where Magnito is a child and torn away from his parents, the gate seems to bend unnaturally, and he is finally knocked to the ground. We then jump to the near future, where a senator played by Bruce Greenwood wants to pass a bill to tag all mutants, much like McCarthy tried to do with communists in the 50s.  Everyone seems to applaud this, and agree with him. The film focuses mainly on Rough played by Anna Paquin.  She discovers her mutation after she kisses her boyfriend, which she can take whose ever life force she touches, and can eventually kill with this with this ability. She later hooks up with Wolverine who has powerful regenerative abilities, and three knives protruding from his fist.  His car crashes, and they are attacked by Magnitos men, while Xavior's defeats them, and then they are taken to Professor Xaviors school for the gifted, which is a cover for mutant children.  The X-Men must stop Magnito from turning the world leaders into mutants, after he unsuccessfully converts senator Kelly.  The cast is fantastic in this film.  Patrick Stewart gives an excellent performance as Professor Xavior he generally cares for his students, and is a positive force for good, and a great mentor.  Anna Paquin's character of Rogue is the one audiences would feel sympathy for.  She can't ever come in contact with other human beings without killing them, and she is innocent.  If you are looking for a great action, Sci-fi, drama film, then X-Men will work for you."

Not only is the movie teeming with eye-popping visual effects, but it also has intelligence, emotion, and humor.  Most of the characters are portrayed with great attention to the conflicts between them (Professor X vs. Magneto; Wolverine vs. Cyclops).  The only things that stop me from giving X-Men a rating of 10 are that Wolverine's past could have been revealed in more detail and that Storm has very little personality (let's work on her more in the sequel).

The plot quickly started to rely on intelligent characters suddenly acting stupid.  Imagine something on par with Mystery Men, only this wasn't a comedy.  The action sequences had some brilliant moments (Wolverine vs. Mystique), but the bulk of them just didn't convey the pace and intensity of super-heros battling super-villains.  The majority of the combat sequences were just how many times can someone get sent flying (obviously on a digitally removed wire) through a wall.  You get hit by lightning... fly through a wall, you get blasted by cyclops' eye beams... fly through a wall. Maybe I've just seen too many good combat sequences in Kung-Fu movies, but I was left less than impressed by the directing during most of the fight sequences.  On top of the statue of Liberty there's about 1-2 seconds in a fight sequence where Wolverine and Sabertooth are both obscured by Lady Liberty's crown!

","I mean well, in a way, it is just another action movie but honestly, could anyone have done a better job than Bryan Singer?<br/><br/>He gave the characters depth. Although I have friends who argue against it, insisting that characters like Halle Berry's storm ""do nothing but strut their stuff on stage with her more than tight leather pants and quite phony africano-exotica accent."" I mean i thought she was rather convincing as Storm, maybe its the boobs thing that got to them. It was sizable. Uhm, but that's not the point.<br/><br/>About character depth... well, Singer couldn't have possibly concentrated on ALL the X-men characters and expect to pull it off. It was smart of him to concentrate on Wolverine - possibly the edgiest and most discussed X-men. He is the protagonist of the story and the other characters revolve around him. Their traits are brought out through their interactions with him. And mind you, Singer's characterization did keep to the original recipe. Marsden was pretty credible as the I-don't-take-no-s**t-and-keep-away-from-my-grrrl leader of the X-men. Janssen gave Jean Grey both body and brains but she looked a little old for Marsden. But I won't chide anyone on that because it just means they're progressive enough to think its ok. :) Well, Storm. she had those little prickly fringe and her attire screamed `look at me body' but no one can take away the fact her power was the ultimate coolest. God, I wish I was one of them.<br/><br/>Rogue didn't really have a name like Marie in the original X-men, right? I think one of the major overhaul from the original was Rogue, portrayed by Anna Paquin. They added this vulnerability to the character, which is, perhaps realistic to a certain extent? But honestly, did Rogue ever have such rapport with Wolverine?<br/><br/>Oh well, I really shouldn't act like a grumpy X-men groupie because this is one of the best comic-based movies. All the batman movies don't even come close. The plot was commendable and somehow, I couldn't think of a better word to describe this movie than cool! Magneto's power and affliction was mentioned so precisely and poignantly at the start of the show. Seriously, its hard to think of how it could be done in a more tasteful fashion.<br/><br/>Ok, maybe this show isn't a perfect 10 because they had some corny and cheezy bits that they could do without. But it does provide many sharp one-liners, mainly from Wolverine. Hugh Jackman really carried it off with a tour-de-force performance. Ok, not THAT fantastic because film critiques will undoubtedly argue that his role doesn't require much. However, he really slipped into Wolverine's persona and skin with such comfort and ease.<br/><br/>Talk about skin, did anyone miss out mystique? Honestly, need I say more?"

","I did enjoy the movie, and found that it kept, in my opinion to the basics of the comic, for what you can do in a movie.  I did however have one problem, with not the movie but the credits.  The movie was filmed in Toronto and area, however in the credits, the following things were not credited.  Casa Loma - which was used for partial interior shots of Professor X's school, and also McLauglin house which was used for several exterior shots which included the scene of the fountain, and when they leave from the grounds in the ship, was a shot of the back of the house. As for the movie I enjoyed it, and have seen it twice.  I would recommend it to anyone who likes the comic.  However not for young children."

","This film could have failed miserably on so many levels, like almost each and every 'costumed-comic-hero-to-live-action' film ever made. But it didn't. It succeeded marvelously. (Pun intended.)<br/><br/>I have been disappointed with a lot of movies lately. In fact, I think the last action picture I was impressed with was 'Blade'. The only complaint I had was with the actor that played Cyclops. If there was a weak link in the cast, he was it. He was not a strong actor, and he was way, way too young. I actually expected Logan to irritate me more, considering that Cyclops has been my favorite since before The Beast had hair! But in this instance, they could have dropped him out of the airplane over the water, and I wouldn't have missed him.<br/><br/>Of course, the anchor to the film was the same as the anchor to the x-men. Prof. X. It's hard not to see Captain Picard when you look at Mr. Stewart, but I'm really glad he was cast in this role. Way back when this film was just a rumour, and we were all doing our 'fantasy casting', Patrick Stewart was always at the top of everyone's list.<br/><br/>So, all in all, my total complaints amount to: Cyclops was a too young jerk, Storm was too short, Rogue was a bit too weepy, although on a deeper level, it works. And...um...Oh! Well, I guess that's about it! Not too bad, when that's all that's 'wrong' with a movie.<br/><br/>Oh, and thank you to the film makers for all the little inside, and semi-inside gems. Such as a nod of the head to the other mutants from other comic titles, and even to the original x-men. A very nice touch, indeed! Who ever was responsible must actually be a fan!<br/><br/>So there it is. Worth every penny.

","So was this movie adaptation of a comic book series going to be a success? Or just something corny and clichÃ© ridden? You know what? I held reservation on it even after I saw the trailers for it and was greeted with an awesome movie! The trailers looked good but the movie was even better.<br/><br/>X-men is a comic series with many characters and plots but this particular movie dealt with the rescue of Rogue (Anna Paquin). Rogue is a young girl who discovers that she's a mutant and is forced to leave home for fear of being discovered and ostracized. She ends up in northern Alberta, Canada where she inadvertently meets and saves the life of a brooding angry man by the name of Logan, otherwise known as Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). The two end up at an institute for the gifted run by Dr. Xavier and the story launches into the comic book world of superheroes. <br/><br/>`Spawn' was another comic series turned movie that left a sour taste in my mouth and left me with a bit of trepidation. What made this movie good? A good concrete storyline with special effects that enhanced the characters and ultimately the story, not a substitute for a story. Although there were plenty of special effects, the movie used it mainly for creating the personalities of the main characters. The most popular character was probably Wolverine and Hugh Jackman did not disappoint. This is the first time I've seen him in a Hollywood movie and he definitely held his own. Patrick Stewart as Xavier was the perfect casting as was Ian McKellan as Magneto. Both actors have very powerful presences on screen and made it a pleasure to watch.<br/><br/>The one thing that I have to say that made this movie a little harder to follow at times was the number of characters. There were so many of them that it occasionally spread itself thin in some of the character development department, especially with some of the villain characters but I'm sure that this will change as in the sequels (there were enough hints of it). Overall, a great movie!"
"Falcon-51","8","0","0","14 July 2000"," Action Packed Fun
","The greatest comic book of all time is transformed into a very well made film. Incredible special effects and a great cast make this a must see film. You do not need to be a comic book or X-Men fan to enjoy this action packed block buster, but you may enjoy it more if you are a fan. The film does not have the best acting in the world, but action films aren't necessarily made for superb acting. Still there were a few performances worthy of mentioning. Patrick Stewart better known for his ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" role is one of the better performances. In this film he plays Professor X the leader of a school for gifted children. Film veteran Ian McKellen turns in the best performance of the bunch. He plays the powerful revenge seeking mutant Magneto. Coincidentally both Stewart and McKellen are English and about the same age. Stewart enjoyed a birthday the day before the ""X-Men"" premiere.<br/><br/>Australian born actor Hugh Jackman has his hands full playing the X-Men's principal character Wolverine. He appears to be a good casting choice despite the fact that the comic version Wolverine has a stronger build and has a Canadian accent. Oscar winning actress Anna Paquin plays the character known as Rogue, but she suffers from the same problems as Wolverine, she is supposed to have an accent. In her case that of a southern belle, but she is observed only a few times actually trying to muster one. However aside from the few flaws the film is really sensational. You get to see three beautiful and talented ladies Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos.<br/><br/>
Look for Ray Park's particularly entertaining role as the otherwise disgusting mutant called Toad. The best costume of the bunch would go to Tyler Mane's character Sabretooth whom most closely resembles his comic book counterpart. Halle Berry's costume would follow a close second.<br/><br/>The film is about two groups of mutants living in a world were they are not wanted. One group focuses there unique individual powers on bettering themselves and one day protecting those who do not trust them. The others are revenge seeking mutants and want to wage war on humanity because of their differences. It will take mutants against mutants in order to save humanity."

","`X-Men'.  ****.  (2000, USA, PG-13, 104 min Directed by Bryan Singer [The Usual Suspects, Apt Pupil] staring Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and a host of others).  The time is now and mutants are being born on earth.  Most appear human, they are human expect for the X factor.  The X factor may manifest itself in many ways: Wolverine is capable of almost instant healing ability, Xavier reads minds, and Magneto is a magnet. You'll have to see the movie or read the comic book to understand all the possible mutations that can or have occurred.  But as the movie starts, humans (the one's without an X factor) are preparing to register all mutants.  They don't want them teaching in the schools or controlling our minds.  `People need to know what mutants can do.'  But to make a movie the mutants are of two camps; those that want to live in harmony with non-Xers and those who want to use the X-factor to kick some butt.  Xavier (Stewart) is the be-kind-to-humans Xer and Magneto (McKellen) is the Xers-will-rule mutant.  After a lot of fights, some really cool special effects, some humor and too few scenes with the nude blue chick; the movie ends.  Not really, the producers just want us to go back outside and pay to see X-men II.  I can't wait."

I liked most of the performances, thought the costuming and characters were played straight and remained true to their source material, and felt that director Singer respected the genre most of all. He had some $$ to work with and didn't waste a penny.<br/><br/>I enjoyed Wolverine most of all, as seems to be the consensus, but will also say that I Liked Halle Berry as Storm. She didn't have many lines sure(and in fact had a real tongue tier in one scene--oh sorry)but you hadda like how they showed Ororo in all her lightning bolt hurling glory.<br/><br/>
Rogue and Cyclops were good too. So were the villains. As I stopped reading the Xmen in the early 80s, I can't say that I remembered Mystique or Sabretooth that much, but the rest I sure did. The XMen are a part of our culture, its nice to see that Bryan Singer has done them justice.<br/><br/>McKellan and Stewart were quite good too, by the way, I agree that Stewart's scenes seemed to be a little truncated, but what he does have, works.<br/><br/>Hopefully the next one will be longer and include likely villains ala the Sentinels or into more of the classic characters-but I agree with some here, you don't wanna jam in TOO many people, it's hard enough to get the ones already included straight or introed properly to the novice fans out there as it is.<br/><br/>So...I give this one *** outta ****, its good and they should be congratulated for turning in a solid effort which could easily have been Really awful.<br/><br/>Want proof?

","Hmmm, I haven't been hanging around this site much lately, but I must admit some surprise at how highly this film is rated.

Well, anyway, that said...<br/><br/>X-Men is not a bad film, but man, they could have done a lot more with it. I mean, here you have a movie that's basically guaranteed a profit, yet it's only a little longer than an hour and a half.  I mean, there's not much character development here - for the most part at least; Wolverine and Rogue fans are in luck.  However, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (as Mystique) has one line and Ray Park (as Toad) has two.  Couldn't they do better than that?  And Tyler Mane (Sabretooth) doesn't speak much either.  In fact, outside of Wolverine and Rogue, Professor Xavier and Magneto are the only characters with much of a personality (flat as they might be), and yet Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem underused in the parts (especially Stewart).  By the way, don't think that means there's lots of action because there isn't.<br/><br/>Which isn't to say that I didn't like the film.  What action scenes it has are fairly good and the plot is passable enough.  There simply didn't seem to be much to X-Men.

","Since 1995, I waited for this movie to come out, and finally it made it's way to the big screen.  My expectations of this movie were high, and I did enjoy every bit of this movie, however, I do have a few bones to pick.<br/><br/>First of all, the movie was way too short!  95 mins was the total runtime, and yet 2/3 of the movie was used on developing plot and background.  I mean, there's really nothing wrong with deeply defining the plot, in fact that is good, but when your limited to 95 mins, then there's a problem. There is really only 1 true action seen near the end, the statute of liberty scene.  And before you know it, the movie is over.  They should have had at least 1 more action scene that would involve a few melee combats.  That would have completed the movie and made it a 9 or 9.5, instead you'll just have to wait for the sequel.<br/><br/>But other than that, the movie is still entertaining.  The effects are awesome, and it was well acted (very unusual for a comic flick).  I wouldn't go as far as to say that there are any oscar deserving performances, however some come close.  Hugh Jackman was a great Wolverine, and Anna Paquin was adorable as Rogue.<br/><br/>I really look forward to the sequel(s).

","I finally have seen this one after waiting ages to get to the cinema and I was not disappointed. I've read the reviews and I have a few things to say...<br/><br/>i) There are characters missing in the movie because the film had to be for people unfamiliar with the movie not just the fans. Too many characters would have been too confusing. People would have got lost with who's who.<br/><br/>ii) The character development was small because the movie would have dragged otherwise, and besides, there are so many characters to develop. Think about it - Wolverine, Cyclops, Rouge, Jean Grey, Professor X, Magneto, Sabertooth, Mystique, Toad and Storm - that's a lot of characters to try and develop in such a small space of time.<br/><br/>iii) The screenplay wasn't as bad as people make it out to be. It was actually kinda impressive given the movie. I've said it before and I'll say it again, a complicated plot doesn't constitute a good movie. Some movies are just as good without them. Besides, what were you expecting? William Shakespeare?<br/><br/>iv) It's got lots of special effects and sfx, but could you really have a movie without them? Bet the same people complaining it was all special effects and no plot would be the same people that would have been complaining if it had a good story and no special effects. I can hear them moaning now, ""Where are the special effects... etc..."" You just can't please these people, ever!<br/><br/>v) There were a lot of loose ends because there is so much more to happen. The comics have been going for so long. Hey the cartoon series took about 15 episodes to cover this entire mutant Registation thing and who knows how many comics. Then there's Apocolyse, the Phoenix and Sinister etc. to go on with. There's a lot of stuff to try and tie up. This is a 30 plus year amount of stuff we're talking about! Besides, in reality if they had have tried to tie up all the loose ends the ending would have been really untidy and clustered and all rushed and it would never have worked, unless the movie went for four hours.<br/><br/>vi) Leave the realistic/ realism stuff alone please! Yes there are continuity and factual problems. Let it go please. That's why they're called movies. For heaven's sake, please leave your brains at home and bring your imaginations with you. You're spoiling the fun.<br/><br/>vii) Some people had there minds already made up about this movie and what they would think of it - cheezy comic remake, plot holes, bad script, not doing the film justice and nobody, not ever me can convince these arrogant people other wise.<br/><br/>No need to mention Hugh Jackman.

Fortunately, the movie was great.  Magneto was portrayed not as necessarily evil, just as a guy with a different approach to a situation, more along the lines of a Machiavelli.  The friendship that exists between Prof. X and Magneto was not given much background, but it was shown that they respected one another in the present based on the past.  Wolverine was well-played, I don't know if anyone could have brought Wolverine to life as well.  Stewart and McKellan were both very good, and so were the supporting cast.

I'm sure there will be some hardcore fans of the comic book who are going to get very nitpicky about certain details, but understand they're trying to make a movie to appeal to everyone and not just the X-Men nerds. Hugh Jackman stole the show as Wolverine; Patrick Stewart was made for the role of Professor Charles Xavier; and Sir Ian McKellen was superb as Magneto.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I wasn't an X-Men or Marvel Comics fan growing up.  I was more into the DC Comic heroes (Superman, Batman, The Flash, Green Lantern, etc.), so this was the first time I got to know some of the characters and background of the whole X-Men story.  What I like about the movie is that it wasn't really an action film, although it did have its moments.  It's more of a story about the mutants and their struggle to live in a world where they're met with hostility because they're different from everyone else, and the two different ideologies as to how to address it.  The film's a commentary on how easily we human beings become frightened with what we don't know and how we seem to always address it: with intolerance and hostility.  The X-Men aren't superheroes per se.  They're regular human beings who just happen to be mutants and have these extraordinary powers. And you can't really think of this as an ordinary good vs. evil story. From the beginning of the movie we get an idea of what made Magneto the man he is today, and that he's more complex then your run-of-the-mill movie bad guy.<br/><br/>Although the movie wasn't longer (like many have said it was tasty but not filling enough), and the ending somewhat awkward, go out and see it!!!! Undoubtedly there will be sequels, and I hope they'll be just as good if not better than the first.

So I went to see X-Men the Movie with some trepidation and a lot of curiosity. In sum: The action was great but the character development needs work.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment was the absence of Kitty Pryde, who has a ten-second-cameo. I can only hope she'll return in one of the sequels because she's always been my favorite. Writing dialogue for her would have livened up things considerably.<br/><br/>Top kudos go to Hugh Jackman's portrayal of Wolverine. He was dead on, in my opinion. You can put an actor in a costume (well, talons) and pray he'll growl with sufficient ferocity but Jackman takes this tortured character to new heights. Sardonic, mistrustful, fierce and under all that, hopeful of finding answers, Wolverine's character came to life in a way it couldn't in the comic book.<br/><br/>Paquin does an admirable job as Rogue, her mixture of fear and hope (somewhat like Wolverine's quest for the truth about his past) was very compelling. I'm looking forward to seeing her in the sequels.<br/><br/>The other X-Men did fine but when action leads over depth, you're going to miss out on the personalities and that's what makes this movie somewhat lacking. Why should we care about Cyclops, Jean Grey or Storm? We (the moviegoer not the comic book readers) know nothing about their history, unlike Wolverine and Rogue. Hopefully, we'll learn more about them in the sequels.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart and McKellan, as someone else said, were underused. As Dr. Xavier, Stewart is a dead ringer for the X-Men's leader and does well. But he's absent for much of the last half of the film.<br/><br/>Any action movie lover will like this film, no doubt. And the seeds have been sown for a promising series of sequels. Maybe I'm asking for a lot, but let's hope we get to hear some more promising dialogue and character development."

While the movie does contain a lot of impressive visuals, it's doesn't focus on the visuals at the expense of everything else.<br/><br/>Like ""Superman"", ""X-Men"" takes time with its story and develops genuine rather than forced conflict.  It isn't simply a matter of ""Here's the villain, here's his master plan, now the hero fights him.""  While there is a villain, and there is a master plan, the actual conflict runs deeper than that.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the strength of both ""Superman"" and ""X-Men"" lies in the fact that the real focus lies on the characters.  Just as Donner focused more on the relationships between Superman/Clark Kent and Lois Lane rather than Superman vs. Lex Luthor, director Bryan Singer focuses on the interaction between the X-Men characters.

When Episode 1 came out, it was in the top 30 movies of all time, and as time passed, the majority spoke and realized that it sucked. Badly. The same will happen to X-Men, so don't be fooled by the good reviews you see. Oh, and while were talking about Episode 1, let me just say that Jar-Jar has just been overtaken as ""most annoying character ever"" by Toad-played by the same who played Darth Maul-small world, eh? Toad is awful. Toad is worse than awful. I can only imagine that Singer(the director) put this character in to appeal to 5 year olds, though I'm sure most 5 year olds were rolling their eyes too at this corny jack-ass dancing around like a clown on screen (you'll know what I'm talking about when you see it). The story is far-fetched, but fine. I have no problem with imagination as long as it is done right, and X-Men does a good job explaining mutants, etc., even though it is a pretty ridiculous plot. It explains it enough to where you can forget about the problems with it, accept that there are mutants, and enjoy what they are doing on screen. Aside from 1 or 2, the characters are fine, the story is acceptable and to tell you the truth, they set it up well at the end for the imminent sequels. But, the script is too cliche' and actually takes away from what could have been a very good film. I wont discourage people from seeing it, afterall, we sat through basically the same stuff the past few summers, and probably will do it again in '01. I KNOW I will see even greater  visuals, and I HOPE that the dialogue and realism stars moving in that direction as well..."

","I've watched two special screenings in my home country because the regular showing is on August 16th grrr...<br/><br/>I've never considered X-Men as an action/adventure film but a very serious film. It is a character developmental movie designed for a trilogy, I think Bryan Singer did a good job for this genre exploring the origins of each character just like in the Usual Suspects. I don't blame this film that Wolverine has more past than his fellow X-Men it's just he's a complexed character. Hugh nailed the part, so what if he's too tall? he delivered it well. I will surely treasure this film bring on the Sentinels, Gambit, Beast and Psylocke on the sequel!"

","Hi everyone. I reckon that X-Men was a real cool movie. I like all the characters and their special abilities. Especially Storm's. She's my favorite, I like the lighting strike she did at the train station when they were trying to find rogue. I liked Rogue and her special but, I did'nt like the way of the reaction of people she touched, festy. When Wolverine battled Mystique, that was mad! Well the last battle, I was thinking, is that it! What! Finished already! That cannot be the final battle! And boom, the movie finishes, and the good guys win without a scratch. Gee I was like, how easy was it for the good guys, more mutants, better abilities and stuff.<br/><br/>Anyway I'd rate this movie 8.6 but since there is no 8.6, I voted 9.

","I saw the top 250 poll has it ranked at like 120 something, and that's pretty good considering it's company. But then I couldn't decide which way it should go. Was it that good that it should go up further and mix in with some of the truly timeless acts of classic movie making, or did it deserve to rest lower amongst the other super-fun Hollywood summertime fluff that it seems to fit in? But was it really fluff? Or was it the vindication movie of all comic book adaptations with an actual plot and purpose?<br/><br/>I'm really wrestling with this one.<br/><br/>How can you call a movie with action suits and dick jokes to be that brilliant, while at the same time with the undeniable presence of a complex and poignant social commentaries on segregation, resistance and acceptance call it popcorn fodder.<br/><br/>It's the feature film equivalent to a monster trampoline double-jump. And I'm still left hanging.<br/><br/>An interesting twist is that I've never been an x-men fan. Not to say I never liked them, but instead have never been exposed to it. 'Usual Suspects' though has been at the top of my list since the day I saw it. For these reasons I have been following the film for some time based and with greater exception placed upon the quality of Bryan's previous work and not on any hopes of making sure Canada was portrayed properly.<br/><br/>I had read a few articles prior to viewing, and have since seen way to many interviews and have read the original script. The more I uncover and the more I ponder this thought I really appreciate Bryan's own struggle when taking on this project on how to balance the cerebral and the physical elements available in it. He could have gone all action and made one whopper of a flick that appeased everyone in the Matrix crowd, or he could have hammed up the commentary to the point were Jim Lehrer would have raved about it as the movie of the year.<br/><br/>Instead there's a balance. A tenuous equilibrium. Difficult almost on the viewer at how carefully it wants to walk the line. But alas, I have to concede successfully.<br/><br/>Sure I could have asked for a few more punches and couple more things to blow up near the end, and of course I still have questions about the issues it raises half way up the flag but never quite comes clear on. But in the end I still felt satisfied.<br/><br/>So yes, after all this (and I do appreciate your patience) I liked it. I don't recommend anyone to go out and watch it for some kind of life affirming revelation on human interaction, not would I tear some teenage angst ridden kid away from one of their violent toys to go get their fill of mayhem. But I will tell anyone who wants to see it that I thought it was good. And that is really all they should have asked."

So what i am saying is,get over it ,so the movie was not dead on with the comic book,SO WHAT!!!,just to see it made into a movie is just great.

"Matt-Buc","Null","0","0","25 July 2000"," Comic-based action sci-fi spectacle which rises above the competition with ease
","X-Men is based on the world's most popular comic book series of the same name, created in the early 1960's by Marvel Comics' ultimate team: writer-editor Stan Lee and artist Jack Kirby. It's premise appeals to the angst of the teenage years, showing a world where outcast mutants are shunned by a normal society who fear and hate their special gifts. While most adaptations of comics are half-hearted and pathetic, Bryan Singer, director of The Usual Suspects, has succeeded in what seemed impossible and produced the ultimate comic book film. While not every piece fits the original comic book puzzle, the whole matches the same spirit of the stories and characters that made X-Men so famous.<br/><br/>As the main plot of X-Men sets in, we find ourselves in the near future. A strange phenomenon has gripped the planet, as a new breed of Man has been discovered. They are mutants, born with a special key in their genes that unlock special powers and abilities. One such mutant is Professor Charles Xavier, a wise, aging man with psychic powers who believes that mutants and humans can live together in harmony. Opposing this ideology is Magneto, a survivor of the Nazi concentration camps who has sworn to himself that he will never allow such atrocities to occur again. Born with the power to control and manipulate the magnetic properties of metal, Magneto has formed a Brotherhood of like-minded mutants in order to carry out his schemes and ensure that mutantkind prospers.<br/><br/>Entering this equation are Rogue and Wolverine. Rogue is a young girl just uncovering her budding powers. Simply by touching a person's skin, she absorbs their life-force, sending them into a state of coma. The first time she ever kisses a boy, he freezes in a death trance, scarring her psyche and making her afraid of herself and how she interacts with others. She soon meets Wolverine, also known as Logan, a hard-boiled, rough-necked wild man who chomps cigars and pit-fights in Canadian dives for cash. He has the power to heal damage done to his body, and even more importantly, he can unsheathe a trio of unbreakable claws out of his knuckles, deadly living weapons which make him a lethal warrior.<br/><br/>After the fantastic, atmospheric set-up of these characters and their personalities, the real plot of the film sets in and never lets up. As Wolverine and Rogue figure into Magneto's whims, they find themselves under the protection of Charles Xavier. He has created a School for Gifted Youngsters, a safe haven for young mutants and their abilities, and a place where they can be taught that even though they are different, they do not have to fear themselves or hate what they are. Along with the School, Xavier has formed the X-Men, a group of mutants who have been trained to defend humanity from evil mutants who would use their powers for sinister purposes.<br/><br/>Everything about the characters and the way they are presented works. Patrick Stewart, a classically-trained Shakespearean actor, is great as Xavier, and Ian McKellan, a Englishman with a similar theater background, is perfect as the diabolic Magneto. But the premiere performance here is Australian unknown Hugh Jackman as Wolverine himself, who captures the character of Logan in every way. He's gritty and dark, but he retains the same soft spot for the women in his life that the comic hero himself has. This is a career-making performance from Jackman, and it's amazing that he, like the rest of the cast, perfects these four-color heroes so well.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is made up of the rest of the X-Men team and Magneto's Brotherhood. The Brotherhood itself is more of the talk less, do more variety, being given little lines, but starring in all of the big action scenes. Tyler Mane, a former wrestler, growls and howls his way through Sabretooth, a feral warrior with super strength, and Ray Park, a veteran stunt-man late off Sleepy Hollow and Phantom Menace, is a show-stopper as Toad, an athletic beast with a long tongue and amazing agility. The most interesting of the three Brotherhood members is Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as Mystique, a blue-skinned beauty with bright yellow eyes, martial arts skills, and the power to shapeshift into other forms.<br/><br/>The X-Men themselves include Cyclops, who can fires beams of plasma from his eyes, played by James Marsden. He's cocky and brash, but stuck-up and bossy; typical for the team leader. His fiancee is Jean Grey, a telepathic doctor played by the gorgeous Jean Grey. A love triangle of sorts becomes apparent between Cyclops, Jean and Wolverine, another comic book mainstay which is nailed by this movie adaptation. The odd character out here is Halle Berry as Storm, a woman who can create and control the weather. Berry is serviceable, but she's a weak version of the regal beauty known to comic fans.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer controls X-Men skillfully and with passion. Its cold and gray, somber and understated. A sense of loneliness and silence hangs over every scene, drawing us deeper into the world of these characters. Even when they use their amazing powers, the special effects never conquer the film. The action pieces themselves which show us these powers are strong and fast, but their only weakness is that they're simply too short. When Storm calls a bolt of lightning or Wolverine and Mystique go tooth and nail, we're left wanting much more than what we are given.<br/><br/>The plot formed by Magneto might be a little hard to swallow, and the dialogue might skip the occasional beat, but for the most part, everything is as it should be. The direction and editing are excellent, the performances are great, and the effects are fantastic. This is the one comic fans have been waiting for.<br/><br/>X-Men receives a 9.5 out of 10."
"ravenmyst","Null","0","0","25 July 2000"," A So-so adaptation! (Not sure if stuff included is considered a spoiler or not! Be warned!)
","Okay, X-Men was a good movie. Not a great movie, but a good one. I'm glad that I saw it in the theatre for the special effects, but I don't think it would have killed me to see it on home video, so it's up to you whether you want to spend 10$ or 2.50$. You won't be losing much if you wait for the video.<br/><br/>I have a couple of problems with the movie. One is the lack of character development! The entire screenplay seems to be written, *assuming* that you've read the comics, and already know about all the characters, and are going to get all the inside jokes. (Like the joke about Wolverine's costume in the comic book series/cartoon.) And some things (The romance between Wolverine and Jean Grey) are pushed ahead at unbelievable speeds! Apparently all the good stuff happened when they weren't on screen!<br/><br/>Two: I hate to point this out to Bryan Singer, but when it's winter in Canada (I'm referring to the scenes in Alberta) it's winter in the United States too. Sorry, it's not like Australia. The USA's summer is not our winter, and chances are if we have snow, they're going to also. I just couldn't believe a continuity error like that! Talk about perpetuating the myth that it's always cold in Canada!<br/><br/>Anyway, aside from those two little things (If you can call no character development little.), it's a pretty decent movie. However, for a better idea of what's going on, I recommend either reading some of the comic books, or watching the cartoon before you see it.<br/><br/>Oh yeah! And whatever happened to Jubilee and Gambit????? Not to mention liberties taken with various other characters!"

Hugh Jackman did a great job acting as a vicious animal and then a fatherly, caring man. His one-liners were also hilarious. <br/><br/>The ideas used in this movie were very original and the special effects were great. The conflict between 2 characters over a love interest was very humorous. I thought the characters were developed well and the costumes and sets were great. This movie is a great one to see with everyone."
"Anonymous_Maxine","7","0","0","26 July 2000"," As far as action and special effects, X-Men was spectacular, but there were a few holes that were really difficult to overlook.
","X-Men definitely delivered in the action and special effects departments. The acting, make-up, and cinematography were all excellent as well. In that sense, it was a great movie.<br/><br/>However, the thing that I really had a problem with was the fact that there were a few holes left in the plot that could very easily have been prevented. For example, from what financial base did Dr. Xavier start this spectacular school for mutants? Clearly it would require a huge amount of money just to build the ""big round room"" alone. And even more than that, is it just me or does it seem very unlikely that every mutant with these amazing powers somehow winds up in this school and not in some secret government institution somewhere? Is it a coincidence that the only people who ever witness these peoples' powers are the people who just want to turn them over to this school and not to the scientific community to see how they work? Not likely. And what about those powers themselves? The narration at the beginning of the film talks about how these 'mutants' have skipped a step in evolution, so that their genetic structure is in various ways superior to that of the rest of the human race. That's great, but does the ability to shoot lasers out of your eyes or, even more, the ability to walk through walls have anything to do with your DNA? I don't think so. It doesn't seem that there was a lot of thought put into these aspects of the film, and it really bothers me when the filmmakers do things like that.<br/><br/>
Overall, X-Men was a very good film, and it is definitely worth seeing, but only as a special effects and action extravaganza. It seems to be aimed mostly at younger male audiences, because of the absence of a solid amorous subplot, and also because of Mystique's outfit (!). Besides all that, at least a basic knowledge of the X-Men comics (which I personally don't have, I'm into movies, not comic books) would probably be beneficial in understanding the story a little bit better. If you haven't seen X-Men, go out and check it out. But if you aren't impressed by films that are pulled along almost entirely by their computer generated images and explosions, you might want to skip this one."

","First of all, I have to make a confession. I never watched the X-men cartoons as a kid. Prior to this movie, I was absolutely clueless about every aspect of the X-men mythology. In fact, the only reason I had any interest at all in this movie was the fact that it was directed by Bryan Singer, who also directed The Usual Suspects, which, in my opinion, is one of the best movies of modern times. Unfortunately, upon leaving the theatre, all I felt was frustration. Sure, the movie was beautifully made. The sets, the costuming, the special effects and the direction were all top-quality. But all I could think about was the amount of holes in the script. Had the screenwriter spent more time on character development, this could be a truly great sci-fi film, this year's answer to ""The Matrix."" But I couldn't keep from wondering throughout the movie, ""What happened to the little things?"" Where was the chemistry between Cyclops and Jean Grey? Where was the explanation of everyone's whereabouts, origins, etc. If only the screenwriter had been more thorough. After all, the little things are what make a movie great. And as for the cliffhanger ending (obviously designed for a sequel) it tied up no loose ends whatsoever. It was almost as if they were in a rush and 'forgot' to film the last few pages of the script! In defense of the ending, a good friend of mine who loved the movie told me, ""It left me wanting more."" Well....the ending left me wanting more, too, only not in the form of another sequel. It left me wanting more detail, more chemistry, and more explanation. It absolutely kills me to see a movie with such potential sink because the screenwriter sacrificed the character relationships because audiences might think it was boring."

","I really liked X-Men. It's the first film of the summer which I've seen more than once, and I still haven't been bored with it. It's full of action, yes, but deep down it is more concerned with characterization. The action scenes in the film are few and far between and most of the characters aren't fully explored, but the DVD will probably clear that up with cut footage. As far as the plot goes, it isn't anything to write home about, but it doesn't matter. It's just a clothesline for some great visuals and scenes. Acting isn't great across the board-only a few stand out from others. Let me start by naming my least favorite performances--James Marsden and Halle Berry(she gets saddled with the worst line of the film). Everybody else works fine, but there are three performances that stand out in my opinion. First, Hugh Jackman has the star-making role of Wolverine and he is great in the role and has some of the best one-liners in the film (yes, the movie has a sense of humor), plus he is backed up with major energy and charisma. I see big things for him in the future. Second, is there anything the great Ian McKellan can't do in terms of acting? He's superb as the villain Magneto, plus he has a legitimate back story for why he is bent on performing his evil deed. Finally, the best performance, in my opinion, comes from Anna Paquin, the little Oscar-winner from The Piano, now all grown up and suddenly very lovely. It's a tender and touching portrayal--what would you do if you had to spend the rest of your life without human contact due to mutant powers? She has great chemistry with Jackman, and has several wonderful scenes. The one I'm thinking of is the quietly performed but still heartbreaking train scene between her and Jackman as her tears spill silently down her cheeks. I never liked her (and still don't like it) performance in The Piano, and I feel she didn't deserve the Oscar--she was simply too grating, to me at least. However, look at what a couple of years has done to her acting--she's given more and more solid performances, and with this one, proves that she can at least now back that Oscar up. Finally, this is a summer movie that at least has a message in it--it deals with prejudice and fear of those who are different from the rest of us. Great popcorn entertainment mixed with solid filmmaking make this a must-see.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","What a great film! After years of problems, the X-Men have finally made it to the screen. And it appears the delay was worth it. The special effects are top notch, with one or two exceptions. Bryan Singers direction is quite confident, considering this is his first action film/ sci-fi film/ special effects film. And it transcends all of those genres. It is a very palatable and gentle lesson in how easy it is to become frightened of what you don't understand and how bias and intolerance can become infectious. The opening scene alone is worth the price of admission. Haunting, tragic, and infuriating. Fear not people, even if you have no idea who the x-men are or what they are about, if you are looking for some great entertainment, fantasy rooted in reality, and characters that are immediate classics, GO SEE X-MEN!"
"spottedreptile","8","0","0","10 July 2000"," Classy film that raises comic book movies to new heights
","Minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I saw this film in Melbourne with about 850 other X-fans at a public preview. I'd estimate that about 800 of them had huge smiles on their faces at the end!<br/><br/>This is a very classy, very tight and wonderfully put together film. As a film on its own, it's right up there with the best of 2000. As a comic book film, it's the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>I loved Batman, and I loved Superman, but X-Men has something these lacked, a special heart to it that stays with you and pulls you into its world. It has that rare quality in a fantasy movie: a soul. This is a film that you won't forget as soon as you leave the cinema.<br/><br/>The story deals with the rise of genetic mutations in our modern world, where children are born with special powers they realise when they reach puberty. Their inability to deal with their powers leads Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), himself a mutant with telepathic powers, to fund a special school where they can learn to integrate themselves into a fearful and prejudiced society which will not accept them.<br/><br/>One of Xavier's old friends, another mutant known as Magneto (Ian McKellen) because of his ability to bend metal, takes a different view. Magneto believes that society will never accept mutants and is out to declare war on those who have persecuted him. His plan is to sabotage the group of world leaders in New York who have gathered to formulate a global policy on mutants, and thereby force a showdown with those who fear his kind.<br/><br/>
Into this world walks Rogue (Anna Paquin) a teenage mutant who discovers she can absorb other people's energies and thereby threaten their lives, just by touching them. Running away from home, she encounters Logan (Hugh Jackman) in a bar in the Canadian winter. Logan is also a mutant, a feral loner with vicious claws and super healing powers, but a mysterious past with a horrific secret. Eventually, without giving anything away, they join Xavier's team and are drawn into the battle against Magneto and his allies. Both Logan and Rogue play crucial roles as they try to stop Magneto before he succeeds.<br/><br/>The story is simply told but is never patronising nor tries to excuse itself with cheesy self-parody, a common trick in science fiction or comic films these days. Bryan Singer, director (The Usual Suspects), takes his film very seriously but is never pretentious. The film contains quite a few laughs and some very good lines, most of them from Logan/Wolverine.<br/><br/>
X-Men is not like the Matrix. The team wear black leather costumes, but the resemblance ends there. X-Men is less hyperreal, more gritty and more relevant. The themes are those of prejudice, fear of what you don't understand, alienation and the courage it takes to be yourself if you are an outcast.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman's performance is brilliant, almost worth the price of admission itself. He completely inhabits the inner skin of Logan. The character is superbly written for the screen. He's funny, he's angry, in your face, he's sarcastic, but he has integrity, honesty and his own set of rules which he lives by. Logan is the audience's eyes into the X-world, and Hugh has him down to a T. Characterisation raised to the level of an art form. For me, he's one of the best comic characters ever to make it to celluloid, and I don't remember a better performance by a lead character in this genre.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen (Magneto) is also magnificent. Great delivery, wonderfully imposing presence and not horribly overplayed or hyperevil. He just has a different agenda. Patrick Stewart is suave, controlled and a humanitarian, the perfect Prof X.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin's Rogue is sensitive, lost, so 'why is this happening to me?' Her scenes with Logan are beautifully crafted and the chemistry between them is very touching. Women will love it. Guys, well, you might too.<br/><br/>
Famke Janssen is also very convincing as Jean Grey, an intelligent, sexy, and mature woman whom Cyclops is very lucky to have as his girl. James Marsden is fine as Cyclops, a young man trying to live up to the ideals of his mentor and finding leadership can be a burden at times. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos is an eye-catching bad girl, shapeshifter Mystique, all blue with painted scales. The makeup is amazing.<br/><br/>The visual effects are very tight, well crafted and are absorbed into the story without detracting from it. Bryan Singer's touch is light and it works well.<br/><br/>The mix of humour and drama is cleverly balanced and never jars. There are also some very moving scenes, particularly at the beginning and the flashback sequences involving Logan's past, which are quite disturbing. Some countries will probably give X-Men a more restricted rating, not necessarily because of any gore or violence, but because of the overall impact of some of these scenes.<br/><br/>Overall, I give this an 8 out of 10. It's exciting, it's dramatic, it's funny. I'm going back Friday to see it again. And probably on the weekend as well. Bryan Singer, you're the man."

","At the tragic final act of La Boheme, love-smitten tenor Rodolfo sings ""Your tiny hand is frozen"" to starving-but-still-singing-loudly soprano Mimi. When the role of Mimi is assayed by a svelte-free diva such as Montserrat Caballe, this scene bids fair to being opera's most falling-down funny moment, but in fact, it works.  It works because a) Caballe can hit the notes, and b) it's opera, dammit.  It's supposed to be over-the-top. X-Men: the Movie is based on X-Men the Marvel comic book, and happily for us, comic books are also expected to be over-the-top.  The only thing we need be concerned about is whether X-Men: the Movie hits the notes.  And does it? You betcha.<br/><br/>X-Men is precisely what we've come to expect from a summer movie.  It's straightforward and not particularly nuanced, but who needs nuance when you can have big, fat explosions and really good looking people in leather? The movie's design is outstanding; dark and foreboding, it harks back to the Frank Miller's Batman and the granddaddy of dystopia films, Metropolis. And of course, the movie has fabulous special effects and great fight scenes.<br/><br/>To be perfectly honest, knowing that the story takes place in a comic-book universe didn't stop me from asking the tough questions.  Did Charles Xavier get the proper building permits for the better parts of the School for Gifted Students?  Who built the X-jet, Boeing or Lockheed, and is the neighborhood zoned for stealth?  Is there a sweatshop somewhere that does nothing but turn out superhero uniforms?  And most importantly, are those suits dry clean or fine washable?<br/><br/>Based on the world's most popular comic book, X-Men: the Movie has a built-in audience of people who have faithfully followed the x-adventures for over 30 years and who are not going to tolerate much deviation from the canon.  I try to avoid those people.  I went to see the film because I really wanted to hear mature hunk Patrick Stewart say ""ee-ville.""  This does not mean I didn't know the movie would succeed or fail based on the performance of the unknown playing Wolverine.  The X-Men may be a team, but let's face it--the rest of the bunch are Wolfie's backup singers.  It's no accident that X-Men the Movie and the latest Harry Potter book are selling like proverbial hotcakes--both are stories about outsiders, with the mutants edging out the wizards in the spiffy threads department. Wolverine is Harry Potter's evil twin.  In short, he is the comic book character I would least like to have at my dinner party but most like to boink.  So let's get down to brass tacks.  Does newcomer Hugh Jackman hit the notes?<br/><br/>WOOF!<br/><br/>And now, I'd like to digress for a moment to rhapsodize about 2000 being the Year of the Antipodean Guy.  From Jackman to Crowe to the rapidly wrinkling Gibson, they're all over the place, reeking of testosterone and raising the drool bar to Olympian heights.  And contrary to the stereotype, they appear to be perfectly capable of handling verbs!  I tell you, it's an exciting time for the intelligent movie-going female!<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is perfectly on pitch, too.  Who cannot enjoy plummy-voiced Master Thespians Stewart and McKellan duking it out for the best-pronounced vowel award?  I suspect that the males in the audience will appreciate the talents of Berry, Janssen, and the very blue Romijn-Stamos almost as much as I appreciated Jackman's.  The villains are appropriately villainous, with Ray Park (who is carving out a career for himself as the most unrecognizable actor to kick serious cinematic butt) winning my personal bad-guy laurels as the Toad.<br/><br/>So drop that Henry James novel and rush right off to see X-Men the Movie. I suggest copious amounts of butter for your popcorn, and perhaps an entire box of Milk Duds.  If you're male, you're going to be hearing some mighty pathetic whimpering coming from your date, starting the moment Jackman hits the screen.  Just ignore it."

","The special effects were amazing and the movie was exciting from beginning to end, but I never found out what these mutants were all fighting for...There's obviously a lot going on beneath the surface between Professor X and Magneto - this is the central conflict in the original comic books, but this movie chooses not to delve in there at all.  Instead, it sticks with its laser blasts and shapeshifting.  There is a brief attempt to convince us to sympathize with Wolverine, but that ends up being too rushed and too shrouded in mystery to make any sense to anybody.<br/><br/>With its arsenal of fine actors, X-Men could've paused a second to let someone say something meaningful.  I don't think I was allowed to blink for the full 104 minutes.  Visually stunning and very entertaining, but it could have been more of a movie and less of a laser-light show...Hopefully they're planning to follow in the footsteps to make X2:Judgment Day - well, you get my drift."

They took Rogue, a tall robust struggling poverty class southern bell with a heavy sensuous drawl and transmuted her into a middle-class teeny bopper.<br/><br/>Wolvie got all the lines and it seemed this movie was made to drown out the actors with little talent by giving the ones with talent (Jackman, Stewart, McKellan) all the lines. Even the special effects were limited to some very artful scenes, which contained those that were best suited for martial artist actors.  Halle Berry got left behind it all (for obvious reasons) like a puffy cloud of silence with frosted lips.  I was upset by the shallow Hollywood treatment of a storyline which could have made a longer movie with lots of Marvel-style flashbacks and mundane comedy creating a legacy for sequels to come.<br/><br/>Bring back Gambit!!

I honestly think that he wasn't used enough and I really really wanna see more of him in the sequels. I understand how they may be mad as Scott and Jean, both members of the beginning 5 as well, were much older but the way Bobby is meant to be in the movie is actually quite dead on. I think it would have been great to see him go save Rouge with the core team, they already had 1 person who didn't know what to do, what would another one do.

I'm happy to say that I was very pleasently surprised. <br/><br/>X-Men really stays true to the comics with well developed characters that act like they did in the comics.

Someone a little older than her would have done well too. Hugh Jackman is a perfect realization of what Wolveriene is and he plays him like he was born to. The rest of the cast fit their roles, but not as well as him. This movie is terrific and even the cameo's done by (hopefully in future movies) Iceman, Shadowcat, Pyro, Colossus, Cannonball, and Jubilee are great.

","I haven't read a comic book in 10 years, but I did see a few eps of the X-Men cartoon TV show that was so popular 4-5 years ago. I was surprised then at how serious that cartoon was, and that it was in serial form with each episode building on past episodes. Pretty adult stuff for a TV cartoon.<br/><br/>That is the same way I felt after seeing the X-Men movie. It was dark, serious (there were maybe two laughs, including one big one), and -- best of all -- interesting. I expected the movie to end up somehow ""kiddie-fied,"" with lots of things that made little sense and many cheap laughs and stupid one-liners. Boy, was I surprised.<br/><br/>X-Men looks like a terrific start to a movie franchise. The characters were all believeable (well, they are mutants, so you have to buy into the premise). The technology was interesting and not too futuristic. The actors ranged from excellent (Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen, and the guy who played Wolverine did a great job, too) to passable (Halle Barry, Sabertooth). Some characters didn't say much (Toad, Mystique). The plot made sense, mostly. We only nitpicked a few things afterward.<br/><br/>The core of the movie, which sets up the ""good"" and ""bad"" sides, is believable and thought-provoking. How *would* our society react if we found that certain individuals were genetically different and had exceptional powers? Would we embrace them or lock them up? <br/><br/>I hope the X-Men movies keep up what this first one started. I would love to have seen the additional 45 minutes that were supposedly cut from the movie. The information was interesting enough to support showing it. If I have one criticism, it is that the movie was a bit slow in the first 45 minutes, because the characters had to be set up and brought in.

","so many factors go into whether one likes a movie or not, and some don't have anything to do with the movie. in this case, the audience i happened to be with made all the difference. they clapped and cheered and made a few cheesy lines sound suddenly deep, and that helped me alot. not that the movie wasn't good on its own. it was great, faithful to the themes of the comic and full of clever action. but since i liked it i will focus on my few criticisms. ok, comic plots are often cheesy, but i don't remember any x-men plots being as simplistic and un-directed as the one surrounding magneto's plan. turn humans into mutants with a white glowing field of energy? please, couldn't we come up with something a little more credible? i don't it needed to be a ""save the world"" plot, especially when the rest of the movie seemed so much an introduction to the characters. i think maybe a cooler plotline would be him going to sink some nuclear submarines (which really happened in the comic and was always a real keystone memory for magneto). anyways, what else? oh, halle berry sucked big time. sorry, but it's true. oh, and too many things were covered in too little time. i thought the movie could've been a lot longer, but maybe younger people would have gotten restless. who knows. i thought the first part of the movie was the best, introducing magneto and wolverine and stuff, but once the it became a ""let's stop magneto and bad guys et al. from shooting their giant white ray"" it fell apart a bit. anyways, wolverine was awesome and so were magneto and prof. x. in fact, everyone was real good except for storm. maybe she'll die early in the sequel...no, i doubt it. anyways, bravo over all. 8/10"

","X-Men almost did it.  It started out perfectly, but then it failed to reach what it needed to reach for fans and non-fans.  Most likely because it was thinking more about making sequels then making the best first X-Men movie that could be made.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of the comic book for awhile and I know of the potential great X-Men story telling that, if done right, can even be considered for oscars and golden globes.  The potential was not reached in X-Men the movie. What did not work especially was Magneto's plan to turn the world leaders into mutants.  It was uncharacteristic for the type of character who whole heartedly hates humans (why would you invest your powers in people you hate?).  From a X-Men fan's point of view it's just something Magneto wouldn't do... from a non-fan view point, it's just stupid.  And the fact the the philosophies of both Xavier and Magneto wasn't heavily explored upon cause a lack of great dialogue.  As great as it was to hear Wolverine call Cyclops a ""D*ck,""  I would much more rather hear a vocal debate on the two view points, then leading to physical confrontations with emotional content. The fighting in X-Men was there for little reason but to have an action sequence.  More human interactions would help exploring the different issues X-Men the movie should've addressed.  Instead the movie focuses mostly on joining the team, introducing characters and powers.  Although that's all good, it doesn't pay off in the end because of Magneto's stupid plan, and lack of purpose.<br/><br/>The X-Men, more than it is about really cool characters, is about prejudice and finding out what is right and wrong by stepping in other people's shoes. In the human shoes, we can easily relate because we don't understand mutants and are afraid that these mutants will be like Magneto and want us dead.  As Magneto, we understand his anger because humans hate mutants, they want mutants dead so why not kill them first.  In Xavier's shoes however, there's the hope that we can all live in peace.  That yes, they might want us dead, but we shouldn't have to kill them first in order to stop them from wanting to kill us, we should invest our time in trying to get them to understand.  And that's why the X-Men are the heroes.  However, X-Men the movie is too much just about cool characters, when it needed to be more about great story telling.<br/><br/>Now that the characters are introduced, let's hope the sequel will reach the potential a X-Men story can become.<br/><br/>****** out of 10."

","My primary concern was whether they would be able to properly recreate all of the very defined characters.  This they did with an ""Uncanny"" ability. I was very pleased to see that they had such a great screenplay for the movie. I was worried that it would be watered down for the kiddies, but it still had a bad-arse attitude that was great to see.  The special effects were wonderful.

","After being a collector of the Uncanny Xmen comics for 20 years, (picking up my first copy when I was 14) I can describe the first full length Xmen movie as ""FANTASTIC""! I know that the events of the movie are different to the true origins of the Xmen but to try and condense the entire comic 25 year plus Xmen history with all its diverse characters into a 90 minute believable movie is impossible. Thankfully this movie has portrayed as closely to the origins as I think they possibly can with the characters that have been used. It was totally enthralling to see other comic book characters like Shadowcat, Iceman, Moonstar, Jubilee and was that Johnny Storm of the fantastic four (all in professor X's office when Wolverine bursts in), come to life and look positively ""Human"". I wait to get this movie on DVD."

","With the auspicious arrival of the new X-Men film, things are looking up for the comic book world in its increasingly unpropitious history at the movies. Joining Donner's Superman and Burton's Batman on the shortlist of truly fine comic book adaptations, X-Men looks to become the next major franchise. (Hopefully, it will fare better in the sequel department than the other aforementioned Warner Bros franchises.)<br/><br/>Though Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan may have lead billing as far as the credits are concerned, this film really belongs to Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, as fan favorites Wolverine and Rogue, respectively. Though Stewart (Professor Charles Xavier) and McKellan (Xavier's old friend-turned-nemesis Magneto) form the intellectual core of the film, the emotional aspect, the connection to the audience, is conducted by Paquin's sense of alienation, her growing fondness for Wolverine, and his developing friendship for his new, young charge. <br/><br/>Much praise will be heaped on Jackman for his portrayal of Wolverine, but kudos must also go to James Marsden (Cyclops) and Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), for it is their by-play and chemistry that gives Jackman his best and most memorable moments. Had they not played so well off Jackman, Wolverine would not have come off so well as he does.<br/><br/>How does the rest of the cast fare? Halle Berry (Storm) is the only X-Men to stand unconvincing in her role. Although it's not entirely her fault: she is simply given very little to do, and as a result fails to convince the audience of her capabilities. Marsden and Janssen are good in their roles, but more time should have been spent on showing us that they are in fact a couple. We are told that they are, but we never see it. Considering that much of the mood of the film and is derived from the triangle of Cyclops, Grey and Wolverine, it would have been nice to have been provided a glimpse into their private life.<br/><br/>The only big failing is the score by Michael Kamen, which falls flat on its face. It's not merely inadequate; it's just plain bad. Had a good composer been brought in who could have developed motifs for the important characters, such as Rogue, Wolverine, Professor X and Magneto, things would have been considerably improved. Just a few notes would have been enough; somewhere between three- and seven-note combinations, to connect the audience sonically to the characters.<br/><br/>Still, I highly recommend the film, and not just to fans of the comics. I think non-fans, people who've never even heard of the comic let alone picked up an issue, will enjoy it just as much. On a scale of 1-10, X-Men gets an 8."

","I loved this film so much I saw it twice the weekend that it opened; I understand that alot of the people who are ""die-hard"" comic fans will nit-pick it until they turn blue in the face, but as a fan of the cartoon, with some other comic knowledge of the X-men, the changes/alterations that they made I think were appropriate (after all, most comic book story lines to alter depending on the new writer, and the interpretation to fit the story-look at the batman movies vs. The Dark Knight vs. Batman the animated series and, oh yeah, Adam West) As for everyone's complaints about Rogue: she was young (but not too young)she can't be flirty as she usually is until she's comfortable with herself (which was hinted at in the end) Anna Paquin was great, a helluva lot better than I had dreamed (as were Hugh Jackman and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, though she didn't talk much)and she's not super strong or able to fly until she sucks the powers out of another mutant whose powers permanently stay with her (originally, Rogue was bad and she killed Ms. Marvel, who had these powers, as I understand it)And everyone else was great. Jean Grey and Cyclops were always a little boring for me, so it fit. (that is, until the whole Phoenix thing) And Iceman will be back in full force by the next one, I'm sure (as will probably Jubilee)  I did love it. My fave of the summer...so far.

","I have been an X-Fan (although I've been out of the comic game for some time now) for years, and I join the legions of my ilk that claim to have been waiting for this 10 years or longer. This is no exaggeration. Hailing back to the days of yore, when Wizard was but a young magazine, posting a fantasy Casting Call for the then-impossible X-Movie (a cast which I believe included Alan Rickman as Magneto), fans have been chomping at the bit for any sliver of information that was in existence. For years, the loyal waited in the wings, watching in silent horror as the project was scrapped not once, but twice.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the film has indeed arrived, poised to satiate the literally millions of fans out there. What was the end result? We'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>The superhero genre has experienced a bit of a quagmire as of late, with wretched entries like ""Steel"" and ""Batman and Robin"" (Note: Joel Schumacher should be publicly whipped). Ever since the release of ""Batman Forever"", the genre has been on a general down swing. I'm not saying that they were all that good to begin with, but let's face the facts. Since the release of said Batman film, the awful PG-13 rated ""Spawn"", and terribly acted ""Blade"" have been the high points in the superhero world. ""Batman and Robin"" was simply the final straw. The superhero genre was dying. It needed a hero of it's own to save it.<br/><br/>Enter ""X-Men"". No adulation, no zealotry to mask this opinion: ""X-Men"" is amazing. Finally, someone figured out that it is not special effects and one-liners that make for good film. The secret lies in ACTING. ""X-Men"", while remaining letter perfect to the mannerisms and behavior patterns of the characters, removes the painfully unbelievable aspects of the comic, while retaining the same overall feeling.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart, the man born to play Charles Xavier, delivers a predictably wonderful performance as the old Prof, displaying all the aspects necessary to his character. Ian McKellen, who I admit would not have been my first choice (although it is now), plays the PERFECT Magneto. Cyclops (James Mardsen) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) fit in to the puzzle naturally, and play their roles to a tee. Ray Park (martial arts master best known as Darth Maul) is actually given a chance to act as Toad, and through his limited lines, he does very well, adding a bit of wicked comedy to the script. The most improved character is definitely Rogue, who always annoyed me in any other incarnation. Anna Paquin shows off some of that Oscar winning charm as a young Rogue, and displays the hopelessness of her situation in an almost heart-wrenching way (not quite your typical superhero scenario, eh?).<br/><br/>But (here it comes), no one stands out more than Hugh Jackman. One statement, if I may: Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine. Can you believe they found this guy doing Off Broadway in Canada? He was cast as the MOST DIFFICULT ROLE in the MOST POPULAR COMIC BOOK ADAPTATION EVER. Fanboys were screaming for blood when they saw the first publicity shots. Where are they now? Shelling out eight bucks to see him in action again.<br/><br/>In closing, ""X-Men"", while admittedly imperfect, is the model by which all superhero films should be made. Studios with films of this genre slated ""In Production"" should be lining up to kiss Bryan Singer's feet. Go see this film. You owe it to yourself."

","Perhaps one need have at least a casual familiarity with the comic book to enjoy this movie as much as the vast majority of the posted reviewers. The movie was mildly interesting, if only in anticipation of which novel mutation would be next tossed our way. On that note, I must say I was left teased and unfulfilled. I didn't think the mutations rose even to the level of interesting. And maybe I am myopic to the subtle nuances of her predicament, but Anna Paquin's rather one-dimensional performance as Rogue left me with not much more than a lingering feeling of pity that she got gipped in the mutation lottery.<br/><br/>Special mention must go to Hugh Jackman who is poised to be the Greg Evigan of his generation. There was also a moment at the beginning when I wondered how David Cassidy got onto this picture. To give Jackman his due, he has at least the charisma of the two combined. He even gets to deliver the film's funniest line when asked to prove that he is, in fact, himself and not some pale (blue) imitation.  And I'm sure I'll tune in to discover which malevolent would-be emperor of the mutant underworld is responsible for Wolverine's radical prosthetic implantation, although I must say I feel a bit manipulated into waiting for a sequel. I would have been much happier if they added another forty-five minutes to the flick and put that baby to bed.<br/><br/>Of course it has been mentioned that Halle Barry's (talents?) were totally wasted. She emoted like one under the influence of prescription analgesics. Claudia Schiffer artfully embodied the rage that could only come from the merciless schoolyard taunting that certainly accompanied her cyanotic complexion and garish engraving work. [Imagine the agonizing choice of being yourself, a blue freak, or looking exactly like one of the other kids you're playing with. Sad. I felt her pain.] Famke Janssen was beautiful as ever. And that Cyclops dude was not nearly as annoying as he could have been. Sir Ian and Mr. Stewart were adequate to the task they were asked to perform. I don't forsee any academy award nods in their immediate future unless they have some stellar projects in the works.<br/><br/>All in all, it was a mildly enjoyable, if uninspired ride.

","This movie does what has almost never been done before and actually doesn't insult the fans of the comic on which the movie is based upon.  It is also probably the only movie I've seen based on a comic which actually treats its source material with respect.  The relationship between Logan and Jubilee is modified to that between him and Rogue but captures the essence.  The mysterious past of Wolverine is discussed and left open to be discovered in sequels which is one sure way to know that people will come to the sequel, as if they wouldn't otherwise!  The tender love triangle is examined between Wolverine, Jean Grey and Cyclops.  Plus, I too have always thought that Cyclops was a dick, hence whenever Wolverine ripped on him, I was delighted. Speaking of Wolverine, Jackman, after this movie IS Wolverine!! Wolverine was to me, like many others, the coolest and most interesting mutant and Singer wisely chooses to give him and his character due weightage. Jackman nails the character in every way possible.  He looks the part of the feral mutant with mutant healing power, nearly unbreakable adamantium claws, often uncontrollable rage and an attitude that's unmatched!  He even manages to sneak in a ""bub""!!  He also brings genuine pathos in a few scenes that flesh his character beautifully, thus wonderfully bringing life to this character in minutes what took years for Marvel writers to build on in the comics. That said, Patrick Stewart was also born to play Prof X and McKellan was surprisingly perfect as Magneto.  In fact, I felt they got most, if not all of the casting right.  Paquin brings the right amount of vulnerability to her character, thus showing it may not necessarily be a gift to be a mutant. The fight scenes were nicely staged and especially the climactic battle was AWESOME!!  It really reminded you of the fights in the comics between the brotherhood and the X-Men.  I didn't really care much about Storm as some other fans here, I thought Halle did a good enough job and the wig wasn't so bad.  But they could've added a fight or two or at least more scenes between Logan and Sabretooth, which would've kicked ass!  These two have a long and legendary rivalry in the comics and should've been explored more in the movie.  Their fights have made some of the best episodes in the X-Men saga. I think Sabretooth, having similar healing powers as Logan, may return in the sequel.  Really, don't be surprised to see more than one villain from this movie mysteriously return in the sequels.  I could gush about this movie forever.  I was an X-Men fan and I was very happy with the way they made this movie.  The only possible complaints from me, it ended too soon! I'll tell you, when the sequel comes out, I'll be there, and I suspect I am not alone in feeling like this.  Go see it, 10/10!"

He is a superb actor (in for a Knighting I think) and puts the movie right at the top.

Bryan Singer deserves accolades for this great movie.  Also making a strong showing was Hollywood newcomer, Hugh Jackman.  I read or heard somewhere that he was chosen partly on the basis of his chemistry with Anna Panquin and I have to agree.  The scenes between the two are extremely believable and very moving.  Also, he did a perfect Wolverine.  All parts of his acting were perfect, the sound of his breathing when he was under stress, his way of moving, the tone of his voice.  Excellent. The movie also had just the right touch of humor (not too much, not too little).  The action scenes were excellent, though I wish Ray Parks had more latitude for his particular physical talents.  I understand why they didn't -- they were keeping with the character's abilities, but one scene reminded me so much of his Darth Maul, I actually felt like watching Phantom Menace again.  Yikes!

","I was not an active reader of the X men comic, and I am no expert on the characters. I found the movie to be more enjoyable than I expected, but it lacked the epic quality one associates with these types of films. For example: the scenes at the Statue of Liberty were very modest--not as spectacular as they could have or should have been. It was very claustrophobic--much like a tv movie of the week on Fox.<br/><br/>In fact--that is what this movie seemed to be: made for television. It is unfortunate that Fox not only slashed the budget on this film, but also forced the filmmakers into a summer rather than Xmas release.<br/><br/>As for the plot, without revealing too much, I will only say that the threat of mutant registration came across as rather lame. Could this idea have come about because of the budget restrictions? I would have preferred something more grand--like legislation to allow the military to use a virus to seek out and neutralize mutants. Now that would have been a threat--and Magneto's response in the film would have been more understandable. Furthermore--the Nazis are featured early in the film. This sequence was truly dead weight. It was jarring and not as relevant to the story as some may suggest. It would have been cheaper and more effective to have Magneto talk about his childhood when he is facing Xavier--or Senator Kelly. <br/><br/>On the plus side--Sterwart and Mclellan did the best they could with their roles, but the real stars were Jackman and Paquin. They brought some emotional power to this flick--while the rest of the cast were not well developed.<br/><br/>I understand that there were scenes removed from this film to cut the running time down--perhaps they would have improved the film, but not enough I suspect. I certainly did not find this film to be as disappointing as Batman, but it didnt soar like Superman either."

There were a few things that weren't totally true to the comic books(like Rogue being so young and Sabretooth being so stupid and monosyllabic)but I gradually acccepted this. The casting I have to say was good. Patrick Stewart IS Proffesor Xavier and Hugh Jackman portrays Wolverine perfectly and shows us that he does have a heart(and that Australian's can act)James Marsden looks good as Cyclops, although I have a problem with DR(?)Jean Grey(I think this is due to the fact that Beast didn't make it to the final cut and they needed that ""Dr"" element in there)Halle Berry was good as Storm, but didn't have much to do (besides kick evil mutant butt).At first I have to say that Anna Paquin was not in my list of choices to be cast as Rogue but she does a good here of showing us a young Rogue before she became what she is now. On the evil mutant side Ian McKellen is fantastic as Magneto and shows us how powerful he really is. Ray Park is good as Toad although the character was TOTALLY different from the original but I don't care because the original was SO lame. Rebbeca Romjin-Stamos looked so incredible as Mystique but why did she only get one line in the WHOLE movie? There was also a slight change in her costume(she was never naked in the comics). Finally Tyler Mane as Sabretooth. Good casting, not so good transition of character from comic book to big screen. I mean Sabretooth is supposed to look like an animal. Instead here he looks like a man with a bad facial hair problem. And whats with the costume? Did he rob a second hand clothes store? Also Sabretooth is supposed to be Wolverine's opposite. He's supposed to be cunning, homicidal and extremely psychotic. Yet here he nothing more than a big dumb sidekick to Magneto. He doesn't sound or even look scary in this movie. Plus his fight with Wolverine should have been MUCH longer than 2 minutes.

But Jackman is excellent, and Paquin does a<br/><br/>great job with Rogue. A good film, could have been a great one."

It's the unknown actors that stand out and give the best performances, and Ian always makes a good bad guy. Maybe if film was longer, they might have fleshed out the characters more, or make you feel for the more, but hopefully the next one will fill any plot holes and give the stars more to do.<br/><br/>Oh yea, lets have Gambit in the next one.

Apparently you were so caught up in the hype that you forgot what the movie was really about: a group of people who fight the good fight in a world that would rather want them killed.  My hat tips Bryan Singer and the players (especially Patrick Stewart and Hugh Jackman) for taking the original premise of the X-Men comic and running with it.  The special effects are nothing but perfect.  <br/><br/>Bottom line: If you are still finding this film unfulfilling, then maybe you should see it again with a more watchful eye."

","One of my major concerns before I saw the movie was whether or not they could do Wolverine right.  Lets face it, he is the X-men and one of the major reasons the X-men has been so popular over the years.  I am happy to say that not only were they true to his character but they were also true to Storm, Jean Grey, Professor X, Mageto, Sabertooth, Mystic and Toad.  Rogue was a disappointment, but luckily she was played very well by Anna Paquin. I only say she was disappointment is because they weren't true to her powers or personality.  True, in the movie was able to steal the powers of other Mutants, but in the comic she can also fly and is very strong.  In the movie she was the damsel in distress most of the time.  Hopefully they'll fix that in the sequel.<br/><br/>All in all, I would highly recommend this movie to anyone, not just comic book fans.  There are many touching moments between Rogue and Wolverine. Some great one liners, and several intense action scene's loaded with great special effects.  Is X-men perfect?  No. (They never explain why Rogue travels to the north before meeting Wolverine)  Is it fun?  Yes.  Should you see it?  Absolutely."

","When I went to see X-Men, I wasn't sure what to expect. I knew it would be great looking, with great effects, and it certainly was. But I didn't know what to expect after that. I was very pleasantly surprised. This is one of the first action movies in a while that has actually had a point to it. In some parts of the movie, it was closer to a drama. It gives us a message of how prejudice affects our world. Although mutants are the target of prejudice in the movie, the message can be applied to any group of people that has ever been in the same situation. Hopefully people who see X-Men will get that message, instead of concentrating solely on the visual appeal, which there is a lot of.<br/><br/>The two main mutants in the film are Wolverine and Rogue (Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, both do incredible jobs). Instead of just showing them killing the bad guys like typical summer action movie fare, Brian Singer (the director...another amazing job) focuses on their pasts, showing us how they ended up like they were. He does a great job at this, he can really make you feel emotion for the characters (another uncommon thing in action movies).<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is good as well. Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier...leader of the X-Men) and Ian McKellan (Magneto, leader of the bad group of mutants) are especially good. I was surprised by Rebecca Romijn-Stamos' performance as Mystique (another bad one). Although she didn't have many lines, I still thought she did a very good job. Surprising, considering how most models do in movies. I'd like to see more from her, provided she can stay out of typical model roles (i.e. Bond girl). The one weak spot is Tyler Mane as Sabretooth, but it's a pretty small part, so it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>You don't have to be a comic book fan to enjoy this movie. I've never read X-Men, and I enjoyed the movie immensely, and it made perfect sense to me. It offers so much more than a typical action movie. It has a well thought-out plot, which may not seem like a big deal, but not too many big-budget action movies do that anymore (M:I-2...). I highly recommend this movie. Even if you don't typically like action movie, X-Men has a much deeper plot, much more heart, and is just a great movie overall.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10"

It focused on my two least favorite X-characters, Rogue and Wolverine, and we didn't get to see Magneto really hurt Wolvie, unfortunately... but I still enjoyed it.  Those who said James Marsden's Cyclops was 'wooden' seem to think that's a bad thing -- Cyclops, while one of my favorite X-men, has ALWAYS been very stiff, at least in my mind... Overall, the only character who I felt was portrayed badly was Storm, who should've been more imposing, IMHO. <br/><br/>
Did Professor X say these were his original students?  I thought he said they were 'some of the first,' meaning that it's possible that Storm wasn't with the rest of the group...

","When the sequel to this movie comes out (and it inevitably will, since the end of the film left it set up for that eventuality) please will someone beat me on the topside of my head if I ever even consider wasting my time and money and going to see it?!<br/><br/>I must start by saying that I am not a comic book fan, I am a MOVIE fan. Therefore, I have nothing to base whether this depicts the comic correctly, if it's true to the characters or much of the other debate that seems to be prevalent in these critiques.  I went in there solely for sci-fi film entertainment and was hoping (expecting really) to see something on the calibre of last year's masterpiece ""The Matrix"", because of all the hype and great reviews.  What a disappointment!<br/><br/>In my opinion, the characters were not interesting or developed enough to care about, the sets were typical, the costumes were unimaginative and the special effects were, well, can we just say, ""Seen it, done it""?  The only thing that I could say was outstanding was sound effects.<br/><br/>
My friend that saw this movie with me said it was the worst movie that she had EVER seen...well, I can't be quite that harsh, but I only gave it a 5 and I would not recommend this movie to anyone. <br/><br/>I am basically dismayed about the lack of original films to come out this year.

","STORY X-Men is a science fiction action film which takes place in the near future. The human race is evolving at an accelerated rate.  At random, people are born `mutants' with extraordinary powers ranging from heightened psychic senses to animal like abilities.  Because some mutants have potentially dangerous powers, a political battle rages over what precautionary steps the government should take to safe guard normal civilians against mutants.<br/><br/>The good guys are the X-Men, a team led by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart, famous for his role as Captain Jean Luc Pickard).  Xavier also heads a school where young mutants learn to control their powers.  The film eludes to a long standing friendship between Xavier and Magneto, who are still friends despite their opposing goals.  Magneto believes that the human race should be conquered by the genetically superior mutants.  Xavier believes that the two should work to co-exist peacefully, despite the personal and political bigotry most men show towards mutants.  Unlike many other generic super hero films, X-Men has plenty of content.  There is obviously much more story to tell both in the past and the future, than what has been shown in this film.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS The bad guy, Magneto, wishes to destroy the human race.  He is a mutant with the ability to create magnetic fields, and thus has a seemingly telekinetic influence over all metal objects.  Aiding him are henchmen Mystique, Toad, and Sabertooth.  Mystique is a doppelganger played by Rebbecca Romijin-Stamos.  I have to wonder why a super-model was cast into the character whose face and body are never seen, as Mystique frequently shape shifts from her original form, which resembles a blue alien.   Toad is played by Ray Park, famous for his role as Darth Maul.  Disappointingly his role is very small (again), although his incredible martial arts skills stand out in the few moments he has onscreen.  Sabertooth is played by professional wrestler Tyler Mane, whom I am not familiar with yet he plays his simple role of dumb henchmen perfectly.<br/><br/>The X-Men include already mentioned Professor Charles Xavier, who can control the minds of others, and is farsighted through clairvoyance.  At his side is apprentice Jean Grey with, among other psychic powers, telekinesis. Jean Grey is the girlfriend of Cyclops, who can shoot laser beams from his eyes.  Cyclops is at ends with Wolverine, who take a liking to his girlfriend.  Wolverine has indestructible claws build into his metal skeleton, and regenerates his wounds faster than most bad guys can dish 'em out.  Rounding out the team is, Halle Berry playing Storm, who can control the weather.  Finally there is Rogue, who has the most crippling and unique power. She can absorb the life force and mutant powers of others by touching them.<br/><br/>OVERALL This film of course is based upon the poplar comic book of the same name. Portraying a comic book on film always requires careful direction.  Most comic book characters wear outrageously unrealistic costumes (Spawn), and perform surreal actions nearly impossible to translate into reality on the silver screen.  X-Men however handles these problems perfectly.  Costumes are never over done (characters even joke about this), and superb special effects make the plot progress very fluidly throughout even the most unrealistic comic book scenarios (although I've heard several people claim they could see a string attached to Toad at one point).<br/><br/>All things considered this is a good film.  Great casting and action combined with a bold story and top notch special effects all work to bring this film together.  Thumbs up and four stars!"

","Sorry, but after reading some of the moronic posts, I had to go through the work of registering to post some of my thoughts.<br/><br/>First of all, several people said this was the best comic book movie since Superman or Batman, but definitely not Matrix 2... Did you people know that The Matrix was also a comic book?<br/><br/>Secondly, I am not a huge fan of the comic book and only an avid watcher of the cartoon, but some statements in here have been bewildering... First of all, someone said the characters were younger than in the comic... What, did you think they were born adults? Second, Jean Gray is a Dr. I realize Marvels multi-faceted fronts to the story line can be confusing for anyone, but this is pretty basic to the whole reality... Thirdly, I saw a comment about how Rogue did not fly. Rogue's flying ability came later due to draining a person that mysteriously endowed her with that persons powers forever. Also, her relationship to Mystique is only a vague intimation, not proven fact. Rogue has never remembered any of it.... And finally, Scott and Jean Gray's relationship was not fiery on screen, as some of you have lamented, but this aspect was perfectly in line with the early story, something that had to kill the Hollywood producers....<br/><br/>All in all I think Hollywood did a commendable job on not being itself in this movie, much better than slew of earlier flicks. I only hope the sequels don't run into the ground, like Batman..."

","I've been waiting for this movie for a long time.  The casting was good, the director was good - I honestly thought this would be a great flick.<br/><br/>I'm up to seeing M:I-2 again and skipping going to X-Men a second time.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer drops the ball royally on this one - this movie lacks any knowledge or forethought of the subject.  I honestly think he did a major disservice to the X-Men.  He had a chance to clean the mythos up and give us something more compact and streamlined.<br/><br/>I would rather read post-Claremont issues than think this was a good representation of the X-Men.  My issues are (SPOILER ALERT):<br/><br/>1) Kelly and Gyrich are dead - and we see Gyrich for a whole twenty seconds. One of the better X-Men antagonists, and Singer dumps him.  All the hype about Kelly is useless - Singer goes nowhere with Kelly and doesn't leave him for future projects.<br/><br/>2) Cyclops is like cardboard on a stick, and just as painful to look at. He was horribly represented.<br/><br/>3) Would Storm freak out due to a human being turning into water?  No, I think not.  Her character was not pulled off very well at all - I think Storm would be much more graceful.<br/><br/>4) Iceman is a teenager?  Why?  What possible good did that do?  His character could have just as easily been Sunspot or Cannonball or Jubilee or some off-the-shelf kid.  They wasted Iceman.<br/><br/>5) Why did Toad have to do the Darth Maul move?  Sure, it's cute, but was it really needed?  Why not just decapitate him while on a horse while we're at it?  I lost any interest in him at that point...<br/><br/>6) Obviously Sabretooth is not the foe we would expect for Wolverine.  I wanted some idea that Creed knew who Logan was - and I got nothing.  He was about as useful as Bane in Batman and Robin.<br/><br/>I could go on, but I won't.  Needless to say, if you need to see this movie, wait until it hits the $1.00 theater.<br/><br/>Now I'm off to see Chicken Run again."

Ray Park, who had, like, one line ""Hey, quit playin around!"", was fantastic as his Spider-man esque amphibious mutant.<br/><br/>Mystique also had one line ""You're the reason why I was afraid to go school as a girl!"", did remarkably well.

","This movie is great for fans of the series and comic book.   And for people who have not seen it yet will like it more.  That's right, I think that if you do not know anything about the X-Men I think you will enjoy this movie a lot more.  I've been a fan of the comic for more years than I can remember and have always watched the cartoon.  And I think I like them slightly better.  It's the fact that there were changes to the character that I did not like, Wolverine for example, was portrayed as a weaker person than he really is, and his fighting ability, come on, he was getting the crap kicked out of him by many people.  In the comic's he is trained in about every form of fighting you can think of.  Plus Sabertooth is the same as Wolverine and the two of them have a very important past together, in the movie they did not know each other.  The list could go on but would you really want to read it?  Don't get me wrong, I loved the movie and intend on buying it on DVD right when it comes out.  But I would have liked to see more development of the characters."
"Foopy-2","7","0","0","14 July 2000"," Excellent for what it's trying to accomplish
","I think that the problem with making a feature-length feature of the X-Men is that the X-Men are an ensemble cast.  Instead of only really having one or two main protagonists to develop, as is the case with most comic-book movies like Batman and Superman, this film has to develop an enormous number of characters.  For the 1 1/2 hours that the movie runs, I think it does as good a job as it could in developing the characters that it chooses to depict from the comic book series.  The adaptations of the characters are well placed into ""the real world"" of live-action film; they're not these spandex-clad commandos where every one of them knows some sort of martial art and has bulging muscles.  In fact, they're more or less normal people who are different from us only because of their mutant abilities.  That makes them much easier to relate to for a live-action film and also makes the premise of the X-Men much more believable in a real-world context.<br/><br/>Altogether, I do wish I could have gotten to know the characters a little better, but there's only so much you can tell about so many characters in just an hour and a half; I guess I wish the film was a bit longer and had a little more character development.  As it is, though, the movie is one of the best comic book adaptations I've ever seen; the action is good, the characters well-done, and the dialogue is very effective, funny, and doesn't insult the intelligence.  Also, the issue of Mutant persecution, particularly its relationship with the Holocaust, is executed very well, although it would've been nice if Magneto wasn't so vilified and if his side of the story was sympathized with a little more.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a very enjoyable movie.  Congratulations to Bryan Singer and his team for making a great film!"
"wyeth-2","Null","0","0","19 July 2000"," Entirely mediocre
","Could this be the best comic adaptation yet?  Perhaps, but only because of the abysmal quality of previous superhero movies.  You don't have to do much to exceed Batman (a fat Joker lip-synching Prince songs?  C'mon, someone somewhere along the line should have realized that was a bad idea.  Of course, the audience ate it up, so I guess I expect too much from Americans), not to mention the Shadow, the Punisher, the Phantom, et al. Superman is the only one that comes to mind that might rival X-Men, and most would probably disagree there.<br/><br/>That said, X-Men is triumphant in it's mediocrity; I didn't hate myself for wasting time and money on it, like I did with the others, and it doesn't totally destroy the legends it presents (see Warren Beatty's ego-trip Dick Tracy if you want to see a legend turned into crap).  The jokes, while awful, are mercifully few (and had the geniuses in the theater laughing, so there I go again).<br/><br/>Still, as a fan of the comic and a student of film, I think much better could have been done.  Cyclops is not pretty enough to warrant hiring one so utterly devoid of talent.  Storm was equally deadpan, and a waste of time. How can you care about someone that boring?  Did I mention boring?  That word fits Xavier, Rogue and all the villains, as well.  Wolverine, while quite capably played by Hugh Jackman, was far too nice (not to mention TALL).  The film makers seemed to have realized that they didn't have time to make you like him if he started out as a jerk, so they made him seem like one for all of about 2 minutes, at which point he becomes a big softy.<br/><br/>One of two things could have been done to make this film better; take the time develop the characters better, or take the time to develop a strong plot.  Neither was done, and it shows."
"JDinSeattle","9","0","0","19 July 2000"," An excellent adaptation of one of the most important comics ever created.
","This movie was great. It had everything in the right place to keep the story moving. You learn early on the two edged sword of the mutations, the mutants are born with a curse as well as a blessing. The tagline, ""Protecting Those Who Fear Them"" explains the core of the movie. Everyone has been at a point in their life when they wonder who they are, what their destiny is, and where they fit in the big picture, this movie taps into those feelings perfectly and provides a great action story as well. My only disappointment is the obvious over-editing of the theatre cut. There was almost 45 minutes chopped out of the movie to slim it down to the 1 hr 44 minutes we see at the theatre. I have a hunch that the bosses at Fox were responsible for this, they wanted all that pesky character development thrown out so the action scenes would completely dominate the film. Those not familiar with the comic may feel overwhelmed as the different characters fly in and out of scene after scene. The powers that be at Fox should have pushed the movie over the 2 hour mark, I think that would have added enough dramatic content to bring more non-X-men fans into the fold. The critics are being very harsh on this film, pointing out the opening scene as too dark for a comic book movie and one even pointing out that the ability to controls the weather isn't a mutation it's a miracle. Well folks it's still a comic book, a fantasy, judging it as anything else is doing yourself and your readers a disservice. More films are sure to be made and will undoubtedly be as successful if not more so. They should stay with the same director and not pass the job to a Joel Schumacher type to turn it into an abomination like the last two Batman films."

X-men is different.<br/><br/>The producer/director took such care, and the actors (especially Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin and Hugh Jackman) played their characters with such respect and dignity that the end result is quite satisfying and rewarding, not at all campy, cheesy or just plain stupid (note to the Batman movie franchise: learn form the X-men).<br/><br/>I can't say enough about the casting. The pairing of McKellen and Stewart was an excellent move, and wow what about Hugh Jackman! I've heard about hime before, but am totally amazed by his acting capabilities.<br/><br/>I have a couple of gripes though. The movie is too short! And Halle Berry wasn't that good.<br/><br/>well that's all, I give it 9 out of 10."

","I think this is a near perfect adaption of a comic book to film.  Kudos to the cast & crew for pulling together & creating this masterpiece.  I could not be more pleased with the film.  Yes it could have had a better score and been about 2-3 hours longer, but those are minor issues.  I can not wait for the sequel!  This has become the new benchmark for comic book adaptions.

","After 10 long years, it's finally here! I've been reading the comics and in 2nd grade, I've heard the rumors about the movie. At the time, Arnold Schwarzenegger was rumored to be in it. Now finally after many years of waiting (Yes I'm gonna be a senior in high school this upcoming school year), I finally saw it. Actually saw it Wednesday at a special screening for free, and I must say, it would've been worth full price. This is, probably without a doubt, my favorite comic book adapted movie, yes better than Batman. It's that good. I never wanted the dazzling special effects and fun to end. But unfortunately it had to, but the good thing is, there is most likely a sequel coming up, and I guarantee you I will be there. I'm ready to see this movie again."
"doug_burton","8","0","0","20 July 2000"," Great adaptation of the comic book
","While some may fault this movie for not being 100% faithful to the continuity of the comic book, it is without a doubt the best adaptation to film of any comic, including Tim Burton's Batman movies.  Fast-paced yet remarkably easy to follow, even for non-comic fans, the movie conveys all the information necessary to understand the who and the what without becoming bogged down in exposition.<br/><br/>Casting in this film was well-done, with a few strokes of luck (in particular, having Hugh Jackman take the place of Dougray Scott actually worked out for the better, given Scott's performance in M:I-2)  Patrick Stewart was perfect as Professor Xavier, as was Ian McKellan as Magneto. What I particularly enjoyed was the on-screen relationship between these two former-friends-now-enemies, which was carried off beautifully by these two fine actors.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast performed well, and the cameos by various other mutants at Xavier's school (""Mutant High"") was fun. From a continuity perspective, several things about the school didn't make much sense -- Bobby ""Iceman"" Drake was far too young, and Xavier listing Storm as one of his original recruits was also incorrect (the original team consisted of Iceman, Cyclops, Jean Grey, the Beast, and Angel, whereas Storm didn't join the team until the revamp that added Wolverine, Nightcrawler, Colossus and others in the late 70's, in Giant-sized X-men #1.)  However, this is a minor nit to pick, one that would not be noticed by most non-fans and which does not detract from the movie in the least.<br/><br/>The door is obviously left open for more stories, and hopefully the movie will be successful enough to justify more.<br/><br/>My one quibble is that the movie seemed a little on the short side (running time was 95 minutes.)  Several scenes felt rushed, in particular Jean Gray's speech at the beginning. However, more exposition might have slowed down the movie too much, which would also have generated complaints.  As it is, we have a fine action film which serves to introduce the X-men to the non-comic-fan audience, and that's a very good thing indeed.<br/><br/>Rating: 8 out of 10"
"nameksei","6","0","0","19 July 2000"," Fun but not great
","I was looking forward to seeing X-Men not because I expected an excellent movie.  In fact, I wasn't sure and didn't really care either way as to whether it was good or bad; it just looked fun.  I've never been a huge X-Men fan, but I'm familiar with most of the characters and major plot points since I used to read American Comics a while back.  With most comic book movies being really bad, I didn't have very high expectations for X-Men.  I'm glad I didn't.  Otherwise I might have been disappointed.<br/><br/>As far as just being a ton of fun to watch, X-Men doesn't disappoint. There's some great visuals and direction, and then there's also some cheesy stuff.  I supposed I'll talk about visuals first.  The special fx weren't too bad, but it looked like they needed a higher budget.  Some of them were really cool.  The wind effects of Storm and Cyclops's optic blast were cool, as well as some of the other mutant power stuff. I was skeptical of Mystique's look at first, but I found that I really liked it in the movie. But any scene with characters flying just looked cheesy and rigged, and the statue of liberty fight scene was just...weird.  The slo mo just didn't work in that context.<br/><br/>As far as the characters go, the ones that were focused on were in character and looked pretty good.  Wolverine was great, and I ended up liking him more than I ever did in the comics for some reason.  Cyclops was the dork that he is, and of course Professor X and Magneto were well done.  Rogue was ok, despite the fact that she was much younger than X-Men fans are used to.  But Storm just....did nothing.  She looked scared most of the movie, and she was way too much of a background character. (Although if they had concentrated too much on every character it would have been too loaded with complicated details and would clutter the story.) And she had the worst line of dialogue I've ever heard, which many people have already complained about.  That line was trying so hard to be cool that it just came out all wrong.  Sabertooth was pretty bad as well.  I'd have to say he was the worst.  I hated the lion roars and the fact that he barely spoke.  He wasn't all that savage either, and the whole Wolverine/Sabertooth rivalry thing was ignored in the movie. I realize that the movie was made for the masses and not just for X-Men and comic book fans, so they did a commendable job translating it even if it's missing details.<br/><br/>Oh, the soundtrack was just bad.<br/><br/>There's not much more I can think to say about this movie.  It was good for a comic book live action movie.  I still think the best medium for comic book movies would be animation, since the characters are drawn characters to begin with, but unfortunately mature cartoons don't go over too well in this country.  Despite the few problems the movie had, it was ok overall and I had a good time."

There were no cheesy lines, the costumes were cool (the spandex is fine in the comic books, but not on the big screen), no stupid effects with mutant powers. X-Men has been the subject of conversation all week at work and at home."
"JERIC0777","7","0","0","19 July 2000"," Better than I expected.
","I have been a fan of the X-MEN comic and cartoon for years and when I heard they were finally making the movie, I was kinda worried after seeing how disappointing some of the other comic book based movies came out. ><br/><br/>Well, I was pleasantly surprised at how well this movie turned out overall. I felt that they really got the main point of what X-MEN is about across to the audience.  Hopefully, with the sequel(s), there will be more character background now that the foundation is laid.<br/><br/>As for the acting, Hugh Jackman stole the show as Wolverine.  Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen(?) were both awesome as Professor X and Magneto. Famke Jansen and James Marston were pretty good in their roles as Jean Grey and Cyclops even though they had little to work with (although her hair should have been redder).  Anna Paquin was ok as Rogue.  She wasn't very good at a southern accent and it was gone by the end of the movie.<br/><br/>I don't know what they were thinking by having Halle Berry play Storm.  Like many other people, I had imagined Angela Bassett in that role. She is a superb actress and could easily convey the inner strength that Storm is supposed to have.  They could have at least had someone who looked a little more like the part like Vivica Fox or maybe Vanessa L. Williams (since Storm does have blue eyes when they are not all white).  And in this day of special effects and makeup, you would think that they could have made her hair look at least somewhat realistic.<br/><br/>Another thing I was somewhat disappointed with is how the female X-MEN were always either getting their butts kicked or being rescued, when one of the things that attracted me to the comic was the presence of strong female characters. I wonder how or if Rogue will have her other powers (she gets from Ms. Marvel in the comics) in the sequel.<br/><br/>As for the other villains, I felt they were all pretty good at playing their parts.  Although, out of all the villains in the comics, why Toad?<br/><br/>Some characters I would like to see in the sequel(s) are Nightcrawler, Psylocke (why not Tia Carrere), Gambit, Beast, and more of Kitty Pryde."

With dazzling special effects and a great storyline, this movie is the best of 2000! Hugh Jackman did a great job as playing Wolverine, and Anna Paquin did a pretty good job playing Rouge. Patrick Stewart was great as Professor Charles Xavier, and Halle Berry was unexpectedly (to me, anyways) great as Storm. I have been waiting for this movie for a while. Maybe even over a year.

","While I enjoyed this film and am mildly looking forward to the sequel(s) -- I am amazed by the ability of an average movie to receive such gushing reviews.  What has happened to us as moviegoers?? The action of the movie kept it moving along and held the audience. However, that wasn't entirely neccesary because the movie was predictable from start to finish!  The acting was all around good -- if not GREAT in places and parts (i.e. Patrick Stewart), and all the characters were at least interesting.  Nonetheless, the back-story to all of them was noticeably absent.  I had to wonder ""why?"", at times, did this particular mutant team up with Magneto or this one with Dr. Xavier.  Do they feel torn with the issues?  Do they have extreme loyalties to the person, or just to themselves?  Why did their ""powers"" develop as they did?  The scene in Washington D.C. at the begining of the film where the Senator makes a speech in the middle of a conference was as subtle and intelligent as, say, an orangutan using an adding machine.  The comparisons to Macarthyism and racial oppression were certainly appropriate -- but give the audience a LITTLE credit!  Sheesh! That said -- the movie was still worth the $5.25 I plunked down (matinee price), but not by much.  The feigned attempts at catchy one-liners were cute, but forgettable.  Obviously, the sequel(s) are already being written.....or even completed as the movie not only leaves several issues unresolved.....but hits the audience over the head with them as the movie ends.  Again -- this is unneccesary and only a plot device to make more money in the future -- not about good film-making.  Oh well.....it's not the first time thats been done and it definitely won't be the last, so I don't blame ""X-MEN"" for that. Final Verdict.....6.5 stars out of 10."
"batturtle","10","0","0","14 July 2000"," A big budget comic book movie that succeeds on all counts
","I'm an independent moviemaker in Canada that aspires to do big budget blockbuster summer movies. I'm also an avid comic book reader. But, I hate Marvel Comics & the X-Men. Have for ages. So I can't say I was exactly looking forward to this movie. And I never ever thought I'd LOVE this movie. Bryan Singer (who directed the also excellent ""Usual Suspects"") & his fellow X-Moviemakers did an amazing job translating these characters to the big screen. Relative newcomer Hugh Jackman gives what may end up being a breakthrough performance as Wolverine. Only die-hard X-Fans may be a bit upset by how some of the characters are adapted to their motion picture versions (Rogue is quite different than the sexy southern bell X-readers are probably used to). My favorite thing is that they didn't have a cheesy top 10 soundtrack to accompany the movie (as they did with Mi2 & other such summer fare). When a movie comes out that's based on something that's already beloved by a large # of fans (whether it's Hamlet, X-Files, Batman or Silence of the Lambs), the key is to appeal to the worshipers AND the people who've never heard of the thing before. Rarely does this succeed, but with X-Men, they pulled off a movie that should be enjoyable to both forms of viewers. I give it my highest possible recommendation. Go see it."

I grew up glued to X-Men books, (not the show - don't talk to me about the show) and have awaited this cinematic moment all my life.<br/><br/>I think it was a really decent portrayal of what I, and many geeks like me, already loved.  In that respect it made the cut.  I don't think anyone expected it to be a brilliant take on an action comic, albeit an action comic with a little depth.<br/><br/>Most importantly, the acting was good.  Seeing Halle Berry, Ray Park, and Rebecca Romijn Stamos in the cast scared my pants off, but Patrick Stewart, (a dry performance, but adequate) Ian McKellan (a charming villain, I thought) and especially Hugh Jackman (great job, but a little more grit) made up for the somewhat below par cast.<br/><br/>I loved that Brian Singer was able to lend a tad of his dark and realism based style to this fantasy epic.  I thought he saw in the story what X-Men fans saw when reading the books: X-Men is real!  I wanted as sincere a treatment of the tale, and Singer did his best to provide it.<br/><br/>As a true blue fan, I am also not offended by editorial changes made to the characters and their powers.  Rogue went from a voluptious flying vixen to a tool in telling a good story.  Cyclops and Storm became minor characters to focus the movie on its most interesting parts.  I'm glad it wasn't bogged down with elements present only to satisfy those who prefer comics to movies, because it was a movie, after all.<br/><br/>I thought the little bit of humour near the end (Wolverine calling Cyclops a bad name) was needed and too rare, although the yellow spandex joke was a little too obvious a wink at the audience.  Oh, and by the way; did everyone notice Ray Park's stick twirling salute to Darth Maul?<br/><br/>Overall?  Go see it if you like sci-fi/fantasy/action and are not short on imagination.

","The biggest and most anticipated film of the summer is finally released.  For years, comic book fans have been waiting for big screen adaptations of Fantastic Four, Spider Man, and now finally released, X-MEN. And what can I say about X-MEN but not since DICK TRACY and the original BATMAN (1989) have I seen a fantastic and exciting film based on a comic book.  This movie is way better than SPAWN and BLADE, it does make the comic book film genre alive again for the new millennium. X-MEN focuses on two characters, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) also called Logan (love that name!!!) and Rogue (Anna Paquin). They discover that they are outcasts of society, called mutants.  Where Wolverine can heal his own wounds and have sharp claws come out of his fists, Rogue can feel other people's or mutants energy and power.  They are attacked by the powerful evil mutant Sabertooth (Tyler Mane) before they are rescued by Cyclops (James Marsden) and Storm (Halle Berry). Wolverine and Rogue are taken to a university for mutants led by Professor Charles Francis Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his assoicate Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen).  Professor X tells the two newcomers that their mutant powers can help protect society, a society that is afraid of them. However, evil Magneto (Ian McKellen) wishes to use his powers to destroy a society that betrayed him and his team including Sabertooth, Mystique (Rebecca Romijn Stamos) and Toad (Ray Park).  Together, the X-Men must stick together to save a society that fears them. I never did read any of the X-Men comics (I was more into the Dark Knight and Captain America).  But from watching this movie, I was very impressed!  There was non-stop action and excitement, and director Bryan Singer doesn't pull any punches with any corny plot, characters, or dialogue.  I was at first disappointed in it's 109 minute running time, but after watching the film, it's so fast paced, that there are no slow scenes. The acting by all of the cast members are great, with kudos going out to Anna Paquin as Rogue and newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  Although, most of the film centers around these two, they both did a great job with their characters, especially Jackman, he's a fantastic Wolverine! And support from McKellen, Stewart, Janssen, Berry, and Marsden also add flavor to the film.  That is why I enjoyed this movie, there is more than one character to enjoy.  Unlike the original BATMAN where the viewer was intrested in Batman and the Joker, there are so many characters to be engrossed with. And the directing is fantastic, from the tricky camera angles, to the fast pacing, Singer makes this film a true comic book film.  Puls I also enjoyed the special effects, the sets, costumes, and music by Michael Kamen. This is another eagerly awaited film, along with EPISODE I that delivers the goods, and then some.  It is action packed, you do see quite a few X-Men characters, and it is in a comic book style.  I highly enjoyed this film, and I'll be the first or one millionth person in line for the sequal.

"Zeratul-3","8","0","0","18 July 2000"," Hmmmm, not too disappointing...
","Well, I have waited, and it has come.  And, in my opinion, it's somewhere in the middle of the road.  Not the most amazing film of the new year, which I had hoped for, nor the phenomenal let-down that I had been expecting. Many of you will believe that I am grading the movie too harshly, but to all the hardcore fans out there, you will uderstand where I am coming from.<br/><br/>Wolverine was definitely good.  Even though he did not have as much, shall I say, grittiness and general tough guy attitude as the comics portray him, I believe that Hugh Jackman did an impressive job filling in his role's big shoes.  Patrick Stewart also did a great job, truly portraying Professor X. Magneto was a bit harder, as Ian McKellen did a good job of displaying the emotions and motivations behind Magneto, but he does lack the bit of muscle that the real Magneto possessed, making his costume make him appear as a somewhat frail old man in a rather unflattering suit.  I mean, the real Magneto was pretty jacked, but that is one detail I can do without.  Jean Grey, portrayed by Famke Janssen, was more or less nondescript, although she does look somewhat like what I would expect Jean Grey to appear as. Cyclops, on the other hand, was more or less cheesy.  Storm was the same, although at times Halle Berry was able to make her a bit less disappointing. Toad was a hit, even though he is WAY too strong for the little shrimp that he is (anyone who has read the comics knows).  I guess the choices of Sabertooth and Mystique were more or less based completely on looks, because the 2 didnt require any acting whatsoever.  It makes me wonder why they picked Rebecca Romijn Stamos...<br/><br/>I feel that the biggest problem was definitely the shortness of plot and the lack of characters.  To the Xmen newbie, this movie does seem great. However, it misses out on a lot of key characters.  Where is Gambit, Nightcrawler, Beast, Colossus, and Angel?  Rogue and Iceman are just teens, and will hopefully be able to appear in the coming sequel (if there is one...).  And the real lack of supervillains was definitely a let-down. They could've thrown in some more, even if they weren't part of the original story (I mean, it already is somewhat distorted as it is).  I don't think anyone would mind if the producers and writers tossed in Mr Sinister and his Nasty Boys, or the rest of the Brotherhood of Evil Mutants (Pyro (who is a kid in Prof X's school), Blob, Phantasm, etc).  And this movie should've been made to be around 3 hours long.  In fact, this could've rivaled Star Wars.  But the shortness of the film, around an hour and a half, didn't go for the character development and taggled plot lines that were usually found in the comics.  All that can be said is, pray for a sequel...<br/><br/>Even though I spent all this time lamenting about what this movie lacks, it is definitely a film to go see.  Good effects that dont turn the movie into a cyberjunkie's euphoria and some better than decent acting make this film overall a good choice.  For the fans, see it for the heck of it.  For the newcomers, see it because you will like it."
"MissCzarChasm","10","0","0","18 July 2000"," Welcome to the Evolution and a fantastic film.
","I saw the X-Men movie on opening night at around 10:30 at night and the theater was packed. There were so many people there and my friends and I, who are all fans of the comic book, sat with anticipation just waiting for it to begin. I have never been so excited over a movie in a long while and when it was over everyone in the theater applauded and my friends and I were most definitely not disappointed. In fact this film is one of the best comic to film adaptations since the original Batman and is in my top ten list of my favorite films.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly basic and if you are not a an avid reader of the comic book you will still understand everything that is going on. I won't give the plot away but here's a basic summary of the characters. Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for gifted youngsters that shows mutants how to use there powers and teaches them to accept what they are in a world that usually doesn't accept things that are different. He believes that humans and mutants can live together peacefully as one. one man on the other hand does not share his views on humans. His name is magneto. He believes that humans be destroyed because they treat mutants so harshly and  that humans should believe that mutants are the superior life forms. Xavier's answer to mutants like magneto are the X-Men, a group of mutants who fight for the benefit of man-kind  and people who also share xavier's view on humans. The X-men consits of Cyclops, Jean Grey, and storm. Caught in the middle of this is Wolverine and Rogue. Wolverine is a very aggressive mutant who is very confussed about his past. Rogue is a young girl who is has just discovered her mutant powers. They seem to share some kind of bound that brings them together. he vows to protect her and watch over her. Magneto has his own answer to people like the X-men, The Brotherhood of Evil Mutants. They consits of Mystique, Sabertooth and Toad. Now it becomes a battle between people who don't share similar opinions and the big question is who's right about the people mutants live amongst?<br/><br/>The acting in the film is good all around. they all fit there parts to perfection. The stnadout performance comes from Hugh Jackman who is a star in the making. he brings wolverine form the comic books staright onto the screen. Anna Paquin is also good as Rogue and the relationship between her and wolverine is very well written. she's vulnerable without being too annoying. The one problem with the acting is halle berry as storm. not that she's bad but i feel that they should've given her more to do. hopefully in the next film they will expand on that. One other good performance is famke janssen as Jean. she's plays the part with smarts and sex appeal.<br/><br/>The action and special effects are great too. the fight between Mystique(played pretty well by Rebecca romyn stamos) is so awesome and very well put together. i liked the fight between wolverine and sabertooth on the statue of liberty but i felt it was a bit anti-climatic. Toad vs cyclops, storm, and jean is gret too. Ray park dazzles us with his great stunt and martial art skills and storm fans will lovre the outcome of this fight.<br/><br/>A great movie and director bryan singer you have put together a solid film. kudos to you. 10/10"

","X-Men was one of the best movies of the summer, I have seen so far. Yes, the special effects were great, but that's not all. The dialogue was sharp and witty, especially from the ready-to-fight Wolverine. You also feel sorry for one of the lead bad guys, Magneto, who has been different from society all of his life: because he was survivor of the Holocaust and is hated for being a mutant. You see why he hates the human race so bad. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine is believable because they are both very different from the other mutants, they share some type of best friend always bond. This is a great directing job by Bryan Singer, director of Apt Pupil, which did nothing for me. I hope there is a sequel in the making, and if it is I cannot wait to see it!"
"i-moss","Null","0","0","18 July 2000"," Great movie overall, with some character flaws and chronology mistakes
","First, let me say that this movie presented a fantastic rendition of the classic comic book characters, the X-men. It was interesting, action packed, and intelligent. But, since I am now acting as a critic by writing a review, I must point out the MINOR flaws that this movie has. Let me start with Hugh Jackman, the extremely talented actor who portrayed Wolverine, an extremely gruff, violent, unreasonable, semi-sadistic, and animalistic mutant. Although Jackman seemed to put his all into this character, he wasn't quite able to capture the roughness of Wolverine. Jackman came off as a nice man playing a mean character. And the absence of Wolverine's catch word, if you will, ""bub"", was not something to be addressed, but I missed it. Oh, another extremely minor detail about Jackman- Wolverine is 5'6"" Jackman came off as approx. 6'. Now let's address the character of Rogue, portrayed by the inspirational young actress Anna Paquin. Personally, I think she is a pretty average actress.(considering she is in her teens) But I thought the flaws of Rogue were more the director's fault than Paquin's. First off, the character of Rogue was brought out to be a Southern teen mutant who had the ability to drain the ""lifeforce"" (as Stewart put it) from any being she touches. Well, the truth is, Rogue/Paquin is a southern woman who seems to be in her early 20's, not a young teen girl! That was the director's fault. Now Paquin's fault: she dropped her accent for half the film. She seems Northern, and she couldn't maintain the Southern belle accent. Actually I think Natalie Portman (Queen Amidala/Padme in Episode I) would have been better. (considering Rogue is a grown woman by the time she comes to Professor X's school for young mutants.) But she was pretty good as Rogue, and did not bring the quality of the film down at all. Now let's look at Storm, the African mutant who, in the comic books, played an extremely important role. Storm was portrayed by Halle Berry who, in my opinion, is not the most versatile actress by far. To put it politely, she's rather limited. The fact that her character probably had under ten lines and didn't play a pivotal role to the plot, was a terrible injustice to the comic book character of Storm, who soon became a leader of the team. She also had the Paquin flaw, dropping her AFRICAN accent for half the movie. And when she had it, it wasn't too noticeable. But, I mean, how can you tell if someone has an accent when their most important line is ""Senator Kelley is dead"". Now we come to the issue of Storm's elemental powers. She has the mutant ability to control all forms of weather. Rain, snow, lightning, etc, are  all at her command. There were three instances where I thought that Storm's powers were underplayed. First, when she and Cyclops (James Marsden) went into a railroad station to try to find the runaway Rogue. Storm is at a ticket booth, when Sabertooth (Tyler Mane) grabs her around the neck, lifts her off the ground, and starts choking her. Storm LETS this happen for maybe ten seconds before she zaps Sabertooth with a lightning bolt. Now, if I were being throttled by a sadistic killer like sabertooth, and I could control the weather, I wouldn't wait until Cyclops made an attempt to save me, before I took action. I would have zapped his behind to Rhode Island the second he touched me! Then, later in the movie, Toad starts beating Storm up, while she makes no attempt to defend herself. It is only after Toad throws her into an elevator chute, that she finally decides to do something about it. Then, when the X-men are trapped in the Statue of Liberty by Magneto, and Wolverine tells Storm to ""zap him"", and he reminds them that they are in a copper structure, Storm doesn't think to maybe blow Magneto away with wind, or part the earth beneath him? Hmm. Disappointing. And I find it sad that, since, Storm was really the only African-American cast member, they should have given her a more significant role. Now let's look at Cyclops, who was portrayed by James Marsden, a seemingly average actor who had a very limited role. In the comic books, he has a very authoritative ""don't take any crap from anyone"" kind of mentality. In the movie, he lets Wolverine mess with him, and kind of let's him hit on Jean (who is his fiance). But that's about it for him. The last character I think had some flaws was Sabertooth, the sadistic, animalistic, killer, who was portrayed by Tyler Mane. First of all, Sabertooth is brought out as a mindless minion of Magneto's in the movie. Truth is, Sabertooth is actually pretty intelligent, and his own man. Then, his claws. Come on! In the books, they're like 6 inch daggers, in the movie, they're like the witch finger nails you buy at Halloween!And Sabertooth and Wolverine have the exact same mutant powers (with the exception that Wolverine's claws pop out and can retract, and Sabertooth's are always out). This similarity is never really brought out. I thought Patrick Stewart (Professor X and Ian McKellen (Magneto) were the strongest actors in the movie and were both great and gave the film a solidity that one doesn't often see in an action, comic book-derived film.<br/><br/>I also think that Famke Jassen (Jean Grey) performed fittingly for her role. Just four more things. First, Sabertooth and Wolverine were already fierce enemies before they came in contact with the X-men. In the movie they meet by way of the X-men. Then, Rogue is not a younger teen when she joins the X-men, she's a grown woman. Third, at the end of the movie, when Magneto is in his plastic prison and Xavier leaves Magneto after playing a game of chess with him, one of the chess pieces falls, making a ringing sound, implying that it is metallic. That is the catch ending, but please! You mean to tell me that everyone went to such lengths to put Magneto in a special, fail-safe prison, and they give him a chess set with metal pieces? Come ON! Fourth, the directors left out one of the original five members of the X-men, Beast, a blue, furry, monster who is strong, agile, extremely intelligent, and fast. If I am not mistaken the original X-men were: Jean Grey a.k.a Marvel Girl (originally), Cyclops, Wolverine, Storm, and Beast. Not Rogue. Rogue comes around the time of Gambit, but that's a different story. Let me say again that all these flaws are extremely MINOR and I don't think that they bring the quality of the movie down at all. I thought X-men was Xcellent and Xtremely well done. I am very glad it didn't suffer from the unintelligent, ""beat em' up"" mentality that the recent Batman movies suffered. I know I critiqued this movie harshly, but I am a real fan of the X-men and my standards were extremely high. Anyway, most of the MINUTE flaws were only noticable if you are really familiar with the X-men comic books. This movie came very close to reaching my standards, and I could have happily sat through it again after it finished. Two words, SEE IT. You will be very pleased. I give X-men 9 stars out of ten. But I'm only 14, so you decide."

","I started reading the X-Men a long time ago along with the counterpart X-Factor. I just have to say that I thought this movie was THE best ""based on a comic series ever done"" It was definitely well worth the wait.<br/><br/>Although I think that perhaps Katie Holmes would have been a wonderful choice to play Rogue. I did like Anna Paquin's performance. But the character I totally loved and can not for the life of me get out of my head is Hugh Jackman's Wolverine.<br/><br/>As soon as he came on the screen I was entranced with him. He just had a way about him and how he played Logan that I would never have anticipated. I'll admit that I wasn't always a fan of Wolverine in the comics. But Jackmans portrayal has shed a completely different light on Wolvie. I think he was a great choice for the role.<br/><br/>The other actor I have to praise would be Halle Berry as Storm. I've never really like Berry in anything else I have seen her in , but I really liked her as Storm. <br/><br/>I too laughed my ass off when Ray Park did his Darth Maul move at the elevator.I also cracked up at the yellow spandex joke.<br/><br/>The only bad thing I have to say about this movie is that the casting of Janssen and Marsden was kind of mismatched. She looks too much older than him.<br/><br/>Back when this movie was still a rumor I can remember thinking that the perfect choice for Xavier had to Stewart. I am pleased to say that I was not disappointed at all.<br/><br/>I completely recommend this film to all who are fans of the comic as well as those who have never even read it. All in all I would have to give it a rating of 15 out 10."

","Overal a statisfying movie.  They did a good job. <br/><br/>Good points: <br/><br/>Very real to life in making the characters exactly like their comic book counterparts. Wolverine was done so well that he stole the show and it was good that this movie focused on him. Fantastic looking and perfect casting for the characters Magneto, Xavier, Logan, Storm, Sabertooth and Cyclops. When Xavier (P Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellan - God and Monsters) get together it is pure magic. Well done fight scenes that make the superheros show off their 'talents' excellently. <br/><br/>Bad points: <br/><br/>Xavier and Magneto feed off each other so brilliantly and I only wish the movie had more of them together on the screen. There could have been a little more on the human fear factor how everyone was scared of all the mutant business, at least they covered it in the movie. I did not like Ana Paquins acting ability as Rogue.  She started off well but seemed to go downhill as the film progressed. <br/><br/>Overall the good more than outweighs the bad probably cause I was so taken with Logan (after all he is my fav X men character).  Is it true that apparantly 45 minutes of this film went on the CHOPPING BLOC!  I wonder what those scenes would have been like to the movie??  Maybe it could of had more dialogue and story explanation..  Me thinks though that they totaly went for the simple adventure-action-effects film.

Since Batman came out in the early 90's I haven't been impressed with a cartoon turned to movie till now.  This movie was just great.

"frankiepelvis","9","0","0","18 July 2000"," The Only Great Comic Book Movie!!!!!
","This is the first time in the history of film and comics that they actually got it right! Lots of people praise the first two Batman and Superman Movies.<br/><br/>I have a piece of advice: Watch them again.<br/><br/>No Batman movie really explores Bruce Wayne as a character. He chases around over the top bad guys (who act like common gangsters in crazy outfits and only speak in catchphrases) for the entire film. He is also involved in a forgettable love story every time. Batman has no real interest in love only justice. It's an intregral part of his Character. We need a Year One or Dark Knight movie.<br/><br/>The Superman movies are a little better, but they really play fast and loose with his powers.  Telekinesis? Illusions? White lasers that come out of his hand?  The ability to erase Lois's memory? Rebuild-the-great-wall-of-China-Vision? Also The Super-Fake city battle in the Second Movie is quite lame.  If it wasn't for Gene Hackman's fab performance those movies would be totally forgetable.<br/><br/>Blade was a vampire movie and a mindless on at that. There is not much in that movie that screams Comic Book, except for the total lack of characterization inherit in most Comic Book Movies.  Captain America(Straight to Video), Punisher(Straight to Video),  and the Hulk(TV movies) were the absolute pits.<br/><br/>X-men was a real Movie, not corny or gritty or cheap looking. The X-men esp. Wolvie and Rogue acted like I would expect them to if the were real people.  Wolverine and Cyclops were perfect together. Storm and Sabertooth were a bit of a bore.  Did anyone catch who was who at the academy? I saw Shadowcat Iceman and maybe Pyro(he's a brotherhood member in the comics maybe he'll defect or betray them in the sequel)  Who were the super fast basketball player and the waterwalker? are they actual Xmen characters or created for the movie?<br/><br/>I would love to see another Xmen movie and a Wolverine solo movie. I wish we could finally see wolverine's origin which hasn't been revealed in the last 25 years.  I haven't read the Comic since they got awful(post Claremont) and I hope they finish that story somewhere."

"baumer","7","0","0","18 July 2000"," i am looking forward to the sequel
","I know absolutely nothing about the X-Men.  I went with a guy who did and he was like a guide.  He explained things to me about the characters that I needed to know.  But after a while I began to realize that it was unneccessary for him to do so.  The film did a pretty good job of explaining it all to me.  And I was impressed.<br/><br/>There was much left to be desired in this film but I think that was by design.  I wanted to know more about Professor X and Magnetto.  I wanted to know more about their friendship and their rivalry.  How did it start, how did it get to the point it's at now and so on.  But that is also a credit to the makers of the film because there is obviously enough material here to make a dozen films.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed most about the film was that the bad guys were not really cut and dried bad.  There was no true villain.  I guess you could say that Magnetto's henchmen ( and henchwoman ) were more evil than not, but Magnetto was an interesting study.  This is a man who was in a Nazi death camp and he is being ostracized from society by humans that can't and won't accept another species as being better in some way than they are.  The subleties of racism are not subtle here.  There is a great line in the film when Magnetto says something to the affect of ""Humans are always afraid of what they can't understand.""  How true.  There is also a scene in here that shows humans experimenting on a mutant and that is similar to what we do to animals. Mutants are treated like lab rats but what one of the underlying subtleties of the film says is that everyone and everything should be treated equal. It is not up to us to play God and decide that just because someone or something is different than us that we should should arbitrarilly exterminate them.  This is a deep movie disguised as a slam bam summer flick.  I guess now I am just learning what comic book fans have known all along....X-Men is a great story, with many layers to it.<br/><br/>My favourite character is Wolverine.  Not only is he Canadian, but he is a rogue and quite the bad ass.  He reminds me of a bit between a cross of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker.  He is abrasive and cocky like Han and he hasn't quite learned how to control and utilize his ability quite yet, like Luke in Star Wars.  I would like to see him learn more about himself and his ability in the sequels to come.  In fact, I am looking forward to the sequels just so I can learn more about all of these characters.  My friend told me that there is a lot more to the X-Men than what we saw on screen and he said that Wolverine and Sabretooth hate each other and are always battling.  That is something I am looking forward to with great anticipation.  And of course, I want to know more about Magnetto and Professor X.  This series should be treated as if no one knew anything about the history of the comic books. If it does so, this could really be a James Bond type series where it spans 4 or 5 decades.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this film.  As I left the theater I wasn't quite sure what to think.  It was good but it took me a while for it to sink in.  Once it did, I realized that this is a great film and the fact that it introduced the characters just enough to garner my interest is also a bonus.  I am now looking forward to perhaps 2002 to see the already greatly anticipated sequel.<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10.... I have a feeling the next X-Men is going to be even better.  There is so much more that I want to know and learn about these characters and a sequel is almost a guarantee.  This is a great summer film and I look forward to seeing all of the characters back for the next one. And one word of advice to the writers....<br/><br/>Give Toad more to say next time.  He was funny and he cracked me up with his childish like antics."
"gastaman","Null","0","0","18 July 2000"," The movie lacks complexities needed to make story interesting
","This is what I think.  If you walked into that theater, not knowing anything about the X-men or good story telling, and only cared about seeing the action displayed when two super-powered beings butt heads, than I'm guessing you probably would have been impressed with this movie.  I, on the other hand, was looking for a bit more.  Watching the movie, I realized that each of the characters fell into only 1 of 2 categories.  That was either good, or either bad.  Watching a movie, I like to look for the complexities of characters, that can make them, either ESSENTIALLY good, or either ESSENTIALLY bad.   This meaning, that the character's decision to be either good or bad, was not one made very light heartedly.  Take for instance, Magneto.  In the comic book, he isn't simply a super-powered villain who displays his superiority out of pure hatred towards mankind, like portrayed in the movie.  He was more so like a very well educated man who knew the stakes, and simply did what he needed to do to survive.  Another example, would be Wolverine.  Now why wasn't Wolverine a complex character in the movie?  One factor, which is understandable, is the fact that they wanted to leave his past shrouded in mystery.  I can live with that.  But what I can't understand is why they left out the other half of his personality.  Before Wolverine had ever joined the X-men, he had gone through a lot of pretty horrible things.  He was a veteran of ""war"" like situations and had many years of life experience to his name.  Unlike, in the movie, Wolverine was NOT just a loose cannon.  He had much more to offer than just a wise cracking, smart mouthed, hard balled character.   I can go on about pretty much every one of the characters.  Another thing I feel missing from the movie, was the personal conflicts between all the characters.  Sure, I know. Cyclops and Wolverine went at it with some witty remarks.  But thats not what I'm talking about.  Anyways, in the movie, the reasons as to why they went at it was left vague.  In the comics, it is easily recognizable.  It was the fact that Cyclops was a ""By the numbers"" kind of guy, while Wolverine on the other hand, did what he felt was needed to get the job done, regardless of anything.  Another tension builder between the two consisted with each other's relationships with Xavier.  Both of them were somewhat considered to be sons to Xavier.  Cyclops being the good child, and Wolverine being the problem child.  Of course, the problem child receives more attention in an attempt to figure out the problem, leaving the OBEDIENT good child, becoming jealous of their relationship and building an undertone of hatred and animosity towards the problem child.  This is where a lot of the conflict between Wolverine and Cyclops evolved from.  Again, I can go on and on.  But to make a long story short, I am merely trying to say this. The movie did not fail in its translation of a comic story to a movie story, as MOST of you probably think I'm getting at.   I believe where it REALLY failed, was in its translation of the comic characters to the movie characters.  Having the characters as CLEAR CUT as they were in the movie, makes it really hard to feel any form of remorse for Magneto, who if you don't remember has been through a lot of horrible events, which partially forms his attitude, decisions, and train of thought.  Magneto is not simply another villain out to conquer mankind, but more so a ""a part of a PERSECUTED race of beings just trying to live another day"".   In the movie, it is hard to feel that any of the characters have any real thoughts about what is happening and what has already happened, and thus it becomes hard to feel triumphant for the victors, and remorseful for the defeated.  In truth, all the characters are just trying to accomplish one goal, survive.   NO ONE is completely good, and NO ONE is completely evil.  I don't want characters that come off as cliche and easily categorized.  I want characters that people can't easily agree on and be able to get something from and question with themselves and others, their beliefs.<br/><br/>At last, in reply to myself, I fear a movie like this will never be made. And this is for one very evident reason.  The X-Men I long for existed only in it's earlier generations where characters such as Magneto and Xavier were modeled after such political activists as Malcolm X and Martin Luther King, Jr., and was written for a target audience of older men and older women. While the X-Men of today, not to say that it lacks the same intellectual stories as the previous X-Men, it is written for a new target audience of males ages 10-22.  So hence, the movie, in order to appeal to the entire audience, felt they must sacrifice intelligence and complexity, to appeal to the younger fan base.  But this is also incorrect.  Given the right writers, and proper direction.... Even my X-Men movie could be made, and appeal to X-Men fans of any age, and even those, who have never heard of them before."

Mutants are a reality. The ""normal"" population fear them and want them gone. Many mutants live in fear until Professor X (Stewart) a mutant himself, opens up a school where all mutants can find refuge and also learn how to control their powers. A specific group of mutants, led by Magneto (McKellen) have a nasty plan reserved for the masses and it's up to Professor X and his team of brave students to stop them. It's a freak war that will blow your mind.<br/><br/>
THE LOWDOWN:<br/><br/>
I cannot compare this film to the comics it's based on cause I never followed them. But on its own, I must say this is a very good movie, a solid platform to build a franchise on. First off, the casting is dead on and I predict a new star in the guise of Hugh Jackman (Wolverine). The man looks like a young ""Clint Eastwood"" has rough charm to boot and knows how to move when it comes to fight scenes. Wolverine is by far the more interesting character in the film and trust me, you will love him. I appreciated that the movie took its time to set up its situation and main characters. It makes the last 20 minutes of slam, bang, mutant action way more rewarding. The visual effects are top notch and the combat scenes rival the ones we saw in ""The Matrix"". Prepare to be dazzled.<br/><br/>My few complaints are A) The movie has many characters but spends most of its time developing Wolverine and Rogue. In the process it leaves other ""main"" characters in the dust. Storm (Berry), Cyclops (Marsden) and the villains were way underdeveloped. I guess we'll find more about them in the sequels.<br/><br/>B) Ian McKellen is a wonderful actor and when Magneto was out of costume, he worked. But for the life of me I laughed my butt off when I saw him in his get up, metal helmet and all. I would compare the feeling to going to a rave and seeing a 60 year old dude, flashing glow sticks and sucking on a lollipop. He just looks silly. Maybe a younger actor would have been a better casting choice.<br/><br/>But enough nit picking, this film delivers on most fronts, has a likeable cast, wonderful visual effects, a good story, breathtaking fight scenes, some humor (the bantering between Cyclops and Wolverine is hilarious), great heroes and amusing villains (I especially enjoyed the morphing, ass kicking Mystique). Enter the world of The X-Men.<br/><br/>
ACTING:<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart is Professor X, he doesn't have much to do but he's the perfect chive for the part. Hugh Jackman has a cool name and gives life to one of the most interesting anti-heroes of the year. Wolverine walks the walk and talks the talk, I couldn't get enough of him. Anna Paquin (Rogue) also does very well, her vulnerable show will surely touch you and her scenes with ""Jackman"" are amazing. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos (Mystique) has maybe one line but she's by far one of the coolest villains in the flick. She has a bod to kill for and knows how to whoop that ass. Ray Park (Toad) also does good in a mostly physical part. He brings some humor to the film and even gives us one of his ""Darth Maul"" moves.<br/><br/>Tyler Mane (Sabertooth) let's the makeup do most of the acting cause he doesn't have much to do but look menacing. He didn't do anything for me either way but he does have a great fight scene with ""Jackman"". Ian McKellen (Magneto) gives another solid performance, he brings depth to the character and we understand where he's coming fromtoo bad he looks funny in that funky helmet. Famke Janssen (Dr. Jean Grey) and James Marsden (Cyclops) don't have much screen time but bring lots of presence when they're on. Janssen is sexy and Marsden is witty. Can't wait to see more of them in the sequel. Halle Berry (Storm) looks amazing in costume but is very underused. Also what is up with that accentit comes and goes like the flu.<br/><br/>
GORE:<br/><br/>No gore but some kool cartoon violence and amazing effects. I loved the ""Mystique"" design, the Toad tongue and the Wolverine claws.<br/><br/>DIRECTING:<br/><br/>Singer is very effective giving the film a comic book feel but somehow managing to also keep it grounded in reality. It makes the fantastic scenes more powerful (an example would be the police showdown with Magneto). He moves the film at a fast pace, gives us some kool shots and well directed fight sequences. Good show.<br/><br/>
SOUNDTRACK:<br/><br/>The score is very under whelming. A bit more juice in the music would have been appreciated.<br/><br/>
BOTTOM LINE:<br/><br/>X-Men fans rejoice, the film gives the comic book justice. Movie fans rejoice, we got ourselves a good summer movie that will surely thrill you. The movie looks slick, has a sympathetic cast, good writing, good production values and a kickarse ending. And for all you ""Marvel"" fans out there let's see if you spot the reference to the ""comic book"" Wolverine and another Marvel hero that goes by the name of ""Iceman"". I for one am looking forward to the sequel already. I can't wait to witness more of the X-Men world. Have a blast!<br/><br/>
BULL'S EYE:<br/><br/>The film was shot in Toronto, Canada. Hugh Jackman is Australian and will surely follow in Russell Crowe's footsteps."

","I used to collect X-Men comics when I was younger, so as a former ""hard core"" fan I was a bit skeptical as to how good a live action movie on the subject would be. I am happy to say that the X-Men movie is wonderful entertainment. I liked Bryan Singer's take on the story, a moody, introspective tale that's closer in spirit to ""Unforgiven"" or ""The Wild Bunch"" than ""Batman."" Watching Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen inhabit their roles and play off each other was a treat, although should we expect anything less from these two actors? Especially impressive is Hugh Jackman's dead-on interpretation of Wolverine - this man is a very talented and charismatic actor who will hopefully go far in the business.<br/><br/>The reason I did not rate this movie higher is because of the not quite air tight construction of the overall work. Also, many of the characters (Storm, Mystique, and Toad in particular) have only a few lines, and we never really get to know them beyond the action sequences. This is not to take anything away from what the film has accomplished, however. This is easily one of the best super hero films ever made. Is there a cinematic franchise in the making? If they keep the tone similar to this film, we might (finally) have a sequel to look forward to."

","It's the most dazzling Unconscious Subversive Moment of recent times. A right-wing Senator (Bruce Davison, famous for the bedside death scene in the AIDS weepie LONGTIME COMPANION) lies on a gurney, infected by a terrorist version of his bete noire--mutants. He has persecuted the mutants of the United States, and now they have made him one of them--at the expense of his body. In short, read it as: ACT-UP infects Jesse Helms with AIDS. And the climax of this tragedy comes when Davison (also known as the child molester in SHORT EYES) looks up at hit-and-run diva Halle Berry, a tragic mulatto in a blond wig, and asks, ""Do you hate normal people?""<br/><br/>X-MEN is an Allegory of Queerness so dizzy and bent it could give Todd Haynes the vapors. Mutants--special people with special powers (read: desires)--are being persecuted by the right, threatened with ""mutant registration,"" the firing of mutant teachers from grade schools, etcetera. An embittered Holocaust survivor (!), Magneto (Ian McKellen) plans to erase the un-evolved, pre-mutant human race. Buddha-calm, a mandarin Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) plans to save the benighted humans--even when they're picketing to throw mutants in jail. It's Martin Luther King versus Malcolm X--or is it Larry Kramer versus Harvey Fierstein? And to add weirdness to weirdness, Singer crams on the mutant superheroes, and their Magneto-driven nemeses, till you start to think the movie is a collaboration of Stephen King and Robert Altman--NASHVILLE set at a convention of the Tragically Telekinetic.<br/><br/>Poor Bryan Singer had to do it all--satisfy the comic-book geeks, placate Rupert Murdoch, and throw together some high-priced CGI and a low-priced cast to make a concoction to rock the mid-summer bells. He gets better than a gentleman's C; the last half hour, a rock concert of dueling powers, suggests the operatic splatter style of Lucio Fulci's THE BEYOND. (Especially when a white-eyed Halle Berry is raising the roof and bringing on lightningbolts.) But Singer doesn't really have the pop-opera gifts of DePalma or even Paul Verhoeven.<br/><br/>Oddly, his best moments are the biggest action set pieces, not the sensitive ""outsider"" stuff. (Credit for that no doubt goes to the editors, the sound editors, Michael Kamen's score, the computer-animation guys...) As the dueling brains, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen have the right iconic quality, but unfortunately, no one else does. This is the kind of thing that has to be cast iconographically, physiognomically, like a Sergio Leone Western. Even when they fit their characters, the actors don't have that stamped-on-a-coin quality. (A possible exception: lithe, lissome Rebecca Romijn-Stamos as the shape-shifter Mystique.) Sequels could bent the perversity of it all in interesting directions. One hopes that next time Singer won't be tempted to outdo Renny Harlin in the eardrum-shattering sweepstakes."

","As a longtime reader of the X-Men comics, I was having doubts about how well it could be made into a movie, especially considering the long chain of crappy comic book movies that preceded it (Batman 2-4, Superman 2-?, Captain America, Blade...need I go on?)  But now that I've seen it, I hope that Bryan Singer comes back, because he made one hell of a cool movie.  X-MEN was well written, very true to the comics-even making some character improvements (Toad, for example, is much better in the movie than he ever was in the comics.)  X-Men was very well cast, especially Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, Tyler Mane (a perfect Sabretooth), Ray Park, and Hugh Jackman. Once I saw that lump of crap known as MI: 2, I was so very happy that Dougray Scott didn't play Wolverine.  They would've had to change his name to 'Ferret'.  The special effects were fantastic, and at the same time not so overwhelming that they took over the movie.  Without a doubt, this movie is a drama with great characters and plenty of history to back it up. All in all, congratulations should go out to the entire cast and crew of X-MEN for making the first comic book movie since Batman that didn't insult the history behind it.  Let's just hope that Marvel can keep this in mind when they go to make Spider-Man and the soon-to-be endless chain of comic movies soon to come."

And being a great fan of X-men and having read all the comic books I know that Jubliee and Shadow Cat(not to mention some of the others that made little cameos)were not at the academy at the same time nor were they the same age. Also the story of how Rogue came to be with the X-men is totally wrong. There is no chemistry between Jean Grey & Cyclops(not even a little kiss) and Jean Grey & Wolverine.The attraction Wolverine has for Jean Grey is tottally unbelievable. The best thing in the movie is the sexual chemistry between Rogue and Wolverine. Was I the only one to notice?? OK, so shes only 17, but I still think they should have been romanticly linked by the end of the movie. Of course I'm just a romantic sixteen year old girl so you may not all agree but you have to admit that theres definetly great chemistry between them. The villans were all good. But I did'nt really enjoy Cyclops or Jean Grey(of course I have never liked them in the comic books either). Famke Janssen is too old and boring as jean grey and james marsden is too young and annoying as cyclops. Halle Berry on the other hand is great as Storm although she is terribly underused, only given a handful of lines and hardly any screen time. Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine. As is Anna Paquin as Rogue. Also I think the film was way too short.  But overall I give this film an 8 out of ten stars and a 10 out of 10 if I had never read the comic books."

","""X-Men"" left me pleasantly satisfied.  I was not blown away, nor did I feel like cinema had been redefined.  But I felt that what I had seen was very good. Bryan Singer and his production team have overcome pretty formidable odds - fan & studio pressure, reduced time and money, iconic source material, not to mention a last-minute actor replacement (Hugh Jackman for Dougray Scott) - to create a nicely-paced, intriguing, and well-produced fantasy adventure with strong performances, good action scenes, and well-done special effects. Almost as fascinating as the film and the hype has been the aftermath. Mainstream reviews from folks like Roger Ebert and Michael Wilmington at Chicago Tribune have ranged from underwhelmed to outright dislike.  While on the other hand, response in alternative press, sci-fi fansites and fan postings has been overwhelmingly positive. Where lies the schism, I wonder.  Comparing some reviews, I find it almost hard to believe that everyone watched the same movie.  One person accuses the film of drowning in special effects, while another says there are not enough.  A critic decries the lack of character development, while a non-X-Men-comic book fan says they clearly understood each character.<br/><br/>I will be the first to admit, the film requires a leap of faith just to accept the initial premise - that genetic mutation would result in divergent and fantastic abilities like weather control and laser-beam eyes.  It seems that everyone's ability to suspend disbelief and buy into the film lies at a different level, a problem that also occurred with Singer's ""The Usual Suspects"" (one of my personal favorites). I will also agree that the large number of characters has resulted in unbalanced plot development, with a lot of exposition time and ciphers abounding.  Halle Berry's Storm is an especially unfortunate casualty, barely registering until the action, and then not as tough as her comic book counterpart.  I am guessing a lot of this is due to the 45 minutes the studio had Singer cut from the movie. However, those details did not detract from my overall enjoyment of the film, or taking pleasure in what I regarded as its successes. The film benefits enormously from Singer's deliberate decision to play everything straight, without the camp that marred other comic book ventures. When humor does occur, it grows naturally out of the situation and attitudes (Cyclops:""Where's my motorcycle"";Wolverine: ""You're a dick"").  I also liked the fact that the actor's all underplayed their lines.  Amid the fantastic trappings and special effects, over-the-top villainy or histrionic heroism would have destroyed the film. When the action scenes kick in, with digital effects, explosions, morphing, and wire-work kung-fu, Singer still keeps things very straightforward and matter of fact.  He does not dwell upon the fantastic nature of what is going on, nor drag out the fight scenes for the sake of fighting.  Take the initial Wolverine-Sabertooth encounter and subsequent rescue by Storm and Cyclops.  Each being uses their powers according to the rules laid out.  Nothing is delayed for artificial dramatic effect, it just happens.  No one talks when they're fighting, probably cause in real life, no one would. This approach does remove an emotional element from the fight scenes that occurs in other films (i.e. The Matrix), but that is because Singer, as always, has goals that are more intellectual than emotional.  The climatic destruction of Magneto's mutant device and rescue of Rogue is not what interests him the most, but the aftermath and what it says about the characters:  Wolverine has proven himself to the team, our novice heroes have had their first trial by fire, Magneto now knows how far Xavier's team will go to stop him.  Again, much of this is inferred.  Singer does not spell it out, which I found to be a welcome change. Though the film generally moves well, it does have an episodic and stop & go quality.  This did not bother me too much, since the original comic books tended to be episodic, though I am guessing part of this is actually due to last-minute re-writing and studio-imposed cutting. Most fascinating for me was the realization of the extent to which ""X-Men"" manifested all the fears and fantasies of childhood through adolescence. As children, we often feel small and helpless.  The origin of Magneto's contempt of mankind is traced to the boyhood trauma of watching his parents' killed, an honest fear even I can recall experiencing as a young child. Marie/Rogue embodies adolescent terrors of puberty, budding sexuality, and the feeling of isolation (which extends to all mutants). At the same time, we see images of what we would like to be.  Cyclops is the handsome, clean-cut hero.  As Xavier's number one guy, he's the jock, prom king, guy who dates the cutest girl in school - we awkward nerds might hate him (as Wolverine does), but we also envy him.  At the same time, Wolverine is that other side boys fantasize about - tough, street-smart, rebellious, a loner.  He's the superhero equivalent of James Dean.  Then there is Professor X - wealthy, all-knowing, all-powerful,  and the guy in charge. The film is dotted with other childhood fantasies: running away from home (Rogue), beating up bullies/authority figures (Mystique to Senator Kelly: ""It's because of people like you I was afraid to go to school""), anonymity (Mystique's shape-shifting), powers contrasting one's size or limitations (Professor X is handicapped but telepathic; Toad is ugly, yet a deadly killer).  Returning to a previous thought, if we fear lack of control, then our desire for control is represented by Storm (weather), Professor X (thought), and Jean Grey (matter). Perhaps this explains the split.  Fans tend to be younger than critics; maybe the film speaks clearer to them.  I have noticed that people who have seen the film close to my age (27) or younger have enjoyed it the most. For us, we still feel a bit like X-Men."

The only X-Man who had any depth to his character is Wolverine.  The rest of the cast may as well have been played by cardboard cut-outs, because there was no depth or development of any of them.  I guess when you put 6 or 7 superheroes in the same movie there just isn't time to show how any of them tick...it's a shame.<br/><br/>It wasn't the worst comic-book-turned-movie I've ever seen, but it sure wasn't the best.

","I just saw X-Men for the second time, and it's still worth seeing for me. Don't believe what the critics have written because if it ain't ""the English Patient"" or some other ""story from the heart"", it's not good enough for them. Though the plot is a little thin as far as Magneto deciding to use Rogue to turn all the world leaders into mutants, it's still entertaining.  I stopped reading the comics several years back when they started doing crossovers and making new X-titles, it became a lot to keep up with.  Plus the cartoon ended.  But this movie is just as good as any other comic movie.  It stays mostly true to its characters (except for Rogue) and its just cool to see Cyclops and Storm on the big screen (though both say hardly anything).<br/><br/>Though I generally think sequels are a way to capitalize on the success of the first film and don't live up to expectations, a sequel would do well for X-Men.  This movie is very much about Wolverine and Rogue.  I think The Brotherhood with the exception of Magneto, spoke a total of 5 lines throughout the whole movie.  The action sequences were cool but the character moments were just as nice to watch.  I hope the sequel can show more of that.<br/><br/>Some quick thoughts:<br/><br/>-Was it just me, or did it seem like everyone passed out and had to be hooked up to tubes at least once.  Did Prof. X really need 20 tubes attached to his head?<br/><br/>-Something about Sabretooth kept reminding me of He-Man the movie.<br/><br/>-It's a little hard to believe humans could imprison Magneto in a plastic cell.  But I guess that's where the sequel comes into play.<br/><br/>-Wolverine has some great one-liners.  (to Jean) ""What's your super power- putting up with him?""  Just as funny as ""You're a dick.""<br/><br/>-Storm had a great fight with Toad at the end but that line ""What happens to a toad when he's struck by lightning"", a little too comic booky for me."

","Having read the X-Men since childhood I was prepared and eager for a major motion picture to be made for over twenty years.  Given the lack of technology, inspiration and motivation by Marvel comics when they were still a strong company, it has taken these many years.<br/><br/>With the initial facts of casting, location and rumors of possible story ideas I was sick with what Hollywood was trying to do with this enjoyable, mind provoking story.  Then I saw the first Internet teaser.  Hmm... maybe I wasn't giving this movie enough credit.  Then, the first full length theatrical trailer, and the second and the third.  I wanted to see more and more as the days went on, leading to July 14th.  I reverted from a complete adult loyalist and fanatic to a kid bursting with anticipation to see his heroes on film.<br/><br/>Singer does a fine job of translating a chapter from 40 years of X-Men history to film.  Where I hated the casting choices before the movie, and still uncertain about some even after, I have to say my biggest doubts were overcome in Wolverine.  Hugh Jackman, a virtual unknown from Australia, lists in his profile that he is 6'2"" and weighed 160 pounds before filming. Can you say, beanpole?  For the readers of the comics we know that Wolverine is so likeable because he is short, mean, sarcastic and ""...the best there is at what he does.""  Upon hearing Jackman's casting as the little, ferocious furball I was ill.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Jackman, with the addition of 15 pounds of muscle, delivers the best performance from the ensemble cast.  Of course the two heavy weights, McKellan and Stewart, were good as usual.  Though there was no back story and extremely little detail of the other characters, aside from names and powers, it was fun to see them all transformed on film.  The biggest problem this movie had was the complete alteration of an already complex, mind blowing story.  I guess Hollywood has to do what it's got to do. The plot was extremely weak as well.  With that 40 years of history they could have come up with much better, but then I guess that's why they went through 9 writers before they finalized this current script.<br/><br/>All in all it's a great ride and just the right amount of time.  In this day of 2.5 to 3.5 hour long epics, X-Men comes in at a wonderfully short 1.5 hours.  Tell the story, get to the action and move on to the sequel. Singer has done just that for this first installment of what is sure to be the rival superhero franchise in films between Marvel and DC."

","I saw this on its opening day of July 12 in Australia. Having watched the animated TV series about 9 years ago I knew a ""Fair"" amount about the X men but I wasn't a long term fan of the comic (never bought one). So was I expecting to grow to love the characters of this Bryan Singer film in only 2 hours?<br/><br/>Y-E-S!!!! From Magneto's heartbreaking separation from his parents, to Rogue's near fatal bedroom pash to Wolverine's ""X-treme Fighting"" introduction, I was instantly gripped by these characters. The writing was flawless, the plot moved along very fast but for an action movie I was amazed how little this adventure was plot driven and how majorly it was character driven.<br/><br/>I couldn't believe I was looking at Hugh Jackman, the musical theatre pretty boy as the meanest toughest superhero of them all, Wolverine.......what an acting standout! He even stole the show away from Patrick Stewart and that is no small feat. When I saw how far down the list Anna Paquin's name was on posters I thought ""She'll be lucky to even say anything in the movie let alone act up to her potential........all I can say is the on screen pairing of Wolverine and Rogue is Cinema magic.....I cried when ""That"" scene (you know the one....let sleeping dogs lie....)occurred.<br/><br/>In fact the whole movie overwhelmed me emotionally. I went ""Wow!"" at the action and most action movies don't do that to me (seen one building explode you've seen them all) but the fight scenes, especially the one on top of the Statue of Liberty were fantastic. It was also symbollic to fight for justice and humanity on the symbol of liberty I thought.<br/><br/>Everything was spot on, the bickering of Cyclops and Wolverine, the calm cold war chess game mind set between proffessor X and Magneto and the mesmerizing body of Mystique made sure I didn't look away from the screen once during the whole movie.......heck I even stayed right to the last credit in case there was a ""One Shot"" to give a clue of a sequel.....<br/><br/>The best comic book to screen adaption EVER, even outdid Superman the Movie and that is the ultimate compliment.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Yes, nine years. I was a freshman in high school when I first picked up a copy of Wolverine and was introduced to the world of X-Men. I immediately fell in love with the characters and was reading the trade magazines to find out when I would see a movie.<br/><br/>Now the moment has come, and it was worth it.<br/><br/>This was definitely one of the best comic book films that this comic book fan has ever seen. It had none of the problems that most comic films have. The dialogue wasn't cheesy, it was very realistic. The look of everything was also realistic without being untrue to the comics. I can't believe that they got Wolverine's hair right.<br/><br/>The changes to the characters backgrounds weren't anything that made me mad or dramatically changed the characters. Nothing like the Joker killing Bruce Wayne's parents. They basically just put the characters together at a different time then when they all met in the comic. In the end, it made the characters they chose work well together without 10 hours of background story to cover 35 years of comic book development.<br/><br/>All and all, I have to say that they presented a very dramatic movie story and fully used these amazing characters to their full potential.<br/><br/>Let's hope Spiderman is this good."

","Fear the mutants no more! A long time fan of the X-Men comic  series, I found this to be a spot on interpretation of the decades long saga. The script was terrific, and provided a well balanced story that within it's time constraints (including the cut scenes) introduces the characters and the story very well and won't leave the general public scratching their head. The pacing of action sequences added immeasurably to the story and special care was taken to ensure that the SFX weren't too over the top, meaning that you could actually believe the characters have their powers. Performances all around were fantastic, stand outs being Aussie Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, and Anna Paquin as Rogue. Best of all you don't have to be a comic geek to enjoy this movie!

","Finally Marvel has gotten this right! After miserable showings from previous ventures such as Captain America, The Punisher, and Fantastic Four, (movies which Im sure no one besides myself and a few other die-hard fans have seen) Marvel delivers the goods with X-men.<br/><br/>X-men joins the ranks of the DC movies that made it big, i.e. Superman and Batman. X-men shines thru out, and true comic-book fans will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>I liked the movie because of the great performance by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Hugh Jackman makes this movie, and he does a great job portraying the brooding, rough-edged Wolverine, the typical 'outcast' superhero. I think Hugh was the best possible choice for this role. He also has some of the best lines in the movie. In fact, you could change the name of the movie to 'Wolverine' and it would still do well.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all the attention that Wolverine gets detracts from the other X-men characters in the movie. Their characters seem almost a side-note to the Wolverine story. Patrick Stewart does a stellar job as Professor X, but I wish he had more lines and a bigger role. Stewart was destined to play this character; the resemblance to the comic-book character is un-canny. (as in un-canny X-men) However, I think his screen time was a bit short. In sum, I would have liked to have seen the other X-men characters developed a little more as well.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie kept me glued to my seat throughout. There just enough unanswered questions to set itself up for a sequel, just like a comic book does until the next issue. I also thought the translation from comic-book to movie was well done.<br/><br/>It was well worth the price of admission and I would gladly see it again.<br/><br/>X-celsior !"

"blasmo","8","0","0","16 July 2000"," Much Better Than Expected
","My biggest concern with the film was that it would either be a Matrix clone or a camp version of the comic. Financially speaking, the former would make sense, and the characters do lend themselves to a simple, blast-em' up effects show. Fortunately for us, Bryan Singer and his writers (9+ at last count) have made a film that dares to be intelligent and character driven in a field of summer low-intelligence crap. As a long time X-men fan, I was greatly impressed with what the filmmakers have accomplished. From its opening shots of a Polish holocaust camp, you know you're not in for one of the Joel Schumacher directed Batman crap-o-ramas that would seem to the only way a comic book movie can be made these days. Rogue's entrance is handled with extreme seriousness, and Anna Paquin's terror at her first use of her powers is believable and connects the audience with her immediately. Wolverine's appearance is also memorable, with Hugh Jackman's silhouetted head gulping a beer down right before beating the you-know-what out of a Canadian trucker. The only problem with Wolverine's introduction is that, after being told to get out of the bar, he leaves his beer behind. Logan would never do that. There are a few plot problems, which probably could have been fixed with a few lines about how the X-Men's inexperience leads them to lose their fights at the start, and how Magneto seems to be sheltering those mutants whose outward appearance would never be accepted by humanity (hopefully, in the sequel, they'll add Nightcrawler to the X-Men roster to counter that). Sure, there aren't as many fight scenes as we might want, and that probably has more to do with budgetary concerns than lack of ideas. But what's left is a well-photographed, intelligent statement about intolerance that sits underneath one of the best comic book plots done on film. Hopefully, the success of the film will allow more money for the budget, and a little more action. That said, I also hope they don't give up the intelligence of the series for a simple series of action scenes. It's a great start, much better than we could have hoped for, but I think it may ultimately alienate mainstream audiences who go into the film expecting explosions and getting Magneto in a Holocaust camp at the beginning of the film and quoting Malcolm X at the end. Now let's see about adding a little more action into the mix. And where the heck was Colossus?"

Ditto Anna Paquin, Famke Janssen and -- yes -- even Ray Park.

","The X-Men are the best team of superheroes and now they are finally on the big screen! The reason why the X-Men are so great is that you can actually relate to all of them in some way. Here are the X-Men in the movie:  The telepathic leader, Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the telekinetic and telepathic, Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), Cyclops (James Marsden), who can shoot an optic blast from his eyes, and the weather-controlling Storm (Halle Berry). Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) become the two new X-Men. Rogue can absorb others memories and (if mutant) powers. Wolverine has the ability to heal himself rapidly and has an adamantium-laced skeleton that comes with three claws which pop from his knuckles.<br/><br/>On the Brotherhood, you have the master of magnetism, Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen), the shapeshifting Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), the fierce Sabretooth (Tyler Mane), and the extremely agile Toad (Ray Park).

","Five more minutes with each character would have made this movie a 9. Rogue and Wolverine were developed, as were Magnus and Xavier, but we never got a feel for Cyclops, Jean, Storm, or any of the bad guys.<br/><br/>For example, the sexual tension between Jean and Wolverine wasn't fully developed, and so the conflict between Cyclops and Wolverine was superficial. Mystique, Toad and Sabertooth were basic thugs--we saw their abilities, but not their personalities. Worst, Storm was nothing more than a pretty statue. What motivated her? Why was she there?<br/><br/>Those of us who followed the characters' exploits in the comic books may have taken our knowledge of the characters for granted. I know I did--I loved the film! My wife, however, had no idea who those people were before she sat down in the theater, so while she enjoyed the action and the special effects, the characters were little more than trained monkeys to her. I was ready to give it a 9, but she thought it was a 5.<br/><br/>So, after seeing the amazing way Singer developed the divers characters in the Usual Suspects, I'm deeply disappointed in his treatment of the X-Men's heroes and villains. Maybe X-Men 2 will do better."

I could not of imagined a better suited cast for the movie, everyone was perfect in their roles, especially Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  He was everything that I imagined Wolverine to be.  Bryan Singer was perfect for the job as director, bringing a realistic vision to the movie and not bringing it down to the depths of a hammy comic book adaption.  The writing was also good, it had good pacing and plenty of funny moments and hidden surprises for the X-Fans out there.  The only problem I had with X-Men was the length.  It should have been much longer, I felt that there were scenes that went by too quick that should have been longer, and the back story behind some of the characters should have been fleshed out more.

"mercury-26","8","0","0","17 July 2000"," Should be the biggest movie of the summer
","I thoroughly enjoyed this film. It should satisfy the passive fan (me) and the fanatic. A note to said fanatics: if you want a truly pure adaptation of a comic this complex, you're talking about a five-hour film that costs 200 million dollars or more. The filmmakers have retained the most vital aspect of the comic: its spirit.<br/><br/>Going in I was concerned that, with so many complex characters to introduce and get to know, the film's creators would have trouble fitting it all in and not sacrifice story. Fortunately, Bryan Singer and writer David Hayter understood that, even though this is a team of super heroes, there would need to be a central character or two that are the story's focus. Even better, they choose perhaps the two most interesting X-Men to build the story around: Wolverine and Rogue.<br/><br/>It's no wonder that Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine, is one of the most popular characters ever drawn in a comic book. For one thing, the foot-long claws made of an indestructible metal (called adamantium) that shoot out of his knuckles (SNIKT!) that he has trouble controlling at times. Along with the claws, his entire skeleton is laced with the same adamantium. Much of his life is a mystery to him--he doesn't remember how the metal got there, nor even where or when he was born. And I haven't even gotten to what his real super power is: he heals really fast (but still feels pain) and has the heightened senses and reflexes of a wild animal. For my money, perhaps the coolest comic book character ever created. Like the other mutants of the X-Men, his powers are both a blessing and a curse. The claws and metal-laced bones come in handy when he gets into a tussle, but they also leave him at the mercy of the X-Men's archenemy Magneto, who controls all metals.<br/><br/>In the film, Rogue (Anna Paquin), a teen who has just discovered that she is a mutant, runs away from home and ends up in western Canada, where she comes across Wolverine (Hugh Jackman). This struck me as a huge coincidence, the kind that only a movie can get away with. But then it occurred to me that Professor X (played by Patrick Stewart), the X-Men's leader, may have placed a hypnotic suggestion in Rogue's mind to go to the Canadian Rockies, to the exact town Wolverine was in. I figure this because, in the film's first big action sequence, the two of them run across some bad mutants, Sabretooth and Toad, and are rescued by two of Professor X's students, Cyclops (James Marsden) and Storm (Halle Berry). I suppose the writer thought we'd figure all this out for ourselves. While all the other mutants in Charles Xavier's school have powers that are useful, Rogue's seem at first only a curse: any person she touches, she absorbs their life force, plus their personality traits and super powers, if any. This leaves the person she touches weakened and, depending on how long the contact lasts, comatose or dead. The prospect of a life without the possibility of real human contact is unimaginable, especially for a teenager.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, we find out that Magneto has plans for Rogue. Wolverine adopts her as sort of a big brother and swears to protect her. He has every reason to fear Magneto, but bravely faces up to him anyway (""Who laced your bones with that wonderful metal?"" Magneto's question to Logan, is one of the weirdest lines you're likely to hear in a movie all year). Logan/Wolverine also finds himself siding with Magneto in a way, seeing that humanity is getting ready to wage war on their kind. This is consistent with the comic, and makes Logan difficult for the rest of the team to trust. Magneto (Ian McKellan-perfect casting), is in the process of recruiting mutants to join him in his planned counter-offensive against the rest of humanity. Driving the political steamroller against the mutants is U.S. Senator Robert Kelly, who believes, among other things, that mutant teens should be banned from public schools because they can be considered lethal weapons (a very timely issue to introduce). It's hard not to empathize with Magneto's view: he's seen what happens when a government turns against an entire race, having survived a Polish concentration camp in WWII (illustrated in the film's gripping opening scene). All signs point to a witch-hunt aimed at the mutants and he's not going to stand around and watch it happen. His plan doesn't even involve killing. He's not out for world domination, but merely wishes to change people's thinking. Xavier knows that bloodshed is inevitable, however, given Magneto's 'By Any Means Necessary' position.<br/><br/>The film's not perfect. It's based on a comic, so it has to be campy at times. There's also a few story flaws. For instance, when Rogue runs away from Xavier's school for the gifted, Xavier needs to use a machine that enhances his psychic powers, called 'Cerebro,' to locate her, even though she's only a few blocks away at the train station. Cyclops and Storm are sent to find her and are again confronted with Sabretooth and Toad (a minor character in the comic, but causes major trouble for the X-Men here). Then Xavier gets the police involved, using them only as a shield and endangering their lives as a result. I'm pleased with this scene because it's almost as if the police aren't even there, just like the comic would do. The only scene where Xavier and Magneto really do battle, it's one of the film's best and most imaginative. Then Mystique, another Magneto loyalist, flies in and picks Magneto and company up in a helicopter. Why would a guy as powerful as Magneto need to escape in a helicopter? There's also a brief ode to ""Star Wars,"" seemingly for the benefit of those who actually liked ""Episode I,"" in which Ray Park, who plays Toad, strikes a Darth Maul pose. Tacky and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Like the comic, Professor Xavier's team is still a work-in-progress, still learning how to work together and to use their own super powers. This vulnerability creates jeopardy and gives the franchise somewhere to go: over the course of the series (there will be several of these films, I'm sure), they'll master their powers and teach newcomers how to use theirs. The final scenes leave the door open for the inevitable next chapter, for which I will wait with bated breath.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","First off, I'll apologize right now for the cheesy summary line.  I couldn't help myself :)<br/><br/>As for the movie, I was quite impressed with what, in my humble opinion, has to be the best comic book adaptation yet.  Many fans of the comics were understandably worried about this movie.  After all, we've waited a long time through rumours of it's production, stories about setbacks, even the occasional rumour that the attempt was being cancelled altogether (why does it seem so difficult to make a movie of a Stan Lee comic while DC comics are turning into movies left right and center?).<br/><br/>However, after seeing the first teaser trailers several months ago, the X-citement (sorry again) began to build.  Patrick Stewart as Charles Xavier? Ian McKellan as Magneto?  How can you go wrong with that?<br/><br/>After seeing the movie, I was very impressed.  After all, it's often difficult to adapt such larger-than-life comic book heroes and their trials and tribulations to the big screen.  In comics and cartoons you can get away with much more, in the movies it seems to be much more difficult to suspend disbelief and yet retain the flavour of the comic.  The movie did an admirable job by taking one of the older stories of the X-Men's fight against Senator Kelly's attempted pogrom against mutants and adapting it to reflect today's current woes of racism and prejudice.<br/><br/>The casting was terrific, from the aforementioned Stewart and McKellan roles to that of newcomer Hugh Jackman as Wolverine.  He was spot-on as the surly, short-tempered maverick of the X-Men and he even looked the part, although with those sideburns, almost anyone can look the part.  We even got a look at how Magneto came to be and why he'd be so twisted by the plight of mutants.  It's a shame we couldn't see more character development for the other X-Men, but it's difficult to do when you've only got 2 hours to work with when the comic had several years to develop the history of these people.  Perhaps the inevitable sequels will give us a better glimpse at how each X-Man came to be.<br/><br/>In all, I found the movie to be very enjoyable, I was even able to ignore for a little while the fact that it was shown in what has to be Prince George's worst theatre, worn-out seats, stained screens, overly salty popcorn, and an outdated sound system.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the X-Men, go see it (although, I don't really have to tell you that do I?), if you're not a fan, you just may become one afterwards.  I'm already looking forward to a sequel where we may meet some of the other X-Men, Hank McCoy (The Beast), Gambit, Morph, maybe even a cameo from Spidey himself.  That is unless the Spiderman movie gets a shot in the arm from this release and swings its way into the theatres a little sooner."

The characters were well-delineated, the script was both funny, surprising, and serious.  The theme of intolerance was handled superbly.  The action scenes were amazing--you really felt like these characters could do all these amazing things.  But the film really benefitted from some wonderful performances.  After this, Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine.  His performance still makes me think, two days after seeing the film.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen(Magneto) spar admirably, and although you know who is good and who is bad, the line between satisfyingly hazy, as it should be with such a complex issue.  The best part of the film was the relationship between Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine.    The rest of the actors do very well with their characters, and you just know that the sequels will be even better, as long as Bryan Singer is the director, and the scripts are kept to such exacting perfection.

","Commendable casting, suitable special effects.  For a comic conversion this film rides well along its ambitions.  Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart make the most out of the standard good guy/bad guy arch-nemesis relationship. Hugh Jackman also lends an excellent helping hand in his portrayal of Logan, a down and out loose cannon.<br/><br/>However, as a fan of the comic since the 80's, and as a writer I feel the script falls far below what the film could have been.  The strength of the comic lay not in the wild fantasy of a world where genetically evolved beings exists, nor in the particular heroism of these particular characters, but in the constant HUMAN drama these characters took part in.  For the most part, the story didn't need to be so belabored with explanations of powers or sinister plots, but rather should have focused on why these characters were placed in the situations they were in.  We were given a glimpse of Magneto's past, which gave a bit of insight to his motivations, but the others were enshrined in mystery (which is perhaps the intention, the chance for a sequel seemingly good).<br/><br/>The special effects (computer generated images, massive explosions, & overused roto-cameras) may have been enough to distract the average teen fan from the holes in the plot, but at the expense of acquainting more mature audiences with characters in a situation which reflects existing racial tensions (one of the issues which the creators of the comic sought to address).<br/><br/>Quite simply this is a film about fantastic heroes and a foreboding threat to mankind, instead of being about a group of individuals feeling their existence threatened at every turn.  These are single-faceted characters come to life on the screen who have no resemblance to adults or oppressed people--a pity."

","Comic book  fan or not, you will enjoy this movie.  The film is plot driven with twists and subtle turns not often found in an action movie.  And of course there is the action and special effects we have come to expect in our age.  There are differences that will disappoint the Marvel Comics readers but also some that are engaging which can't be said for all screen adaptations.  The movie is well cast (excepting Cyclops) and focuses on Wolverine who is well played by Hugh Jackman even if he is taller than the 5'4 character.  The movie is not an ensemble, but relegates even Patrick Stewart (Professor X, Jean Luc Picard for you trekkies) to a supporting cast role despite his strong performance.  The movie certainly was a hit for my 13 and 11 year old kids and was appropriate viewing for children their age without excessive violence or adult content.  There is some minor swearing. There is obvious sex appeal for the adults in addition to the story and action.  While, Famke Janssen (strong resemblance Elizabeth Hurley) as Jean Grey, Halle Berry as Storm, and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos - Mystique will keep the men entertained, my wife couldn't stop talking about Wolverine on the way home.  There's not much that I can say about the plot without giving too much away other than, as expected, bad guys try to take over the world and good guys try to stop them.  Certainly an old premise but done with flair. Ian McKellen does a masterful job of portraying the villain Magneto without being over the top and maintaining a believable quality.  In the end, the movie left several openings for a sequel and the audience wanting more.  As a fan of the X-men comics, etc., I expected an ending with a little bit more flourish, but was more than happy with the overall film. 8"

","The ""super-hero"" film is a much maligned genre.  In most cases, this reputation is well deserved.  Face it.  Most super-hero films stink.  Above the usual duds, there are a few that stand out as adequate or slightly better, such as Superman or Batman(1), but even these miss the mark.  The common failure with these films is that they do not capture the essence of the heroes involved in the stories.  They too often ignore anywhere from 10-50 years of history, and they simply cover a typical story with a hero's insignia, or they parody what is wrongly regarded as only a ""kids"" genre. They miss the comic book.  X-Men does not.  More than any super-hero film ever, it stays true to its source.  It captures the spirit of 30+ years of ""The Uncanny X-Men.""  It treats its characters and subject matter seriously and makes it easy to believe that Super-Heroes do exist in the world of this film.  They are not campy parodies or distant icons, but real heroes.  The genre has always held tremendous potential.  It's nice to see someone finally capture some of that lightning."

But oh, the wait was worth it.  I don't care how many screenwriters it has (many props to Joss Whedon of 'Buffy' fame), or the fact that there was no Danger Room, this movie flat out rocked.  Bryan Singer is an amazing director, and his touch kept 'X-Men' from being campy and heavy-handed.  Hugh Jackman as Wolverine-- people, in two years, you won't be able to escape this guy.  But why would you want to? He was absolutely amazing, for fan-boys and non-fan-boys alike (hey, I'm a chick!), the embodiment of everything Wolverine could, would, and had to be. Anna Paquin as Rogue?  You may laugh, but she made me ache, what with the can't-touch-you problem and the inner strength.  What I mean is, just because she doesn't look like Rogue in the comics doesn't mean she can't be Rogue.  I think it was a great opportunity for her to flex her acting ability a bit, and hopefully in the sequels (you know there will be) she'll really get to use the whole flying aspect of her power, too.  Halle Berry was not, however, the person for Storm.  Growing up on the streets of Cairo? I think not.  Angela Bassett would have been awesome (to borrow an idea from the Stranger).  Scott Marsden played Cyclops exactly as he should be, a bit of a self-righteous jerk, but basically a good guy.  Famke Janssen looks EXACTLY like Jean Grey, and Patrick Stewart was his normal elegant self.<br/><br/>Villans:  Ian McKellan is great at whatever he does, but even the Magneto getup towards the end made him look like a little Lego man.  Ms. Romijn-Stamos played a great Mystique (watch how guys in the theaters crane their necks for a better view), and Ray Park's martial arts skills, formerly showcased as Darth Maul, were missing as Toad.  However, did you catch the Ep.One joke?<br/><br/>All in all, I very much appreciate the main arc of the story being Wolverine and Rogue, not Cyclops and Jean.  They were always my favorites.  It was well-written, well-acted, all that good stuff.  This is definitely the new yardstick to judge all comic book films by from now on.  Kevin Smith is right in saying it's one of the top five.  It's plain awesome, which is exactly why I ended up dropping $16 this weekend to see it twice. You have to, so you catch all the little things you miss the first time.  I can't wait for the sequel."

","Being a die-hard fan of the comic book genre, I feel compelled to voice my opinion on this move.  Like all the classic popular comic books the transition to the big screen from the colorful pages of marvel comic was poorly done.  The creators of this movie took too many ""creative licenses"" with the characters, making them almost unrecognizable to their comic book counter parts.  They cast a group of children to play the parts of adults, and their selection of stars left much to be desired.  The original X-men, were more then just a group of kids, with strange powers, they had definition and soul on the pages, you actually cared what happened to them in the comics.  However this is not the case on the big screen.<br/><br/>Lets start off with Cyclops, he is portrayed as a mere child (immature at that) and not nearly as tall as he should have been (yes I know I'm nit picking but its my review so tuff).<br/><br/>Jean Grey since when did she become a Dr?  And most of all when did she loose her telepathy?<br/><br/>Rouge, in the film she couldn't decide weather or not to hang on to that southern draw or give it up.  From what I remember Rouge was born and raised in Louisiana. And was raised by Mystique who forced her to duel with Ms. Marvel and absorb her powers, making her virtually invulnerable, and be able to fly.  None of that was explained in the movie.<br/><br/>Wolverine, probably the only one that they did get right. Although they should have bulked him up a bit more.<br/><br/>Storm by far the most underrated character in the move, (whose idea was it to get Halle Berry ?) again, they made her into a 2 dimensional charactes, they never touched on her claustrophobia, or her past.<br/><br/>All in all the move was exactly what I expected it to be, a cheap money making knock off attempt to bring the famous Marvel name to the big screen. (Did any one consult Stan Lee on this movie?)<br/><br/>The thing that p***ed me off the most was the costumes. So much so I'm not even going to get into it.  (I'd write 5 pages on that alone.)<br/><br/>So for you hard core fans of the X-men, who think they are going to see a really good version of our Marvel heroes brought to the screen, all I can tell you is save your money."

","Turning a comic book into a full length feature film is either wildly successful or a terrible flop.  In recent years, comic book-turned-movies have left much to be desired (Judge Dredd, Spawn).  I went into X-Men expecting it to be good and I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Director Brian Singer does an excellent job of making the characters seem real as opposed to cartoonish or just actors wearing bad Halloween costumes. The opening scene is as powerful as anything to come out of Hollywood since Saving Private Ryan.  The settings are realistic as opposed to the overly Gothic style of Batman and the intrusive colors of Dick Tracy.  It is basically a few mutants fighting it out in an otherwise regular world.<br/><br/>The fight scenes are well thought out and the mutants' powers are used effectively.  For example, Magneto renders Wolverine defenseless by controlling Wolverine's Adamantium frame and claws.  Also the powers are not over-exaggerated, allowing clear winners and losers in fight scenes.<br/><br/>The plot was solid and as intriguing as possible.  Of course it has to be some large-scale diabolical plan to alter humanity or destroy it as in any super hero movie.  The outstanding aspect of the plot is that it is a main story with interesting subplots often left out in comic book movies.  We see the struggle between mutants and humans, between Magneto and Professor X, and genuine character development of the X-Men, with an emphasis on Wolverine.<br/><br/>I'm sure X-Men comic book stalwarts will be quick to point out several inconsistencies between the film and the comic book, but I encourage them to dismiss it.  You don't have to read 30 years worth of X-Men comics to appreciate the film, but fans of the comic book should not be disappointed either.<br/><br/>The entire cast gives above average to outstanding performances.  Hugh Jackman is excellent as Wolverine, and the chemistry between Ian MacKellan and Patrick Stewart is just what the relationship between Magneto and Professor X calls for.  Despite comments from critics that Anna Paquin is too young to play Rogue, she delivers in that role as well although more of a southern accent is needed.<br/><br/>In short, expect many sequels as there are quite a few ways the film can go. The last 10 minutes scream for sequel and there is probably already plans to make it. Besides, we still have to meet The Beast, Gambit, and a slew of others."

The X-Men, as a comic, as a series, and as a movie, are not about frustrating minutiae.  They are about fighting racism, living in a world that, to quote the comics as well as Hugh Jackman, ""hates and fears"" them, and most of all, they are about family.  This was the greatest comic book movie since Superman, and may have even surpassed it.  But more over, this was one of the greatest movies I have ever seen.  Yes, I read the comics, but that only heightened my enjoyment of the film.  The cast and crew are to be commended for a truly X-cellent movie.  They did not choose to go over the top with effects, or inside jokes, or anything like that.  Singer made an outstanding movie that would impress audiences across the board, without letting down hardcore fans.  How anyone can question this movie is beyond me.  As a fan, there were some discrepancies I didn't care for, but they paled in comparison to everything that was done right.  And for those of you whining about the effects, I'm terribly sorry this wasn't Matrix 2.  That's not what this movie was about.  The effects were there, but they were merely the punctuation.  Some characters were a bit underdeveloped, but with a core group of 6 heroes, what could you really expect.

While recent comic based action films have developed into over priced rehashes of the 60's batman series, X-men is so much more than that.  It's true that not every character is developed, but Bryan Singer did an excellent job considering the movie's running time.  Plus, as any comic fan might realize, how many times did you actually see Sabertooth in the comics before his motivations were discovered?  This movie is an excellent blend of action, character development and humor.  It isn't the most action filled summer block buster (MI2), nor is it the funniest (Scary Movie), but it is certainly the most entertaining, and worth the ticket price.  It manages to do what few movies can...appeal to all movie goers. The brains who want a story will be satisfied, but not at the expense of anyone who wants a great action film.

","I was a little weary when I had heard the X-Men were going to be made into a movie.  At first sight of the guy who was playing Wolverine, I feared the worst.  I mean, what are you gonna expect from a bunch of people running around in spandex.  <br/><br/>Thankfully, however, we were spared spandex in place of leather.  I don't believe they could've picked a better cast for the X-Men.  Halle Berry was kinda weak as the part of Storm.  Hugh Jackman amazed me.  Even though he was much taller than Wolverine, he played him exactly like you would read in the comic.  I was amazed.  He has the character down.  Other than Wolverine, I enjoyed Rogue.  Besides her being a total babe, she did a great job.  Anna Paquin was perfect for the role.  The other actors were decent for their roles.  Patrick Stewart makes a good Professor X.  Ian McKellan an okay Magneto, but nothing like you'd imagine from the comic.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this movie did the comic justice.  Except for a few complaints it was good.  I didn't however see Cannonball or Colossus in the movie.  Go figure.  And who knows, maybe the X-fans will get their wish next time around.  What better mutant to kick off the second movie than Gambit. Least that's what they're saying.  I'll definitely be in line for the next."

","Well I went in expecting good things and I was not disappointed.  As with any comic the main plot was weak, but there was reason behind it.  They took the time to really get into the characters, not all of them mind you, but it was still very well done.  Bryan Singer is an excellent director and I think I will continue to be impressed by his work. ( I only hope they bring him back for the sequal)  I feel that this movie will do well and expect other comics to make the move to movie form shortly, because of the success of the X-men movie."

","For the normal person, this movie could be an okay movie to go see, but for fans of the original X-Men comic, this is a lot more than just any movie.<br/><br/>Although I did enjoy it, I found myself wondering why the movie has to be such a setup for a sequel. Because of the whole setup there really wasn't much time for any real plot, story or character development. Singer (The Director) did a good job on most of the details of the X-Men, their powers but seemed to try to include too much information that he couldn't fully explain or elaborate on.<br/><br/>However, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine was amazing. He brought the real human and edgy qualities of Wolverine out into one person and made him more real than many of the other characters. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart were also really great in their scenes together.<br/><br/>Overall, I liked the movie but there were a lot of places where it could have been better. Maybe if the studio hadn't rushed Singer and made him cut nearly 30 minutes it could have been better, but for now we'll have to wait until the second movie (if it happens) to see what can really be done with the story of the X-Men.<br/><br/>W.

","After much anticipation X-Men has arrived... and it is one hell of a ride!!<br/><br/>There is little to criticise as the characters are established well and the fight scenes are evenly dispersed throughout. The special effects are flawless and the action is wild! However, this would have left me cold if the plot, dialogue and the characterisation had been ignored. However, the team behind X-men have succeeded in every area!<br/><br/>The few sore points in the film were as follows though: 1) Storm was grossly under developed. The few bits of dialogue she was given were truly lame and she was the only sore point in the cast. However this was not Halle Berry's fault but then again, she did not look to be enjoying herself in the role. 2) Despite Wolverine's one liners the film, for me, truly lacked a sense of humour. A few more laughs would have made the film a little less serious and was sorely needed. 3) Senator Kelly was not a powerful enough presence. However I say this only because he was the centre of the X-Men add  campaign yet... where was he???<br/><br/>and that was it!! That is all that I didn't like! The rest was excellent!! The standouts were obviously Hugh Jackman's Wolvering who is being universally praised. Anna Pacquin exuded innocence and the sex appeal of the comic character while also giving a very moving performance. She was definetly the biggest surprise of the film. Mystique was AMAZING!! She was the perfect villain. She had one line but the way she moved, her eyes and her eventual fate was all spot on! Another surprise was Ray Park's Toad who provided some nifty moves and some much needed comic relief.<br/><br/>All in all one hell of a movie. The two ppl I saw it with were non-fans but they agreed it was one hell of a ride! I'm a big Batman fan and this almost knocked the original Batman from it's perch. They now sit side by side as the definitive comic to film translations... so far. However, X-Men 2 has plenty of potential! Grade - A"

"gookie-2","Null","0","0","16 July 2000"," where's the third act?
","I am a fan of movies that do not conform to the traditional Hollywood ""Three Act"" formula, movies that break away from expectations and focus on character rather than effects, and hence, based on descriptions, I thought I would enjoy X-Men much more than I did.  Let it be known that I have never read an X-Men comic and thus cannot compare the character development to those well loved tomes.  The acting in the film ranges from charismatic and wonderfully larger than life (McKellan, Jackman) to awkward and forgettable (Halle Berri (sp?)) and the effects are less impressive than I expected. Its not a bad film, just not a particularly involving, exciting, or thrilling one.  It seems, ultimately, like a long, elaborate setup for a much more thrilling sequel.  There are too many heroes for any tension to be built in the action scenes (when you have so many mutants to save the day, where is the danger?) and the ""climactic"" battle between Magneto and the X-Men seemed like the middle of a movie, not the end.  I left the theater feeling like they had forgotten to show the final reel, the one where the heros come dangerously close to failing and have a huge showdown with the bad guys, resulting in one spectacular battle to the end...  I guess I expected a comic book movie to satisfy the typical summer-movie-arc and this one did not.  Somewhat entertaining, but wasting too much potential."

","Finally the blockbuster of the summer has arrived.  Want to take a action-packed thrill ride loaded with some of the best visual effects, terrific acting jobs and some of the best one-liner humor in recent films? If so, then you owe it to yourself to see ""X-Men"".  And soon.<br/><br/>Plotline revolves around the plot of an evil mutant who is out to wage war against humanity, and his old friend and now arch rival, who believes that humans and mutants can co-exist.<br/><br/>This is such a star studded cast that I'm going to tone down my usual critique of the actors to insure I cover everybody.  I'm going to start with Charles Xavior, better known as Professor X.  Smartly played by Patrick Stewart, the cult status this role will provide him may even eclipse that of Jean-Luc Picard, and with good reason.<br/><br/>Halle Berry plays Ororo Munroe, who goes by the name of Storm.  Nicely played, nothing spectacular, but she fits in well and never detracts from the story.  James Marsden chimes in as Scott Summers, the man they call Cyclops.  Leader of the X-Men, this is also a well played role, if not a little thin.  Not a lot of meat in the script for any of the X-Men, but I'll explain that in a bit.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen plays Dr. Jean Grey, a telepathic/telekinetic mutant who is Professor X's right hand.  She runs afowl of Senator Robert Kelly (maddeningly played by Bruce Davison), only to be searched out by him when needed.<br/><br/>Tyler Mane plays Wolverine's nemesis, Sabretooth, Ray Park follows up Darth Maul with a kinetically furious turn as Toad.  Rebecca Romijn-Stamos gives a stellar turn as Mystique, a shape shifting mutant.  Not much in the way of dialog from her, but she plays smartly, and figures in the ending of this one.  Sir Ian McKellan plays the lead evil mutant Magneto.  Seeing his parents drug away in Nazi occupied Poland simply because they were Jewish is the impetus for his never wanting to be ""labeled"" again.  He will control his own destiny.  If normals force registration and identification as mutants then he will.........<br/><br/>Now, on to the real primary characters in this one....Hugh Jackman plays Logan.  We all know him better as Wolverine.  Living as a loner, unable to remember his past, Logan moves from town to town, engaging in local toughman contests to provide a living.  This is so well done that I simply have to thank John Woo and the entire ""M:I2"" cast for hanging on to Dougray Scott. Jackman oozes Wolverine, and delivers the best characterization in the movie.  One day Logan runs across a stowaway in his truck, her name? Marie. Now calling herself Rogue, Marie has the ability to draw out the life force of any normal human.  Well played by Anna Pacquin, breathing new life into the voluptious southern belle.  I have to admit I didn't think she'd do well in the role, but she proved me and every other nay-sayer wrong.<br/><br/>The special effects are top notch, the story is excellent.  Acting, not a flaw or bad word to say about the entire bunch.  Bryan Singer has done an outstanding job bringing this to the big screen.  You don't have to be a fan of the comic series to enjoy this movie, and if you are then the slight differences between the movie heroes and the drawn ones is inconsequential.<br/><br/>""X-Men"" is classic summer ""popcorn"" fare, and should provide Fox Studios with just the franchise it needs.

I knew this film would use this legacy as it saw fit, but would it sacrifice itself for the 'facts', or just pillage the past for some cheap thrills?<br/><br/>Well, in 'X-Men', Bryan Singer seems to have perfectly captured the essence of every character, every motivation, every dynamic, and melded them into a new adventure which is logical, surprising and inspiring at the same time.

"austig37","9","0","0","16 July 2000"," A set-up movie that truly does set-up...
","In the past, directors have given us weak attempts at translating the pages of our favorite comics on to the big screen.  We have flops like Punisher, Captain America, and the Batman sequels.  In fact, the only two remotely well-made comic book adaptions I can think of, are the original Batman and, I'm going out on a limb here, Spawn.  Movies are two hour pieces of eye candy, while comics are a continuing epic that not only have time to focus in on action, but also the character development of their heroines.  It is in this rare occurrence, though, with the X-Men movie, that that line between comics and movies has been crossed, and a very successful crossing at that.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer, the director of X-Men, has crafted the greatest adaption of a comic book on to the screen that I have ever seen.  Throughout the movie, each character, whether villain or X-Men, has development, with the exception of Storm whose development I suppose was lost due to her being Halle Berry playing Storm.  Logan, a.k.a Wolverine, is the focus, and who better I ask?  He is almost everyone's favorite X-Men, and with good reason, he has frekin' adamantium claws, people!  The script, I must say, gave me great delight.  It is far better than what the early buzz gave it credit for.  I didn't get a chance to discover the writer, but kudos that that (those) certain person (people).  To me, the script came off as very intelligent, almost too intelligent.  When you combine that with the great performances given by Hugh Jackman (Wolverine), Anna Paquin (Rogue), Patrick Stewart (Professor Xavier), Ian McKellen (Magneto), and, of course, how can I not mention Ray Park (Toad) for his amazing moves and Famke Janneson for her being not only beautiful, but also suiting Jean Gray just fine, you get one helluva pace that just doesn't quit.  The movie seriously flew bye, as my childhood memories of reading the comic flashed before my eyes.  It is a true bliss to finally see your favorite characters up their on the screen, exactly the way you imagined it.<br/><br/>What is so great about this movie, is not just the movie, but the way it sets itself up for something even greater.  This is truly one, great set-up for something bigger to come.  As I said before, each character had some sort of development.  Some examples include Sabretooth and Wolverine's dilemma concerning Wolvie's dogtags, also Wolvie's origin, the love triangle between Wolvie, Cyclops, and Jean Gray, Magneto's struggle, Ice Man growing up, the Mystique and Rogue connection (I'm not spoiling it), and even new characters (I can only hope Gambit, my favorite X-Men, next to Wolvie, or course).<br/><br/>Bryan Singer has left the door open, and I can tell you that whatever comes again is going to make all the fans very happy.  This movie is a gift from God.  It not only satisfies for the two hours, but it also leaves you thinking about the sequel, and the sequel after that.  Only time will tell. For now, ignorance is bliss, and you can bet your sweet-@$$ that I'm seeing it again, and again if I have to.  Can't nobody hold me down, bub!"

Obviously, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen steal the show. Portraying Scott Summers as a preppie refugee from Beverly Hills, 90210 was definitely a good move. The special effects were great without overtaking the movie.<br/><br/>That said, this movie was a little confused. On one hand, it tried to deal with substantial themes of fear, human rights, being seen as a freak by others, etc. However, when you get right down to it, the plot could be summed up as '""The Heroes"" must save ""The City"" from ""Certain Destruction"" at the hands of ""The Villains.""' This is standard 60s-era DC Comics boilerplate and the exact same plot as ""James Bond: The World is Not Enough"" and ""Mystery Men."" However, ""Mystery Men"" was a spoof, and the Bond films were always a bit self-deprecating. ""X-Men"" tries to be much more serious but then opts for a formulaic plot (and it's not self-conscious about it at all). It would have been a great summer movie if the deeper themes were more well-developed OR if there were no deeper themes at all and they just opted for a fun action movie. As it was, I came away feeling that it claimed to be so much more, but they copped-out at the end, leaving me with just another big-budget summer movie.<br/><br/>It was a nice setup for what I hope are good sequels, though.<br/><br/>-Dean"

","I enjoyed X-Men more than I thought I would, especially after some of the leaked reviews that tore the rough cuts to shreds.  My only prior knowledge of the X-Men came from the Fox cartoon, but I was very pleased to see most of the characters make it into the first installment of the movie franchise. Standout performances from Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen anchored the movie, along with very cool SFX.<br/><br/>Basically, there were a few key problems with the movie, but nothing that stopped me from enjoying it thoroughly.  For one thing, the film is at least 20 minutes too short.  We could have gone more in-depth with a lot of the background, or the focus of the story, or pretty much anything--the movie was very condensed.  Also, the fight scenes, while interesting, were not very impressive on a Matrix/Episode I level.  I have to give the film-makers credit, because it's hard to choreograph for somebody who has claws coming out of his hands, making it pretty difficult for an opponent to block realistically.  The movie was also definitely PG-13; some of the humor could have been much more adult, but I guess it's nice that the mom sitting next to me with her 9-year old didn't have to worry.  James Marsden, Famke Janssen, and Halle Berry all turned in fair performances.<br/><br/>Overall, a good movie worth the price of admission.

"Mancer","10","0","0","15 July 2000"," This movie is the best at what it does...
","A lot can be said for movies adapted from comics, most of it bad. Occasionally though, a gem will appear on the screen that will cause you to completely rethink your opinion of comic book adaptations.<br/><br/>The X-Men is one such movie.<br/><br/>Thankfully, 20th Century Fox has done away with long opening credits which allows the move to get right into the action.  A Godsend in my opinion.<br/><br/>The movie opens hauntingly at Nazi internment camp, and the rollercoaster ride continues on to the deep south, Washington DC, Alaska and finally to New York.<br/><br/>I have to admit, when I first saw who had been cast in which roles, I had my doubts.  Patrick Stewart is excellent in his role as Professor X, but it's Hugh Jackman who steals the show with his insightful interpretation of Wolverine.  Astoundingly believable, Jackman takes the role of Wolverine seriously, putting every ounce of his acting ability into it, and delivers the goods in spades.  Obviously Jackman found the character of Wolverine appealing, as he seemed to have a ball playing what in my mind would have been a very difficult role.<br/><br/>An addition that I found both fun and charming was the number of cameo appearances that Brian Singer added to this flick, especially at Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters.  I found myself trying to pick which particular mutant was which.  I managed to spot Shadowcat, Karma, Jubilee, Pyro and Blob, though I'm sure I missed as many as I spotted.  Added to this was a school with a  large number of students, leading to greater plausibility to the cover of a school for ""gifted youngsters""<br/><br/>The script writing was without flaw, easily bringing the X-Men into the ""Naughties"" and giving them  an air of modern, streetwise heroes that the comic has lacked for some time.  The script holds nothing back, confidently reinforcing the relationships the characters share time and time again.<br/><br/>Ultimately though it was the the combat scenes that, in my opinion, were to make or break this movie, and I'm happy to say that once again I was not disappointed.  Too many times, a good movie has been destroyed by badly choreographed combat.  The X-Men movie not only shows that a comic book fighting style can be successfully brought to the big screen, but makes it breathtakingly believable.  Coupled with special effects that were used only so far as to enhance the story, and not make the movie a circus of pyrotechnics had me feeling satisfied, but wanting more at the story's conclusion.<br/><br/>That having been said, there were one or two aspects of the film that I found slightly disappointing.  Firstly I felt that the heroes were rather underpowered and lacked skill in the use of their powers.  In particular I found Jean Grey and Storm's power levels were seriously curtailed, and I can't help but feel that this was done so that they wouldn't outshine their males counterparts.  One one hand, Storm and Jean felt as if they were drawn from early in their comic careers, whereas Cyclops and Wolverine seemed drawn from much later one, with far more control of thier unique abilities. Granted, this does leave the characters somewhere to go in future sequels, I feel it could have been handled better.<br/><br/>Secondly, I found the relationship that the young Rogue and Wolverine shared was too much like the relationship Wolverine shared with young Shadowcat in the comics.  This was disconcerting, as I was expecting Rogue and Wolverine to have quite an antagonistic relationship as opposed to the almost father/daughter relationship that was portrayed.  To me this felt wrong, and I couldn't help but feel disgruntled at the reworked character dynamics.<br/><br/>Of course the good news is that I loved the movie, regardless of it's minor faults.  I feel for the average viewer who has no real experience with the X-Men this movie is going to be a resounding hit.  For X-fans though, I feel it may not be quite the same success."

"jdimstr31","5","0","0","16 July 2000"," An OK distraction
","Let's get one thing straight. Patrick Stewart is WAY too talented to be doing this kind of thing. He is excellent as Xavior, but his talents are still wasted. In an age when style counts more than substance, X-Men fares better than most comic book adaptions. It ranks better than any of the Batman films, but that's not so tough since they haven't made a good one yet. But this film makes the typical Hollywood flaw, it lets its' visuals and volume level get in the way of story and character development. Sure it loud, fast paced, and visually impressive. It makes for a good summer movie, and it's technical achievements assure it good sales when it hits video. But is there anything really worthwhile here? Not really. There is nothing within the characters or the story that really get to you. You simply do not care about the characters and their situations. You are not given the chance to. Instead, you're beat over the head with more meaningless, albeit impressive, action sequences. Unfortunately, we live in an age when that equates good filmmaking to mass audiences. Hollywood has only gotten the comic book translation right two times. The most recent was The Crow. It, like X-Men, was visually stunning. But The Crow made room for character development. You cared about what was going on. It had real emotion and an incredible performance by Brandon Lee. But the greatest comic adaption in Hollywood history is Superman. The original and its' sequel stand head-and-shoulders above all the others. They had incredible visuals and epic action scenes. But most importantly, they had character dimension. They all served a purpose to the story. The action served the story. They also remained loyal to the characters. Even the lesser Supmerman sequels, while not very good movies, remained faithful to the characters. If you've ever read an X-Men comic, you'll see many changes to the characters. They are either flat background characters that are thrown in because the audience expects to see them (Storm, Cyclops), or they are completely changed to fit into a modern movie. The biggest example of that is Wolverine. First off, he doesn't have the same demeanor, or accent, as the comic character. He was just over 5' tall, now he's over 6'. And he wore a bright spandex costume, not leather. The leather may be more 90's but it's just not true to the vibrant nature of the comic. So, all in all, I was very disappointed. It's just another flash in the pan. It will make a load of money, but will not stand the test of time. No one will remember this movie 20 years from now, except the fanboys whose lives revolve around X-Men. Still, it looks good so I give it 5 out of 10."

","I really went into this movie prepared for the worst.  As a lifelong comic fan, I had found the X-Men and its family of titles were becoming practically unreadable.  The unrelenting hype surrounding this film screamed ""flop"" - as if Marvel were trying to milk everything they could out of it. Anyone who has been into comics for more than 3 years knows that this would be standard operating procedure.  Not to mention their abysmal parade of cinematic failures (Blade would be the exception, but then again, it hardly resembled the comic character.)<br/><br/>Thankfully, they got this one right.  The opening scene made me sit up and take notice, and they held me throughout most of the remainder of the movie.  The first half in particular was perhaps the best adaptation of a comic I have ever seen.  It did a great job of highlighting the characters, and setting up the conflict.  I am not particularly fond of the comic version of Wolverine, but they hit a home run with this one.  He looks great - rough, tough, and ready to rumble without being a complete psycho.<br/><br/>Needless to say, the effects were great.  Magneto, in particular, has some spectacular scenes.  I did find the fight scenes to be a little cartoonish, however.  Wolverine-Sabretooth promised to be the all-time heavyweight championship match, but it didn't deliver a knockout. Hopefully, they'll work on their choreography next time (Ray Park is tragically underused in this one!)<br/><br/>After the well-conceived and -executed first half, the film slowly grinds to the finish line.  It wasn't a total letdown, but I really expected more.  Of course, they had to leave a few threads dangling; these will no doubt be tied up in the sequel(s).<br/><br/>All in all, I came out of X-Men very satisfied.  This is a very promising start to what will (hopefully) be a series of quality movies based on Marvel Comics.  The high points of this movie more than balance out its flaws.  I guess the best comment I can make is that it made me a fan of the X-Men again."
"DECKARD-50","Null","0","0","16 July 2000"," Hugh Jackman, X-Men could be best new film series
","I read the X-men comics as a kid who's parents were divorcing, couldn't play football that great (though in Texas I was supposed to) and my only real friends were my cousins.  I got a five dollar allowance every two weeks and with that I bought the X-men comics.  Without a doubt, this movie is the truest adaption to a comic ever.  I know they aren't in spandex.  I know that not every X-man you want in there is in there.  But, a tale about unwanted people who fight for the rest of mankind's freedom despite the consequences, that is what drew me in as a kid.  I can relate to that.  Is some of the movie corny?  Sure.  Are some of the special effects not up to par with, say, Matrix?  Sure.  But, can I identify, root for, and sympathize with these characters?  Absolutely and instantly.  The dialogue is funny, smart, to the point, and, I mean this as a great compliment, simple.  The action is built very well and you are with everyone of these guys the moment you see them.  There are great movies that take the entire movie to develop characters (i.e.- Rain Man, Driving Miss Daisy).  There are even better ones that do it instantly (i.e.- Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark). Having discussed a little about the movie, let's discuss the best thing in the movie.  Hugh Jackman is the most exciting presence on the screen since Harrison Ford blasted Greedo in Star Wars.  Of the new generation of Hollywood stars, I like Russell Crowe, Edward Norton, Matt Damon...I love Brendan Fraser.  But, Hugh Jackman had me on his side the first second I saw him in the film.  I eagerly await anything his does in the future, and I darn sure await the next installment-Wolverine-X-Men Part II (maybe?).  If someone out there gives best newcomer awards to actors - Hugh Jackman can take it home now.  I'm especially glad, above all else, I have a son who saw the movie-with his mom and dad.  Thanks."

","I was very pleased with the movie. Granted, it is true what Ebert said that they focused too much on introducing the characters, but nevertheless it was a good start (since they plan on making this into a movie series ala Star Trek, Star Wars, and James Bond). I do wish they didn't cut out a 45 minute section however (yes, the movie is 45 minutes shorter than originally planned), I feel that if they let it go a bit longer they might have been able to develop the plot slower and build towards a better climax.<br/><br/>
Overall, the effects were stunning, the plot was decent, and the action (even though not as much as the action in The Matrix) was great. I never was a major X-Men fan, but I have changed after seeing this movie.. and cannot wait until X-Men 2!"

It, to my surprise, was very well-done, with a great caliber of actors and special effects. It wasn't too long at all, if anything, it could have been a little longer.

I grew out of the routine as I got older, but when I heard that they had made a movie, I was so excited. I couldn't wait to see it.  Well it was worth the long wait, the movie was wonderful. I think it was smart that they didn't put alot of the X-Men in the movie that would just make the story more complicated, and I think anytime you base a movie on a comic don't use alot of the characters or you'll just get a bad movie, perfect example ""Batman & Robin.""  Wolverine is played wonderfully by Hugh Jackman, he is the toughest S.O.B., he's the guy everybody likes. The special effects are wonderful and the movie is just great.

The movie just assumed that everyone watching was a fan of the comic. I didn't expect much going into the movie and I left with just that.<br/><br/>P.S.

","A marvelous, spectacular movie!!! Very un-Batmanny, un-cartoony. None of that dark, brooding self-indulgent crap that has marred so many cartoon adaptations in the past. In fact, if I didn't know this was an adaptation of a comic book, I honestly wouldn't have guessed it.<br/><br/>First, the special effects are genuinely a new generation of anything seen before. Truly! I know that may sound trite, and maybe not appealing, but that's one of the reasons the effects here are sooooo good. They are so smooth and integrated into the story that at no time did I think: ""Oh, a special effect."" I just found myself watching and believing and enjoying the movie without much self consciousness or self-awareness of being an audience member. And that's a high achievement for ANY movie.<br/><br/>I am NOT a fan of the genre, particularly, but I thoroughly enjoyed myself at this one. And I suspect that the great actor Patrick Stewart may find his star with this role. He was so good, and so believable and natural that I had to squint my brain to even recall that he was Captain What's-his-name for all those years (and I love that portrayal, too, and hope to see a few more movies yet in that franchise). And the entire cast was wonderful too.<br/><br/>Great job. Fantastic accomplishment-- made a fan out of me.

","Bryan Singer and crew did a great job on the film.  The effects were not revolutionary as The Matrix or anything, but unlike many effects-laden no plot movies (not The Matrix,) the ones it did use were used to further the plot, rather than just for a spectacle.  It definitely kicked the living crap out of MI:2, as far as summer movies go.  If you are not a comic book movie fan, DON'T go see this movie.  If you are a fan or know something about the comic, you will have a great time at this movie.  Despite the film looking like it could have been just a brainless, effects heavy, one-liner infected disappointment from its trailers, it is hardly that.  Wolverine and Mystique stood out a bit from the rest.  Storm (Halle Berry) was a bit disappointing, not because of her acting ability (obviously,) but because of the lack of use by the movie to make her interesting.  She could be much improved upon.

X Men is different because A. It's well written, with good dialogue and characters you care about B. uses its budget to show special effects that other films are too lazy to show and C. when you walk out of the theater you don't feel ripped off AGAIN!

","So, the X-Men, the world's ultimate superteam, finally reached the big screen. At first, I was a skeptic: ""How could they adequately address each character?"" ""Will the movie have story or only action?"" ""Will these actors be able to portray these well-known, set characters accurately?""  The answer is a resounding YES! <br/><br/>This movie gave us the background and story that a really good sci-fi needs in order to make it.  The characters were established, and a basic, yet intense, good vs. evil theme was set. I got to know all the characters and got a taste of each personality. True, there is a Wolverine-Rogue focus, but the movie lost nothing. <br/><br/>The actors worried me.  Sure Stewart and McKellen are big hitters and can hold a movie (or series) together, but what about the rest of this basically new cast?  I was amazed at how well the actors portrayed their comic counterparts.  Any hardcore Marvel fan will be able to see the characters in each performance. Great accent, Halle! <br/><br/>Overall, with great action and great story, X-men promises to be a film worth noticing.

","As soon as ""X-Men"" came onto the screen my first reaction was ""Whoa"". My friends and I were surprised this movie was as good as it was. We were expecting a typical super hero movie like ""Batman"" or ""Superman"", What we got was not just a superhero movie but a ""movie movie"", Meaning it had a great plot and great acting.<br/><br/>James Marsden (Cyclops) was extremely good, You could tell he was really p***ed at Logan but didn't hate him. Halle Berry was awesome, She pulled it off extremely well, And this is coming from a huge Storm fan, I think she was great and I want more of her in the sequels. Tyler Mane (Sabertooth) was simply a bad ass, He was simply oozing, ""badass"". ""Scream for me"" was one of my favorite lines in the movie. Toad was awesome, I was expecting him to just be this stupid little sidekick, but he was extremely cool. Mystique is the only character I didn't like, I really thought she was playing second fiddle the entire time. A lot of people think she's sexy but she's just disgusting.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart is Xavier, he was born to play that role, the same goes for Ian McKellan as Magneto. Throughout the entire movie I kind of felt sorry for Magneto, from the Holocaust scene to the fact that he didn't know his machine would kill people. Hugh Jackman is Wolverine, no one else would have been this cool. He played the part Canadian which was very good. Famke Janssen was a very good Jean Grey, I could feel her and Marsden's chemistry when they were on screen together, you could tell they were in love.<br/><br/>The special effects are very effective, pardon the pun, they weren't like in the matrix, which I hate, The effects were good because they were only used when necessary not like in the matrix when they'd use slow-motion to show someone eating a potato chip. Lastly, Anna Paquin was a very convincing Rogue, her accent was great, as well as her acting.<br/><br/>In the end this movie makes you want only one thing...A sequel. If they can make the Sentinels look good, I mean really bad ass, it will rock! I give this movie an a 10 out of 10."

I was expecting to be let down on many levels, and I wasn't at all.  Jackman totally made up for his physical ""faults"" with his acting, capturing Wolverine's whole character in 96 minutes.<br/><br/>As far as the movie being too short... aren't you SUPPOSED to be left wanting for more?  The ending of the movie leaves room for so many sequels that you know you'll get more in a couple of years.  You have to keep in mind that some of the character development will be short.

"cougar-10","7","0","0","13 July 2000"," Better than I expected
","I have collected X-Men comics for many years and was not expecting too much from the movie but I was pleasantly surprised.  It was pretty good.  Based in reality and more science fiction than fantasy I believed such a future could exist just around the corner.  Unlike many comic book adapted movies X-Men is not cartoony.  The spirit of the characters has been preserved although comic book continuity has not.  Although Anna Paquin (Rogue) could not sustain a Southern accent I sympathised with her ordeal as a confused young woman.  Hugh Jackman won me over as Wolverine (although he was not gruff enough or hairy enough) but I was disappointed with Sabretooth. What a wimp!!  Not vicious enough and to see him as Magneto's lapdog was embarrassing.  Mystique was pretty good but I do have one criticism here. Mystique is a shape shifter.  She takes on the appearance of something or someone else including their clothes etc.  When she becomes Wolverine and mimics his claws, the claws are still part of her flesh therefore when she battles the real Wolverine they would not break off as portrayed but would be sliced off an she would bleed.  It was interesting to see Toad as a major baddie.  I actually thought that he seemed the most powerful of the villains, quite the opposite of his rather lame comic book persona.  On the whole I recommend this movie both to the general public and to the fanboy, although I did think the action sequences were a bit weak by comic book standards.  Watch for the cameo and background appearances of a multitude of marvel characters and enjoy the jibes and in-jokes if your a fanboy. Happy viewing."

Outdo BATMAN & ROBIN and everyone falls in love with you.  Well, what kind of accomplishment is that?<br/><br/>All they had to do was stay true to the source material, do some competent casting, and load it down with FX.  But no.  They decide to fail in each one of those categories.<br/><br/>SOURCE MATERIAL - Xavier has to introduce Sabertooth to Wolverine.  Enough said.<br/><br/>CASTING - Halle Barry as Storm?  She's like a child playing dress-up. Cyclops looks trendy.  Jean is old enough to be everyone's mother.  Magneto looks too old to go to the bathroom himself, let alone threaten the world. And Wolverine?  Contrary to what EVERYONE keeps on SAYING, he is NOT Wolverine.  Not even CLOSE!  Just what are you all on?  Hugh Jackman is taller than Cyclops, and way too skinny.  And Singer decided to trade his log cabin feel for a Harley/trucker feel.<br/><br/>FX - Did you see any?  If there's one thing you would've thought you could count on from Hollywood, it's FX, but not here.  Nor is there any good stunt-work, choreography, or anything.  The action SUCKS.  It looks like it was all done by ameteurs.  Where the hell did all of the budget go? Probably into things like Halle Barry and her three lines, or the 3-D morphing map.  Money well spent, all right.<br/><br/>Oh, there is so much more to complain about...<br/><br/>Magneto doesn't have a costume, because Singer wanted him to be more down-to-earth, so he gives him a LAIR instead.  Oh, but no Dr. Evil is complete without his obligatory invention of doom.  Tell me, why did Magneto need such a plot device as the mutation-triggering machine?  Isn't his magnetism itself the plot device?  Oh, but that's not enough, I guess.  So, instead of just showing Magneto kicking ass, they take the money they could've spent on his electro-magnetic sphere and put it towards lame-ass white radiation.  Other casualties of this stupid plot device include half the running time of the movie, Senator Kelly, and oh yeah - any hint of respectability.<br/><br/>The thing that gets to me the most is, I think I hate this movie more because I can picture watching it from a non-fan point of view.  Wolverine has a thing against Cyclops.  Because.  He has an attraction toward Jean. Also, just because.  There is NO flesh given to these relationships, they just pop into existence.<br/><br/>Erik Lewald should have made this movie."

","I started collecting comic books back in the early '80s. Primarily the X-Men. Around '85 my friends and I got together to try to figure out how they'd make this a movie. We knew then that it couldn't be done. X-Men were Wolverine, Storm, Collossus, Kitty Pryde, and Nightcrawler at the time... We could see the movie industry trying with the special effects they had then and failing miserably. Since then, the makeup of the X-Men has changed - new and old characters joining and leaving. Technology is finally cutting-edge enough to make the mutant abilities believable.<br/><br/>I feared that the producers would make this a special effects and action movie with a script that would only equal the technology of the '80s. I was more than pleased with the results. This is the perhaps the best written script for an action and special effects movie that is intended to be the beginning of a new franchise - introduction to the characters, getting the feel for the group in this version of the Marvel Universe, setting up and resolving an introductory conflict.<br/><br/>I look forward to the next installment.

","After months of anticipation the X-men movie has finally arrived. Now, as a big fan of the X-men comic book i was worried that it wouldn't live up to it, but not only is it the best movie of the summer, it is the best comic to movie adaptation since the first Batman movie. This film is action packed, but it also makes you feel for most of the characters and takes the time to tell a story. In fact for kids it's a story that teaches them about intolerence and being different.<br/><br/>i won't give away the plot but here's the basics. Professor Xavier leads a band of mutants known as X-men who serve his purpose to unite humans and mutants peacefully. He is in charged of a school for gifted youngsters who are young kids that are learning to control their mutant powers. The X-men include Cyclops, who can shot laser beams from his eyes, Storm, who can control the weather and Jean Grey, who possess telekenisis and mild telepathic powers. On the opposing side we have Magneto, who can manipulate anytihng metallic. He believes that mutants are the superior race and that the humans that fear and hate them should be destroyed. On his side is Mystique, a shape-changer, Toad, who possess incredible agility and a very trippy 15 ft long tongue that he shoots out of his mouth and sabertooth, who possess fast healing factor and super human strength. Both sides are very dedicated to the people who lead them but who's right or wrong about how humans accept them is yet to be determined. Caught in the middle is Wolverine and Rogue. wolverine possess fast healing factor and adamantium that was put into his body over 15 years ago and allows his retract claws from his hands. Rogue has the ability to drain a persons life force, making it impossible to have skin to skin contact with anyone. Professor X wants to train Wloverine and help him find his pass but Magneto wants something from Rouge that will help him with his plan.<br/><br/>First off the acting is great form everyone. Patrick Stewart is great as Professor X. i loved his performance and Ian Mckellan is perfect as magneto. he may not look the part but he plays the part well. Famke Janseen plays jean grey really well too. combining smarts and Sex appeal. i wish they would've gave her more to do but she was still good. Halle Berry is good as Storm. she looks the part and she gives storm a soul. i hope they expand on her part in the sequel becuase there's a lot there in the character thayt is waiting to come out. James Marsden, who has minimal screen time is cyclops, is still very good. hope they expand on his relationship with jean in the sequel becuase it isn't too apparent in this film. You can tell he has grown though as an actor after been in not so good teen films such as Gossip and Disturbing Behavior. Hugh Jackman and anna Paquin are the best performers in the film. he brings the chracter of Wolverine righ tof the comic books and unto the screen. he's funny, especially his frequent banter with Cyclops, he's emotional, his father/daughter relationship with Rogue is very well played in the film, and he's a loner who is searching for answers to his past. Anna Paquin plays the Rogue chracter as a vulnerable confused teenaged girl who is just learning about her mutant powers. This is a far cry from the strong southern belle in the comic but it will be interesting to see her grow in each film. The villians are a real treat. Rebecca Romjn stamos, has only one line as Mystique but she knows how to come off as simply evil. she knows how to work her body and the trippy make-up helps too. Ray Park is awesome as Toad. he's very funny and he brings his skills to the part such as he did in Star wars episode I. Tyler mane, who is a former pro wrestler is good as sabertooth. he basically just growls and grunts but he also knows how to come off as evil.<br/><br/>The action is fantastic in this film. From the fight between Wolverine and Mystique which is beautifully executed to the fight between storm, cyclops, jean and toad. When storm comes face to face with toad the special effects used here are great. The fight between Wolverine and Sabertooth on the Statue of Liberty is a bit anti-climatic but is still good.<br/><br/>One last point i would like to make is Bryan singer thanks for putting together a wonderful film. i'm a big fan of the comic book and i can honestly say you and everyone involved put together a great film. it leaves you wanting more and i think that's a good sign of a successful movie.<br/><br/>

","The only complaint that my friends and I had was the lack of Gambit in the movie. Otherwise it was excellent. Good acting, good script, good direction, good effects. I'd place this one right up there with Batman and Superman. I'm sure there will be some sequels in the future, I can only hope they will be on the same level, but I doubt it somewhat. The actor who played Wolverine did an excellent job, and somehow they managed to make his hair look right without overdoing it. Patrick Stewart and Ian Mckellen were just awesome as Professor X and Magneto. This show was well worth the price of a ticket."

","I went in thinking that the main focus of the movie would probably be the fighting and the powers of the mutants.  Having been a fan of the comic series for some time now it was my opinion that the most important element would be the fight seen between Wolverine and Sabertooth.  However, I was very pleasantly surprised to see that not the mutant powers or the fighting was the focus but that the story and plot became the main focus and with intellegent twists and turns, as well as some well timed and very humorous comic relief this quickly became my favorite movie of the year.  Though due to the Academy's obvious feelings about Sci-fi the only oscar possibility I see in the future is for special effects."

I feel the casting was great, Logan could have been a bit bigger.  Sabertooth and Prof X were probably the best adaptations from comic to screen out of all of them.

Rogue was cool and hot at the same time ... =)  a talented actress as well.  The music was great, the direction was great, the story was pretty close to great, and there is a really funny scene where Toad who is played by the same guy as Darth Maul makes a HILARIOUS reference to the double edged lightsaber.<br/><br/>Well, I've rambled long enough.

I was looking for every bit of anything that could be wrong with this film.  Despite this, I loved this movie.  I'm sure not too many people can boast of seeing it twice on opening night.  That's how excellent I thought this movie was.  All of the characters were protrayed remarkably.  And the cameos of certain undergrad mutants were cool also.  Stunts and special effects were perfect also.  I don't think they could have done a better job.  Although I do have to admit the chronology of it was quite off.  But it definately made for a better story line.  If you like the X-Men, if you LOVE the X-Men,  if you've never heard of the X-Men, go see this movie.

I honestly believed it would be a movie with no plotline, no character development, just a bunch of guys beating on each other with super powers thrown into the mix.<br/><br/>Not so.<br/><br/>X-Men is a well-written, beautifully acted film.  The characters have substance (some more than others) and the plotline is sound.  Of course, the incredible special effects helped make the movie what it was supposed to be. Hugh Jackman is hilarious as the cynical Logan, and the rivalry between him and Cyclops (James Marsden) adds more humor. Toad (Ray Park) fills in the blanks.  Ian McKellan is very believable as the corrupted Magneto, and some fan-favorite X-Men have cameos as students at the Xavier Institute (Iceman, Pyro, Jubilee, Cannonball, Shadowcat, and Colossus).<br/><br/>This movie was a dose of reality.  It reinforced the idea that they CAN base a movie on a comic book or video game character that won't bomb in the box office."

","I was a fan of the X-Men back in the early sixties when they first appeared on the comicbook scene. Then, the members were Cyclops, Marvel Girl (Jean Grey), Angel, Beast and Iceman. The group has evolved over the years...and out of my life many moons ago. The only contact I have with them now, is thru my 12 year old nephew who is as excited about them now as I was back then. I went to the movies Friday to the very first showing of X-Men the movie. From the first second the screen came alive to the final credit, I was glued. All of the main characters were explained perfectly so that even an oldie like me could understand who and why they were who they are. The storyline was great. The actors portraying anybody and everybody were right on the mark. I want to thank and congratulate all of the people behind this movie, from Marvel itself, thru to Stan Lee, to the director, the producers, and even the guys driving the roach coach. Excellent job! I rate this movie as the best movie of the summer.

The action is enough to hold you on the edge, while the plot and character development keep you interested and in your seat. I was never much of a comic book reader, but I know this is very true to the original stories. In my mind, a good comic book provides a complete story, yet leaves enough open that the imagination can take over where the plot doesn't go. It also should leave enough unanswered questions that you can't wait for the next episode. X-men fulfilled my expectations and I look forward to perhaps a sequel. This is the best comic book turned movie that I have seen and I have also learned to appreciate this genre a lot more because of it."

As I understand it (as was more fully explained on the way home from the theater), some of these characters have been around for almost 40 years and others for 20. Men, women, black, white, all working together for the common good (okay, or bad, if you were rooting for the other side.) It was a great experience for me since I wasn't at all familiar with the comic book at all when I was growing up. I will make an effort though to seek out some old issues. From what I understand, there's a LOT more of the whole story. Yes, I can see four sequels easily. (Well, it was a long ride home!)"
"Monolith-4","Null","0","0","14 July 2000"," A strong summer film that captures the essence of the comic book
","My first introduction to the X-Men was in the summer of 1963 when I bought the first issue at a corner drug store.  I was ten years old at the time. Ironically, around that same time I would think about how old I would be when the year 2000 came and what life might be like in the ""far future"". It seemed so far away at the time.<br/><br/>Thirty-seven years later, the year 2000 has come, I have turned 47 years old, and my favorite comic book of my youth has made it to the big screen. I'm very pleased to say that the writers have done considerable justice in capturing the key elements of why the book made such an impact on me when I was young.<br/><br/>Two defining moments of the original comic book series came in two early issues.  In issue #5 (1964) Toad (in disguise) participates in a track meet, shattering world records.  In a state of shock and disbelief, the crowd becomes suspicious of fraud, and enraged, attacks Toad.  A small riot ensues.  In issue #8 (1964), when one of the members of the original team rescues a child, who has climbed to the top of a water tower, the crowd reacts with fear, anger, and suspicion instead of gratitude.  Although Marvel had successfully used the dramatic device of having the public fear and loath a super-hero previously in the `Amazing Spiderman' series, this was the first use of prejudice against an entire class of individuals or `mutants' who were different from birth solely due to a genetic `accident'.<br/><br/>SPOILER WARNING!  SPOILER WARNING!   SPOILER WARNING!<br/><br/>This theme of blind prejudice against an entire `race' of individuals and the resulting fear, anger, and violence is introduced powerfully in two early scenes of the X-Men film.  One is set in a 1944 Nazi concentration camp.  The next is in the near future at a congressional hearing which is debating if a law should be passed that would require all `mutants' to register with the government.  Sadly, the years from 1963 to now have seen much prejudice, racism, bigotry, and even `ethnic cleansing', so the theme of intolerance holds as much power today as it did in 1963, perhaps more so.<br/><br/>Another defining theme of the Marvel comic books of the 60's was the sense of loneliness and isolation of the heroes.   Their super powers, rather than bringing them fame and fortune, became a curse, something they often felt they would be better off not having.  Cyclops (Scott Summers) is deeply in love with Jean Grey, yet his `dread power' (Issue #3) compels him to keep his feelings to himself.  Certainly, no character could be more tragic than Rogue whose touch can be fatal and who is potentially destined to never enjoy true human intimacy.   Oscar winner Anna Paquin is outstanding playing the young Rogue character.<br/><br/>A final defining theme of the Marvel comic book revolution of the 60's was that of the anti-hero.  These were characters that were angry, often out of control, loners who struggled to do the right thing.  The `Incredible Hulk' comes to mind.  Yet, the later (70's) X-Men character Wolverine may be the ultimate Marvel anti-hero.  A victim of horrendous human experimentation, whose memories are largely repressed, Logan is bitter, angry, and alone. The connection and interplay between Logan, played most convincingly by Hugh Jackman, and Rogue contains much of what sets this movie apart from any other comic book adaptation.  Logan has the ability to heal himself quickly. Rogue has the ability to temporarily `steal' the powers of another `mutant'.  These powers are exploited to full advantage in this movie. I'll confess that certain scenes between them moved me to tears they are so strong, surprising, and compelling.<br/><br/>Much of this film is expository.  It's designed to introduce a `universe' to an audience that is assumed to have little or no knowledge of the characters.  It's a fun, exciting, action movie.  It's also a somewhat faithful adaptation of the comic book series.  Given the fact that the movie lasts barely over ninety minutes, the filmmakers have pulled off quite a feat.<br/><br/>Looking at the film as a pure action, sci-fi film, I'd give it around 3 to 3-1/2 stars out of 4, or a 7 or 8 out of 10.  It's hurt a bit by the fact that it's trying to do so much in so little time.  Also, the film was originally intended to be released in the latter part of 2000.  I think the shortened timeframe for the making of the film may have had an impact on its overall quality.  Nevertheless, it is unquestionably in my opinion the best of the superhero, comic book adaptations.  I saw it in a packed theater and it was an obvious crowd pleaser.  Along with some very serious acting and themes, it has stunning special effects and very funny one-liners.  My wife, who was never a X-Men comic reader, thought the movie was fantastic and she's very hard to please.  She will recommend this film to her friends and so will I.  I will look forward to seeing a director's cut on DVD and a sequel.  Enjoy."
"Minerva_Meybridge","Null","0","0","18 July 2000"," An X-asperating lack of character development.
","Thus, after the barrage of previews, we went to see The X-Men.  I found it to be a Batmanish film-dark and brooding with excellent cinematography and special effects.  My end reaction, though, was that it lacked story development.  I sort of sensed that before I went in from all that I had pre-seen.<br/><br/>In the near future, certain members of homo sapiens are born into the next phase of human evolution.  This is what we are told.  But why each evolves into a different life form is never explained.  No two mutants are alike, leaving us to question whether humanity is doomed beyond this simple show of genetic godfreaks for lack of an ability to mate. The film is flawed by an all too sparse character development.  The greatest insight we have of anyone is of Rogue, played by Anna Paquin, whom most of us remember as the little girl in The Piano and later in Fly Away Home. Rogue is a teenage girl, who can never touch another person, for to do so drains their very life force.  Yet she seems almost content with this; being a virtual leper, never being able to so much as kiss another individual, let alone have sex with anyone.  All she could do was run away.  Here was a mutant who should have had the curse of immortality, unable to end her own life.  And with her acceptant attitude, perceptions of plausibility faded from whom she was meant to be.<br/><br/>Two of the mutants had not so much as one line-Sabertooth and Mystique, the latter played by drop-dead gorgeous Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, whose face one could not even seen though the blue reptilian scales.  Patrick Steward and Ian McKellen gave adequate performances with what they were given.  I remember watching Gods and Monsters recently, and thinking how much Ian McKellen sounded like Patrick Steward and how similar were their eyes and here they were like diametric twins.<br/><br/>Famke Janssen, who plays Jean Grey, although having considerable credits to her name, is relatively unknown to the general public.  Star Trek fans, however, may remember her in a Next Generation episode back in 1992 called The Perfect Mate [a quasi-remake of an original Star Trek episode, Elaan Of Troyius, with France Nuyan].  In The Next Generation, Janssen played Kamala, a metamorph who would mentally bond with the man with chosen for her.  A pawn of interplanetary politics, as fate would have it, she bonded tragically to Jean-Luc Picard (Patrick Steward), her mentor in this film, whom she would never see again, at least as Kamala.<br/><br/>McCarthy-esque Senator Robert Jefferson Kelly , played by Bruce Davidson, shared credits with McKellen in Apt Pupil back in 1996.  Hugh Jackman gives a credible performance a Wolverine, the amnesiac mutant with metal talons someone has grafted into his arms, which project outwards through his ever-healing flesh in moments of rage.  Gone for the most part was the Iceman, a significant character throughout early X-Men comic book history, probably because the special effects of creating bridges of ice would have been prohibitively expensive.  Gone, too, were some scenes shown in the Making of the X-Men recently on Fox, including one where the Senator's daughter turns into a mutant before everyone's eyes, as her neck begins to stretch upward like Plasticman. Whoever was responsible for the previews missed the point, as did the writers.  The X-Men was to represent the next stage of evolution.  If only the screenplay could have evolved beyond the formula plot as well.  This should have been a three hour film.  Character development and character interrelations were left on the cutting room floor in some mutantless dimension where quality takes precedence over box office sales. How this brings to mind the theatrical release of The Abyss and its unsatisfying end!<br/><br/>Well, undoubtedly there will be a sequel and, undoubtedly, too, some adult entertainment company will mutate this into The XXX-Men, which, more than likely and in totally contrast will have ""in-depth"" character relations and absolutely no plot.  Welcome to America."
"RookMark","8","0","0","15 July 2000"," Fans: Great, Non-fans: Good
","Thank god it didn't suck.<br/><br/>After having lived through the various incarnations of Batman and Superman it's nice to finally see a superhero comic turned movie done right.<br/><br/>Granted, it's not the kickass blockbuster summer movie it could have been, but I'm just counting my lucky stars that it didn't suck.<br/><br/>It could have been much worse.<br/><br/>Anybody see the Fantastic Four movie? No? Not surprising. You'd be hard pressed to find it on video.<br/><br/>There have been so many bad superhero movies you'd think someone would have sat down, viewed them all, and finally figured out what wasn't done or was done wrong with all of them. Then they could have produced a good film.<br/><br/>Well, apparently Bryan Singer did just that. Along with the other writers, Tom Desanto and David Hayter, Bryan wrote and directed what may be considered the first good movie based on a comic series.<br/><br/>But there were still things that didn't make it great and they all relate directly to the medium of movies itself.<br/><br/>Things most people won't like about the film: The first problem was the length. Ninety minutes is no where near enough time to present the full depth of history of Professor Xavier and his school of mutants, but they made a valiant effort anyway. Unfortunately they only left the comic series fans wanting more and those unfamiliar with the comic going `huh'?<br/><br/>Second is the ineffective Sabertooth. Through numerous fight scenes we note that he is supposedly wild and beastlike. That's it. He has claws and, occasionally, when he opens his mouth we hear the MGM lion. Fans will know that Sabertooth has the same healing abilities as Logan and is, in fact, a much better killer/fighter than Logan. In the comic series he has wiped the floor with Logan repeatedly.<br/><br/>Non-fans in the theatre will no doubt note that Sabertooth is struck with several lethal blows (including both of Logan's claws sunk knuckle deep into his chest) and never seems to be hurt. For those not familiar with Sabertooth's abilities these scenes will appear as gaffs or continuity errors. Heck they felt like continuity errors to me and I knew what was going on.<br/><br/>Things that will bother the fans:<br/><br/>Rogue is young, definitely in her early teens. And you never get any explanation as to where she picked up her nickname. But her age works for the movie. The relationship that develops between her and Logan is believable and, surprisingly, touching. I also feel her young age played on the sympathy for her curse much more than the comic series ever could. This is aided in no small part by Anna Paquin's marvellous acting.<br/><br/>No Danger Room. Which is a big disappointment to me too, but one I can live with. Including the Danger Room would have been fantastic, and I would have been willing to sit through a three hour movie if they'd been willing to fit it in.<br/><br/>Things that will bother the Fanatics: Bobby Drake (Iceman), one of the original Xmen in the series, is just another teenage student in the movie.<br/><br/>Toad is the best fighter of all the characters, hero and villain. Now I actually enjoyed this, and Ray Park (Darth Maul) did a kickass job of, well, kicking ass. But this will bother the purists as, in the comic series, toad was always there more for comic relief than anything.<br/><br/>We didn't get to see more of the other mutants and their abilities. But this is good, in the long run, for the film since so much of it is taken up with introducing the characters already. If they'd added any more full characters (like Bobby/Iceman) the movie would have ended up being nothing but an Xmen roll call.<br/><br/>The costumes are nothing like the comic book series. Again, though, this is very much a Good Thing.<br/><br/>Wolverine's skeleton is made out of adamantium, supposedly unbendable and unbreakable. Magneto was twisting his blades around like they were tin.<br/><br/>Orroro and Jeans' powers are pale shadows of their comic book versions. I can't help but wonder if this isn't another indication of Hollywood's vaguely misogynistic ruling class. But that's a rant, and better suited to a different article.<br/><br/>Things that will bother the non-fans: Who the hell is this Charles Xavier and where the hell does he get the funding for this school of his? We can assume Magneto stole money for his nefarious offshore base, and probably constructed most of it himself too, but Charles is supposedly a Good Guy and wouldn't stoop to anything illegal. So what's his source?<br/><br/>Actually, I don't think this was ever explained in the comic either.<br/><br/>Things to absolutely love about the movie: Mystique kicks ass, both figuratively and literally. As a villain she is smart, cunning, and powerful. She comes very close to defeating Wolverine, which is impressive in either incarnation. (Another Hollywood paranoia moment, though: only villainous, murderous women can be powerful? Just a thought)<br/><br/>The special effects are used effectively and sparingly. The only gratuitous inclusion, in my mind, was Magneto's little `executive toy' hovering above his desk.<br/><br/>Toad kicks ass. I can't help but feel that Ray Park is on his way to an action movie series. I can only hope he winds up better than Jeane Claude Van Damme. So far he is kept to short lines between fight scenes. He gets to use his signature `weapon spin' at least once, as he did in Episode 1 and Sleepy Hollow.<br/><br/>Quotes like: `Don't kick him in the balls.' `But you said anything goes.' `Yeah, but if you kick him in the balls, he'll take it personally.'<br/><br/>`Wait, how do we know it's you?' `You're a dick.' `Okay, it's you.'<br/><br/>Rating? For the fans: 5 bottles out of six. For the non-fans: 4 bottles out of six."

","X-men is a strange movie to review.  It's main problem is the same as it's greatest strength.  The best thing is the great characters of Wolverine and Rogue.  The worst thing is the characters of... every one else.  Patrick Stewart is great as Charles Xavier, and Ian McKellen is great as Magnito, but their characters are not as developed as they should be.  The other characters suck.  Storm, Cyclops, Toad?  Jean Gray is the best secondary character. Some people have complained that the X-MEN have human looking mutants, and the Brotherhood of Mutants are all physically mutated.  But if you think about it, the reason the mutants in the Brotherhood hate humans is that humans have rejected them, hate them, and fear them.  It is easier to hate someone who looks different.  Each character looks great and are very true to the comic book.  The only problem I found will the characters looks is that they had to cover up Rebecca Romaine Stamos's gorgeous body with blue paint.  Halle Berry's wig is kind of distracting too. Over all, I heavily enjoyed the movie."

This film revolves around Wolverine, Rogue and Magneto. The rest of the characters serve to occupy camera time even to an extent, and I'm surprised to say, Patrick Stewart.

","While it was accessible to general audiences, it was merely adequate for fans. I'm no comic freak I did wait for 2 1/2 years to see this and I was impressed with Singer(who ironically never read the comic)for visualizing a movie he had no idea where to begin. That fact shows itself to serious fans but I did not feel I wasted money. Simply put there are just too many characters and not enough time. Action sequences are pretty fine but I kept recalling Joel Schumacher's silly Batman sequals. It's obvious the special FX were a bit shoestring but it was more or less better than average. I wish they could have fleshed out Magneto a bit more and explained his and Pros X's previous friendship. ""Wolvie"" was cool and they even made his hair look cool. Sabretooth should not have been as oafish and ass-headed as he was and fans will agree that a big fight b/t certain characters was missing(wink wink). Mystique was too cool for her own good(though I still wanna marry Romijn).Plot left a little to be desired but acting was top notch all around(except James Marsden!) which brings to mind the fact that Jean Grey was not supposed to be considerably older than Cyclops. I guess I could keep nit picking and while I know nothing compared to other people about the comic I still think that while it wasn't bad it could've been better.

","I just saw this movie last night.  Even through I wouldn't know an X-man from Superman, I loved it!  It is wonderfully well-acted, and a great story line.  And Wolverine!  Two words describe him:  Yum Yum.  It was also funny, a surprising thing in an action and special effects movie.  The lines were delivered well and Dr. Xavier was well-played by our favorite bald guy, Patrick Stewart.  It wasn't just designed to be pleasing to the eyes but to the funnybone also.  And believe me, Wolverine and Cyclops in leather does not make you miss the yellow spandex, let me tell you.  The villiains were well-played, Sabretooth was very menacing.  Toad was very good, especially his huge tongue that would put KISS to shame.  I recommend, even if you are not an X-men-aphilic, see this movie, it's fantastic!"

","Ok, I admit, I was really worried about how this film would turn out. Being a die-hard X-Men fan, I had already accepted the fact that I would most likely be disappointed with the film.  But to my surprise, X-Men is terrific.  Director Bryan Singer was faced with a really tough task in trying to find a way to introduce the X-Men to those who weren't familiar with them, while at the same time providing an engrossing adventure for die-hard fans.<br/><br/>Well you can breathe a sigh of relief, because Singer pulls it off perfectly.  Much of the first part of the film is spent introducing the characters and their powers, but I was never bored.  Singer also did a fantastic job with the relationships between the characters.  The bickering between Cyclops and Wolverine had the entire theather howling with laughter.<br/><br/>In one scene Wolverine comes back into a room where Cyclops, Storm, and Jean are, after he gets through fighting Mystique.  Cyclops is about to blast him (thinking it's Mystique) and Wolverine says, ""Hey wait, it's me.""  Cyclops replies, ""Prove it.""  Wolverine responds with, ""You're a dick.""  Cyclops, ""Ok, good enough for me.""  The big brother/little sister relationship between Wolverine and Rogue helps us go deeper into the characters.<br/><br/>That's the beauty of this film.  You go for the fantastic action scenes and special effects (and believe me, they're awesome) and you also get treated to a cast of characters that you fall in love with.  My gripes with the film are very few and far between.  Halle Berry sucked as Storm, but I expected that going in.  Her dialogue consists of about 5 one-liners throughout the whole movie.  Those who aren't familiar with the comic (or cartoon) won't notice anything wrong, but those of us who know what an important and fantastic character Storm is will be disappointed to see her reduced to this.<br/><br/>Second, Xavier has a huge role in the first half of the film, but very little in the 2nd half.  Professor X gets . . . incapacitated half-way through the film, and spends the 2nd half of it lying in the X-Men infirmary, doing nothing more than showing off his bald head and hairy chest.  Anyway, these are VERY minor gripes.  Overall, I would give X-Men a 9 out of 10."

","This was a very good transition from comics to the ""big screen"", better than Superman or any other DC Comics attempt.  The last time I saw a transition so accurate to the story was with Captain America (If you haven't seen it then check it out... it's good).  There were some flaws though that only fans of the series might see.  IE:  Colossus is in the movie, yet he is not young when he joins the x-men.  Other than that, not much wrong with the movie... not much wrong... what am I saying?!  It was awesome.  It could have used Professor X to have the golden chair instead of a regular wheel-chair, but I guess our own technology puts limits on movies at times. If you are a fan of the series then you will love the movie.  If you are not a fan but just want to see what the hype was all about then I am sure that the special effects and jokes will be enough to keep you entertained."
"MrUnderdog","8","0","0","14 July 2000"," Very fun movie for non-comic readers as well.
","This was an excellent movie for the budget they were working with.  The script did a great job of packing quite a bit of information into a short amount of time.  By doing so, they did skip some more in-depth characterization, but that's understandable.  There's still plenty there to get a sense of where the characters stand.  The story had some very entertaining and impressive action sequences, as well as some occasional sarcastic humor which fit the characters nicely.  I went to the movie with my wife and four others who had never touched any X-man comic (or other comic, most likely), and knew nothing about the heroes that they did not learn in the movie.  They all enjoyed it.  My wife wants to see it again, which surprises me.  Even the person in the group who is non ""action movie"" oriented gave it a thumbs up (not a super-excited-wow thumbs up, but a thumbs up none-the-less).  Having read the comics as a child, which I like to think wasn't too long ago, I caught a few inside jokes which were nice to see.  There are some changes to some characters (for instance, the original comic had an Iceman character as a charter member...here he's a younger more minor character), but they do not seem like they would be detrimental to the story for long-time fans.  I would venture a guess that there will be sequels, and that the budget will be much larger next time, and the running time will probably be extended.  I'm sure that there will be more development of relationships throughout the series.  This was a very good start with what they had to work with.  If you talk to someone who has read the comic after you see the movie, they will probably fill you in on a couple things about the characters and their pasts that would be interesting in reflection and setup the next couple of films.  Like I said, I was the only person who had any background knowledge of the X-men, and our whole party enjoyed it thoroughly.  Job well done.<br/><br/>Have fun!"

","Well it was better than Battlefield Earth, I will give it that. First off it should have been called Wolverine (in big letters) and the X-men (in small letters off to the side). The whole movie focus's on Wolverine and Rouge. The flash-backs to Wolverine's past seem like just an excuse to make a sequel later.  The rest of the team is just there as an excuse for some FX. The villains don't really do anything either. They fight with the X-men now and then but don't really do anything. Then Toad and Mystique kick all of the X-men's asses by themselves. HUH??  Storm just sits and gets her butt kicked twice and only seems to use her powers at just the right time and when that is all that will save everyone. Same with Cyclops and Jean. Speaking of Jean she is a TK yet outside of a few useless times she never uses her power. There is more than one time where she could end the fight and win the day if she used her TK but she just sits there whining. The pointless cameos are annoying as well.  Kitty, Pyro, Iceman and others are there for no reason other than to be there.   I don't know where I should start in pointing out the many, many moronic ""plot"" details and problems. First the mutant making machine. What the hell is that?  Magneto has a machine that can make a human into a mutant.  F***ing stupid. I also guess that being stuck in a mutant making battery and dying turns some (not all) of your hair white.  When Mystique changes form the CGI people have no idea what mass is. She is sneaking into a the X-mansion as a young boy and when she changes back to her she doesn't change size, height or anything.  In the comics she could also NEVER have kicked the crap out of Wolverine but seems to do it with barely any effort here. Sabertooth is just a big, hairy bum. Toad is just annoying and really stupid. The fights are so overblown and over the top that they are funny to watch. Every time someone gets hit they go flying back (or up) as if there was a stagehand off camera pulling them. There is no logic shown in the movie by any of the characters and especially not by the cops. I can't explain it but when you see the scene with the cops you will end up beating your head against the wall at how dumb it is. Next the FX. Some look good and others (like Mystique's transformation) are such obvious CGI layovers they look ridiculous. The sets look like something stolen from a James Bond film. Come on there is NO way you could sub-contract out the work needed to build these complexes and keep it a secret (and not cost billions of dollars).  The dialog was awful and was really  forced. The performances where either bad or average and the ""Plot"" twists can be seen 10 minutes before they happen. Now the fact that none of the characters even come close to their comic counter-parts is something I was willing to over look but these are so far off it is blasphemous.  This is yet in a long line of awful comic movies and is up there with Batman and Robin and Superman 4. Avoid at all costs. At least I got to see the trailer for Highlander: Endgame."

","As a long time fan of the X-MEN comics I entered the movie with some prejudice. However, Director Bryan Singer did an excellent job transforming the comic universe on to film.  Special effects, story line, and casting were all excellent.  When I first heard of the ""team"" of X-men used I was disappointed when I learned that they were not using the original team of Jean Grey, Cyclops, Iceman, Beast, and Angel. However, I soon realized that to tell a story that everyone would enjoy that some changes would have to be made.  I was also concerned when I learned that Rogue would not have her flight capabilities, and super human strength like she has in the comic, but Singer's use of her powers was a great way to move the plot. I hope other comic fans will go in with an open mind. If so I believe that they will enjoy the film, and hopefully will discover the wonderful comic universe. Singer, Salute you! Thank you for doing the X-Men justice!"
"Panthera-3","Null","0","0","12 July 2000"," Excellent blend of action and subtlety, but comic fans may be disappointed
","X-amining the X-factor Panthera, July 12th 2000<br/><br/>Wolverine fans are going to love this movie. Storm fans are going to get a real kick about halfway through, but if your favourite happens to be one of the other X-Men, you could well be in for disappointment.<br/><br/>Judged on its own merits the X-Men movie is well worth seeing; granted, the major plot twist is more than a little predictable, but the character interaction is nicely done and without any cheesiness or schmaltz. For example, the conflict between Xavier and Magneto is excellent (not least due to the talent of the actors); there is no posturing or rhetoric. These men have known, respected and opposed each other for many years, and that is exactly the effect that Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan convey.<br/><br/>`Understated' isn't a word usually associated with a comic-book movie, but strangely enough it applies to this one; alongside the character interaction, the special effects that give the X-Men their powers on screen are elegantly done, depicting the various mutant abilities with a subtlety that makes them all the easier to imagine in the 'real world'.<br/><br/>Given that it would be impossible to cram 30 years of comic-book history into a two-hour movie, the creators of X-Men have aimed for a blend of 'old' and 'new', and also attempted to make the movie easier to understand for those who have never read the comic. Unfortunately, neither gambit (pun intended) is entirely successful.<br/><br/>Aside from the aforementioned Wolvie fans, comic diehards are going to need a good dose of charity toward this movie. Of the major characters only Wolverine and Xavier seem entirely themselves; Cyclops, in manner at least, is a posturing adolescent, and one wonders what the far more mature Dr Jean Grey (yes, Doctor Grey - shades of Hank McCoy, perhaps?) ever sees in him. Jean herself seems rather flat and bland, as does Storm, but this may be because their purpose in the movie is to provide background for Wolverine and Rogue.<br/><br/>Rogue is depicted at the time of her life immediately after her powers appear. She is lost, and alone, and it is easy to believe that the comic book Rogue was once this way. Along with Wolverine she finds herself inside Xavier's School for the Gifted. The School, too, is different from the comics; it actually has classes of students in attendance, and among these we find some familiar characters, such as Shadowcat and Iceman, whose presence the movie as 'in jokes' for the initiated is both entertaining and annoying at the same time.<br/><br/>Of the villains, Mystique is stunning, although the character is, once again, quite different from the comic book version. The Toad is closer to being himself, and proves to be the most interesting and entertaining of the baddies, while Sabretooth is not nearly as formidable or as engaging as he could be.<br/><br/>The movie has plucked the characters and the character traits from different times in the comic book's history - a young Cyke, an older Jean - and thrown them together, a combination which doesn't quite mesh; long-time fans can spot the discrepancies, and new initiates are left confused.<br/><br/>Also for 'first-time' viewers, there are some minor details left unexplained - Wolverine's heightened senses, for example, are never mentioned but suddenly he's sniffing and identifying people by scent. Likewise Storm's claustrophobia, while not essential to the action or the plot, is never mentioned, even though she is placed in a situation which would trigger it.<br/><br/>On the whole, the X-men movie manages to portray the action and adventure of the original without going overboard, either with the characters or the effects, but long-time X-fans will need to cut it some slack. Sit back, relax, and let it come at you."

","More movies should be made with this much care.  It certainly did everything that movies are supposed to do:  It was entertaining, it held my attention throughout, I was able to suspend my belief, and I was drawn in by the story and kept ""inside"" the movie's reality with engaging and well-drawn characters.<br/><br/>This is truly a rarity -- a Summer Blockbuster with a real story (most are analogous to porn -- in that there is no plot but manages to do what it is supposed to do at the basest and fleeting of ways).  The effects were made for the story, not the other way around.  I am not an ""X-Men"" fan but I know who they are.  I am sure there are fans who don't like the movie; just like people who have read the book first -- it can never be the same.<br/><br/>I was especially taken with the underlying story of prejudice and how the down-trodden feel and react to their oppressors.  This is a scary view into the history of man.  It explores one of our potentially harmful traits -- wanting to judge and blame certain peoples for our troubles.  Fear and a feeling of a lack of control is something you can see as a motivating force for some of the main characters  With this, you get a really good idea of Magneto not simply as ""main-villain-we-are-supposed-to-hate"" to more of a man with his own ideas of how best to deal with the prejudice against him and his kind.<br/><br/>The acting was very good, especially with Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan. The man who plays Wolverine was especially into his role and very effective. It was great to see Anna Paquin again.  I doubt she will get a nod for this role from the Academy, but she played it as it was supposed to be played -- as a sad young innocent just trying to find her place in the world. The relationship between Rogue and Wolverine was well written and grew as the picture played.<br/><br/>Above all, it is the best Summer Blockbuster I have seen in a long time! The action sequences were engaging and cool!   There are a lot of details to see, I think this is a movie worth paying for to see more than once!  The great thing about it is that there isn't just one or two things that work in this film.  The whole thing works!  I am sure I can find its weakness after more viewings, but I still think its strengths far outweigh any mistakes. I am 31, and I really enjoyed it!  My brother went with me, and he said that he believed that at least it would be nominated for an Oscar (TM) for Makeup -- I agree.<br/><br/>Bryon Singer surrounded himself with credited and uncredited talent, and it shows.  Fortunately the movie did not drown in this pool of talent.  Of course, there seemed that some things were left out (the only ""anti-human"" mutant's background we know about is Magneto's); but that just means I was interested enough in what I WAS told to want to know more.  Besides, no-one wants to see a ten hour movie; and there are always sequels.  This movie does promise a sequel, but not with a cheesy cliffhanger.  It offers enough to stand on its own, while making you care enough about the characters and their situation to WANT to see more.<br/><br/>And that is the greatest compliment I can give this movie:  It left me satisfied, but at the same time it ended making me want more."

","Some twenty years ago, I became a fan of the X-Men comics.  I followed the story for about five years before drifting on.  So, I was intrigued by the notion of the live-action X-Men movie.  I was skeptical, as comic book characters, as a rule, do not translate well to live action (Christopher Reeve's Superman (1st movie only) and the first Batman movie notwithstanding; the Spiderman and Hulk live actions were pretty lame.)<br/><br/>I was NOT disappointed in this movie!  The characterizations are dead-on accurate, the special effects are satisfying, and the storyline was solid! If I have one problem, it might be the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue. She did a fine job, but Rogue is about 7 years older than Paquin's character. The one performance that was a tad weak was Halle Berry's Storm, but then they didn't do too much with the character for her to sink her teeth into.<br/><br/>In particular, Wolverine was EVERYTHING I hoped he would be!<br/><br/>All in all, a must see movie for comic book fans and X-Men fans everywhere, as well as those who like a good fantasy yarn!"

","This was easily the best comic-book movie ever done, faithful where it needed to be and taking liberties only where necessary, and only to make the story better. They avoided most of the common pitfalls (like making it campy) and while most of the characters are pretty light, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin really bring life to their roles, and McKellen shines as Magneto.<br/><br/>If you don't like super-heroes, you may not care for it... but if you don't like super-heroes because of goofy dialogue, strange spandex costumes and totally ludicrous plots rather than just hating the concept, you'll probably enjoy it a lot. And super-hero (especially X-Men) fans will greatly enjoy it."

","While it was accessible to general audiences, it was merely adequate for fans. Though I'm no comic freak I did wait for 2 1/2 years to see this and I was impressed with Singer(who ironically never read the comic)for visualizing a movie he had no idea where to begin. That fact shows itself to serious fans but I did not feel I wasted money. Simply put there are just too many characters and not enough time. Action sequences are pretty fine but I kept recalling Joel Schumacher's silly Batman sequels. It's obvious the special FX were a bit shoestring but it was more or less better than average. I wish they could have fleshed out Magneto a bit more and explained his and Prof. X's previous friendship. ""Wolvie"" was cool and they even made his hair look cool. Sabretooth should not have been as oafish and ass-headed as he was and fans will agree that a big fight b/t certain characters was missing(wink wink). Mystique was too cool for her own good(though I still wanna marry Romijn).Plot left a little to be desired but acting was top notch all around(except James Marsden!) which brings to mind the fact that Jean Grey was not supposed to be considerably older than Cyclops. I guess I could keep nit- picking and while I know nothing compared to other people about the comic I still think that while it wasn't bad it could've been better. I do trust that the sequel will be better and I believe Singer will again be up to the challenge. All in all,it missed the mark for serious fans but certainly could've been MUCH worse.

","Many times in college, my roommates and I would sit around and muse about how much we wished certain comics would become movies. Sure enough, X-Men was top of that list for us. Well, after all those years, it was worth the wait. Although I am an ""old school"" kind of guy, I must admit that the overall atmosphere and feel of the movie was very refreshing. Yes, the colors are gone, but the new, sleek look is very, very cool! And while I yearn for Nightcrawler, Colussus, Iceman, Angel, and Beast (Oh Hank, where were you?), it would have been overkill for those not familiar with the comic. It was an interesting twist to see them portrayed as youngsters at the Institute, though. Fans of the comic and cartoons, pay real close attention to the scene in the jet, when they get ready to go save the world. I am not going to spoil it for you, but the little exchange between Cyclops and Wolverine is priceless! All in all, I was quite pleased. For once, the movie lived up to the hype. Oh, and Michael Kamen's soundtrack was a nice touch too. You knew the music was there, but it never distracted from the action (of which there is plenty).

Anyway, I gave this film an 8 out of 10 although it probably only deserves a 7. Here's why. The Direction: Pretty good, though Bryan Singer needs to improve his fight sequences a bit. The fight between Wolverine and Sabretooth on the statue of liberty cut to so many angles I lost track of which was up or down. But I give him credit for taking the charactors seriously. The Story: Pretty much like a marvel comic, not very original. But at least we were explained Magneto's motivations. I would have liked this film to have been a half hour longer. I keep reading ""great charactorization"" from other reviews, and that's true for Wolverine, Rogue, and Magneto, but what about the rest of the cast? And will non X-MEN fans understand what happens to professor X with Cerebro? Yep another half hour would have been great. The ACTING: HUGH JACKMAN now has a career in Hollywood. Everyone else did a satisfactory job except for Tyler Mane who growls like a lion more than he speaks (but that's the writers fault.) and of course Halle Berry who, except for the elevator scene, walked around with a blank look on her face. It didn't help that she was given the worst lines to read. Which brings me to... THE WORST LINE: STORM: ""Would you like to know what lightning does to a toad?"" TOAD:""AAAH!""

I have to say that despite the above flaws it was still a very entertaining movie that hopefully will create an even better sequal."

I say this movie is a 10 easy when compared to other movies of this type. (super heros, action, etc.)  Highly worth seeing!"

","You might as well as said Wolverine as Wolverine, because Jackman was at home in this role.  From his first scene, smokin' a cigar and fightin' in a bar--Jackman brought Wolvie's character out like no one else could have. You had no preconcieved notions of him, because you've never heard of him, and that was the best start.  Aside from Jackman's awesome portrayal of Wolverine, THIS MOVIE WAS AWESOME!  The X-Men is quite possibly the greatest comic to movie adaptation ever.  It is definitely one of the best of the summer!"

"SpackerMatt","10","0","0","14 July 2000"," Why ask questions you already know the answer to?
","SOME SPOILERS: READ AT YOUR OWN RISK I walked in expecting a great movie. Walked out, and saw a movie that was basically a masterpiece. First the cast: Hugh Jackman as Logan/Wolverine: Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine. His gruff looks, beard and mannerisms. Everytime he SNIKTS his claws, you almost feel transported into the comic book. However, I agree that he did do a little too much, but he was awesome. Patrick Stewart as Professor X: Perfect. PS is the spitting image of Xavier, and although he didn't require much physical activity, he did a great job. Anna Paquin as Rogues: Good. Although I know she's still a teenager, I kinda wanted her to do more. She screamed a lot, and gave a hard look a lot as well. But she was still good. Ian McKellen as Magneto: AWESOME! Ian McKellen portrays Magneto in all his nastiness. When he flies, it's outstanding. He's just so evil, and looks cool in that cape and hat. Everyone else: Famke Janssen was good, a perfect love interest for Scott, but didn't do much. James Mardsen was great as Cylcops, he looks like him, but also acts like him. A no-nonsense leader why immediately despises Logan, and the two chit chats make up for some of the funniest lines in the movie. (gotta love it when Logan flips off Cyclops) Halle Berry wasn't that great at all with Storm. She didn't do much, (the most underdeveloped character) and she had few lines and when spoke them, sounded like she was reading cue cards. Ray Park was kool as Toad, and ended up being the most interesting baddie. He had these eyes, his mannerisms, and gotta love it when he's onscreen. And finally, Ray talks! (well, not a lot) Tyler Mane did his best job as a disappointing Sabretooth, who sadly was riddled with bad cliche lines (like when he picks up Storm and tells her to scream for him) but that wasn't his fault. And finally Rebecca Stamos (I wouldn't even bother trying to spell her maiden name) They made such a big deal about her, but she was onscreen for like a total of ten minutes. But she did surprise us every now and then. Bruce Davidson was the perfect condescending baddie, who in one scene made me almost throw up... Xmen surprised me a lot. It had way more humor than I expected it to, (just seeing Logan and Scott onscreen would equal a chuckle, because of the tension between them) I personally thought that Storm and Sabretooth (two of my most favorite characters) were a little under developed, but good. The action is relentless, and I only counted one boring scene. Some people had say this is a short movie, but really isn't. It's around 105 minutes, but so good it seems like, 80 minutes. I loved the way Bryan Singer directed it: but of course, we gotta respect the writers, because without em no movies would exist. We gotta thank them for giving us a real, dimensional comic book movie, for healing the cuts Batman made. (sure, Blade and Spawn were good-but not this good) And of course, making everyone forget Marvel went bankrupt and made Punisher. (but lets not bring that up) I know it wasn't a comic book movie, but Xmen in my opinion blew Matrix out of the water, simply because I thought some of the characters were better developed than in Matrix. I loved the heck outta this movie, it was so good. Look out for Shadowcat, Jubilee, (I think I saw Nightcrawler-but not positive) and Iceman had a small role... And of course, many answers aren't answered. Mystique is still alive, judging by the Sen, Kelly video, Magneto isn't dead, and I'm not quite sure if Sabretooth and toad are dead either. Wolverine's got to come back, and of course there's Bishop, Cable, Gambit, Angel, and many others (especially Beast) to explore. Also, we saw shots of Prof. X walking, and Wolverine having dreams of his surgery. These are never explained, so all this adds up to another Xmen movie. I hope it's as action-packed, funny, suspenseful, surprising and downright awesome as the first one. 10/10"

","Well, XMen has finally hit Australian shores, and in front of a packed cinema last night we finally got to see what all the hype is about, after the trailers, the web sites and the numerous bits of gossip that have leaked out about this highly anticipated entry into the superhero franchise.<br/><br/>It does not disappoint.  Its got something for everyone.  It has lots of backstory setting up the whole thing for three of our main characters (Rogue, Wolverine and Magneto), its got a fantastic english actor playing Magneto (McKellen), and it has plenty of action to keep the adrenaline junkies happy.<br/><br/>As I said it does go into the backstory quite extensively for three of the leads, though it does add a richness to the whole thing that you would otherwise not think. Instead of being bored with the backstory it instead intrigues you.  They have certainly left plenty there for a sequel.  In fact, X-Men is probably the most open ended movie I have seen for quite a while.<br/><br/>With such a relatively large cast, some characters are left underdeveloped or underused.  Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm are the notable candidates.  But in a story that focusses its energies elsewhere it is understandable that this had to happen.  I am sure they will get more to do in the next film.<br/><br/>It does have plenty of good one liners to keep it bobbing along (my personal favourite, and one to look out for is the ""you're a dick"" line).<br/><br/>Its also over very quickly.  I am sure it went for no more than 90 minutes.  Once the climactic battle on top of the Statue of Liberty is finished you realise just how quickly the time has gone.<br/><br/>On the negative side, the score is absolutely woeful.  Michael Kamen does just not deliver the goods in this case.  This movie called for a big majestic score to go with the impressive visuals.  What we get is some tink tink in the background with the TV Series X-Men theme thrown in once or twice for good measure.<br/><br/>The effects are quite good (but not as good as their boast ""best special effects since The Matrix).  But they should slow down the graphical representations they use when planning their battles, they often flowed by and you couldn't make out what the hell they were looking at.<br/><br/>X-Men promises and delivers.  It is big, dumb fun that will please the entire audience.  I am certainly looking forward to more entries in this particular franchise.<br/><br/>

","Yup this movie stands above Mortal Kombat, Street Fighter, Spawn, Judge Dredd and the likes of it. Hell, all the following I mentioned above are not even good. It was even better than Blade and the original Batman movie. I finally realize what makes a superhero movie work, A good director and a production crew who actually cares. Most of these other shameful attempts are made by people who either have a long list of bad movies under their name or have no list at all. Backed by the companies who are shamelessly using their trademark names looking for a quick buck.<br/><br/>Fortunately, they've now learned their lesson. I guess after watching Spawn and Mortal Kombat flopping at the box office, they've figured that they can no longer fool the audience. With X-Men they've finally picked a critically acclaimed director in Bryan Singer (usual suspects). I'm quiet impressed by what he achieved because making this movie is a very hard task. If you were one of those comic book junkies like am I, you know what I mean. The original story of the X-Men is so complex and broad that I thought it would be impossible to create in a less than two hours movie.

","This movie has a great and unique quality - it is a comic-book movie that develops its own story while, at the same time, keeping loyal to its characters and backgrounds. There's the usual good points to mention:  the heroes and villains look great, the FX are good. The action is satisfactory but if you were looking for an intense, edge-of-your-seat action movie,(i.e. something like the Matrix); you may be disappointment. This is not where the heart of this movie lies. What drives this movie is not the unique fight-scenes that only super-human individuals could reach, but the characters. This movie is about the personal struggles of the characters; against their enemies and among each other.  The director, Bryan Singer, uses his experience as an apt director to carry this through. Singer does a lot for this movie: great camera angles, editing, and a sleak and serious overall look. But his best contribution is how he directs the actors. Character development is done with very few words of dialogue and Singer seems to know that the right expression and gestures will say more about a person than any great, Shakespeare-esque speech could ever hope to do. This movie has not only made is plausible but tasteful to have a sequel; perhaps even a series of movies. By the end of this film, important questions were unanswered and personal issues were left unresolved - just like life. I loved this movie and I hope that a sequel follows tightly to the style of the original."

","I took my nine-year old to see X-Men and he loved it, which was to be expected I guess.  But I enjoyed it too.  I found the Batman series to be pretty tedious - too dark and brooding for a  comic book-inspired movie. Superman, on the other hand, was too light - it left no impression that lasted beyond exiting the theatre.<br/><br/>The X-Men movie on the other hand, though not perfect, at least has an interesting cast that doesn't get completely overshadowed by the special effects, which are very good.  Hugh Jackman gives a convincing performance as the angst-ridden Wolverine and Anna Paquin is a very believable Rogue, with considerable depth to her performance.  Patrick Stewart is perfect for the role of Professor X, and the rest of the cast is adequate.<br/><br/>True, the introduction of the characters takes up quite a bit of time. But that is a lot more engrossing than the formulaic whiz-bang James Bond kind of intro., that moves from one special effect to the next with tedious predictability.  The action, when it came, was good and sharply directed. The big finale was a bit diffuse though.  I kept wondering if it was going to be just the precursor to an even bigger showdown with Magneto and crew, and I don't think I would have been thinking that if it had had a bit more oomph to it.<br/><br/>But that is a small quibble.  I liked it.  I think it is going to be a big hit."

Halle Berry was good too, but her acting abilities weren't really put to the test, although she looked PERFECT for her role.

Predictably, Wolverine steals the show. In fact Hugh Jackman turns in a first-rate performance as Logan - making up for my early disappointment when I heard last year that Russel Crowe turned down the role. Scott and Jean were both underused I thought and I didn't really like the dumbing down of Jean's abilities but they can develop. In fact the sequel should be even more impressive. This movie has defined the characters, culture and context very well. The next one can just be an action-packed romp.<br/><br/>Can you imagine a Bond-style opening featuring the X-Men?

"john t-2","8","0","0","17 July 2000"," X-Men meets my expectations.
","On Friday morning, July 14th, the X-Men was released nationwide and this is a day that I had awaited with some anticipation.  I had honestly looked forward to this movie more than any other that I can remember.<br/><br/>Why?  Well, I'm certainly a fan, and I know that filmmaking has the technology to do justice to the presentation of superheroes without the effects looking cheesy.  If the story is solid, this should be a good film, I thought.  I was disappointed when both of Chicago's daily newspapers' reviewers gave the film a less than stunning review.<br/><br/>Roger Ebert of the Sun Times was the more generous, giving it 2 1/2 stars, a lukewarm endorsement, while Michael Wilmington, of the Tribune panned the film with 1 1/2 stars.  Everyone's a critic and I think both these reviewers missed the mark.  Wilmington described the story as being so bad that the script must have been written in crayon.  This from a person who gave ""Titan A. E."" 3 1/2 stars!  (If you enjoyed ""Titan A. E."" please do not take offense.  While I thought that movie was visually appealing, I thought its story was weak in numerous places.  Hey, everyone's a critic, right?)<br/><br/>I think Roger Ebert touched on two points that indicate that he failed to follow the story and does not appreciate the feel of the comic, nor the film.  He wondered openly why Magneto would risk empowering his enemies by turning them into mutants.  This was clearly explained in the movie. Magneto's motive in turning everyone into mutants was that he reasoned if everyone were a mutant, the need to persecute persons on the basis of their differences would go away.  (This is arguably a good plan.  I, for one, assume that if the world were all mutants, we would find some other way to discriminate.  Like, we would decide that some types of mutations were better than others.)<br/><br/>Later, he allows that he does not understand the appeal of Wolverine and what would make him a major character.  Afterall, he reasons, Storm can control the weather and is the most powerful of the bunch.  Wouldn't that make her more important?  Surely, Mr. Ebert should understand the appeal of the laconic hero, such as Mifune Toshiro's Yojimbo, or Clint Eastwood's the man with no name.  Like Wolverine, these are people who might easily be bad, but choose to fight on the side of good, more or less.  They are ultimately more interesting than well defined good guys and play a pivotal role in the story.  Not that you wouldn't want Storm or Cyclops on your side!<br/><br/>But, I'm not here to critique the critics.  I say all this merely to provide the backdrop against which I took Friday afternoon off and went to see the matinee performance of ""X-Men.""  I was not disappointed.  Was I blown away by the movie?  No.  It wasn't like seeing ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" which left me worn out from its seemingly non-stop action.  Nor was I as impressed as I was with ""The Matrix,"" whose fresh story and astounding special effects caught me unprepared.<br/><br/>In the case of ""X-Men,"" I can say simply that my expectations were met.  The effects were good, convincing, but did not dominate the story.  They got Wolverines claws just right, sound and all.  Storm and Magneto both manifested their control over the elements as you might expect and Cyclop's power blast was perfect.  The story was straight from the comics in that it was true to the theme of the X-Men, but it's very basic, just about bad guys versus good guys.  It wasn't Victor Hugo nor Herman Melville, but it was a good enough story for you to care.  And, I thought they did a good job of introducing characters and getting people, who wouldn't know anything about the X-Men, into the framework of the film.  It wasn't an easy job, given that there was a wide ensemble to be introduced.  They had to compress a lot of history into what is just a few minutes.  I thought the sets were good, and the dialog was decent, no speeches, but the few lines were distributed fairly evenly across a number of characters.  Finally, just as the effects did not dominate the story, nor was it all out action.  There was a story in between the fights and the effects.<br/><br/>Were there downsides?  I suppose that I was disappointed that we didn't get to see a lot more interaction between mutants and non-mutants, to bolster the sense of the strained relationship between them.  Similarly, we are basically trapped in the Mansion or Magneto's lair for much of the film. What we do see of the outside world indicates that it is not so different from our own and that is a plus for this film versus the comic book worlds of films such as ""Batman"" or ""The Crow.""  All in all, though, I would say they did a credible job in the time alloted to the film.<br/><br/>Perhaps this doesn't sound like a ringing endorsement, and it's true that I am not going around telling people that they cannot afford to miss this film.  Rather, I would say that if you think you might like the ""X-Men,"" then you will.  They did a good job on this film, and I'm looking forward to their adventures in the future.<br/><br/>P.S.  I took my wife to see the film later that evening and she liked it too!"

","While X-Men is far from flawless, At least Mr. Singer seems to respect the characters and the source material enough to take them seriously (which is more than I can say for Mr. Shumacher or Mr. Burton). The first half of the film works surprisingly well, especially the Haulocost sequence and Logan's introduction.  What's also fascinating is that Bryan singer seems more interested in the quiet moments than in the Pyrotechnics.  Wolverines conversation with Rogue at the train station, for example.  There is a certain fragile quality to those scenes. Unfortunately, things fall apart in the third act, mainly because of the thin plot and surprisingly lifeless action sequences ( although the train station battle and Magneto's stand off with the police are handled well).  You can almost feel the film pulling it's punches.  I would have preferred a more straight forward approach to the fight coreography instead of all the Hong Kong style wire work.  Note to Bryan Singer and company: Just because ""The Matrix"" grossed nearly two hundred million does not mean that every ""comic Book"" movie has to look like Iron Monkey. I liked what I saw, but I wanted more.  I'm really curious as to what was in those 35 to 45 minutes that Fox took out of this film just prior to release.  I'll bet it consisted mostly of character development and plot. Hopefully, Bryan will get a bigger budget (and a longer running time) with the sequel after Fox sees this weekends box office results. Bryan seems to aiming for a thinking man's popcorn movie, and while he wasn't completly successful this time, I can see what he's getting at.  If nothing else, you've earned my respect, Mr. Singer.  I give you a well deserved B this time.  Maybe Fox will take you more seriously now that you've delivered the 4th biggest opening in history.  With X-Men 2, I think you should have a reasonable shot at an A+."

","You know, there are a great many things that could easily have wrecked this movie completely.  Marvel Comics adaptations have a pretty poor track record of coming across in live-action to either TV or the movies, especially when compared against their competition from DC.  Witness The Punisher, The Trial of the Incredible Hulk, Captain America, Doctor Strange, and a good handful more.  Balance these with the successes of the old 70's Spider Man series (cheesy, but not a bad effort at all for its time), the majority of The Incredible Hulk series and the recent Blade, and you can imagine how terrified I was that X-Men simply wasn't going to cut it.<br/><br/>I mean, bring in the biggest overall franchise Marvel has had in the last 20 years, throw in ""that guy from Star Trek"", ""that guy from Apt Pupil"" and several supermodels, and everything points to an expensive disaster that would kill the credibility of what used to be a really good comic book. Granted, I'm talking 15-20 years ago, but I am, after all, at least that old, and it was, after all, really that good for a while.<br/><br/>I was worried, to say the least.<br/><br/>But then, I noticed who was directing.  Bryan Singer most assuredly did not screw up with The Usual Suspects.  Not a bad pedigree, that.  Also, one of the aforementioned supermodels, Famke Janssen, proved she can actually act a while back when she bloody well held her own against that very same guy from Star Trek -- IN Star Trek, no less.  She also added a great deal to GoldenEye, and I'm not just talking about visuals, either.<br/><br/>""Onotopp?""<br/><br/>""Onotopp.""<br/><br/>Sorry -- where was I?  Oh, yes.  Then there's this whole Hugh Jackman guy. Never heard of him, and he gets to play what is potentially the pivotal role in the (contracted) trilogy?  Granted, I was pulling for Robin Williams or Gary Sinise, but that just goes to show what an idiot I can be when I put my mind to it.  So Wolverine was a big question mark.<br/><br/>I went to see it the Friday night it opened.  You know what? It Does Not Suck.  Not only does it Not Suck, but it's actually Pretty Good.<br/><br/>Remember, I'm from Minnesota.  Up here, winning the lottery is considered ""Pretty Good"", too.<br/><br/>You know what?  It was such a solid Pretty Good that I went back on Saturday and paid to see it again, this time with my friends. They came out saying the same thing -- ""You know what?  That Did Not Suck.  In fact, It was Pretty Good"".<br/><br/>This, of course, led to the many details underlying the concept of Pretty Goodness, including Hugh Jackman's absolute nailing of his part, the rest of the cast doing their jobs and then some without trying to take over, and, most of all, Bryan Singer showing that rarest of qualities in a Hollywood director, restraint.  Not one shot stood out as being bigger/badder/bloodier than it needed to be, and that is saying something these days.<br/><br/>Bottom line -- go see it.  Comic book movies are very rarely this good, and one like this deserves to make enough money so that we might actually SEE the other two for which the cast has been contracted.<br/><br/>If we're lucky, we'll get Bryan Singer back, too.<br/><br/>IMDB rating = 9"

I was disappointed with the limited role a star like Halle Berry played, but I can forgive them if they make up for it in the upcoming sequels. In addition I owe an apology to whoever did the casting. I cursed them night and day when I heard Hugh Jackman won the part, I was wrong. In fact he became Wolverine! Right down to the cigar. This movie is a must see for anyone who loved the comic."

","I had a lot of hope leading up to this movie. FOX had a 30 minute special on TV to hype the movie, and initially I thought X-MEN was going to be like Street Fighter and be really cheezy. But then seeing some of the clips, I became really impressed. One review said it's better then the MATRIX, which really shot up my expectations. With such high expectations I was a bit let down. The special effects were great, I liked the premise of the story and the story line... but the pace was too casual, and the  movie lacked intensity. Storm was pretty useless. Cyclops was too young, and didn't really say anything (when he's supposed to be next in command after Xavier). They seemed to want to touch upon Wolverine's past, and then skipped that part over. Though I was listening to Howard Stern this morning, and they had the Executive Producer on. He was saying they're in talks of  working on a sequel."

","When I came to see this film on the 12th of July, this year 2000, I had my doubts.  Could Singer pull of the greatest comic book movie of all time? Well, yes!  For the true fanboys, the film might seem drawn out, exploring the relationships between the characters, but for everyone else, what a film! The action is mind blowing, and Wolverine really carries the film. The casting is great and the plot stupendous.  And Stan the Man makes a cameo!<br/><br/>X-Cellent!"

","I went in expecting a bad movie. I was surprised. It was actually good. Not great. But it had this feeling of not wanting to be great. Or at least not trying to be great, just fun and tightly done. Which it was. The movie is really focused on Wolverine, which is good; I guess they recognized that Wolverine is most people's favorite X-Man. Rogue would be the second banana I guess. She doesn't get to do much but she is the key everyone is after.<br/><br/>Some very well-done super hero fight scenes. The strong point of the movie. They are really handled well. Some good special effects. Although they don't make a movie they are used well here.<br/><br/>The story trucks along at a brisk pace. A little too brisk in some points. But you are never left too long to think about how silly it all is.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are great together. Hugh Jackman carries the movie.<br/><br/>It's greatest fault is it feels like it has been over-edited.

","Obviously, I liked -ehem, LOVED!- X-Men. I came in expecting a movie with effects but not believable, good characters but not feeling, excitement but not thrill. It WAS believable, I FELT for the characters, I was SO thrilled I had to control myself from shaking and freaking the person sitting next to me. Others have said that the movie was too serious. I think that most movies are not serious enough (with too many jokes) but that this movie was just right (Wolverine made a few punches to keep us slightly relaxed... while still on the edge of our seats).<br/><br/>Okay, so the movie was obviously slamming conservative Christians but hey, I am one and I can live with that!

","When I went to see the X-Men movie earlier today I was expecting something good. Something like the original Batman. A dark comic book movie that had a good story and some good action scenes. Well this movie doesn't deliver them. This movie is basically introducing the characters that all the fans already know, and the film makers are also telling us about there special powers. By the time we get to know them the movie is half way done. This movie is like The Phantom Menace it introduces the characters and its set them up for the next sequels. The only problem is that the Phantom menace sets the characters up for the story we all know while X-men is setting them all for the sequels. Not only that The Phantom Menace had some very good action sequences like the pod race and the final battle. While x-men has some action sequences there not every good. The battle between Wolverine and Sabertooth something all the fans want is every short and ain't that good. A few punches and then wolverine defeats Sabertooth with two punches. Also the special effects were pretty lame. They weren't that good. Also what is it with the costumes. Does every super villain has to have some sort of cape to say that there some special force with super powers. There were many things that were done wrong with the movie that could have been done better and those things could have made the movie better. One thing  that I didn't like was wolverine's claws they look like plastic.  The claws don't look any dangerous they just look like some toys. The movie could have been better and so could the action that's the weakest points of the movie. For a movie like this you need a good story and very good action sequences to support it. This movie has a good story but the action sequences aren't that good nor are the special effects. This could have been a good or maybe a great action movie but it wasn't"

","This was the summer movie I was most anticipating.  The trailers assured me that it would be great.  I watched the behind the scenes special on the Fox network several times to hold me over until July 14.  I was very excited in the theater as the opening credits rolled.  X-Men lived up to my own personal hype.  It surpassed comic book films such as Blade, Men In Black, and the Batman sequels.  The characters were realistic in terms of speech and emotions.  Their powers looked great on the big screen.  The plot reminded me of that of an X-Men comic.  But, that was a good thing.  All of the characters were portrayed as I thought of them.  The acting was very well done.  Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) was the most interesting character. He had the best lines.  Through the entire movie I was convinced that I was actually watching the X-Men fight evil rather than people acting.  Ray Park did a particularly good job as the amphibious Toad, a member of Magneto's Brotherhood.  His agility was amazing to watch.  Great special effects enhanced his top notch performance.  My only complaint is Storm's stupid lines.  I'm surprised they weren't replaced with something at least a little better.  The movie focuses mainly on Wolverine, Rogue, Magneto, and Professor X.  The other characters are given a sufficient amount of screen time.  I don't want to get too much into the plot because it gradually unfolds throughout the movie.  The action was on the same level as last year's The Matrix and The Phantom Menace.  There are a lot of violent situations; but there isn't much blood or gore.  This was done for the PG-13 rating.  X-Men was an excellent movie that was great the first time around. I can't wait until I see it again.  Even if you're not an X-Men fan, I think you will enjoy it if you like fast paced action and fine acting."

It doesn't have A LOT of cursing and there was almost no innuendo.  That may not be too important to some people but it was for me.  I found myself cheering for my present favourite character, Wolverine, and I was even sort of cheering for the bad guys.  I didn't want them to win but I didn't want them to be destroyed either.

"jb0767","8","0","0","12 July 2000"," Erases the nightmare of Batman and Robin
","Comic book movies in Hollywood generally mean: nice guys with superpowers versus evil guys with superpowers, lots of special effects and overdone settings and some very one-dimensional characters. Well, X-Men changes all that. At last Hollywood has dared to deliver a comic book film with depth and some real issues to discuss. And  we actually have a villain with layers and complexity, who could be any one of us who has been persecuted and decided to strike back.<br/><br/>The story tells of children born with genetic mutations and how they learn to cope with their abilities once they grow up and society turns against them. Some decide to use their powers for beneficial means, others decide to live alone, eking out an existence and raising a finger to those who scorn them, and some decide to hit back against prejudice and persecution. The conflict is between the mutants themselves  in particular Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), a telepath who has established a school for mutant children  he calls them gifted', and Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Nazi victim who wages war against anti-mutant sentiment. Both are fighting for the same cause  acceptance of mutations  but both take different paths and end up on opposite sides.<br/><br/>Into this conflict is drawn Logan (Hugh Jackman) an angry savage loner with some interesting physical mutations and a past he can only remember in nightmares. He joins up with Rogue (Anna Paquin) a teenage runaway who finds her touch drains the life from her boyfriends. They become crucial pawns in the chess battle between Xavier's and Magneto's opposing teams of mutants.<br/><br/>What I like about the film is that it has faith in its universe and stands up for the premise and the characters it portrays.  There are no gimmicky features to distract you from the story. Colours are muted and realistic  no garish costumes or noirish black shadows and Gothic settings. The film focuses on its characters and lets them stand on their own. No hokey villains. Magneto is just a man with a different agenda, and his solution to anti-mutant sentiment actually makes you think a bit. Remember the Romans and the Christians?<br/><br/>Overall this is a really good film that can match it with the best of 2000 releases. As a comic book film it's different and Bryan Singer (director) has created something new which raises the bar for others to follow. The casting is excellent as are the performances, the standouts being McKellen and Jackman, whose Logan/Wolverine is complex and brilliantly portrayed.<br/><br/>The script is very good and the dialogue is superb. There are some very funny lines. The characters get laughs from the lines, not from their costumes or their over-the-top mannerisms. The effects are excellent but the film does not rely on them, just uses them when the story demands it. The mutants' powers really blow you away though.<br/><br/>It's well paced although a little short, but a good introduction to the X-Universe for those who don't know it. If you've never heard of X-Men you will still enjoy and follow the film's storyline. If you're a long X-fan or comic fan, well this is the movie you've been waiting for. Hats off to everybody involved.<br/><br/>The only disappointment is the score. It's pretty average.<br/><br/>Overall 8 out of 10."
"ninjahero-3","Null","0","0","14 July 2000"," X-Men is great and I think the critics have missed the boat.
","I read one review that suggested the makers of X-Men `lighten up' with the next in the series if a sequel is in the future.  It is clear to me having seen X-Men that this person and those critics like him have obviously seen a different movie.  X-Men is full of exciting action, wonderful characters, and a surprising amount of humor.  The exchanges between Cyclops and Wolverine are worth the price of admission.  I'm not sure how one gets to become a movie critic, but I imagine it entails sticking one's head way up one's behind.  If I sound a somewhat bitter it is because critics tend to crush the chances of great comic book movies with mean-spirited reviews while praising pieces of crap like the latter parts of the Superman series and the Batman series respectively.  Isn't that something?  In my opinion there have only been two really good Comic Book films...Blade and X-men. All the others tend to disappoint when it should be so easy to please with $150 million dollar budgets.  I'm curious what Mr. Maltin will have to say about this one."

"Riom Stonn","10","0","0","14 July 2000"," Telekinetically rose past my expectations...
","When I saw the many previews of X-Men, being a follower of the comics, I was somewhat disappointed. They didn't even keep the costumes which to me was a somewhat big part of the X-Men, it was what separated each of them(aside from the powers, duh!). In the movie, apparently, they wore all black, taking away that uniqueness each had aside from their powers. They didn't have Angel or Beast even, characters there since the beginning. They had Rogue, but not Gambit(For me, you should have had both, not just one)! Moreover about Rogue, she didn't have that white hair you see in the comics(and even the cartoon) and she wore a cloak, not a leather jacket which she wore in the comics and cartoons!!! Mystique was naked the whole time(not that bad a thing) whereas she should have a costume, Sabretooth looked nothing like himself and who the hell was Toad?!<br/><br/>So upon arriving at the theater, I was expecting not much at all. However, I sure was wrong about the movie. The movie still captured many aspects of the comic even though it missed out on others. The conflict between Wolverine and Cyclops was great, Charles was as hopeful as ever with Magneto forever opposing him and Wolverine still had the thing for Jean! Even more, Rogue does happen to get her unique blotch of white hair in the end(If you want to know how, watch the movie, there will be no spoilers here)! The action was pretty cool, I was seeing some of my favorite super heroes come to life. Watching Wolverine break out those awesome adamantium claws of his was so damn cool! As was seeing Storm hit Sabretooth with a bolt of lightning and Cyclops hitting them with his optic blasts! The Toad wasn't bad either, but Sabretooth still needed some work. The plot was something really pulled out a comic book which I wanted & liked and the actors played their roles well enough for me. Even if you're not a fan, give X-Men a try, bub! It's not as bad as you may think."

Sure, some X-Men were left out, but that's the reason to make a sequel.  And while we're on that subject, why do we call it a sequel? The James Bond films have never been ""sequels"", the Star Wars films are certainly not ""sequels"".  <br/><br/>The story was dead on for origins.  Wolvie's powers and abilities, Rogue's fear of her powers, all beautifully explored.  Anna Paquin really delivers in her performance here and, if the Academy didn't have their noses in the air about these kinds of films, she should be considered for another Oscar. Hugh Jackman is now a movie star in this country.  Halle Berry was pretty good as the weather controller.

"cmdywrtr","9","0","0","14 July 2000"," For fanboys and regular homo-sapiens alike.
","Yes, I'll admit it. I read comic books. And yes, I've read the X-Men comic books. In fact, I started reading XMEN when I was about thirteen, and got quickly hooked.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't know, (as if the media juggernaut for this movie hasn't run you over yet) the X-Men are mutants. They're born with genetic abnormalities which give them super powers. These powers usually manifest around puberty. Mutants, in general, are feared and hated by the rest of humanity.<br/><br/>Is it any wonder teenagers eat this stuff up?<br/><br/>Well, we all grow up. I still read X-MEN from time to time, but not with the fanatical devotion of my teenage years (at one point I was reading ""X-Men,"" ""X-Factor,"" ""eXcalibur,"" ""X-Force"" and ""Wolverine,"" much to the detriment of my savings account). Now, maybe I'm just being an old fart, but I SWEAR the comics had better quality when I was younger. The thing that always drew me to the book (well, aside from the adolescent male power fantasies) was that, unlike many super-team funnybooks, X-MEN was character driven. Most of the heroes had major flaws, and the villains weren't really evil, they just saw the world with a different set of ethics. Best of all, their super-powers were often as much a curse as a blessing.<br/><br/>Recently, the writer who brought comicsdom its best X-MEN stories (and characters such as Wolverine, Storm and Rogue) has come back to the title--which is good, because recently, X-MEN has been all about a bunch of super-powered, spandex-clad yahoos who go out and beat up on the bad guys.<br/><br/>Now, I was afraid that X-MEN might be like THAT. Fortunately, it's not.<br/><br/>Okay, much as director Bryan Singer (THE USUAL SUSPECTS) has denied it, X-MEN is an action movie. But it's most decidedly NOT a children's film. The PG-13 is there for a reason--don't bring your eight year old, assuming it's just a comic book movie. You'll scare him. He also won't be able to follow it.<br/><br/>I'll admit, I was rooting for this film. I wanted it to be good. Well, it met my expectations and exceeded them.<br/><br/>First point: you don't have to read a single X-MEN comic book to enjoy this film. It actually opens in Poland, 1944, in order to explain the motivations of its villain. That, from the get-go, let me know that they'd done this movie right. Any movie which uses its opening sequence to humanize the bad guy (ESPECIALLY a summer special-effects blockbuster) gets major props in my book. Next, we see the harrowing trauma one young girl goes through when her powers manifest. In fact, we don't really see an action sequence until about 20 minutes in, when we're introduced to Wolverine (Hugh Jackman).<br/><br/>You're gonna be seeing more of this Hugh Jackman guy. Mark my words. In fact, unlike MOST comic-book adaptations, the producers of X-MEN went out and found themselves actors who could actually ACT. One big fanboy complaint has been the casting of Anna Paquin as Rogue. Now, in the comic-books, Rogue is a incredibly well-endowed babe. Anna Paquin... well, she's cute and all, but no one would call her the comic-book model of babeitude. Well, lemme tell ya--Rogue was NOT an easy role. A lesser actress would have come off as a whiny, annoying, self-pitying ass--kind of like Lacey Chabert in... well, in anything. Fanboys everywhere should thank their lucky stars that the producers didn't listen to them.<br/><br/>Second point: if you've read the comic books, you'll especially like the metallic ""clang"" when Wolverine hits a guy. You'll also like the cameos (such as Shadowcat, Iceman, Jubilee, and even Pyro). But especially, you'll like that Bryan Singer and writers Tom DeSanto (APT PUPIL) and David Hayter do justice to the characters. They're also smart enough to keep the story focused on the more interesting characters, (Wolverine and Rogue) while giving the more two-dimensional characters (Cyclops and Jean Grey) a backseat.<br/><br/>Anyway, if you like action movies, run right out and see this sucker. If you're not a big action movie fan but you find yourself sucked into seeing them (by family or friends), then you could do a whole lot worse than X-MEN.<br/><br/>Like any Jerry Bruckheimer movie, for example.<br/><br/>X-Men gets 4.87632 out of 5 Woobs. Just about perfect for its genre."

","I must admit, I was unsure whether or not I'd enjoy the X-Men movie when I first heard about it.  I went into the advance screening of X-Men expecting the worst.  I'm happy to say I wasn't disappointed.  In fact I was pretty pleased, along with the rest of the audience.  Singer's film is not without faults, but it is a highly enjoyable interpretation of one of the biggest comic properties around. The film opens in the 1940's as we see a young Magneto being separated from his parents in the middle of a Nazi concentration camp.  We quickly see the awesome power this young man possesses.  Jump to the not too distant future, where we meet a confused girl named Rogue, who learns of her power in a frightening way.  The film doesn't waste too much time on story, but rather jumps forward with numerous character introductions.  We learn that Mutants are the subject of fear within the American public.  One man in particular, Senator Kelley, has determined that Mutants must not be tolerated due to their unpredictable nature.  Meanwhile, Rogue leaves home only to find another Mutant in the form of the rough and rugged Wolverine.  They are attacked in the snow filled woods of Canada by another vicious Mutant named Sabretooth.  Just when things start to look really bad, two more mutants show up to save the day.  Jump to the Xavier School, where Wolverine and Rogue find safety among others like them.  We learn that Professor X, played casually by Patrick Stewart, has assembled a bevy of Mutant youngsters in an attempt to teach them and help them understand their powers.  We also find out that Magneto, all grown up and immensely powerful, has devised a lethal plan to get back at his human persecutors.  The first thirty to forty minutes of the film simply introduce and explain all of the key characters and plot points to us.  We then become aware that Magneto's plan is contingent on acquiring the power of one of our heroes.  Then the major action starts, and pretty much doesn't stop for the rest of the film. The movie is paced fairly well.  We never really get much of a chance to be bored, and there are plenty of nice effects to gaze at.  Singer tries to spend a fair amount of time on each character, but it's obvious he wants to focus on Wolverine.  Hugh Jackman does a fantastic job of portraying the popular hero, but I can't help feeling that some of the other characters get neglected.  Cyclops, who has always been one of my favorite characters, doesn't really have much to do here.  Oh sure, he stands around and looks tough, but I wanted to see more depth from him.  He and Storm, played quietly by Halle Berry, are for the most part just set dressing.  I really got the sense that we were missing some development scenes here and there. I hate to say this, but I really got the feeling that Wolverine was doing too much.  During the film's finale, our rugged hero fights THREE battles, one after the other.  Why couldn't Cyclops jump in there?  Perhaps if the franchise continues, the sequels will spend more time with the other heroes. All in all the film is pretty well done.  We get most of what we want, which is fast-paced action and lots of groovy effects.  The film is not without surprises either.  Look for cameos by other X-Men, or shall I say soon to be X-Men.  Judging by the audience reaction, this film is really going to do well.  In my opinion the best thing about the film is the fact that it will open some doors in Hollywood for others like it.  Singer has provided a nice template to work from, let's just see which artist uses it next."

Visually, it's wonderful, with some tremendous special effects from the get go. And there's some great dialogue, too (especially Wolverine's comment to Cyclops when asked to prove he was Wolverine). But the storyline was a bit lacking in intrigue, and that kind of ruined the experience for me."

Movie is NOT suitable for children, and there were many children in the audience...most left quietly and seemed dazed. Parents should not bring young ones to this film....should be at least 13 years of age. I liked the storyline but felt special effects overwhelmed it.

","I have just spent the last one hundred minutes in total bliss. I have just come out from watching the X-Men movie, and it has at last proven to me that to make a good comic book film takes a major company to employ a very good director to direct exceptional actors, who take their profession serious enough to make it feel like you've known their world all of your life.<br/><br/>As you've probably guessed, I am a big X-Men fan and have been for the last twenty-five years. I have watched the development of characters within the books, Watched members die and seen new members born. Seen brother fights their own brother and even their own father, I have felt their pain and joy, and as a family they have become part of my life.<br/><br/>When I first heard that they where about to make this movie, the first thought that came to mind was the original series of spider-man films then I remembered the last comic book hero that I had seen in films of which I enjoyed watching which was Batman. Things just had to get better. Today was the day that things would change for better or for worse, today was the day I got to see people that I have known most of my life in the flesh. Dying with anticipation I arrived at the cinema took my seat then waited. There was not much wrong with the film apart from the obvious differences in age with some of the major and minor characters, and the obvious lack of stronger personalities, it was just great to see people that you could feel for, feelings either of warmth or disdain. I am not going to mention scenes from the film as I urge all to see for themselves, all I can say is thank you Bryan Singer for making the world of the X-men real for the rest of the world.  Roll on X-Men 2"

","Yes, it's true: X-men delivers where even Superman II and Batman stumbled. It captures the spirit of its subject and the fun of comics in general. Credit Jackman, who has presence to burn, and Singer, who makes (almost) every fight fun to watch and allows us to feel awe at the characters' powers.  Some roles are a bit smaller than one would like, but that's why there are sequels. Also notable are Paquin, whose acting saves the movie's heart, as a younger and less va-voom Rogue than in the books,  and McKellan, with all of Magneto's smoothness and ruthlessness.  Berry, however, seems bored but looks great. This works not just as a comics movie, but as a movie, and that is why it succeeds where others have failed: instead of stringing together set pieces, it tells a STORY; a good one, well told."

","Probably the most anticipated movie of the year, the X-Men have finally arrived. A lot of fans have been eagerly awaiting this film while having to barge through all the gossip and fortelling that stemmed from the internet. Well, the movie actually turned out fairly well. It revolves a lot around Wolverine, played brilliantly by Hugh Jackman. Let's just be glad that Dougray Scott had to bow out to finish MI2, and was unable to bring his level of sucktitude to this film. Look out for Jackman, he could become a major star if he picks the right roles. Surprisingly, Patrick Stewart's role is rather small, as well as most of the other characters like Toad, Mystique, and thankfully Storm, Halley Berry just looks and sounds awful in this. Look for a funny little moment when Ray Park gives a little Darth Maul twist to Toad. The dialogue had its stupid moments, as most blockbusters do, but the banter between Wolvie and Cyclops is often hilarious and well written. Overall, go see it if you like action flicks. The special effects are pretty good, and its worth it just to see Wolvie's claws and of course the hair. Bryan Singer did an excellent job translating the comic to film. And if there is a sequel, as the ending suggests of course, lets hope he helms it. Afterall, who wants to see Joel"

","Why bother going to see The X-Men?  It comes out tomorrow, but it seems that I have seen most of the film already in the previews, which have appeared in theatres, on television and on the Web.  I must have watched a quarter of it by now.<br/><br/>The premise finds its way into a McCarthy-esque era, where super-evolved human mutants stand trial for the mere fact that they are different from the rest of mankind.  In a world where anything can happen, quite often happenstance, it seems, takes the shape of human evolution.  Oddly enough, it occurs beyond the realm of Darwinian theory, for each mutation here is different from the next.  No new species appears to come into being, but rather a hodgepodge of supermen, each unique unto themselves.<br/><br/>There is Cyclops, whose vision is like laser blasts.  There is Storm, who can influence the weather and cause hit-and-run car accidents.  Wolverine has great physical prowess and a high threshold for painful critical reviews.  Rogue absorbs the emotions and memories of other individuals (and wild geese), struggling to keep her own thoughts and emotions in the forefront of her ultralight mind.    Jean Grey has telekinetic abilities, as troubled as those she had aboard the Enterprise, when she mentally bonded with Captain Make-It-So.  Professor Charles Xavier, nee Captain Make-It-So, possesses telepathy, often speaking into other's minds as he was wont to do with `I am Loqutus of Borg, resistance is futile.'  Magneto, god or monster, holds the power of magnetism.  Sabertooth, an orthodontist's dream, can heal himself so quickly he is virtually invulnerable, immortal and may thus survive into any sequels.  Mystique, who has chameleon-like abilities, is able to morph herself into anyone alive including Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. Finally, Toad has superhuman lower body strength and may well be the envy of every adult male film star, but that's a tail to be wagged, not tolled.<br/><br/>The basic plot of The X-Men appears to be rather formula.  Boy meets girl. Boy faces NSC hearings.  Boy battles mutants.  Boy saves world and wins respect of humanity.  Great special effects.   Wonderful costumes and, in the case of Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, wonderful paint.  Predictably bombastic script.  Too bad there probably will not be any great scenes about how being unique will affect each mutant's ability to live among the less fortunate and less imperilled masses of homo audiensus.<br/><br/>In any event, I wish the producers could have waited with all of their promotion to allow me to be either pleasantly or unpleasantly surprised. I know how it ends before it starts.  The only question remains is, is it worth watching twice?"

","As the film opens up to a very dark and morbid scene, an Encapsulating atmosphere surrounds the audience into a stunned silence. X men begins, continues and ends with an aphrodisiac that keeps you hooked for a good two hours. I walked into the cinema with extremely high expectations (being a fan) and was surprised that a film I have waited for since its filming status cleanly and easily satisfied me leaving me open mouthed in awe. With Australian Hugh Jackman and New Zealand Academy award winner Anna Paquin I was glad to watch the film not only for the sharp special effects and familiar ""abilities"" but also for the deeper and darker involvement in want and need for acceptance (Anna Paquin/Rouge) and the pain and agony of a lost past (Hugh Jackman/Wolverine). I especially liked how in first knowing of who the actors were to be portraying and their appearance compared to that of their comic counter parts, the disappointment and uncertainty completely vanished as the actors all of them slid into the age old characters and played the parts with a Rubato that was almost flawless. It is easy to go on and on about a film such as this, only i wanted not to mention the flaws I myself had picked up leaving this only my opinion on how the films success by far exceeds the conventional successful action film, and falls much further beyond that. A pleasure to watch and much more then a ""Movie"" (referring to the typical Hollywood films of course)"

As I entered the theater for the screening (I have connections in management at the local multiplex) and took my seat, I prepared for a childhood dream, smiling but worried deep down that this would ruin my fancies.<br/><br/>Guess what.  I was absolutely blown away... the first scene alone was enough to satisfy my live-action X-guys craving, the craving I'd felt since childhood.  This movie was an almost perfect adaptation of the essence of the X-Men comic, with just enough artistic license taken to make the movie both (remotely) believeable and utterly entertaining.  The production design was nearly flawless, taking what would translate horribly to the big screen (the garish yellow and blue spandex Wolverine wears in the comics was translated into black leather with gold accents, for instance) and turning it into something you want to see.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane or The Empire Strikes Back from this movie, but I got what I came to see: the X-Men whomping on Magneto and his lackeys and getting a whompin' right back... Wolverine in a berserker rage and Mystique being, well, Mystique.  I cannot stress enough how thoroughly enjoyable this movie was, albeit lacking in the heavy plot department (though the race relations tone was handled very well).   But that's not what one wants from the X-Men.  One wants Wolverine kicking the living crud outta Sabertooth or the Professor tooling about in his wheelchair.  And that's what we got, fortunately.  And I couldn't have asked for more."

","Any kind of an adaptation bears a heavy risk of missing the balance of compromise between tradition of its source material and dramatic license. Comic book adaptations seem even more prone to this balance then most media. X-Men works because it finds this balance quite handily.<br/><br/>The X-Men are products of a representation of racism and inequality. They were created in a time when these factors were predominant in society. The film actually chooses to focus on this as the story instead of setting up a reason for everyone to fight. This makes the characters not only more believable, but when the inevitable fight scenes do occur, you actually want to root for the good guys, because you actually care about them.<br/><br/>Any person who writes this movie off as another comic book adaptation may have, based on precedent, some reason to do so, but it'd be a shame to deny yourself a glimpse at what it looks like when it's done just right."

","Much like the mutants that 'X-Men' brings to the screen, this movie is of a different breed. Instead of falling into the mold of the prototypical summer blockbuster movie, 'X-Men' has raised the bar for action films in general and especially for comic book adaptations. What sets it apart is that it exceeds certain expectations for a movie released between May and August. Amazingly, 'X-Men' has been blessed with several mutations which give it an edge over typical summer fare: a well-developed story, abnormal amounts of character depth, and the ability to give its characters good dialogue. Also, the performances are good; the scenes between Wolverine & Rogue and Xavier & Magneto are especially impressive. Like most anything released these days, the special effects are above par and the cinematography is fine. Plus, Bryan Singer has shown that he has what it takes to direct an action film.<br/><br/>Despite its relatively modest budget, the makers of 'X-Men' have done something that the people behind movies like 'The Perfect Storm', 'M:I-2' and 'Gone in Sixty Seconds' did not do: make a movie for an intelligent audience and give them what they deserve - an intelligent action movie. 'X-Men' is not just another sensory overload of pretty special effects and loud noises and after watching this movie audiences will be wondering why they've put up with the same old song and dance every summer."

","OK, so I'm a big fan of the X-Men comic book and have been reading it for over 20 years.  I was skeptical of this film: I've been criticizing its casting from the beginning (except for Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier -- that's perfect casting).  So I watched with trepidation and was pleasantly surprised.  It works.  And most of the cast is just right.  The story mucks about with some of the mythology, missing some major X-Men like Colossus, Nightcrawler, Angel and the Beast (and Iceman is just a kid in the film), but so what?  The action scenes work, the story is true to the comic and both Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin are absolutely excellent (and they're the main stars, so you know you're doing well when your two leads are good). Most of the supporting cast is fine, except for Halle Berry as Storm (weak) and James Marsden as Cyclops (bland) -- plus he looks way too young to be Famke Janssen's love interest.  But even rather scrawny Ian McKellen makes a good Magneto.  So, it's pretty good, not great, but pretty good and this summer (which has been very, very bad for movies), what more can you ask for?"

Finally the film has dawned upon our cinema screens and it's actually quite good.<br/><br/>The X-Men comic was always going to be a difficult to transfer onto the film medium, Simply because there is so many heroes and villains. This film cleverly chooses its characters wisely and we also see a glimpse of what may be future pivotal characters in the hopeful sequels to come.<br/><br/>The main players for the X-Men are Prof. X, Wolverine, Cyclops, Jean Grey, Rogue and Storm. The villains are also very cool, with the obvious choice of Magneto as the main bad guy, and Sabretooth, Mystique and Toad all look exceptional in this film. Unlike the first Batman film, X-Men has chosen to include more villains in it's first outing.<br/><br/>The acting and special effects are extremely good, with notable performances from Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellan and Patrick Stewart. Hugh Jackman managed to bring Wolverine to life very convincingly. Singer's direction adds a more 'realistic' feel to the X-Men film, and I liked the design of the costumes and the theme of the film.

","When I first heard of the plans for a filmed version of The X-Men, I was skeptical.  Many times in the past, comics have been adapted into films.  Some have met with a great degree of success (Superman, Batman) and some have been total disasters (Batman & Robin, Steel).  After seeing X-Men, I can safely say that my fears were unwarrented.  Bryan Singer crafted a superb story that condenses thirty years of backstory into a movie that moves quickly, but gives you enough information on the main characters.  As for the characters, the cast was perfect.  Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are Professor X and Magneto.  The scenes between these two powerful mutants show their common respect for each other, but also illustraits the differences between them.  Hugh Jackman is perfect as Wolverine.  He's got attitude, he smokes and he's got a mean streak a mile wide.  As in the comic, there is an immediate dislike for Cyclops, and a small degree of attraction to Jean Grey.  Famke Janssen was perfect as the telekinetic doctor and James Marsden was perfectly stiff as the team's stalwart leader.  Halle Barry was a good choice as Storm, and I suspect that we'll see more of this team, hopefully it will be soon.  Facing off against the X-Men is Magneto's team of mutants. Mystique, a vicious shapeshifter, does some neat quick changes.  Toad and Sabretooth round out Magneto's team and these guys are a formidable force for the X-Men.  I think we'll see more of them soon.  <br/><br/>So, all of the X-fans can relax.  Our favorite mutant superhero team has made the giant leap from page to screen with outstanding results.  With the overwhelming repsonse the movie has generated, I hope and pray that there will be a sequel.  It would be interesting to see where Professor X and his gifted students lead us"

I was not let down.<br/><br/>Sure, there are a lot of changes from the comics, but it didn't stop me from enjoying the movie.  The movie is centered around two future X-Men, Wolverine and Rogue.  The others are just scenery, mostly.  Their characters will probably be viewed with more depth in sequels.  Hugh Jackman may be to tall and skinny for Wolverine, but, WHO CARES!!!!!!  He plays the part with the right wit and attitude you would expect.  Anna Paquin works well as Rogue, even though she is very young.  She is the mutant that we feel sorry for throughout the movie, and rightfully so.  The villans are there to provide an opposing view on how mutants should handle humanity's hatred of them.  Magneto, (Ian McKellan) is almost understandable in his violence. Still, I found myself rooting on the heroes at the end. <br/><br/>
I couldn't be happier with this stunning adaptation.  It has just the right amount of humor, action, and memorable characters you would expect from an X-Men film.  That is what kept me glued to the seat of the theater on opening night.  I was the one with a smile on my face."

Wolverine has so many mannerisms, so many little characteristics, that it would be impossible to list them all<br/><br/>here..Wolverine is a tough character, but ultimately has a heart<br/><br/>of gold[forgive the cheese]..Jackman nails that perfectly..he<br/><br/>also gets the mannerisms perfectly...being an unknown actor<br/><br/>helps, because he BECOMES Wolverine..he is Wolverine, through<br/><br/>and through...I consider this to be a amazing performance<br/><br/>because Jackman makes Wolverine real...he gives the film's truly<br/><br/>best performance... Also deserving praise is Anna Paquin as Rogue, who makes Rogue a<br/><br/>real person, by showing the fear the young girl experiences by<br/><br/>being unable to touch those around her.. And of course, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKlellan as Professor X<br/><br/>and Magneto, respectively..they give the characters the true 3<br/><br/>dimensional feel they deserve.. everyone else in the film gives commendable performances, and I<br/><br/>praise them all, but Jackman deserves much praise for his dead<br/><br/>on Wolverine performance.. However, I need to give a lot to Bryan Singer..he delivers a<br/><br/>film that could have been an absolute cheese fest and does so<br/><br/>without ever dropping into camp...he makes the film real, makes<br/><br/>you care about the characters, and ultimately delivers a<br/><br/>excellent, exhilarting, aderaline [and story] packe"

","I have been a X-men fan for quite a long time. I watched the<br/><br/>Cartoon, read the comics, and collected the cards..there was<br/><br/>always something great about it.. so that was why I approached X-men the movie with trepridation. Comic book movies, with the exception of the excellent<br/><br/>Batman[the first-not the others] and Superman[1 and 2], have<br/><br/>really sucked. However, X-men showed potential with the fact that Bryan Singer<br/><br/>was directing, and that powerhouse actors Patrick Stewart and<br/><br/>Ian McKellan[face it-these guys are so serious about their<br/><br/>acting that I know they saw something beyond the pay check] were<br/><br/>scheduled for the leading roles of Magneto and Professor X.<br/><br/>So, as I sat down last night in a darkened theater, I prayed<br/><br/>that X-men would hit hard..then it started..and any worries I<br/><br/>had subsided.. now that I have seen it, I can honestly say that<br/><br/>few films have captured my attention for their entire running<br/><br/>length more then X-men.

","As one would expect, X-Men delivers on visual spectacle. There are lots of good effects, things being blown up and broken, and so forth.<br/><br/>What one wouldn't expect from an action and effects-driven summer film is the performances. Two veteran actors, Patrick Steward (as Professor Xavier) and Ian McKellen (as Magneto) provide depth to their roles as antagonists on the mutant issue. Newcomer (to the American screen, anyway) Hugh Jackman is a sensitive and effective Wolverine, and Anna Paquin holds up her part as Rogue nicely.<br/><br/>The film also provides some depth to the issue of mutants and their place in society. Three sides are presented (Xavier, Magneto, and Sen. Robert Kelly), and the film doesn't treat it as a black and white good-vs-evil situation. Instead, we see that there is good and bad in all their positions.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. I'm looking forward to future installments in the story, and hoping that they continue to develop the characters and the depth of the story."
"gartner","7","0","0","16 July 2000"," For a summer blockbuster, X-men is a nice little movie
","If I could describe 'X-men' in one word I would call it 'surprising'. Having gotten used to the overblown and bloated 'Batman' films, I was expecting another bombastic, pointless, neon filled, superhero movie replete with dumb illogical villains and heroes who are seemingly an afterthought in the plot.<br/><br/>
Well what do you know?<br/><br/>For an expected 'summer blockbuster', X-men is a nice little movie. Fans of the X-men comic are treated to a remarkably faithful adaptation of the characters they know and love. The casual movie goer is treated to a summer movie that has an easy to understand and not needlessly convoluted plot, good but not over the top action, and no mindless smirking quipster villains to groan at.<br/><br/>The villain, Magneto, is very essential to the plot, but is not made the core of the film as the Joker was (successfully) in the original Batman movie and the likes of Catwoman, Riddler, and Mr. Freeze were in the subsequent (not so successful) sequels. Even better, the supporting villains are just that; supporting. It is obvious that Magneto is the main man and he does not compete for screen time with his henchmen. It is also an extra bonus, that Magneto is played as an intelligent villain with purpose and not just some loony guy in a colorful suit.   The film is filled with special effects, but does not depend on them to carry the proceedings. The special effects are necessary to the plot and are never overused (they may even be underused, but read on).<br/><br/>The only complaint would be that the story really centers on two main characters (Wolverine and Rogue) and to a great degree the other characters (though perfectly cast) are defined but not truly developed. Also at an extremely manageable hour and a half running time, you leave the theater thinking the film could have benefited from another 10 to 15 minutes to come to a satisfactory conclusion (the ultimate final battle is a bit anti-climatic.) Somehow Xmen seems to conclude with a whimper and not a bang. <br/><br/>Still I'd rather leave a film being pleased but wanting more than feeling like I just threw my money down the drain. I hope all the stars are signed to a multiple movie deal, because I look forward to a sequel.<br/><br/>
Kudos to Fox for putting a superhero movie together that does not play for laughs or cornball antics but instead attempts to find a way to take the essence of their subject (which makes them successful in their own genre) and communicate it on the big screen for the mainstream audience. I can only hope that this message resonates with the non-comic book based audience and X-men brings the super hero genre back from it's current doldrums. Who knows? If X-men is a hit, we just might get a Batman film with a decent plot that is ABOUT Batman someday soon."
"moonlightreflections","7","0","0","16 July 2000"," A good superhero film adaptation, though a below-average movie.
","Despite the fact that my days as an avid X-Men devotee finished a half decade ago, I was ecstatic upon being subjected to the reputation that this film was beginning to garner a couple of months prior to its release.  Thus, I patiently awaited for the movie to arrive with the anticipation level rising more and more as the days neared, my long-lost fanboy traits making every single fraction of a second nearly unbearable to experience. Afterall, who could resist seeing the legendary X-Men emerge on the silver screen after so many years of biding?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I allowed my expectations to get the best of me, and as a result walked out of the theater not only slightly disappointed, but ashamed that I had expected this to be one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>The first factor that disillusioned me was the commercial campaign of the movie--things such as the X-Men television special, which revolved rather heavily on governmental mutant control, and the Mutant Watch website.  Both painted the image that this particular film would not only bring forth the subject of discrimination, but in addition, discuss it to depths which could be deemed unprecedented in the genre of superhero/action films.  Yet alas, the foregoing does not happen to prove true, and the fashion in which the subject emerges and ""thrives"" in the film adds the proverbial, lackluster Hollywood flare that so many of us hold dear.<br/><br/>Secondly, it is to be expected that villains in superhero movies should possess a certain degree of superficiality;  but everything up to this point had suggested that at the very least, Magneto and Mystique would be the antagonists who would be most explored, while Toad and Sabretooth would play relatively minor roles.  On the other hand, the reality of the situation is that Magneto is characterized by relatively weak scenes (with the exception of the opening of the movie), whereas all of the other characters utter no more than two or three lines each in the entirety of the film.  A real disappointment indeed, as the major fights in the movie become devoid of any emotion whatsoever due to this.<br/><br/>As far as the protagonists of the story are concerned--I'll simply state that this movie should have been called ""The Adventures of Wolverine and Rogue.""  They are the only two characters that are explored to a satisfactory degree (with rather excellent scenes in the beginning and end of the movie, no less), while Cyclops, Jean Grey, and Storm are simply there to provide a higher number to the group should the need for battle ever arise, with a slightly-explored Charles Xavier serving as mentor.  Honestly, where are the admirable leadership traits of Cyclops, the legendary rivalry between him and Wolverine, the ""Get away from Jean or I'll kill you"" scenes? The rivalry is essentially established by Wolverine demanding that Cyclops move away from a door, and despite the fact that Cyclops at one point mentions for Wolverine to ""Stay away from [his] woman,"" not once do we see the couple together.<br/><br/>And, this may seem like a bit of nit-picking, but for such a high-budget movie, there are a number of scenes that really could have afforded to be redone in different techniques.  At one point in the movie Wolverine is flung about, and his body becomes contorted as it slides across the ground to the point where it elicited laughter from the audience in a rather serious moment.  The Blackbird looks like a miniature toy as it lands and moves about half of the time, and the characters, when punched or kicked, fly backwards for yards on wires and arch their way upwards in a -very- unrealistic manner.  And that's not mentioning the preposterous scenes where we see somebody flying about.<br/><br/>The common notion for comic book films is that if one is familiar with the comic book and its characters, the film will be better understood.  Perhaps, with X-Men, this proves true to a certain extent, as in understanding where the rivalry between Cyclops and Wolverine comes from.  Yet the one thing to keep in mind is that one-line characters are the order of the day in this movie, even when it comes to some of the larger parts like that of Storm's. For what it's worth, X-Men is indeed one of the better comic-book-to-film adaptations ever (simply read positive reviews to find all that there is to like in this movie), and I did come out feeling that it was not as much of a waste as a Batman film could have been.  But I will forever remain adamant in my conviction that, with thirty more minutes detailing the characters and the world that they live in, this film could have turned out to be a contemporary classic."

","Not since the days of Christopher Reeve(Superman),or Micheal Keaton(from the first two Batman films),there hasn't been a movie that rocks non-stop from start to finish,and here its the blockbuster/rollercoaster ride of the summer,and its one of those pictures that gives you the bang for the buck. Based on the Marvel Comics Book,it combines great special effects(the best I've seen this year)with a great plot that gives it one of the best cimematic experience that you will see at the movies. When Wolverine(Hugh Jackman),and Storm (Halle Berry)came out,the audience went completely crazy,and it was one of those films were the audience was cheering them on to take out the bad guys. The part that scared me was Mystique(Rebecca Romijn-Stamos),and it was one of those characters that you'll never know what to expect from her,since she changes colors like a chameleon,or a person,at any given moment. It stayed very true to the comic strip,which I've thought it wasn't,but with all the excitement,you just can't take your eyes off it...really,it was just that good and off the hook too!!!<br/><br/>Great chemistry between Patrick Stewart(Professor Xavier),and Ian McKellen(Magento),and solid performances from Anna Paquin (Rogue),and Famke Janessen(Jean Grey)...................<br/><br/>Great action of the summer flick all the way,and there should be a sequel to this as well.

"Nigel St. Buggering","8","0","0","16 July 2000"," Finally, a real comic-book movie
","Movies based on comics characters tend to apologize. The film-makers often transmit an embarrassment to the screen, and like to throw little moments into the film that show us that they're not really taking it seriously, and they know how silly it all really is.<br/><br/>X-Men does not have those moments, thank god. This is a real adaptation of a superhero comic, by far the most faithful ever made. Anyone familiar with the comic will recognize the characters and situations presented here, and without apology or condescension.<br/><br/>Does that mean that only comics fans will enjoy it?  Honestly, I don't think so, but I can't be sure.  I was too overjoyed with the adaptation of characters I was familiar with.  Even the good comic-to-film transfers have messed with the characters (Batman's rubber armor comes to mind).<br/><br/>The film has its problems, of course. There's very little time to develop all of the characters.  Storm, in particular, gets short shrift in the screen time department.  At 95 minutes, this is one economical piece of filmmaking. But at a time when even fluff like ""Meet Joe Black"" can clock in at three hours, this is actually very refreshing, and keeps ""X-Men"" from bogging down in the self-important philosophizing that the comic often indulges in.<br/><br/>As expected, Wolverine quickly takes center stage.  Given that, the casting was vital, and fortunately, the ball was not dropped. Hugh Jackman IS Wolverine, to the point that it's impossible to see anyone else in the role. Similarly, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen have now BECOME Professor Xavier and Magneto.  I will not be able to see the comics characters without seeing these actors; they're that perfect. The award for most improved character goes to Rogue, whom I've always found irritating in the comic, but who is very nicely re-imagined here.<br/><br/>This is a great introduction, whose only real flaw is that it DOES feel somewhat like a mere introduction. Hopefully, the already-contracted sequels will flesh out this very promising beginning."

I kind of felt sorry for the makers of the film as they would have such a large burden on their shoulders. I have to say that despite the difficulty they carried it off quite well. The casting was perfect as far as I'm concerned. All the actors ranged between good and incredible and special mention must go to Hugh Jackman. I thought he really WAS Wolverine(probably one of the hardest characters to pull off). The film was entertaining and stuck to the true form of the original comic book, changing what was necessary (eg the costumes). The story while nothing special was interesting at the least. One problem was the lack of involvement of a number of the X-Men (Cyclops and Jean Grey don't have much to do in comarison to Wolvie and Storm is simply a background character with like two lines). Al round every single X-Men fan needs to see this (and get the DVD) while non-X-Men fans will be suitably entertained (this film did convert a lot of non-fans into fans)."

","The long awaited ""X-Men"" movie has arrived, and it's a pretty entertaining film. However, it's not a great film. Most of the characters could have used a little more development because they're so interesting. One character in ""X-Men"" is developed effectively and that's Wolverine, well played by Australian newcomer Hugh Jackman. We get to know him pretty well during the course of the film. Another character that has a good amount of screen time is Rogue, played by Oscar winner Anna Paquin. We get to know these two characters very well, but I would have liked to have seen Professor X (Patrick Stewart), Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden), and Dr. Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) on screen a little more often. Same goes for the bad guys in ""X-Men"". I recently heard that this movie was originally 45 minutes longer. That might be the problem. Nevertheless, all the actors are perfectly cast, and if their is going to be sequel, I hope that we'll get to know them better in the next movie (and get more screen time).

Although I would have liked to see more development from Storm, Jean, and Cyclops, most of the roles were properly developed.  Wolverine was displayed perfectly, as were Professor X and Magneto.  Rogue also came across well.  The acting was also done very well.  Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, and Ian McKellen were perfect in each of their roles respectively, and the rest of the cast played their parts well.  The story was also well thought out.

","Seemingly a cartoon played by real actors on big screen, X-MEN is a serious story of the two old men conflicting,together with their follower mutants,over liberation of estranged and segregated minority. Magneto try to free the mutantkind by terrorism and the domination over humankind. Xavier do it by education and enlightenment. This can be applied to regional,ethnical and religious conflicts we have around in the real world and make this film something special. And I noticed the mutants are described as thouse burdened with useless and almost funny 'gifts', such as Cyclops,too dangerous to see,and Rogue,too fatal to touch. And Mistyque is a symbol of strong desire to be accepted. Maybe I am taking too it seriously,but its allegorical awareness of the problems of the real world today saved me from feeling foolish,as is often with me after seeing a comic book of a film like Superman and Batman3,4.

This attracts the attention and resistance of Stewart's X-Men, a heroic gang of mutants who believe that the two groups can live in peace and harmony. Unremarkable, occasionally cheesy, but the story is good, and there are many engrossing and believable moments showing how humans fear and discriminate against that which they do not understand.

","I really had no expectations that this film would be even be modestly good, so it was a pleasant surprise to see a very well made film unfold. Perhaps some fans of the comic strip  may find too many variables, however as cinema entertainment it hits the spot. With inevitable comparison, to some of the Batman offerings, I tend to like X-Men better. The Batman offerings seem more ponderous and overblown compared to X-Men, and somehow despite it's comic-strip origin X-Men seems to appeal on a more adult level. Much of this is due to the deftness and light touch of the Director. Great C-G work ( this is one genre where C-G really works well ) alongside very good ""real"" sets makes for an excellent looking film. Patrick Stewart at last gets a chance for once to unleash his screen presence ( shamefully squandered by the Star Trek folks ) and does a great job. Teamed against the awesome Ian McKellen these two add the sinister darker aspect of the film. Hugh Jackman (looking eerily like a young Clint Eastwood in many shots) and the rest of the cast very ably fill the young cast roles. Oddly I had heard very little about X-men and it would seem it has been greatly underrated. From the look of things, it appears that this was intended to be the first in a series of X-Men films.

It was easily the best comic adaptation to date.  Even the reviews are better than average, and as of today (7/16/00) imdb score is an 8.3, which is very respectable.  Unfortunately, it doesn't look like people are turning out for the movie like I expected.  It had a few flaws, such as rushing into the movie, and a couple of hokey lines (not many, though).  The humor was cute, and the interplay between the characters was essential to having a decent story.  The few 15-20 minutes were absolutely incredible (my favorite part), as it explored the characters as human beings, rather than super-heroes.  There was lots of action as well, so we didn't get bored.  My biggest problem (and I can overlook it) was that some of the characters (I'm mostly bothered by Mystique) weren't true to the comics.  I mean, Mystique fought Wolverine to a standstill using incredible martial arts... no way would this have happened in the comics.  Of course, Wolverine was trying to kill everyone, so that was pretty cool. :)<br/><br/>This comic movie even stands up to ""normal"" movies.  It was really great.  I was split between giving it a 9 or a 10, but I ended up giving it a 10.  If you're a comic fan, you'll really enjoy.  If not, it's still great."

The movie landed on many executives and director's desks, but it was Bryan Singer who finally took the helm and directed it.<br/><br/>In an PEOPLE magazine interview, Singer himself admits, he knew nothing about the XMEN and immediately started reading comics to learn as much as he could about the characters.<br/><br/>This is one of the few times that a movie does live up to its hype.<br/><br/>In this movie, like in the comic book war is being made on mutants, specifically by a Senator Robert Jefferson who sees mutants as a threat to mankind ""Mutants are among us, you must know who they are and what they can do"".<br/><br/>It is here that we meet Jean Grey (Cyclop's woman) that tries to defend mutants in a hearing trying to decide what to do about mutants.<br/><br/>Before that we see Erik Magnus Lehnsherr or Magneto as a child during WWII as his mom and dad are taking away from him, we see Magneto's power as moves barb wire and steel around him,yet he is only a kid.

Also the evil mutants like Apocalypse ,Blob, Pyro and others dont appear.<br/><br/>Make no mistake though, X-MEN is worthy of a great Christmas gift. It's available on VHS and DVD.<br/><br/>DVD features extra footage and even a screen test of Hugh Jackman (Wolverine)."

"billy_loomis1","7","0","0","14 March 2002"," X-MEN has brains, but it is terribly RUSHED...
","Here we are... 1 year before the franchise, waiting to see the un-answered questions, the plot gaps and the under-developed characters to be fulfilled. Well... you see X-MEN's BASIC problem is that it so keen on to be a franchise, that forgets to be a decent, fulfilling and self-contained 100mins feature film! But let's take things from the begging...<br/><br/>Firstly Brian Singer isn't Joel Schumacher(THANK GOD!) and so X-Men isn't a garish, nightmarish BATMAN & ROBIN s***e. But it is not a slick and stylish Batman either, it has a magic but it has flaws that after a certain point(e.g. thinking about the movie!) became really obvious. So what is it? Singer said this ain't gonna be a brain-less action-packed superheroes in tights et la, he proves it when we actually see the opening Auschwitz sequence, with the very emotionally powerfull scene of the young Magneto. The message is obvious Mutants are like the Jews, chased and hated by normal people. They live in prejudice and in Terror, a Terror which is leading the humans against the mutants. In a  nutshell: They are hated by the people they are trying to save and who themselves must deal with their own fears and emotions!<br/><br/>A very powerfull story-line(for whom director B. Singer receives a credit), a set of very strong characters(Rogue,a very good Anna Paquin, a teen misfit who is doomed to a life where skin touch must be avoided-a character that best embodies the sense of the mutant dislocation-/ Magneto, kick-ass Ian McKellen who does GREAT, although he is notoriously atracted by Brian Singer's direction!/ and WOLVERINE-with the almost famous(now) Hugh Jackman. He kinda pretty and TOO TALL for Wolvie but he kicks some serious but there!) and some subplots(the romance between Wolverine and Jean Gray, the mystery behind the ""mask"" of Wolverine et la) who are never really answered and are left hanging there like a ""poop on a stick""! And what about the UNDER-DEVELOPED Cyclops(a cold-ass Madsen!), Storm(a coooooool Halle-white haired- Berry!) and the evil GUYS characters who are like something more of cameos and bit less than bit-parts and forgetting that the ALTHOUGH EXCELLENT Patrick Stewart is serving the duties of an on-screen narrator!<br/><br/>Except all these we also get the feeling that we are missing something, maybe some set-pieces or something like that! We got some very good inside jokes-Don't you people just DIE!- or ""Would you prefer tights and yellow suits?"" hillarius but the shows is not good. We have great fight sequences(the big-tongue/the claws/the thunders/the touch-my-head-bullet etc) but the climactic sequences is disappointing to say the least because instead of a jaw-dropping moments we get rutine stuff, lacking of nerve and no feeling of impact!<br/><br/>At the end, what we see is a VERY GOOD 35 say 40 mins of a different BLOCKBUSTER but the rest is low-life action and plot gaps, under-developed characters, a feeling of rush and less excitment than expected... we get nearly nothing new! But it is very entairtaining... and i can't wait to see the sequel(although i now, know what to expect!)....<br/><br/>I gave it a 6/10"

","I'm a huge DC comics fan, but unfortunately the Superman and Batman movies have always been pretty lousy (save the first two Supes flicks) and The Watchmen never made it to screen. Marvel seems to be doing the right thing and having Stan ""The Man"" Lee aboard helps alot. The Spiderman trailer looks great and The Hulk sounds promising - I just wish the Marvel stock was still up there on the NYSE - its worth next to nothing now since they claimed bunkruptcy in 1995. Anyway, X-Men keeps you interested and tells you enough about each character while tossing in a bit of a plot at the same time. It's smart and worth seeing. Halle Berry and the Cyclops guy could have been better but Ian, Picard and the Wolverine guy are great. Hopefully this will start a small new genre for the 200's - the ok superhero movie!

","There were two reasons I rented this movie out. A) I used to love the cartoon and had missed it when it was released at the theaters, and B), I had just gotten back from a school camp with Anna Paquin's father (No I'm not kidding). Nice guy.<br/><br/>Anyway, the film itself is really cool. A+ Special FX, an *actual* storyline and the actors chosen to play the mutants were well-picked and intriguing.<br/><br/>The story goes: Rogue (Anna Paquin - a NZ Native who won an Oscar for ""The Piano"") runs away from home after discovering her mutant abilities and jumps on Wolverine (Hugh Jackman)'s truck, where they are attacked, saved and taken to Professor X's School for Gifted Youngsters (or something).<br/><br/>There, they are taught how to use their powers and are told about the ""brewing war"" between mutants and the rest of humanity.<br/><br/>The movie features some big names: Halle Berry (an OK 'Storm', but she should have used something for the voice), James Marsden (the ever-annoying 'Cylops') and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos as Mystique (who was put into full-body make up for 5 hours).<br/><br/>Here's hoping 'X-Men 2' continues the high-callibre entertainment this one carries, but it was a let down to hear that they're not introducing ANY new mutants (good, bad or otherwise).<br/><br/>P.S. Anna has said that she felt her character was just a helpless little girl, so I'm betting they'll improve her character a bit!!

","X-MEN should engender hope in the hearts of long-suffering comic book aficionados. Perhaps this film will raise the bar for this long-abused genre. Maybe the key is to have the screenplay written by a fan of the original comics, as was done here. Whatever the reason, X-MEN is a winner. This is a character-driven story that never sags, but just marches through from opening scene to the credits, skillfully incorporating just the right amount of action, dialogue, and scenery. There are plenty of great special effects shots, but they never overwhelm the characters. The quality of the fight scenes is also excellent, and they also don't overwhelm the story (in contrast to just about any action-adventure movie in recent memory).<br/><br/>Special accolades go to Hugh Jackman as Wolverine; perhaps this is a breakthrough role for him. This is not to detract from the other actors, all of whom handled their roles perfectly. Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, having to work through tons of makeup as Mystique, still projects humor and personality into her character. I wish we had seen more of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, but unanswered questions in the story, combined with what appears to be enthusiastic viewer response, assures us of a sequel featuring both of these journeyman actors."

","X-MEN / (2000) *1/2 (out of four) <br/><br/>   It is never a good sign when a movie features a theatrical trailer more entertaining than the movie itself, but Bryan Singer's ""X-Men,"" the live action version of the outdated cartoon, is as disposable and lightweight as its characters on helium. The film brings new meaning to the art of science fiction, where it attempts to portray futuristic ideas in human evolution without drastically changing the world around them. There is no explanation behind the movie's concepts, that become lost in an overzealous and dramatically disappointing script.  <br/><br/>    The story takes place in ""the not so distant future,"" where the government considers mutants, people with extraordinary powers, a threat to society. U.S. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is proposing a plan to expose these individuals to the public. Although most mutants are decent, ordinary, law-abiding citizens, Kelly feels others have the right to be informed about their powers and potential dangers. <br/><br/>
    Humanity has greater concerns, however, like continuing their ordinary existence. Magneto (Ian McKellen), the aging but magnetism controlling madman who believes humans are mutant's nemesis and his gang, including Sabertooth (Tyler Mane), fierce and beast-like, Toad (Ray Park), who has abilities similar to his namesake species, and Mystique (Rebecca Romijn-Stamos), who can transform into anyone, plan on conquering the planet with complex technology.  <br/><br/>    There is the good hearted professor, Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the handicapped but telepathic leader of the X-Men, a group of mutants bent on peace between humans and themselves. He owns a school for the mutants and among his longtime students is Cyclops (James Marsden), a young man with laser-firing eyes, Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who has telekinetic powers, and Storm (Halle Berry) who is able to control the weather. Newcomers Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a man with retractable claws and the ability to heal himself quickly, and Rouge (Anna Paquin), a young, confused teenage girl that drains the power from anyone she touches, are quickly woke up to the dangers of their counterparts and his plan to seek total denomination. 	 As in all superhero movies, we expect big, explosive special effects, heart-pounding action, and a final confrontation between the head honchos of both good and bad sides. ""X Men"" adequately provides all but the later, which ultimately leads to the film's horrible conclusion, naturally setting up for a sequel. However, where can the story go from where this one leads off. The filmmakers have no choice but to place the variety of diabolical characters in a world-threatening situation for our succeeding heroes to return to duty.  I dread the day ""X-Men II"" hits theaters, surely only to spark quick commercial success in the box office, but then efficiently be flushed through the drain of forgotten Hollywood cinema. <br/><br/> ""X-Men"" opened to sensational success in the box office (well over 50 million) undoubtedly due to the big time summer anticipation of the film. With such a star-studded cast, including hot young stars James Marsden and Anna Paquin, as well as older, more sophisticated performers like Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, how can audiences expect little of the production. Bryan Singer, who so vividly directed ""The Usual Suspects,"" also precedes to undividedly disappoint us with unfocused direction and a style not even die hard ""X Men"" fans will enjoy. Not coincidentally, the very expensive production quickly lost interest with audiences (plummeting over fifty percent in its second weekend in release). As this movie proves, American audiences can continue to confidently rely on word of mouth."

","First of all, I like COmic books, I've been a fan of the X-men. Not a very big fan, but I've always found the story extremely fascinating. Heck, I found the 30 minute animated episodes better than this film. I understand that its a challenge turning the X-men into a live feature film, with real characters, and I shouldn't compare the animated series with the movie too much. With that being said, here's why I think this movie is awful? 1. The saying goes, its better to be the only country with a nuclear bomb in the world, then to have a thousand nuclear bombs,in a world where everybody else has one. what do I mean? Too many mutants with super powers isn't as impressive as having a few super-powered mutants. That was a very big let down, they shouldn't have used the whole mutant school angle, I don't really care about a bunch of kids, who don't contribute anything to the story, who have powers. 2. The fight sequences. Mystique being a kung-fu master. That just doesn't seem right. Its not about mystique, the collision between the bad guys and good guys seems very bad, I wasn't impressed at all by the battles, they needed better fighting scenes. 3. Like some other reviewer has suggested by saying that a movie focusing on just wolverine could have been more successful. I agree, that the story of a FEW key mutant characters could have been the better way to go. Character development, the story could have gone deeper. 4. Love triangles. Haven't they been overdone by now. They really annoy me, for heavens sake, choose someone and get it over with. The route taken in Cinderella man is better. A love affair between a husband and wife for a change. 5. I didn't want to mention the plot, but I've seen the first two movies, the plot is DREADFUL.<br/><br/>In conclusion...Very disappointing, I expected more, I know its a challenge, but hasn't Hollywood had enough experience experimenting with comic book heroes. This is unacceptable quality."

","X-Men is the perfect example to showcase the gaping flaw in my reviews: older movies have a lower chance to be good, on average. Regardless about how much they progressed the industry or how new the concept was at the time, some older films have been severely outclassed by newer. X-Men was probably great in 2000. Superhero movies weren't dominating the screen, and some of the effects probably looked great. However, now that big budget hero flicks are the mainstay, X-Men looks like silly childs play.

"luke-a-mcgowan","9","1","2","1 April 2016"," A terrific, genre-transcending film
","1. This film is very topical today with the current debate of Muslims and terrorism. This film was written and made before 9/11, based on real life events such as the Holocaust and the Civil Rights Movement, but its themes are so universal that they still apply. Many innocent mutants/Muslims want only to live peacefully but are instead subject to fear, violence and hatred at being identified. Showing your powers is no different to wearing a turban or reading the Qoran or saying an Islamic prayer. Treating all mutants the same is likely to drive more mutants/Muslims into the arms of radicals like Magneto/ISIS, who argue that violence is the answer.<br/><br/>2. The film's sharp and perceptive dialogue does a lot to help it. Though uncredited, Christopher McQuarrie's fingerprints can be seen all over this. The debate between Senator Kelly and Jean Gray at the start of the film is intelligent but also sets the stage tremendously for the film we are about to watch. The final exchange between Charles and Erik paraphrases how a conversation between Malcolm X and Martin Luther King might have gone. <br/><br/>3. The film is nearly flawless in its editing. We jump from scene to scene, with each one serving its purpose and not staying overlong. We are able to establish Magneto, Rogue, Senator Kelly and Wolverine in quick succession, and despite the sometimes significant time gaps between those scenes the film never feels like its going too fast. <br/><br/>4. The casting of Ian McKellen is inspired. Not only can the great thespian get into Magneto's shoes as a marginalised homosexual himself, but he instantly elevates every single one of the screenplay's lines with his dramatic delivery. His little speech to Rogue about how America was meant to be a land of tolerance and peace stands out as a highlight. His humour and charisma make him not only believable, but plausible as a revolutionary leader.<br/><br/>5. Hugh Jackman suits the role of Wolverine perfectly. Whilst I believe there are other enormously talented casting choices in the film, it is Jackman's ability to easily establish the perfect chemistry with each that makes the film work. He and James Marsden instantly clash as rivals for Jean's affection, whilst he and Famke Jansen practically have sparks flying from their first interaction. His older brother relationship with Anna Paquin is the film's most important. <br/><br/>6. Singer's decision to make Rogue, then a relatively minor X-Men character, a focal point for the story was brilliant. Rogue, especially through Anna Paquin's powerful performance, represents everything about mutants that the film needed - fear of your own powers, fear of others' powers, and most importantly, a crushing feeling of isolation. <br/><br/>7. Singer does an amazing job at creating a high tension, high stakes movie within PG-13 limits. The scene where Magneto controls the guns is supremely tense without being dark, as is the powerful scene in which Wolverine accidentally lashes out at Rogue in his sleep. The Senator Kelly subplot is dramatic without being gory. There's no blood and therefore the scenes work in a PG-13 setting. Singer shows us that we can have superhero movies where the stakes are higher than ""oh no, the cars are all being blown up"".<br/><br/>8. The ability of Toad, Mystique and Sabertooth to physically deal with the X-Men in abundance creates some amazing fight scenes. Rebecca Romijn barely speaks for the entire movie, but says so much in her amazing body language and eyes. The sequence in which Mystique impersonates different members of the team is again something I attribute to Singer and McQuarrie. The fight scenes are tense because Toad is able to physically fend off all three of Storm, Jean and Cyclops with ease.<br/><br/>9. If I have one complaint its that too often the film comes off as cheesy. Ray Park and Tyler Mane are physically impressive, but neither has the acting ability necessary to compete with the rest of the cast. Halle Berry as Storm also makes it hard to get into the movie, due to her cheesy delivery. Some elements of Magneto's plan simply rely on our going ""okay, sure that makes sense"" because we don't have a whole lot of reality to base them on.<br/><br/>10. There are some top-notch visuals, especially with Mystique. I can't fathom just how much effort went into creating Mystique's makeup and prosthetics, or in doing that seamless midair transition from Hugh Jackman to Rebecca Romijn as she jump kicks him.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer should be recognised for re-launching the superhero movie. Were it not for the performances of Park, Mane and Berry, I'd say that this movie transcended its genre and became an important civil rights commentary. It comes pretty darn close as it does."
"tankace","8","1","2","29 March 2016"," The Starting Point
","The first X-Men is ,at the time of this review ,16 years old. Wow. It is amazing if you seat and think that for a minute, then you will realize that this movie is older from a large percent of the people who now believe that Superhero movies are the norm of Hollywood blockbusters. <br/><br/>So it is an important flick,but I have to be honest though here we have THE MOVIE,which restarted the superhero as a genre in general after the death of it from Batman and Robin it is a little dated by today's standards. But its legacy it is unquestionable for it gave birth to the great superhero flicks of the New Millaia which dominate the Box Office.<br/><br/>As for the casting Patrick Sturat as Professor X, Ian MacKellen as Magneto were wish fulfillment to fans around the world. Dispute these great casting Hugh Jackman as Wolverine is the show-steal-er here and his portrait is the reason why most X-men films have him as a center character and he was the only one to get solo films apart from Deadpool. And something mind-blowing is that when he was first announced many disagree ,because he didn't looked the part, but after that film mouths shut.<br/><br/>As for the action is well directed and entertaining, though the final plan of Magneto is quit cartoony, which a bit ruins the film for me, but that is my only major drawback. As for the theme on which X-men were made, prejudice against the persons who are different from the average Joe or Jane is handle in a mature way and not shoved in.<br/><br/>All in all if you haven't seen it for a long time re-watch it worth your time."
"davispittman","7","1","2","22 January 2016"," A pretty good action film
","X-Men (2000) is of course the first film in the X-Men franchise. Of course, Hugh Jackman was amazing in this film, as he is in everything else. Hugh just really fits the role of Wolverine, it's almost the role he was born to play, he was rugged, sexy, tough and very likable. Also Anna Paquin was perfect for her role, and her and Hugh have awesome chemistry together. The script was pretty well written too. Also the action sequences were entertaining and fun to watch and enjoy. What I do like about this movie is that it's pretty intelligently written and filmed, it's not just one of those mindless run of the mill action romps. I have not watched the rest of the films in X-Men movie series, but after seeing this first movie, I do plan to see the rest of them sometime soon. I would suggest X-Men (2000). 7/10."
"joshuadrake-91275","8","1","2","24 September 2015"," Very underrated X-Men movie! But starts the franchise off strong!
","I am doing a superhero franchise review and it is X-MEN.<br/><br/>In 1994, 20th Century Fox and producer Prawan Singh bought the film rights to the X-Men. Andrew Kevin Walker was hired to write and James Cameron expressed interest in directing. Eventually, Bryan Singer signed on to direct in July 1996. Thought not a fan of the comic-books, Singer was fascinated by the analogies of prejudice and discrimination it offered.<br/><br/>John Logan, Joss Whedon, Ed Solomon, Christopher McQuarrie and David Hayter wrote the script, with Hayter receiving sole credit. Production began in September 1999 in Toronto, Canado and ended in March 2000.<br/><br/>The film was released on July 14, 2000 to positive reviews and critical success and spawned a reemergence of superhero films and it would prove to movie studios that superhero films could succeed.<br/><br/>The film introduces us to Wolverine and Rogue into the conflict between Professor Xavier's X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Magneto. Magneto intends to mutate world leaders at a United Nations summit with a machine he has built, to bring about acceptance of mutant kind, but Xavoer realizes this forced mutation will only result in their deaths.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman was the perfect choice of Wolverine and this film would lead him into being in the sequels and two spin-offs and other movies including Van Helsing and Prisoners. Patrick Stewart plays Professor X and Ian McKellen plays Magneto and they were also really good casting choices.<br/><br/>Anna Paquin was the perfect choice to play Rogue / Marie and this would lead her into playing in ""True Blood"" as the main character, which ended in 2014 and my 25-year-old sister watches the show, but I don't. Famke Janssen and the rest of the cast were all cast perfectly in this film as their roles.<br/><br/>The action sequences were amazing and there is less CGI in this film because some of the visual effects are really amazing and this film only had a $75 million dollar budget and I really liked the way this movie turned out and the story is not action-packed, but I will say it is really amazing, but there is just one major flaw: This was 2000 and it did not make me feel any emotion for the characters, except for Wolverine and Rogue.<br/><br/>The musical score is really good and I think Michael Kamen did a really good job with his X-Men theme. But, I like John Ottman's X-MEN theme in the next film.<br/><br/>Overall, I like X-MEN, but the one thing that had me confused is that the story is not action-packed enough and it does not make me feel any emotion for the characters, except for Wolverine and Rogue. X-MEN is the reason why we have superhero films today like Batman Begins, Spider-Man, Iron Man, The Dark Knight, The Dark Knight Rises, Man of Steel, 300, Blade, Watchmen and of course, both The Avengers and Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>8/10."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","23 September 2015"," Pretty good start to new franchise
","This film here was clearly the big winner at the Academy of Science Fiction, Fantasy & Horror Films Awards in 2001. It was the beginning to a super successful new franchise: the X-Men movies. Writer and director Bryan Singer was mostly known for his Academy Award winning work on ""The Usual Suspects"". And it was definitely quite a leap from the world of crime into the world of superheroes, or I should maybe say mutants with superpowers. The cast may appear to include some big names, but that's only because of what happened in the last 15 years. There is certainly some irony to the fact that only Anna Paquin, the youngest cast member, was an Academy Award winner back in 2000. Berry had her win not much later. Famke Janssen looks absolutely stunning in here and was mostly known for her portrayal of the very memorable Xenia Onatopp at this point. James Marsden was fairly unknown and same can be said about Hugh Jackman, an Australian actor that nobody knew before this film was made, but who since has risen up into the elite of Hollywood. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen were both very established actors already, even if McKellen did not yet have the LotR-trilogy under his belt. And finally Rebecca Romijn, who received lots of recognition and awards for her portrayal here, which baffles me as I felt her character was 99% makeup and special effects instead of a really convincing performance, even if she played a memorable character. Oh yeah and Bruce Davison is in here as well, a Golden Globe winner and Oscar nominee.<br/><br/>So yeah, the story here is that the world of humans is also packed with mutants and there are obviously skepticisms coming from both sides towards the other. Mutants are also separated into two groups, the ones who aim at peace with humans and the ones who look forward to war. Anna Paquin plays a young mutant who is a key figure in the evil mutants' plans, but the main character Wolverine intervenes. He is still portrayed by Hugh Jackman these days and I think it was a bold move by Bryan Singer, who also wrote the characters, to have Jackman carry this franchise on his shoulders, at least in this first film. Quite a vote of trust. I assume Singer was already planning a second film when he made this one here. He included an ending where it was left open if Jackman may return depending on how audiences would like him and also an ending in which McKellen could very well return as the main antagonist, even if he was not 100% evil, just disappointed and desperate I guess. I expected a final fight between Stewart's and McKellen's character as they really built up that storyline, but Stewart was pretty much missing in action for the entire final fight sequence and the young guns took over instead. Still, they reunited the two for the very final scene, which again shows that McKellen's character is not 100% evil playing chess with his mentor and antagonist. The two just have completely different political positions.<br/><br/>This was a good film in terms of special effects and characters. They were all fairly memorable and easy to distinguish with their costumes and abilities, which is always important in sci-fi films. It was unusually short for a superhero movie, only 95 minutes (without credits) and completely different compared to today's standards. I must say this one got me curious about the next installments to the series and I will certainly check these out at some point. As for this very first, I recommend it. Good watch."
"lisafordeay","7","1","2","21 August 2015"," X Men the movie that started it all with Superheros.
","As a kid I loved the X-Men cartoon series. Strange as it is coming from a young girl who grew up in the 90's but still though I loved watching X Men,Spiderman to name a few as a kid and to this day I still love them. So in the new Millennium 20th Century Fox gave us X-Men a movie adaptation based on the famous Marvel comic books and cartoon series. The story is as follows. A young woman named Marie(Rogue) played by Anna Paquin from True Blood is a introvert who discovers she has superhero powers as she can kill anyone if you touch her and she could absorb someone else's powers(she kinda reminds me of Elsa from Frozen but anyways)she runs away after nearly killing her boyfriend and bumps into a arrogant man named Logan(Wolverine as he is later known as)played by Aussie Star Hugh Jackman in his Hollywood debut and the movie that gained his career in showbiz. Together Logan and Rogue end up being kept captured by other mutants called Storm and Cyclops(played by Halle Berry and Enchanted's James Marsden)and they both work for Professor Charles X played by Patrick Stewart from Star Trek TV series. Logan and Rogue must fight for mankind as well as battling other mutants one who can change into anyone she wants called Mystique(played by Rebecca Romijn)and Sabbatooth(played by Tyler Mane)as both of these are working for a former friend of Professor X, Magneto played by Ian McKellan. So will Rogue,Wolverine and Co save mankind?<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this movie. Is it the best movie ever No its not and I tell you my only problem with this film were the effects,especially when Hugh Jackman as Wolverine took out his claws you can clearly tell that it was prosthetic hands as it felt kinda false to me compare to X Men Orgins: Wolverine which was better with the effects. But hey this is the year 2000 we are talking about here. Also the rest of the film seemed kinda fake like one where the Senator was also a mutant and he can change into water and he blew up in the end as well as moving like rubber,and I thought he looked very false looking too. <br/><br/>Mystique and Wolverine are literally the coolest superheros ever in my opinion as Wolverine is rough and arrogant and Mystique(who said nothing in this film)was cool for changing into different people. As for the rest of the superheros they are all good too. The cast was all very good especially Hugh Jackman who was a newcomer in Hollywood as he hails from Austrailia and to have him change his persona and accent in every film he is in is brilliant. Not only is this guy handsome and down to earth but he is a remarkable actor and isn't one of those typecast actors who just walks in and be themselves in every godforsaken film they are in(I am looking at you Adam Sandler,Meg Ryan etc). James Marsden was also very good as Cyclops and the rest like I said were all very good. But it was a shame we couldn't get into everyone's backstory as in every X Men movie Wolverine is the star of the show in X Men. Why I may never know but I guess its got to do with his powers and that.<br/><br/>Bottom line I liked it and I was glad to see it again after all those years and finally got the original box set of the franchise from 2000- 2006 at a very reasonable price.<br/><br/>Now all I have to watch next time is X Men 2:United. Stick around for that review which will be the next review.<br/><br/>C+ 7.0/10<br/><br/>3.5/5<br/><br/>Good fun"
"Hitchcoc","8","1","2","19 August 2015"," The Start of Something Big
","My son brought me into the foray of comic book movies. I had low expectations. This one is quite expository, bringing us into contact with the principles of the X-men. We are introduced to Wolverine and the lot. The plot involves all of the planning, government meddling, and super-villains with whom I am not familiar. One thing that impressed me is the quality of the acting and the big time performers that contributed to this. It does leave unanswered questions, but I would assume there are answers galore as the blockbusters of the day seem to be about 90 percent directed to fanboys. I really enjoyed this, but am still a bit bewildered by who these guys are."
"Al_The_Strange","8","1","2","11 June 2014"," X-Men Review
","Superhero films are a dime-a-dozen these days. Regardless of whether you think that's good or bad, we all have the original X-Men film to thank. Prior to this, superhero movies were limited in scope, scale, and conception; after all, comic book stories are so larger-than-life that it's hard to adapt them for the big screen (much less justify a big enough budget for it). With the X-Men (and arguably Blade, released a couple of years earlier), filmmakers took a chance on modern effects and techniques to bring a whole team of heroes to life, ushering in a massive wave of comic-book movies that would eventually lead to Marvel's rise as a new studio: a cinematic force to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>As the first-ever X-Men film, it has its share of limitations, especially compared to later films. Action is kept to a minimum; the biggest highlights being the train station scenes and the big climax on Liberty Island. Special effects are plentiful, but used sparingly. What really matters is that you get to see a whole world of mutants showing off their varied powers. The film blasts so many memorable details with sporadic bursts of short scenes, crafting just enough spectacle to wow us, but also just enough to tell the story it needs to.<br/><br/>It is a decent enough story. The film takes its time tracking various characters and bringing them together, so we get a solid and well-composed introduction to the X-Men and the world they inhabit. There are a ton of characters involved, but the film juggles them well enough. A good amount of attention is given to Wolverine, Rogue, Magneto and Professor X, who are all endearing characters we can appreciate. Most of the others tend to be lacking; there is no real development involved with Storm, Cyclops, Jean Grey, or Mystique (and Toad and Sabretooth stand as two of the weakest villains in the franchise, for they are lacking in presence and depth). All things considering, the film covers so much ground that there's really no room for extraneous character beats; what matters the most is the plot, which is intriguing, as it builds up to a fairly decent climax. At its core, it's a film that underscores themes of prejudice, which provides all the dynamics for the character and the conflicts they go through.<br/><br/>This film is very tightly-composed, with excellent photography and very rapid editing. It is especially noteworthy how the film manages to relay so much information with a constant stream of short, revealing images. Acting is a little dry, but the casting choices are mostly perfect. Hugh Jackman is easily the most iconic character of the lot, thanks to his perfect portrayal of Wolverine. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Anna Paquin, and Bruce Davidson are great in their roles, and I enjoyed watching Famke Janssen and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. I got to admit that the more I watch this film, the more I dislike Halle Berry as Storm (she does deliver one of the worst lines ever in this film). Writing is pretty blunt, but it gets the job done. This production uses some very slick and cool-looking sets, props, and costumes. Special effects hold up mostly well, with just a few weaknesses. The music score is alright.<br/><br/>The first original X-Men film was an inspiring hit at its time, but would only be a small taste of even greater things to come. It still holds up thanks to its storytelling and nuanced attention to detail. It's worth seeing at least once, especially for genre fans.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Story: Good | Film: Good)"

I remember when this movie first came out in 2000, I was so excited and was not disappointed!<br/><br/>I watched X-Men (2000) again with fresh eyes, and despite the special effects which are nothing compared to what can be accomplished today (which for being made in 2000 is not bad at all) - the movie is a classic adaptation of the comics. The casting is done perfectly to reflect the characters. Had my cartoon X-Men come to life, this is precisely what they would look like. <br/><br/>A good old action film appropriate for any age.

","Back in the summer of 2000, no other movie had been more hyped up and anticipated than X- Men. Nowadays, the reactions from people ranges from ""It sizzles"" to ""It's just OK."" The movie itself, adapted by director Bryan Singer, supports all those responses.<br/><br/>What sizzles? Start with Hugh Jackman as Logan,also known as Wolverine. Jackman energizes X- Men with power doses of fire, flashy humor and somehow creates the character as his own. Many people were skeptical about a Broadway actor playing one of the most bad-ass characters in comic book history; however, Jackman gives Wolverine an identity of his won while trying to be faithful to the source material. <br/><br/>The other characters also shine in this movie. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen play the ongoing characters of Charles Xavier and Magneto. They aren't enemies so much as ideological opposites; Magneto, having seen the Holocaust, has a deep pessimism about human nature. Xavier, who runs a school for mutants in Westchester County, where it doubtless seems no stranger than the other private schools, hopes these new powers can be used for good.<br/><br/>Others like Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden), Jean-Grey (Famke Janssen), and Rogue (Anna Paquin) all lend great performances. The Brotherhood of Evil also make a great rogue of villains that stand in the way between the other X-Men.<br/><br/>What's just OK? The thin excuse for a plot. While it boasts a great cast, that doesn't mean that all of them are developed. Wolverine and Rogue are, and they have great chemistry between each other. In fact, I wouldn't have minded if the movie was about these two; two mutants that are lost and need help from each other sounds like a great plot. Unfortunately, great actors like McKellan and Stewart, are just supporting characters. I wish they were more scenes of them discussing their plans, and the reasons why they are against each other. Also, Magneto's villains aren't as memorable as Xavier's X-Men. They just seem like pawns rather than real characters. <br/><br/>I respect this movie rather than I do view it. Without this movie (and arguably Blade), the comic book movies that we know today wouldn't have existed, or would've been drastically different. It's a good movie, but with a lot of flaws. However, it was just the stepping stone to what would become a great franchise."
"PassPopcorn","7","1","2","23 May 2014"," Pass the Popcorn! review
","Undoubtedly, we live in the golden age of superhero movies – in the last several years, there have been more superhero movies than ever and the majority of them were big box office successes. And the movie which is almost solely responsible for this current situation – the movie because of which the superhero movie fad reemerged, after it nearly died in the 90s – is Bryan Singer's 'X-Men' (2000). In spite of being considered a low budget movie in the summer blockbuster season, 'X-Men' managed to earn almost $300 million world wide, thus spawning more movies in the franchise and making way for other superhero movies. In its own way, 'X-Men' played an important role in cinematic history.<br/><br/>Set in the near future, 'X-Men' follows mutants (extraordinary individuals with superhuman powers) in their plight to be accepted by the human race. There are two notable fractions among the mutants: The X-Men, led by the peaceful, intelligent Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and the Brotherhood of Mutants, who operate as terrorists, and are led by the brilliant, but vengeful Magneto (Ian McKellen). Two mutants – Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a former military personnel who can't remember his past, and Rogue (Anna Paquin), a confused teenager – get caught up in the rivalry between the fractions.<br/><br/>'X-Men' works both as a decent action-drama movie and a superhero movie. What differentiates 'X-Men' from other superhero movies is how seriously it deals with its source materials and topics – the topics of homosexuality, racism and even America's fear of communism. In the hands of another director, 'X-Men' could have been nothing more than a generic mindless action movie, but in the hands of Bryan Singer (himself a homosexual), who also worked on the movie as a writer, 'X-Men' definitely stands out among other superhero movies/franchises. Although it deals with serious topics, 'X-Men' never comes off as preachy; it equally portrays two legitimate, opposing views – that of Charles Xavier and that of Magneto. In spite of Magneto being the movie's bad guy, he makes some interesting remarks about the nature of humans, and the audience can easily side with him morally (which is unquestionably a sign of a well written villain). Casting Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen in their respective roles of Charles Xavier and Magneto was a genius move, since both of them give magnificent, memorable performances. The then actor newcomer, Hugh Jackman, doesn't fall behind in his most iconic role to date – that of Logan aka Wolverine.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, not everyone in the movie was on the same acting level as McKellen/Stewart. Especially not Halle Berry, whose acting was clingy and awkward, and created a very unnatural Storm. To her defense, she did have possibly the worst lines of dialogue in the movie (especially the infamous 'you know what happens when a toad gets struck by lightning' line), but she still was the weakest link in the acting crew. And speaking of dialogue, it seemed like throughout the movie the dialogue slowly started deteriorating, with the dialogue in the movie's third act being sub par to the rest of the dialogue in the movie. In addition to that, 'X-Men' clearly could have benefited from a bigger budget since some of the action sequences in the movie were oddly executed. Luckily for the audience, the sequel, X2, learned from its predecessor's mistakes and was an even better movie.<br/><br/>Rating: 7/10 Read more reviews at http://passpopcorn.com/"

"tomgillespie2002","6","1","2","22 May 2014"," In hindsight, a tame, yet very entertaining movie
","It's hard to believe that back in 2000, Marvel's first crack at creating a superhero universe on the big screen, X-Men, was a near perfect summer movie. 14 years on, and the cracks are as clear as day in Bryan Singer's hesitant and rather tame blockbuster. Don't get me wrong, X-Men still has plenty to enjoy, but the meatier, more confident recent efforts such as Christopher Nolan's Batman trilogy and Marvel's own Iron Man (2008) and Thor (2011), as well as the vastly superior sequel two years later, form a rather large shadow over Professor X and his pupils' first outing.<br/><br/>In the near future, evolution has taken a huge leap forward, creating 'mutants' - humans with special powers and abilities that defy anything science has seen before. Tensions between humans and mutants is at an all-time high, with the idea of mutant cataloguing being passed around by Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison), despite the efforts of telepaths Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen). Mutant Magneto (Ian McKellen), a Holocaust survivor with the ability to control anything magnetic, has different ideas, and plans to induce mutation on world leaders gathering on Ellis Island.<br/><br/>As the machine, powered by magnetics, could easily kill him, Magneto seeks Rogue (Anna Paquin), a young girl with the ability to temporarily steal a mutant's power. Having just met Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a beast of a man with a skeleton covered in an indestructible metal, which he can shoot out like claws, and an uncanny healing ability, Rogue's abduction fails and is foiled by Storm (Halle Berry) and Cyclops (James Marsden). They end up in Professor Xavier's school for gifted children, where Wolverine learns about mutant struggle and falls in love with the powerful Jean Grey.<br/><br/>With a film this packed with personalities and powers, it's only natural that it loses it's grip on a lot of its characters. Sensibly, the main focus is on Wolverine, who has always been the most interesting X-Man, and is perfectly played by Jackman, a performance that made him a huge star. The rest of the characters, with the exception of Professor X and Magneto, do little but fall flat. They either suffer because their powers aren't particularly interesting, or spend the duration of the film using what little dialogue they have to explain who they are and what they can do. The movie also has one of the worst lines in cinema history, uttered by Storm. You'll know it when you hear it.<br/><br/>For all its lack of ambition and absence of any real set-pieces, X-Men is still the first of its kind. Refusing to give in to the idea of comic books being light, colourful and mainly for kids (which was still the general idea back in 2000), the opening scene depicting a young Magneto in a concentration camp ensures this is something that should be taken seriously, yet still enjoyed. Singer grew in confidence and made X2 two years later, which is still considered by myself and many others to be one of the best superhero movies ever made. X2 showed that the vast ensemble can be given room to breathe, and had the set-pieces to match, and in hindsight, makes X-Men a much tamer, yet still very entertaining, animal.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"videodrome1234","8","1","2","21 May 2014"," The Start of Marvel's success
","Marvel first found success with Blade in 1998, but their really big breakthrough came when Bryan Singer directed the first x-men. That was the moment that started the renaissance of comic book films and lifted Marvel studios from obscurity. It wasn't by accident that x-men fueled the mania because this was a production that was taken very seriously. It was at once faithful to the comic book, a little darker than it, and portrayed the characters well without making them ridiculous. A good director can bring the most out of even the silliest concept. And Bryan Singer really is a good director. It was a courageous step to direct a comic book film after films like The Usual Suspect and Apt Pupil, but he did a marvelous job. It was critically and viewer acclaimed. The story opens in a concentration camp in Poland, 1944. Erik Lensherr is separated from his parents by the Nazis, which causes his powers to manifest. In the not too distant future, a world where both Mutants and Humans fear each other, Marie, better known as Rogue, runs away from home and hitches a ride with another mutant, known as Logan, a.k.a. Wolverine. Charles Xavier, who owns a school for young mutants, sends Storm and Cyclops to bring them back before it is too late. Magneto, who believes a war is approaching, has an evil plan in mind, and needs young Rogue to help him. X-men is a unique film, even in that it's very first scene is a Nazi death camp. Even after the many years since it's release I get goose bumps during the first scene. The film is deep and layered with meaning. It shows us how sick the human race still is how intolerant we are with each other by showing us how the mutants are treated. Luckily Singer paid attention to the personality of the characters giving them depth and layers, the films three most developed characters are Professor X, Magneto and Wolverine, the actors playing the three of them take the cake. The script is good, making sure that the film is never outrageous but rather dark and serious. The most unforgettable scenes are the conversations of the two veterans at the beginning and the end. The special effects are good, but you can tell that it was made in 2000, but it's okay, because there aren't too many action scenes in the film. It only has a few mistakes that are things that the die hard fans may not like, for instance Wolverine being the main character which he isn't in the comics but what can I say Hugh Jackman Australia's gift to woman everywhere kind of steals the show. or he would if the whole thing wasn't the great Mr. McKellen's one man production. Singer got it right, and could bring out the most he could from the film. The first part may not have exploded, but it was the perfect lead in. Singer bit off as much as was chewable, doing a perfect job. Now 14 years after the release date we can say xmen was perfectly placed into his hands 'cause if he wasn't around Marvel most probably wouldn't be where it is today. 8/10.

It also focuses on the, at times, hostile Human interaction with the Mutant world, setting it up for later film (and comic) story lines.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen give strong performances throughout and considering the film is now coming up 14/15 years old, the special effects are pretty good! <br/><br/>Overall it is definitely worth a watch, especially for fans of the original Marvel comics (though I did enjoy X-Men 2 (X2) more!)"

With the exception of the ""Blade"" franchise, which represents more of a minor character's appearance on the big screen, Marvel fans had only witnessed the disastrous and preposterous films based upon: Nick Fury, Captain America, Fantastic Four, and The Punisher.<br/><br/>In 1989, Tim Burton demonstrated to the world how comic book movies could be adapted, revolutionized, and modernized with his creation of ""Batman."" Marvel fans had to wait 11 years to experience this same sensation.<br/><br/>From the futuristic opening credits, director Bryan Singer plunges his audience into the mutant world of the X-Men.<br/><br/>A solid plot which explores the idea of eliminating the mutant problem, uncovering Wolverine's origin, and the comparative yet dissimilar perspectives of friends yet enemies, Magneto and Professor X.<br/><br/>Magneto (Ian McKellen) assembles a modern-day ""Brotherhood"" consisting of a crafty and sinister Mystique,a too dumb for his own good Sabertoothed, and a surprisingly productive Toad.<br/><br/>Professor X relies on his typical entourage: Cyclops, Rogue (Anna Paquin), Jean Grey, Storm (Hale Berry), and ideally cast newcomer Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who begins the movie living on the outskirts of society making ends meat as an unbeatable cage fighter.<br/><br/>Hank McCoy (The Beast) is noticeably missing from the team, but is still mentioned within the human world, as he attempts to fight for mutant equality.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie delivers. Don't expect the special effects of 2012, but this movie was certainly ahead of its time. Solid plot. Good pace. Well cast. Excellent re-watch-ability factor for comic book fans. Don't expect the same climactic thunder packed into ""Avengers"" or the complexity of the more tightly written ""X-Men: First Class""; X-Men is a good film, not a great one.<br/><br/>Primarily, I recommend this movie basically because of its groundbreaking affect in terms of beginning the dictation of the Marvel Universe on the silver screen."

","I was always a DC Comics fan so I don't have as great a familiarity with the Marvel characters, but I have to say this was a fairly entertaining film. The characters were cool, and I'd say the casting was pretty dead on for the principal players - Patrick Stewart for Charles Xavier, Ian McKellan for Magneto, and Hugh Jackman for everyone's favorite mutant Wolverine; I don't think there were any better choices out there. Halle Berry, aside from her acting in this flick, was also a slick dead ringer for the comic book Storm.<br/><br/>In retrospect, the entire concept of the government attempting to legislate mutant behavior seems pretty non-sensical though, doesn't it? Consider Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) railing about how a powerful mutant may even be able to control one's thoughts. Does anyone see a problem here? If they have that kind of power, how effective would civil authorities be in trying to bring them under control? You have to look beyond that aspect of human vs. mutant behavior if the story is ultimately going to work.<br/><br/>The best fun moments for me occurred when Wolvie gave Cyclops (James Marsden) the middle claw, and later on when Wolverine commented on the lack of uniforms, and Cyclops responded, ""What would you prefer, yellow spandex?"" Mostly an inside joke for Marvel fans, but I've seen enough comic book covers to know what he was talking about."

","X-Men is directed by Bryan Singer and based on Marvel Comics characters. The screenplay is by David Hayler and based around Uncanny X-Men written by Stan Lee & Jack Kirby. It stars Patrick Stewart, Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry, Famke Jansen, James Marsden & Anna Paquin.<br/><br/>It's a future world where mutants with special powers co-exist with humans. Congress wants to ""out"" all mutants, Magneto wants to form an army of mutants to take over the world, but Professor Xavier wants mutants to only use their powers to do good. Something's got to give! Long in gestation (1989 was when it was first mooted), X-Men finally made it to the big screen in 2000 with much anticipation and apprehension. Cast and director changes occurred, as did rewrites & re-shoots, while the film was considerably lean with a running time of just over an hour and half. Throw into the equation that early in proceedings Bryan Singer had declared he wasn't really a fan of the source material, and the apprehension of Marvel fans was understandable. Nice, then, that the final product has actually ended up rather good.<br/><br/>Singer had been turned around by the comics due to its thematics of prejudice and assimilation (the comic was born out of the civil rights movement), in fact it was this that also got McKellen on board with the project. Substitute Magneto & Xavier with Martin Luther King & Malcolm X and you get the picture. The whole theme of the outsiders trying to get onto a level playing field of acceptance is what gives X-Men its serious heartbeat. Sure it's fun, and you got to have some silliness in a superhero picture, but thankfully Singer has managed to marry up all the threads to keep it accessible to film watchers of all ages.<br/><br/>Where X-Men falls down is with its needy reliance on being the first film of a franchise. Come the mid-point of the film, one can't help thinking about the sequel that was always going to come. Problem number two comes with too many characters purely existing within a short running time. The film is dependent on Stewart and McKellen's battle of wills and Jackman's Wolverine carrying the weight of the movie. That all three men are great softens the blow of knowing next to nothing about the other X-Men and their foes. Credit to Singer and his team, tho, for cloaking a very simple story with an impressive production. The sets, effects and set-pieces are treats for the eyes, even if the finale is not as jaw dropping as one reasonably expects of a well budgeted super hero picture.<br/><br/>But maybe the point is that the finale is merely a bridge to a second film? With that in mind, us the viewers get an appetiser. Relief, then, that it's of the very tasty kind. Here's hoping that X-Men 2 is a delicious main course follow up. 7/10"

","I saw X Men for the first time yesterday. I thought it was OK but it could have been much better. For one thing the only character who really is developed and explained how he came to be is Wolverine for the most part. The other mutants (Cyclops, Jean Grey, Storm) really get no explanation at all as to why they are mutants. THis film was not very long either so they could have taken a minute or two to explain how each mutant got their powers. Did they just expect everyone to know each of their back stories? I knew a little about X Men before seeing this film because I have read some of the comics and also watched the show back in the day but what if someone who had no prior knowledge watched the film? They would be lost a little. ALso there are not nearly enough action scenes. The fight at the end is quick and not spectacular. ALso Wolverine is on screen way more than any of the other X Men, this really is a wolverine film. The scenes with him are nice but they could have shown some other X Men as well, like Cyclops. Cyclops does not have enough dialogue. But I liked the scenes with Wolverine, those were well done. But this is not a film about Just wolverine, it is titled X men and they do not show enough about each X Men. Maybe they will in the sequel which I will see soon. But for the most part this film is too short and should have made more scenes to describe each X Men members back story and the action scenes are OK but there are not enough of them. Not strongly recommended but it is OK. Five out of ten."

","Are they ""X-Men"" because they're ex-men (and ex-women), or because ""X"" is such a nifty little letter for sci-fi and comic-books? (Kind of like ""Z"".) All ye comic-book nerds reading this, feel free to answer me that one. I am soooo interested to find out.<br/><br/>Ever since Mystique entered the picture I found the movie a bit laughable. All along I was thinking why Magneto (I feel very silly using these names) simply doesn't send her to impersonate the Senator and end the anti-Mutant political propaganda. And voila: in the end Magneto finally realizes that the ol' switcheroo can be used to solve their problem with the politician, so she does exactly that. Yawn.<br/><br/>Oh, the ol' switcheroo... It's been milked dry - and then some - in ""Star Trek"" (and many others), so I thought how boring and stupid to have that blue woman changing bodies all the time. With her in his ""arsenal"", there is no logical reason Magneto (that dumb name again) shouldn't win this war in a flash, especially when faced against a pathetic pacifist, Patrick Stewart.<br/><br/>We're told that mutants have special powers. Fine. However, we were never told that they all have far superior IQs, which they must have because both Stewart and Magneto (oh...) are scientifically far ahead of the rest of mankind, what with their fancy little laboratories, Star-Wars-like spaceships, and other gadgets.<br/><br/>On the other hand, why nit-pick? I forget that this is just a dumb comic-book adaptation, unnecessarily trying to be dark.<br/><br/>I see a lot comedic potential in this. For example, Rogue. She stuns/comatoses/kills whomever she touches. She has three encounters with Wolfy, which kind of started to get funny by the time they touched each other on the Eiffel Tower... sorry, the Statue of Liberty.<br/><br/>All in all, watchable, but far from thrilling.<br/><br/>I found the messages of tolerance a little pathetic - in a damn kiddie comic-book action yarn."

","Enter Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. Enter Ian McKellen as Magneto. Enter Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier. Enter Halle Berry as Storm. With a cast like that, how could any movie go wrong! The answer: IT CAN'T! I fell hook-line-and-sinker for this movie the moment I saw how awesome Magneto's metal-warping powers were portrayed. This movie doesn't limit his powers at all, allowing him to snatch hundreds of bullets out of thin air simultaneously and use a small metal plate to cross huge open chasms! Last but certainly not least is the fact that Magneto is portrayed by, as far as I am concerned, one of the greatest actors of all time--Ian McKellen. While McKellen's masterful role as Gandalf in Lord of the Rings was undoubtedly his crowning achievement, McKellen's portrayal of Magneto is a close second. He is charismatic, domineering, and yet has a shed of humanity left in him--a remnant of what he once was. I don't mean to spend so much time on Magneto (and I normally don't like villainous characters that much), but there is just no way around it. Magneto made the movie. Certainly, Patrick Stewart as Professor X and Hugh Jackman as Wolverine contributed greatly as well, and Halle Berry's portrayal of Storm was flawless. Overall, this movie is the whole package.

"MaxBorg89","8","1","2","20 December 2005"," The first step in superhero movie evolution...
","X-Men is a very good, stylish, exciting comic-book movie. Which is a positive thing, considering the last ""big"" superhero flick released before this one was, uh, Batman & Robin. This first movie featuring Stan Lee's ""Children of the Atom"" is not based on a particular story (with the exception of the characters' origins), as director Bryan Singer uses a plot almost entirely made from scratch to introduce us to a new world: the mutant one.<br/><br/>The setting is the United States, in a soon-to-come future: mutants, people born with a genetic alteration (the so called ""X-gene"") which gives them superhuman abilities, are becoming more and more common. Unfortunately, the rest of humanity fears them and some even try to destroy them. This brings us to the current situation: Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his students, the X-Men, which include Storm (Halle Berry), Cyclops (James Marsden) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), think peace is possible; his old friend Magneto (Ian McKellen), on the other hand, is firmly convinced war is inevitable, since he already has witnessed genocide (he's Jewish and his parents were killed in Auschwitz). As such, he and his allies, the Brotherhood of Mutants, will not allow US Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) to pass the Mutant Registration Act, and the only thing that can stop them is Xavier's students, plus two new mutants, the claw-wearing, virtually invincible Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and the power-stealing Rogue (Anna Paquin).<br/><br/>The X-Men comic books have always been an interesting sci-fi oriented reflection on such concepts as racism and alienation, a theme that emerges quite vividly throughout Singer's filmography (his previous movie, Apt Pupil, dealt with a lonely kid who forms a morbid bond with a former Nazi). In particular, Xavier and Magneto are seen as the mutant versions of Martin Luther King and Malcolm X - two people who respect each other, but choose to respectfully disagree on how to deal with specific problems. The movie takes this one step further by highlighting the philosophical and moral contradiction of Magneto, an Auschwitz survivor, trying to prevent a new extermination by causing another one himself (the role is made even more ironic by the fact that McKellen played the Nazi in Apt Pupil).<br/><br/>Alongside the thematic relevance, Singer also has to deliver in terms of action, and deliver he does, thanks to a spectacular third act which features the kind of iconic moments fans will love instantly. That being said, the film does have a defect, and that's the plot being structured as if it were the pilot episode of a TV show (in fairness, though, several first installments are written that way, but less directly) or, as Patrick Stewart put it, an extended trailer, in which all the main characters (except for a couple of villains) are thoroughly introduced so that the audience will understand who they are and what they do. Then again, such a move is justified by the solid cast the director has assembled: Stewart and McKellen were a quality guarantee from the get-go, and everyone else complies as well, particularly Jackman and Paquin, the outsiders who act as our guides in this new, exciting cinematic universe.<br/><br/>So, entirely satisfying it may not be, but the first X-Men is the film that effectively started the new wave of intelligent, above-average comic book movies. And that can only be considered a good thing."

One of them is the visual style, I don't know but it was just all to dark for me, it didn't had a comic book feeling like movies as ""Spider-Man"", ""Hulk"" and ""Batman"" all had. The X-Men uniforms also bothered me, yes I would had preferred yellow spandex! (inside movie joke).

"imprator","Null","1","2","19 June 2004"," Dull, Proselytyzing Drivel
","Fantasy and science fiction films (and literature) are a personal favourite, but this film isn't.<br/><br/>My dissatisfaction derives from three sources.<br/><br/>First, the film is very dull. There is a great deal of philosophising; indeed, a great deal of talk of all kinds. Then when the action finally arrives, it is distressingly predictable. One can hear the minds of the writers ticking over (their minds obviously never ran faster than idle  pun intended). 'Well, let's see this mutant has this set of powers so let's invent a situation that allows him to save the day. OK, that's him done now let's invent a different situation for the next mutant to solve and the next and the nextand the next' (Oh no, even writing these words makes the film live - or rather die - again in my mind.)<br/><br/>The second problem is the central premise. The mutants are going to replace us? And I am supposed to be happy about this, to cheer for them? Forget it.<br/><br/>Finally, there is the problem of the constant promotion of liberal doctrine. Thou shalt be tolerant, thou shalt not be racist, thou shalt worship diversity  and on, and on, and on, and on (Hey, with that kind of repetition I could be a scriptwriter  well, for the X-Men films, anyway.) Yes, we get it  the mutants and their situation are a metaphor for 'racism' in our society, and they represent what we are told will be the future - the (supposedly) desirable mixing of races into an eventual universal racial homogeneity.<br/><br/>This repetitive political message has no place in a popular entertainment movie, and can only detract from the enjoyment of the audience. Alright, there isn't much entertainment in this film anyway, but this propaganda just makes it worse. It's not the message that's the problem specifically  it's the endless, dull repetition and the fundamental objection to indoctrination in entertainment. I would have the same objection regardless of the nature of the message being promoted.<br/><br/>Watching such films only makes me more aware of the increasing similarities between 'Western' societies and those of such countries as Saudi Arabian, China or North Korea. Very different countries, very different beliefs  yet they all have a lack of individual freedom in common, and a media that knows its place; a media that only creates productions that promote the politically correct doctrine of the homeland. You doubt the similarities? Well, when was the last time you saw a production from Western media that promoted the idea that homosexuality is undesirable, that immigration is bad, that racial interbreeding should be avoided, that women should have more children instead of pursuing a career - or even that women are not as strong or physically able as men? It's not that I agree with these ideas  or disagree with them. My views are irrelevant. The point is that many people, both inside and outside the 'Western' world, do hold some or all of these views. Indeed, at least one of these views (women are not as strong or physically able as men) is held almost universally. Yet how often is the exact opposite view portrayed in the western media, with women out-muscling (and outfighting) men? My concern is that ideas that do not conform to politically correct doctrine are not allowed to be portrayed. This is not freedom  it is totalitarianism. We are on a dangerous path, and X-Men is one of the signposts pointing the way.<br/><br/>OK, rant over. You get the point  I really don't like this film. With more imagination, less proselytizing, and a storyline that didn't contain the central premise that we should cheer for our own destruction, X-Men could have been so much more.<br/><br/>An opportunity lost.<br/><br/>Rating  2.5/10"

","That's what Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart, Captain Picard of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" fame) said of human beings in a scene ultimately deleted from the theatrical film but used in one of the trailers.<br/><br/>
Based on the popular Marvel Comic book, this somewhat overlong, surprisingly un-action packed but not completely uninteresting film chronicles the exploits of runaway misfit Rogue (a miscast Anna Paquin) before she acquires the powers of flight and super strength and brawling loner Logan, AKA: Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, in the role that made him a star) and their crossing paths with the X-Men and joining them to help thwart magnet master Magneto's (Ian McKellan, Gandalf of the ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy) evil scheme to mutate human beings so that all life on Earth can be united in commonly being mutants. Then again, unification doesn't sound quite so bad after all. Magneto's reasoning, of course, is that there can no longer be prejudice against mutants if everyone is a mutant. Ironically, as this film depicts it, mutants will eventually inherit the Earth anyway because they are, after all, the next step in human evolution.<br/><br/>And in real life, the mutants probably would have taken over the world by now, but for the sake of drama, mutants are made just slightly less powerful enough to keep them from completely taking over the world.<br/><br/>
Now this isn't a bad film, but as a comic book fan, I'm not sure I like it as a comic book adaptation. Hugh Jackman is a capable albeit less bad ass and less gruff Wolverine, and Patrick Stewart & Ian McKellan are well cast and well matched as Professor X & Magneto, but the film is too tightly focused on the overly popular Wolverine character to give enough space for character development for the other X-Men. James Marsden is already too young to be an effective Cyclops but it's even harder to gage his acting ability when he has so little to say and do. Halle Berry and Famke Janssen make the most of their roles as Storm & Jean Grey, respectively. Tyler Mane is an imposing Saber Tooth and Rebecca R-Stamos is hard to ignore as the blue shape shifter Mystique. Ray Park (Darth Maul of ""Phantom Menace""), is just annoying as Toad.<br/><br/>The special effects are bright and colorful, but there isn't enough action to go along with it. The X-Men are also made down right pathetic during their fight with the obnoxious Toad character. That is, when Storm isn't blowing stuff at him and zapping him with lightning.<br/><br/>All in all, I preferred the animated series Fox had back in 1992. The sequel is an improvement of sorts."

However, this film contains some of the most stupid sentences I've ever heard in a film! For instance, in the scene where the X-men are captured by Magneto in the Statue of Liberty. Storm says that she saw senator Kelly die. Magneto answers: ""Are you sure you saw what you saw?"" I mean.. What were they thinking???!!! Another major one is at the point, when storm is about to fry Toad (it's so idiotic, you probably all remember!!): ""Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightening? The same thing that happens to everything else!"" I have not yet seen X2, but I sure hope the dialogue has improved since the first movie.<br/><br/>Mikkel Drewsen, Sønderborg, Denmark"
"timefreezer7","Null","1","2","22 May 2003"," Way too overhyped but OK film
","Directed by  Brian Singer Written by  David Hayter , Tom DeSanto and Bryan Singer<br/><br/>Starring  Hugh Jackman , Patrick Stewart , Anna Paquin , Ian McKellen and Famke Janssen<br/><br/>
Before I begin I should say that I am quite unrelated with the X-men universe . I have never read comics and the only character I knew apart from the celebrated worldwide Wolverine , was Cyclops . I can understand that the film by Brian Singer followed accurately the story and the origin of the characters so the fans liked the movie . Unfortunately the film hasn't got much to offer to the rest of the sci-fi and comics - transferred - to - celluloid aficionados . The 7.3 (!!!) rating is too much and I don't care about how much some X-men fans will protest , but comparing X-men to classics like Superman or Batman is an insult . I have already written in my Mortal Kombat Annihilation review (read it if you like) that it is strictly for well knowing fans of the video game and the rest are advised to keep away because most probably they will be lost . X-men 's fatal flaw is the same : too many characters in one short movie . But where at least MK:A had wonderful fight scenes and some decent SFX , X-Men fails miserably not only action-wise but the character development is also a letdown . Now , I would like to think that the deleted scenes which are included in the DVD will improve the unfinished elements but only time will tell . For now , the official cut is disappointing . Don't believe the hype : X-Men is an OK film but really nothing special . The critics for once again are proven to be wrong . There is actually nothing that differentiates the film from other ones . The comments about `adult' themes and `futuristic' imagery make me want to laugh . Batman (1989) had much more adult atmosphere and movies like `Dark City' or even `Demolition Man' deal much better with social and political issues than this latest cinematic adaptation of the famous characters . X-Men cannot hide its comics origins and it is not as dark as the official critics alleged . It DEFINITELY doesn't reach an intellectual level .<br/><br/>PLOT SYNOPSIS :  The not so distant future . In the USA there is a great number of mutants . Although it is never explained how the mutations occurred , it is probably due to perturbations of D.N.A. The mutants have some amazing super-powers which have caused people to be afraid of them . The mutants cannot live ordinary lives and try to hide their secret because they now that a disclosure will ostracize them from society for good . As if this wasn't enough , a Senator called Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) has started a campaign against mutants and wants to confine them so their super-powers will not be a threaten to society . Unbeknownst to his plans , there is a powerful mutant who is also a wise scientist , Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) with enhanced telekinetic and telepathic abilities (ironically he is stuck in a wheelchair) . Professor Xavier (a.k.a. Professor X) has founded an occluded academy for mutant children . He teaches them how to use the powers they have and learn how to control them . He is an idealist and believes that some day the mutants will be incorporated as a healthy tissue of the society along `normal' humans . There is also another equally powerful mutant scientist Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto) with the ability to manipulate metal objects within a remarkable range and scale with exceptional timing and synchrony . Magneto (Ian McKellen) believes that a war is coming and he wants to exterminate humans before they get the chance to strike first . Professor X and Magneto were old friends  but now their philosophies are bound to clash . Professor X's key assistants in the academy are Scott Summers (James Marsden) alias Cyclops whose eyes emit deadly energy blasts , Orore Munroe (Halle Berry) alias Storm with the ability to control thunders and air and Dr Jean Grey (Famke Janssen) a skilled scientist with limited telekinetic and telepathetic powers . The basic star of the film is actually Wolverine (a brilliant Hugh Jackman) a mysterious man with amnesia who has the power to heal himself rapidly from serious injuries. He meets with a mutant girl called Mari D' Ancanto (Anna Paquin) alias Rogue who has an energy-draining ability and her touch can be deadly . When the two of them are attacked by Magneto 's henchmen they are rescued by Cyclops and Storm and are taken in the Academy for security . Rogue is adjusted easily and makes new friends but Wolverine doesn't want to stay despite Professor X's warnings that Magneto is after him . Predictably more fights among the X-Men and Magneto 's gang will ensue .<br/><br/>This is the so-called `plot' of the movie . The first half hour before we enter the Academy is extremely weak and boring . If you are not familiar with X-Men you will not understand much . Towards the end there is a `master plan' by Magneto but it is a desperate and futile attempt to create a plot where there isn't there any . So what happens in between ? First of all Magneto is not evil and his henchmen are ugly and repelling freaks with lousy make-up . Mystique 's blue body is cheaply made and disgusting . The villains are not interesting . On the X-Men side things are not better . Storm (a woefully underdeveloped Halle Berry) and Cyclops hardly ever use their powers . Even worse they are decorative . The entire movie looks cheap. I don 't care how much money it cost but it looks cheap . Most of the SFX are nothing special and I was expecting better from a 2000 new-tech film . I have seen better SFX from older movies (Superman) or TV shows . Mystique 's shape-shifting , Cyclops 's red rays or even Magneto 's white light-emitting device are cheap and could be included in a 1970 's B-movie . What I liked was Storm 's abilities to fly and control the weather but as I already said she hardly uses them . Most of the fight scenes are also disappointing . As for character development forget it . Patrick Stewart was an ideal choice for the role but even he is not given much to do except from reciting his history to Wolverine . The interesting characters are Dr Jean Grey and Rogue. Famke Janssen and Anna Paquin try valiantly but suffer from a shallow script . There are also cameos from Pyro (a young man with pyrokinetic abilities) , the well known Iceman and Kitty Pride ,  a girl who can pass through walls with momentary dematerialization , who are all students at the Academy . I guess we will have to wait for the next film to see their characters stretched out . Professor X , Storm , Cyclops , Dr Jean Grey and Rogue have great potential and worth more screen time . This is another great problem of the film apart from the cheap SFX : the leads are never given origin or motives . They simply are there and act mechanistically . X-Men is clearly an introductory film and it leaves you wanting for more . As for the messages about racism and the obvious parallelism to Mac Carthy's politics ? Cute and welcomed but haven't we really seen it all over again in other films ? So this is not an innovation .<br/><br/>There is one thing I liked and of course this is Hugh Jackman as Wolverine . The man was born for to play this role . Wolverine is the lead of the movie . His claws is the most convincing SFX and he is the most developed character . In the future we will probably dig up more information about his past and how he obtained his powers . Hugh Jackman gives a great performance and survives the script 's flaws . On the acting side Famke Janssen , Anna Paquin and the ever reliable Patrick Stewart give solid appearances despite the one-dimensional roles . Has this film any other virtues ? Quite a few I am afraid . The academy 's scenery is quite psychedelic and who can forget the scene with Wolverine walking through the corridor with the mirrors . Some of the costumes are also nice . Jackman and Paquin share an interesting quasi-erotic chemistry . I also liked Bruce Davison as the Congressman and I believe he should be used more . And no matter how cheaply directed and unoriginal , the final showdown between X-Men and Magneto 's mutants succeeds in being memorable.<br/><br/>In conclusion X-Men is not a great movie . Brian Singer is definitely an overrated director (Usual Suspects was also OK but nothing great) but I have sincere hopes that the sequel will be better . If however you are sucker for comics - movies (like I am) see it . It is not Batman but it is not Howard the Duck either .<br/><br/>X - MEN        7 / 10<br/><br/>
P.S    In case you wonder about the corny line ` Do you know what happens to a toad when it is hit by a thunder ? ....... What happens to everything else' . This wasn't in the script . The rational explanation comes from the original version . The plausible answer is ` It croaks'."
"chthon2","5","1","2","20 May 2003"," It was ok.
","There have been a lot of comments here from people who loved the comic books.  Well, I used to read comic books, but actually, I never liked X-Men. I don't know why; it's nothing I could put my finger on.  I just didn't like the general plotline.<br/><br/>Likewise, I can't really point out why I didn't like this movie.  I'm never impressed by fancy expensive effects, so those didn't save it for me.  I just didn't like it.  But most people did, so if you haven't seen it yet, give it a try."
"MoSD","Null","1","2","25 April 2003"," X-Men...More like crap-Men!
","This movie is one of the most hollywood washed down heartless films In which to ever make a huge profit. Not only did the movie itself suck, but they had to go out and make another sequal to supply to the dumbed down mind of the American youths of the 00's. The screen play just might be the worst one I have ever  ever seen and Halle Barrey's character states quite possible the worst line in big budget cinema history. ""Do you know what happends to a toad when it gets struck by lightning? The same thing as everyone else.""  That by far is the worst line ever delivered by an Oscar winner. What crap. Not only does the script suck but so does the acting. The acting is horrible and I know in a movie like this the acting is not suppose to mean that much but when you have a cast ensomble as Patrick Stewart, Anna Paquin, Halle Barrey and Hugh Jackman you would expect better acting than the high school amateur ability that was shown in this film. At points in this movie I found myself laughing at how bad the acting and script was. Though the special effects looked cool, this movie still sucked and is what is wrong with the movie industry today. And now this summer we are going to be giving nothing but sequals which will mostly all suck because movies such as X-men makes a killing even though it sucks."
"Infofreak","Null","1","2","12 April 2003"," Adequate I suppose, but really, I was expecting a LOT more!
","I'm not an 'X-Men' buff by any means, but I do read comics (though I prefer Vertigo to Marvel), and I love Bryan Singer's 'The Usual Suspects', so I was expecting a lot from this movie. I really hoped that this would finally be THE movie that takes comics seriously and takes them to the next level. Sadly it isn't. As comic adaptations go it's one of the better ones, but that's not high praise as most of them stink. Not being a fan I didn't mind that some details were played around with, but I did think that the script left a bit to be desired. The Bruce Davidson character and the McCarthy witchhunt aspects of the plot were heavy-handed and obvious, and basically all the potentially interesting ideas raised throughout the movie were never explored. Maybe if Singer had asked his talented former collaborator Christopher McQuarrie to write the script things would have been meatier and less predictable, I don't know. I did like the way the movie didn't get bogged down in origin stories or flashbacks, something that usually drags these kinds of movies down, but 'X-Men' really runs out of steam in the last third with an anti-climatic finale that fails to satisfy. Plus the movie is blatantly left open for the inevitable sequels, and this comes across as a very cynical move. The best thing about the film is the casting of Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen as Professor X and Magento respectively, both are much better than the weak material they have to work with. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine and Famke Janssen as Dr.Jean Grey were both good, but the rest of the cast were pretty dull, especially Halle Berry as Storm who might as well not have been in it.  So, a missed opportunity all round that is adequate but not much more. I hope the sequel is a big improvement but I'm not holding my breath."
"ufokart","5","1","2","3 February 2003"," why did they make this movie anyway?
","i have seen lots and lots of bad movies in my short life (i'm 16) but this is surely one of the worst. everything in this picture is out of order. the plot is totally idiotic and it's not even original. when i was younger watched the tv series from time to time and they were at least interesting. but this movie seems it wasn't based on the tv serie but on a trash can. i have seen the movie almost two years ago, so i don't remember exactly what the plot was (i only remember it was awful), i only remember that here we have wolverine as the lead character and that we learn how he got into the academy of mutant (or whatever it was).<br/><br/>performances are indeed bad. hugh jackman gaves a ridiculous and boring performance as wolveine, and the others such as halle berry, anna paquin and james marsden. ian mckellen dissapointed me , he did very good movies (like ""the lord of the rings: fellowship of the ring"" that was excellent compared to the sequel ""TTT"" that sucks, and he also did ""gods and monsters"") i don't know why he is so bad in this one. another dissapointment was famke janssen, who was excellent in ""goldeneye"" and good in ""rounders"", here she's plain bad.<br/><br/>the most irracional thing for me is that the guy who directed one of my favorite movie (""the usual suspects"") has directed this crap, and oh no !!!!!!!!! he has also directed the sequel of this so-called movie. yucks!!!!!!.<br/><br/>good stunts and the ok performance of patrick stewart can't make up for all it's flaws. i warn you: don't see this movie, in fact try to avoid any contact with it. 1/10."

"Moricious","Null","1","2","29 May 2002"," Pretty flat really
","I'm a reasonably loyal fan of the comic, so I went in wanting to like this a lot. But it came off as not quite translating the X-men's actual appeal. To be fair the film is burdened with setting up the groundwork for the characters and their factions. Though in truth the conflict between Xavier and Magneto isn't the most compelling aspect of the X-Men story, and didn't seem particularly engaging in its depiction here. I would have liked to see a little more character interaction and a little less Matrix-lite action. Some of the casting choices could have been given more thought as well. If you were underwhelmed by the movie but are still interested in the X-men story I'd recommend the Graphic Novels ""God Loves,Man Kills"" and ""The Dark Phoenix Saga""."
"Mike Astill","7","1","2","26 September 2001"," Good fun, and it shows respect to the comic book and its fans
","It's always nice to see a superhero tale told with an amount of respect shown to the source material, rather than taking the easy route to campy humour and frivolity. The X-Men, one of Marvel Comics' most popular titles, if not THE most popular, concerns itself with a group of young mutants, using their powers to protect humankind.<br/><br/>The movie focuses on two of the more interesting characters as they discover their powers, come to terms with being ostracised from society, and eventually find a home at Professor Xavier's School for Gifted Children, from where the X-Men launch their missions to protect mankind.<br/><br/>
Much of the casting is inspired. Patrick Stewart would have been a popular choice for Professor Xavier if it had gone to a vote anyway, but Shakespearian thesp Sir Ian McKellen turns up in the unlikely role of a costumed supervillain. He pulls it off in fine style. <br/><br/>As for the X-Men themselves, Hugh Jackman was a great choice for the pivotal Wolverine character, and Halle Berry's icy-cool Storm was perfect. As always, though, Berry seems to be underused. A shame, as she's a great actress. Anna Paquin's youthful Rogue was cute but didn't seem to have much to do except play a hapless captive. Hopefully she'll get her chance to kick some ass in the sequel. Janssen and Marsden were fine as Jean Grey and Cyclops, but they seemed to be secondary characters. Again, maybe there'll be more for them to do second time around?<br/><br/>As far as the sequel goes, hopefully we'll be getting more action, as the necessary exposition about the mutants and their world is now out of the way. It's slightly disappointing that we'll be seeing the same villains again, as apart from Magneto himself they were a little drab. For all her lithe sexiness, Romijn-Stamos's Mystique was little more than the dull old shapeshifting villain, and Mane's Sabretooth nothing but a bumbling musclehead. Ray Park seemed to be having fun as Toad, though, and it'll be worth seeing more of this particular villain. <br/><br/>One of the best movie adaptations of a comic book then, and we should be looking forward to an exciting sequel next year."

I liked the movie and it was well acted and the special effects didnt take presidence over the story like a certain Star Wars Movie from last summer. I left the theatre wanting more. I only wish we could have found out more of the characters pasts and alittle more team effort instead of Wolverine and Rogue getting most of the screen time.

James Marsden looked like LeVar Burton in his Star Trek get-up and Anna Paquin looked like she was doing ""The French Lieutenant's Woman"" for the high school play.

","Bruce Wayne Vocal Diary:""Having just seen the X-Men movie, I feel as if I have a deeper understanding of these controversial public figures and their dangerous terrorist antagonists. Couldn't get Professor X's opinion on the movie fictionalized from their battle with peace, bigotry and equal rights, but needless to say, some of the actors used aren't very flattering to the actual members as I know them. Per se, Halle Berry- she's a very beautiful actress but the real Storm is a little exotic looking, kind of like Vanessa Williams. I suppose it's the African blood. The only actress I know who comes close to the beautiful Jean Grey is Nicole Kidman, and Rogue is flattered by Anne Paquin's portrayal, but the Rogue I know looks more like a cross between Brooke Shields and Carmen Electra. Toad and Mystique are a lot more sinister looking in the movie than their truer counterparts, but the Mystique I know isn't quite that sexy. Otherwise, the similarities are rather precise. There I go rambling,,,but then I'm still irked at those Val Kilmer and George Clooney movies.  Continuing,,,, the movie is a very dark and sometimes light-hearted adventure somewhat patterned after the style of the recent Batman films of recent so I'm sure they'll be some sort of sequel. This Bryan Singer seems to display the same artful repertoire of Joel Schumacher and Tim Burton. The violence is played down for a more action feel,,,,,I wonder how the video store clerks are going to label this movie,,,action? fantasy? The masses who go to these movies have predominantly declared views that are mixed on the exemplary special effects and the less than satisfactory script. The true stars of the movie are the costumes and less so the actors in them; the television's ""Flash"" and ""Lois and Clark"" being good examples of when the costumes carry the entertainment. Still,the movie is a big departure from when all heroes wore spandex. That Adam West television show still gives me nightmares to this day; yet,the Hulk still speaks fondly of Lou Ferrigno. The movie fortunately has a very realistic feel unlike the campy atmosphere seen in the Generation X television pilot and the Spiderman television series.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","3","1","2","11 December 2000"," Remember Spawn?
","Spawn is a dark and humorous comic book that totally rocks. The film contains none of the pathos, imagination or spirit that the comic book had. Its main fault is that it was toned down for a young audience and had to many CGI FX.<br/><br/>X-Men suffers from exactly the same problem. There is VERY, VERY little or action and what little there is is very tame and stolen from other movies (Matrix, T2). Nothing much happens for long periods of time, the dialogue is nothing but mumbo-jumbo and there are plot holes all over the place. Professor X can sense the presence of mutants from far away but cannot notice a bad mutant walking all over his house. Duh!<br/><br/>The ending was ridiculous. It was completely senseless and did not impress me one iota. The word 'contrivance' echoed around in my head. If the whole scene had been set on the roof of a supermarket instead of the Statue of Libertywould it be cool? Of course the reason it IS on the big statue is because Magneto wants to turn a bunch of people into mutants with what looks like a giant whisk. Uhyeahthat's inspired. <br/><br/>Anna Paquin was competent enough, Jackman was pretty cool, Stewart was Picardish, Jansen was underused, McKellen was campy as hell and James Marsden was as woodenly wooden as he was in Gossip and Disturbing Behavior. Thank Mother Nature he only had about 2 lines of dialogue.<br/><br/>I cannot think of any reason why this trash is in the IMDb top 250. It stinks. Perhaps fans of the comic book, who were so disappointed with the film, gave it 10/10 because they felt they owed it to the X-Men. Me? I just wasted my money."

However, every few hundred thousand years accelerated mutation happens and humans with certain ""superhuman"" abilities come to be. It manifests itself during puberty, and is triggered by an emotionally-charged event.<br/><br/>The film opens in 1944 Poland, a concentration camp, where the protagonist who will become ""Magneto"" is an adolescent and his power is first manifest as his mother and father are being dragged away from him. Next, the ""not too distant future"" in Mississippi, where the girl known as ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin)kisses her boyfriend and almost kills him.<br/><br/>There is activity in congress to legally require ""mutants"" to be registered.

"SKG-2","8","1","2","17 July 2000"," Very good comic book movie
","One of the never-ending debates about popular culture is whether it reflects the times or dictates them.  I tend toward the former view, and comic books are no exceptions to this rule.  Batman and Superman, the popular comic book heroes of the 30's and 40's, came during the Depression and WWII, where people wanted larger-than-life heroes to look up to.  Whereas in the 60's and 70's, when society was becoming ripped apart and people were feeling confused and didn't trust society, comic book heroes like Spiderman and The Fantastic Four, who had as many everyday problems as they did evil ones, were the popular heroes.  Square in that tradition are the X-Men.<br/><br/>I was only a casual reader of the comics when I grew up; it was more the excellent animated series of several years back I became a fan of.  It was on late at night, and the times shifted around so I couldn't always watch, but I enjoyed watching the adventures of Professor X, Storm, Wolverine, Rogue, and the others, and how they struggled to find their place in the world and to help other mutants do the same.  Now, director Bryan Singer and a host of writers(in addition to credited writers Singer, Tom DeSanto, and David Hayter, writers including John Logan, Christopher McQuarrie, Ed Solomon, and Joss Whedon took a whack at it) have delivered their version of X-MEN, and I'm pleased to say it delivers.<br/><br/>One of the reasons it works is Singer, his usual director of photography, Newton Thomas Sigel, and production designer John Myhre eschew the usual look of comic book films.  Even though this is set in the future(the ""near future""), everything looks close to like it is today(except, of course, Magneto's hideout and Professor Xavier's school).  This emphasizes even more the alienation mutants feel from society.  And while there are visual effects used in both the battles and when the X-Men show their stuff(especially Mystique), they don't come at the expense of the story, but serve it.<br/><br/>Some have complained the film is overly serious, as if being a comic book automatically meant it wasn't worth taking seriously.  Yes, Singer is making parallels to bigotry today, with some direct antecedents(the anti-mutant Senator Robert Kelly is clearly modeled on Joe McCarthy, Magneto is a Holocaust survivor, and he quotes Malcolm X near the end - ""by any means necessary"" - which also suggests Professor Xavier is parallel to Martin Luther King), but they're handled well, and not overplayed.  It's also refreshing to see how little melodrama creeps in(SPOILER ALERT: When Professor Xavier becomes bedridden and the rest of the X-Men must carry on without him, it's good to see he doesn't suddenly come back just in time to save the day.  END SPOILER ALERT).  And to those who suggest the movie is without humor, there are jokes both visual(I don't know the characters, but at the school, one boy makes a fireball, and another sneaks up behind him and turns it into ice.  Also, Wolverine's version of flipping someone the bird) and through dialogue(when Wolverine puts down the costumes everyone's wearing, Cyclops shoots back, ""Would you prefer yellow spandex?"").<br/><br/>One criticism of comic book movies has generally been that they spend too much time trying to explain things to people who don't know anything about them, all at the expense of the story.  That's certainly a valid point, but the stories of Wolverine and Rogue(though admittedly hers is supposedly changed radically from the source) are a good way of getting into the story, and Magneto's short past is necessary to show while he is a villain, he's not your standard one.  And the stories of Wolverine and Rogue provide an emotional counterpoint to the information disseminated about the X-Men(the fact that Patrick Stewart is handling the exposition keeps these scenes from bogging down).<br/><br/>Which leads to the performances.  In order for this to work, you need actors with tremendous presence and authority to play Professor Xavier and Magneto, and someone who can fully handle the complexity of Wolverine, and this is where the film truly scores.  Stewart and Ian McKellen are terrific in their roles, both resisting the urge to camp it up(the fact that they sound alike also illustrates how the characters are two sides of the same coin), and especially play well together.  And while I had wanted Russell Crowe(the first name mentioned during casting talks) for Wolverine, newcomer Hugh Jackman does quite well, capturing all the feelings Wolverine feels, plus having a great physical presence.  And he also does a great job working with all the other actors, and acting with his face(SPOILER ALERT: especially in the scene when he rescues Rogue near the end. END SPOILER ALERT)<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is more of a mixed bag.  On the minus side, Tyler Mane has very little to do as Sabretooth, though Magneto and Mystique are the main villains here anyway.  Halle Berry has a great physical presence as Storm, her battle scenes come off well, and she's quietly powerful in her one dramatic scene with Senator Kelly, but her African accent(Storm, of course, lived there much of her life) is wayward, and she gets stuck with some awkward dialogue(her scene with Wolverine).  And while James Marsden is appropriately cocky as Cyclops, and spars well with Wolverine, isn't quite convincing as a leader, in his one dramatic scene(with Professor Xavier), he's wooden rather than moving, and he and Jean Gray don't have much chemistry(in fairness, that was probably among the footage cut out after previews).  On the plus side, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos only has one line of dialogue, but she's quite a presence as Mystique; she's a visual effect all to herself.  And unlike the tiresome face-swapping of MISSION IMPOSSIBLE 2, her shape-shifting never becomes tiresome, because it's always used right, for terror or a joke.  Ray Park also makes a good presence as Toad, and contributes some humor as well.  Bruce Davison doesn't overplay as Kelly, but brings the right amount of edge.  Famke Jannsen brings quiet strength to Jean Gray, and her scenes with Wolverine sparkle(especially when she looks into his mind).  Finally, while some have complained that Rogue is too passive a character, I would argue it's appropriate for this conception; she doesn't use her power in fights because she hasn't learned to control it, and is afraid to use it.  And Anna Paquin captures this emotional confusion well, especially with her scenes with Wolverine(along with McKellen and Stewart, Jackman and Paquin are the best pair in the film).<br/><br/>Overall, this was quite a good effort, and while I'm normally leery of sequels, the same people are back for the second film, so I'm looking forward to it."

","There's little I can really say about ""X-Men"". Everything is done well enough, and yet nothing stands out. Patrick Stewart is perfect as Professor X, opposed by Ian ""Gandalf"" McKellen. Everyone else is adequate but there's no outstanding performances.<br/><br/>What of the script? Again *shrug*. Essentially terrorists trying to sabotage a political conference - not exactly innovative thinking. There's little in the way of surprises.<br/><br/>How does it look? Director Bryan Singer decides not to make this movie into a tongue-in-cheek affair, which is perhaps wise considering how the Batman series fared from that approach. The movie is fairly dark, a fact struck home by the bleak visuals in the opening. There's an almost sombre feel to the picture, with the humorous moments delivered dryly.  And yet Singer never got me caught up in the movie - the visuals, the sound, the characters - nothing dragged me and made me think ""X-Men"" was really good. As these action block-busters go it was certainly better made than most, and looked nice, et cetera. And yet it was missing that .. X.. factor that makes a movie great. Perhaps the sequel will do better but I can only give it a 6/10. Somewhat disappointing."

At least for people like me who had not known about the comics before, because I felt as if I didn't know something throughout the film. The characters were introduced rather fast, and some strands definitely have the purpose of justifying a sequel. Thus, the movie itself seems somehow incomplete to me. It's probably more fun watching it when you know the background stories of the plot."

","Good Points:  It is an entertaining flick, in spite of its flaws, with plenty of sweet eye candy.  The mutants' powers are nicely brought to life through the miracle of CGI.  Kudos to Patrick Stewart who played a wonderful Professor X, Ian McKellen as the perfect Magneto, and Hugh Jackman who deserves every penny he gets for playing Wolverine with charisma and style without coming across cheesy like everyone else in the cast.  Bad Points: It's not that the movie is BAD per se, but there's nothing outstanding about it.  The directing is decent but not ground-breaking, and aside from Stewart, McKellen, and Jackman, the acting is nothing special.  Bottom Line: Kids will love it.  For the adults, don't expect much and you won't be disappointed."
"wileyjp","Null","1","2","13 November 2001"," The Muties Go Commercial
","As an action movie, this more or less works. As an accurate cinematic portrayal of the X-Men, there are more than a few flaws. Does it detract from the experience? Not entirely. A few nagging points constantly scratch at your brain.<br/><br/>First, the casting is somewhat mixed. I think the only dead-on casting was of Cyclops (PERFECT match!), Magneto and Professor X (who else BUT Patrick Stewart could play him?). The rest is alright, but nothing special. Hugh Jackman can handle the Wolverine attitude (""Later, bub"" would not sound wrong coming out of his lips), but he's just a little too tall. And a few decisions really get you: Halle Berry as Storm? I say, if you don't see Storm as anything more than Halle Berry in a platinum wig, don't put her in the movie. Even at the climax, when she rises from the elevator shaft, eyes glossed over, hair and cape flowing, I still wasn't seeing her as Storm.<br/><br/>Rogue deserves her own paragraph: where is the tall, striking, Southern brawler we all know and love? Gone, replaced by Anna Paquin, who is about half the size and has none of the bravado, fire, and spirit of Rogue. In fact, she looks like a whiny kid. Sorry, Anna, but that travesty of a Southern accent (which rapidly disappears anyway) does not Rogue make.<br/><br/>The chronology of what mutants join when is a little confused. They attempted to make it a cross between a historical account of the forming of the team and a ""hit parade"" of mutants. <br/><br/>If they want a historical account, then it should start with Angel, Iceman, Cyclops, Jean Grey (Marvel Girl) and Beast. The rest (Rogue, Storm, Wolverine) would join later in the film. No Angel, barely any Iceman, and Beast was canned due to makeup restraints. So much for that idea.<br/><br/>The ""hit parade"" idea holds a little more water, but not much. Where the heck is Gambit? And what is Colossus doing painting when the team is in desperate need of muscle? Betsy Braddock, a.k.a. Psylocke?<br/><br/>And the villains: Magneto, Mystique, Sabretooth and Toad. That's it. Some army. When will the Cytorak gem turn Cain Marko into the Juggernaut? Where are the Sentinels? Omega Red?<br/><br/>When will we see the Danger Room in all of its might? The Savage-Land? Sure, the ""yellow spandex"" line gets a few laughs, but why are the costumes so generic? This film asks more questions than it answers, but if you take it on its own terms it's an alright movie, but nothing more."

I used my imagination to create a world that I understood and believed to fit the narrative. These movies take that all away and you subject yourself to the will of the director and writers.<br/><br/>I don't like these movies.<br/><br/>Magneto was originally a good villain but now he's a Mary Sue. Mystique too. I'm not sure about Toad. I mean, what the hell is this BS? Toad was a meaningless side kick and now they make him out like some super villain? I mean seriously. Toad super powers?<br/><br/>The Magneto powers, well, they turned Magneto in to something which is to say the least, moronic. I've seen the fan-boy explanations for his super powers but if you have half a brain cell you can understand how magnetism works, and they got it 100% wrong in X-Men.<br/><br/>The other problems I have is that Wolverine, while a great casting job, is another moronic interpretation of the original Wolverine. His feud with Sabertooth is shown briefly and they bring together the two characters out of sync with the original story. It would be far better to make a movie about Wolverine and Sabertooth so that you can get the reason why Sabertooth doesn't like Wolverine or vice versa.<br/><br/>Storm, well, Storm is Storm. I think that I expected better casting, but that's the way Hollowwood is these days.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is fairly benign<br/><br/>Overall? The script sucks and so does the directing. The special effects are meh. This movie sets the stage for all other superhero movies. Total suckage."

","X-Men (2000) is MARVEL comic book superhero Action Science Fiction Flick. It is the first and Original film in the ""X-Men"" movies and an awesome film I ever saw. It is my favorite film of the franchise series!!! X-Men was the first movie I saw it back than in 2001 in the summer on the tape, I rent it a VHS video in the video store. That time I did not like the movie because I did not got it and I did read a lot of critics about this movie, that it was bad etc... That suits weren't like were in the comic books. So for Spider-Man they tried to make his suits more by comic books. My favorite and best one is X-Men (2000) the original film. It is a good conclusion to end of the first movie. I love the fight scenes in Liberty Island,that took place in Statue of Liberty in New York. <br/><br/>2.mutants in Canada Wolverine and Rouge are traveling together but Magneto order to attack them, he need it one of them, to used her/him to lunch an attack on the humans. Because he believes the war is coming. Yes Wolverine and Sabretooth does fight each other in this movie, but in X-Men Origins: Wolverine they were both brothers and they don't know who they are, In this one is a hug error put hole I. I like Toad when he spit a powerful toxic goo in Jean Phoenix's face. X-Men is a great superhero comic book movie but it isn't an origin story of how they met each other. The origin story would be X-Men: First Class here is more in the middle class. My favorite movie of the trilogy is X-Men (2000) I considering as best one and I enjoyed this movie a lot. I love it and I love all three of them. <br/><br/>Actor Ian Mckellen is great, he played Magneto once again in X-Men: Days of Future Past (2014). X-men is a very good comic book to film story. It has a lot of solid 'superhero-esque' mutants that band together under the hospices of Mr Xavier (Stewart) and with lead protagonist (Jackman) in Wolverine...a lot of ass kicking and taking names going on here. I actually like this series pretty well. Mutants vs Humans vs Bad Mutants...a lot of treachery and twists here and overall, a solid picture for young and old alike. <br/><br/>I think this is a good superhero movie, with a lot of fights, and twist, I just love this film to death! Bryan Singer did an excellent job Directing the most awesome Action superhero film! I love this film much better than X-Men: Days of Future past! I love this film, I love Wolverine, Magneto, Phoenix, Rogue, Storm, Cylops and Mystique. The actors portraying the mutants and battle were great. CGI and special effects were also great, they weren't annoying, they were great. <br/><br/>""Mutation. It is the key to our evolution."" <br/><br/>The basic plot about this film is In the near future, ""mutants"" are the next link in the chain of evolution. Each are born with a genetic mutation that manifests into extraordinary powers. Under the tutelage of Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the world's most powerful telepath, these ""gifted"" students have learned to control and direct their respective powers for the greater good of mankind. But when the Professor's former colleague and friend, Erik Lehnsherr a.k.a. Magneto (Ian McKellen) wages war against them and society, Xavier brings together a special group of mutants called ""X-Men"" to protect the world that fears them.<br/><br/>I love this film and it is one of my favorite comic book superhero films! I love it so much!

But there are some Outstanding Set Pieces, like Magneto's Standoff with the Police, and the Train Sequence. The Ending Statue of Liberty Battle comes off rather Lackluster. <br/><br/>The Mutant vs Human Confrontation can obviously be Analogous to Real Life Prejudices, as Magneto Says ""Humans always fear what they don't understand.""

","X-Men can be said to be the movie that by itself launched the modern superhero film madness. There had been superhero movies before, some of them even somewhat successful, but this was the film that defined the new style. It paid homage to the comics, taking its inspiration from them, but it took liberties with its characters, story lines and most importantly the visuals, transforming and translating them to the silver screen.<br/><br/>It also helped that it had an amazing ensemble cast behind its characters. Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and Halle Berry were already well-known by this point, but the film also helped to put several people on the map, most prominently Hugh Jackman. And their newfound fame is well-deserved as they all give fantastic performances, breathing life into their characters. Sure, some of their lines... okay, about half their lines were very cheesy, but that's the fault of the script which, while revolutionary in its own way, was still looking its way and thus contained a significant amount of silliness from the previous decades, which had made those previous films so hard to sell to the larger audiences.<br/><br/>Another minor problem is the story. And don't get me wrong, I like the story. But right now, fifteen years and an impressive amount of superhero films later, I can say that it's a bit juvenile. And, to the film's credit, it shies away from pure black-n-white morality with its villain Magneto (McKellen), as well as it should, but overall the tone and the events don't reach that same magnitude and epicness that later movies would.<br/><br/>In the end this makes X-Men very important for the whole superhero genre, but keeps it from being more than an average film.

You want to shut your brain off and see a high budget superhero movie then this is it. Normal rating for a film like this is a C, or 5 stars. My rating is a D/F, or 1 star to make up for all the nonsense praise for this pile of nonsense."

","I`ve never been all that keen on comic strips , the only exception being the strips that appeared in the issues of the Doctor Who Weekly by Marvel comics from over 20 years ago that featured early work from legends like Dave Gibbons , Paul Nearey and Alan Moore , but apart from that I have no interest in what some people pretentiously describe as "" Graphic novels "" . Come to think of it shouldn`t books be called "" literary comics "" in that case ? No ? Well thank gawd for that<br/><br/>My knowledge of the X-Men strip exactly matches my interest ie zero , so I was surprised when the movie`s opening sequence takes place in a Nazi death camp which led me to think this topic didn`t belong in this movie , but as the story progresses this ties in with the subtext of the movie . Unfortunately this subtext of xenophobia is quickly forgotten about as the movie mutates ( Geddit ? ) into a yawn stifilling battle between good and evil , the only difference being that both the goodies and baddies have superhuman powers . It goes without saying that there`s a lot of make up and special effects involved and both are disappointing especially the CGI . It`s also obvious that before X-MEN was shot it was going to be a franchise movie which means we have a fair amount of exposition which holds up the story<br/><br/>X-MEN is just as I expected it to be for the most part , a Summer blockbuster heavy on FX and light on plotting and characterisation . It`s not the worst Summer blockbuster you`ll ever see but just like a comic strip it lacks substance"
"zanghi_james","7","0","1","21 October 2019"," One of the most important Modern Superhero movies out there, but has sadly not held up well in a few aspects
","I loved the X-Men franchise films, even with its super-screwed-up timelines. It's almost 2020, now, and I'd say that it's still a good series, but recently I re-watched the original X-Men by Bryan Singer, and I can see some impressive flaws in it.<br/><br/>First off, the action for the movie is incredibly slow in comparison to standard MCU/DCEU-fare. The fight scenes are forgettable and poorly choreographed, even worse than the Lau fight scene of The Dark Knight. There's no real build-up or intensity. Plus, all Cyclops does in this story is press a button. He doesn't throw a punch.<br/><br/>Second, the acting. While there is no doubt that the casting of most of the actors is great (Namely Ian McKellen as Magneto, Bruce Davidson as Robert Kelly, Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Ray Park as Toad, and Patrick Stewart as Xavier) some of the other actors give poor performances that don't live up to their comic-book counterparts. James Marsden is instantly forgettable as Scott Summers, Famke Jammsen is rather weak as Jean, and Halle Berry is incredibly one-dimensional as Storm.<br/><br/>Despite the flaws, this film is notable since it is pretty much one of the first Modern Superhero movies that focused primarily on dramatic storytelling and gritty action. There are some well-done scenes that make up for the poor script and bad fights, most notably the iconic performance of Hugh Jackman on the train with Anna Paquin as Rogue. That scene gets me every time in a good way. Also, the ending scene is perfection with Charles and Erik playing chess and discussing the fate of the Academy if the Mutant Registration law is ever passed.<br/><br/>I like also how this movie compares the Mutant Community of Marvel Comics in a parallel to what is going on with the LBGTQ community these days. I think it's a good parallel.<br/><br/>May the Force be with you!"

","The X-Men movies for me have always been a disappointment. I love the X-Men and the Marvel / DC Universes however, the story lines for the movies always left me somewhat cold.<br/><br/>The storylines were 2 dimensional and basically lacking any depth.<br/><br/>I am all for making improvements when transitioning from comic book to cartoon to big screen movie - however the storylines in the cartoons had more depth and interest then the movies.<br/><br/>OK maybe there are limitations when transitioning from cartoons to big screen movies I get that - but there is no excuse when the film makers tone down and over simplify the storylines or in the case of the X-Men change the storylines completely into something that just lacks substance."

"jordanthomas_2009-346-914758","9","0","1","23 July 2018"," Great debut for the popular comic
","X-Men is packed with a talented cast of actors from Hugh Jackman, Anna Paquin, Halle Berry, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen. Adapted from the popular Marvel comic and directed by Bryan Singer (The Usual Suspects) Its full of themes like tolerance and prejudice which are conveyed very well in the film. The stigma these mutants face in their daily lives are very similar to our own and we can all connect with them to some extent which is the real driving force behind the film. <br/><br/>Although it has some visually awesome action scenes there is a lot more to it than that. There are some great story arcs focusing on the vulnerable sides of these characters rather than just their superhuman abilities. It's also great how it deals with the political side of things. Mutants can indeed be very dangerous which the politicians are quick to judge by labelling them as weapons. Deep down they are just like everyone else - They want to fit in with society and abide by their laws. <br/><br/>Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart are really good in their roles. They really play off of each other here. Magneto (McKellen) can control all forms of metal. He is an interesting villain as he is more of an activist who fights for mutant rights though his methods can be extreme. He is just doing what he feels is fair and it's easy to empathise with him as he is older and been through some bad things in his lifetime. Charles Xavier (Stewart) can read people's minds while also manipulating them. He has also seen his fair share over the years but he still chooses to do good by giving mutants a place to live. He is all for mutants and humans living amongst each other but Magneto sees mutants as the next stage in evolution. <br/><br/>Wolverine was born in the 1880's he has retractable claws and can heal at rapid rates. Played by Hugh Jackman he is a lost man who makes a living as a cage fighter until he's pushed away once more. He meets a girl called Rogue who can cause harm to whoever she touches. They are both welcomed to Xavier's school for the gifted discovering that they are not alone. There are a few nitpicks to mention that won't sit well with everyone - The ending gets a little silly as it has a lame fight scene complete with and a cheesy one liner from Halle Berry's character ""do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning? The same thing that happens to everything else""... And some of the make-up effects look dated. But forget about all that because it's full of interesting characters, a great storyline, a nice music score and some brilliant special effects. X-Men is a film you can sit through again and again."
"minerex-91500","9","0","1","8 March 2018"," A Classic That Holds Up
","Everything about this film is done perfectly. Hugh Jackman surprisingly is great as Wolverine, despite this being his ""odd one out"" performance, and Patrick Stewart is especially memorable as Proffesor X. I also liked the casting decisions of James Marsden as Cyclops and Halle Berry as Storm, but I wasn't a huge fan of how their characters were somewhat underdeveloped.<br/><br/>So basically, the plot revolves around Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen) trying to hunt down Wolverine for some unknown reason, even though SPOILER ALERT: He actually wants Rogue. The biggest problem I have with the plot is that it doesn't make sense to me why Magneto wants Rogue because all she can do is make someone have a heart attack, meanwhile Wolverine has a full skeleton made of adamantium.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, this movie holds up in a dated sort of way because it's an all around 1990s/2000s movie. It's theme still holds true today and I felt that it was presented in the best way possible. Not to mention that"

"fernandoschiavi","7","0","1","30 September 2016"," A worthy introduction to the characters in this new media
","There have been some attempts to adapt comic characters to the big screen. The most successful adaptations so far were certainly Blade: The Vampire Hunter (1998) and Blade II (2000). Subsequently, the first adaptation of X-Men along with Spider-Man (2002), led Marvel to transform his studio Marvel Films in a specific producer to adapt their characters, with distribution of Paramount Pictures. With the granting of the film rights of the X-Men purchased by 20th Century Fox in 1994, scripts and treatment of the film were ordered until finally Bryan Singer - Suspense acclaimed The Usual Suspects (1995) - signed to direct in 1996. X-Men was released to positive reviews and was a financial success, starting the X-Men trilogy and beginning a resurgence of superhero films.<br/><br/>X-Men is a film that, despite all the success made at the box office worldwide, divides opinions. Bryan Singer is an uneven film, but it fully works as a starting franchise. The script, written by David Hayter, is extremely didactic, since the first line of text when explaining about genetics and mutation evolution, even when Professor Xavier explains to Logan (and the public) which is Charles Xavier School for Young gifted, which serves as a front for these young people learn more about themselves and about their newfound powers. Moreover, the characters are constructed of one-dimensional, without further development. All personalities and special powers of each of the characters were very explicit, but it is very little explained in the past of the characters, except with the Vampira character. We get the impression that the film is short (takes just over 90 minutes), nothing is satisfactorily developed and the first hour of life is uneventful, except for a few moments. It is clear that lacked at least thirty minutes dedicated to a better development of these characters and to increase the action scenes.<br/><br/>One aspect in which Singer was largely responsible, was to give the right tone in addressing these characters to the movies. The director tried a story of a superhero group, a science fiction and fantasy film, more seriously and merging and political aspects of our contemporary society in this context special newly discovered super-powered beings. It is precisely this relationship scenes of our society in direct conflict with a new variation of the human race and all moral and philosophical conflicts is this discovery that guide the whole narrative structure of production. The trial of the X-Men by the world's leading authorities and that decision can affect the mutants and Magneto plan that considers humans as a lower stage in the evolution line is a well explored conflict. Synger hit the tone of the story giving a science fiction air and focusing on marginalization of mutant minority, creating an interesting parallel with the struggle of real minorities (such as homosexuals, for example) and the peaceful and respectful coexistence between different religions, political positions etc., bringing an appeal for the production that made possible the identification of the work with your audience. Perhaps for being openly gay and Jewish, the director Singer brought in his heroes the bitter hatred for being excluded from society.<br/><br/>The fans were not disappointed as the relevant visual effects, with the manipulation of particles such as fire, ice, lightning, wind and others. I emphasize here the battle in the train station, the individual struggles of Mystique against Wolverine and Storm against Grocho and the final scene of the Statue of Liberty. Allied to photography Newton Thomas Sigel, costume Louise Mingenbach, John Myhre production designer are in perfect harmony. In the all-star cast, Famke Janssen (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Halle Berry (Storm) are great supporting cast. Already Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen veterans are sovereign in opposition as the leaders of both sides of the mutants, and the highlights are even Anna Paquin (Rogue) and Hugh Jackman, the embodiment of Wolverine, delivering a visceral performance, animalistic and at the same time human. Besides the similarity with the original mutant design, Jackman exudes an undeniable charisma.<br/><br/>What is missing in this production is a grandeur it deserved. Either for lack of a larger budget, either for lack of boldness of the writer and director, the great action scenes only occur even in the final half hour of production. Missed scenes that leave the affected public. Compared to current superhero film, X-Men disappointed by its weak and lacking action sequences of emotion. Moreover, it is clear the aging effects and the soundtrack of Michael Kamen is disappointing. Not far heard a marked trail, differentiated and personality.<br/><br/>Even just using the concepts of comics and the essence of the characters, the production is not very faithful in many ways (after all, the true original members of the team have only Cyclops and Jean Grey, the uniforms were all replaced by black clothes that look military uniforms , etc.), this was certainly a worthy introduction to the characters in this new media and made room for a new niche in Hollywood. From there, the productions coming from HQs dominated movie screens and became the highest grossing in history."

","X-Men (2000): Dir: Bryan Singer / Cast: Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Hugh Jackman, Famke Janssen, Anna Paquin: Visual wonder lacking a plot but the title is curious because ""X"" is the symbol of marked individuals who contain strange powers. Plot regards the war between humans and mutants. These mutants are indemnified by their power because the screenwriter is unable to provide personalities. Much of the film is incomplete. The Senator protesting the mutants suddenly disappears. He undergoes a transformation after his capture and dies as if that matters. Directed by Bryan Singer who previously made The Usual Suspects. The initial problem is that the film seems too pleased with being associated with the comic book as oppose to being a great plot. The cast don colourful costumes but their lives seem pasted into a screenplay bent on throwing them within the middle of action and violence. Patrick Stewart plays the leader who can control minds. Ian McKellen plays a villain who can attract metal objects, and at one point has the police at bay with their own guns. These cops are gifted at overacting. Hugh Jackman plays Woverine who lives in solitude and cage fights. Famke Janssen also appears, etc. Anna Paquin plays Rogue who joins Wolverine in some pointless opening fight scenes. Racial theme is symbolized through mutant characters and the array of visual artistry they possess. Score: 4 / 10"

","X- Men This movie should be called Hugh Jackman the movie as he dominates the film. People idolise Wolverine at the expense of others. Basically the film is the live action version of the comic books featuring mutants with superhuman powers. One group led by Charles Xavier starring Patrick Stewart and the other group by Magneto starring Ian Mckellen. <br/><br/>The potential was there to have more mutants, better character development and a stronger plot. Alas they went with a conventional story about Logan an angry person looking to know who he is. My favourite X- Men was in fact a women Storm played by Halle Berry. Her character was well acted and interesting and the nightmare that was Catwomen had not yet been made. Poor choice in having so few characters and focusing on Wolverine. <br/><br/>On the plus side more X-Men give us the chance of having more characters introduced and having better plots. So let us hope new the films are a lot better."

","A promising start of the X-Men universe on the silver screen, X-Men is a fascinating work of science-fiction & a terrific addition to the superhero genre film. This is the first time I've watched this film & now I'm wondering what the hell actually stopped me from checking this out in the first place. The only other X-Men film I've seen is X-Men: First Class & if it wasn't for its upcoming sequel which brings back the cast from the original trilogy, I wouldn't have bothered to give this one a chance & would've again missed what actually is a pretty good film.<br/><br/>Set in a not so distant future in which few people around the world are mutants; possessing superhuman powers that has also resulted in them being outcasted by the society, it tells the story of two mutants named Wolverine & Rogue who find themselves in between the ongoing battle between two mutant groups; X-Men is led by Professor Charles Xavier; who believes that mutants & humans can co-exist, while the Brotherhood of Mutants is led by Magneto; who believes that humans will never accept the mutants & will always fear them.<br/><br/>The direction by Bryan Singer provides this franchise the kickstart it needed & Singer makes sure that the story is easily absorbed by even those who were never aware of Marvel's X-Men comic books. The writing also is nicely carried out with fine introduction of its mutant characters & is detailed with enough information for the first chapter. The film features a strong cast in Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen, Halle Berry etc but it's Jackman who impresses the most as Wolverine, followed by composed performances from Wilson & McKellen.<br/><br/>The story is nothing great as per se but it does provide the start it needed, the action sequences are nicely carried out although there are few VFX moments that look dated & unintentionally funny now, most of the characters present in the film are intriguing, especially Mystique about whom I would love to find out more. The music however is a let down & the overall production design manages to work just fine. On an overall scale, getting more rights than wrongs, X-Men is an admirable, satisfying & amazingly balanced work that'll manage to grip its audience from start to finish."
"StevePulaski","8","0","1","6 May 2014"," Holds up amazingly well in the face of innovation and standards that refuse to bottom out
","X-Men has been the sole Marvel franchise to exist during the campier and less serious times of the superhero genre and the more serious, ubiquitous times of the genre. In a way, it's difficult to believe the film is fourteen years old, but the franchise it spawned is still going strong to this date.<br/><br/>For a fourteen-year-old film revolving around mutants, genetic modifications, and including seven superheros it needs to acquaint audiences with, X-Men is still much better than anyone probably would've initially imagined. In a shockingly short one-hundred and four minutes, the film manages to give all seven of its heroes some time to shine, while offering us some seriously contemplative political drama on the ethical ideas of allowing mutants and genetically-modified humans to coexist with traditional humans. The result is a pretty intriguing endeavor.<br/><br/>Set in the not-so distant future, we see that the idea of mutants - or those who possess special powers as a result of DNA modifications/mutations - being able to declare themselves through the means of public registration has surpassed issues of gay marriage, abortion, and immigration in the United States Congress. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison) is the leader of this movement, using Congressional hearings as his opportunity to stand on his soapbox and sermonize about how mutant registration needs to exist for the safety and well-being of America.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Professor X (Patrick Stewart) is busy constructing his merry-band of X-Men, or, mutants, in order for them to bring about their own line of vigilante justice. We have Cyclops (James Marsden), with his laser-eyes, Dr. Jean Greay (Famke Janssen), whose telekinetic powers prove limitless in size and scope, and Storm (Halle Berry), who lives up to her name with powers that can manipulate meteorology and weather.<br/><br/>Professor X runs a school called the ""School for Gifted Children,"" where those with unforeseen powers can go and still have their own free will and dignity intact. Two new students with incredible potential arrive at X's school one day; Rogue (Anna Paquin), a shy recluse who discovers that she cannot touch another being without the life of them being literally sucked out of them and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), a muscular individual with retractable claws that sprout from his knuckles. Both contemplate whether or not they should join X's band of X-Men and make an attempt at defeating Magento (Ian McKellen) and his band of loyal comrades.<br/><br/>For a film that works to assemble a barrage of different heroes and utilize them in creative ways, it's sort of admirable how X-Men doesn't get lost in the shuffle. While not each hero bears a great deal of personality, each is humanized to the point where you feel you could at least recognize and find yourself acquainted with them on a basic level. Then there's the fact that despite bearing a lot of heroes in the film adaptation, X-Men had enough heroes for multiple different franchises when it was confined to the captivating, colorful pages of a comic book.<br/><br/>For what it has, and for what writer David Hayter and director Bryan Singer choose to do with it, X-Men manages to be a surprisingly solid, especially given its cluttered array of characters. The film avoids the pitfalls of a dry origin story by not only giving each character time to showcase their powers and utilize them accordingly, but usher in biting political debate about the ethics and value of having a world with known mutants. Toss in some uniformly strong acting, especially by the likes of Jackman, Paquin, McKellen, and Stewart, and you have a strongly-constructed package deal.<br/><br/>X-Men really marks the drastic change in tone superhero films of the 2000's ushered in. The genre that was once looked at as a piece of escapist camp ultimately became one to show people that things aren't forever and that genres can undergo a drastic change overtime. What became of the superhero genre is something to praise and commend, albeit critique in aspects, and this particular pictures serves as a winning time capsule to that enormous revitalization.<br/><br/>Starring: Hugh Jackman, Ian McKellen, Patrick Stewart, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden, Anna Paquin, Bruce Davison, Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, and Ray Park.

The talented actors chosen to play these two characters, Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin, is an interesting choice, and are utilized quite well. Though Mystique doesn't have much of a character, Rebecca Romijn is exquisitely hot as the seductive shape-changing accomplice of Magneto. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are good as the leads of the two sides. Actors like Halle Berry and James Marsden are quite underutilized, and I hated the way the movie undermines Cyclops' character and pays too much focus on Wolverine's; in the animation series, Cyclops is the formidable and admirable leader. I loved the way they show how Rogue's front white hair came about.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a good and interesting start to an amazing Marvel series, which is the most mainstream allegory on the Gay & Lesbian community.

","Before this film the realm of comic book films had been looked at but mostly laughed at, but that all changed with X-Men in 2000 that can be truly heralded as the saviour of comic book films. This film sees two outcast mutants - humans with special powers who are recruited to a school for their kind while a group of enemy mutants are attempting to start the war between Mutants and humanity. Now when we think of the character Wolverine we automatically think of Hugh Jackman and this all started with this film. He portrayed the character of Logan so well with the mixture of tough guy attitude, heart felt moments and quick witted humour providing a great lead for this first film and the many that would follow. The supporting cast do a good job as well with Patrick Stewart doing a phenomenal job as Professor Xavier by really coming across strongly as a good father figure but also powerful, likewise Ian Mckellen as Magneto was great and the delivery of his lines was so perfect that I couldn't imagine anybody else delivering them. Famike Janssen was also really good as Jean Grey, especially with the fact that I find her character quite boring in the comics so that is impressive. The one I am not a huge fan of though is that of James Marsden as Cyclops because they make him really boring and like a boyscout which is totally against his character in the comics. The story was good with Magneto's plot and some of the twists being well thought out, but I feel it would have been better if they had left a certain story arc out of the film that I hate. The script was okay with some of the dialogue being fun and witty or well delivered, but then their are other lines that are just bad and have no place in this film. The style of the film is great with the powers and action scenes really working and providing a solid platform for them to improve which they did.

I also liked how it delivered a message, about how everyone should be viewed as equals, no matter what your condition is. There are a few things that would set the tone for future installments. Wolverine's flashbacks would be told in lengthy detail, with the movie Wolverine. It also has a great love triangle with Wolverine, Cyclops, and Dr. Jean Grey, but Wolverine & Jean's attraction towards each other is subtly hinted at, but that would change. I always thought Anna Paquin was terrific as Rogue. It is kind of a shame that her screen time would decrease with each installment. Hugh Jackman is fantastic as Wolverine. He plays the perfect anti-hero, and is the coolest character as far as i'm concerned. Patrick Stewart oozes class as Prof. Xavier. He was a joy to watch, and his scenes with Ian McKellen were awesome. Ian McKellen is awesome as Magneto. Famke Janssen isn't unstable in this one. She is rather tame, compared to how she would become as Phoenix. I thought she was excellent, though, and drop dead gorgeous. James Marsden fits the arrogant Cyclops to a T. Halle Berry is absolutely beautiful, but she felt a little off at times, as Storm. Tyler Mane does fine as Sabretooth, but I find sabretooth to be insignificant and rather useless. Rebecca Romijn is awesome as the devious Mystique. Wait until you see Wolverine battle himself, when she turns into Wolverine. Bruce Davison is good as Senator Kelly.

Some might consider this a pure popcorn film with mindless action and to those criticisms I say look deeper within the context of the film and you will discover there are several allegories within the context of the story, at its heart it is a tale about hatred and misunderstanding from those that our different than us. It is in this film that Hugh Jackman becomes a household name, his portrayal of the tortured and animal-istic Wolverine is truly the bread and butter of the film. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen have wonderful chemistry as friends turned foes. Singer's direction and pacing of the film are top notch and X-Men is a pure cinematic pleasure, that more then comic book fans can get behind and enjoy."

","Bryan Singer directed this first film adaptation of the popular comic book series that stars Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier, who has assembled various mutants like Cyclops(James Marsden), Storm(Halle Berry)& Jean Grey(Famke Jannsen). Mutant Wolverine(played by Hugh Jackman) befriends fellow mutant Rogue(played by Anna Paquin) on the road, but after a battle with rebellious mutant Magneto(played by Ian McKellen) is brought into Xavier's school for refuge, and to prepare for a greater battle against Magneto's evil mutants, who are planning a devastating attack on the humans, and begin with anti-mutant crusader Senator Kelly(played by Bruce Davison). Exciting and well made film with excellent F/X and memorable characters, all acted uniformly fine by a talented cast. First of a long-running(still going!) franchise."
"MaximumMadness","8","0","1","26 November 2013"," Though perhaps dated by today's standards over 10 years later, Bryan Singer's ""X-Men"" adaptation is still a strong, entertaining and complex thrill ride.
","At this point in time (November, 2013 as I write this) the Comic Book and Superhero have become the world's modern Greek Mythology. And the Comic Book Movie Adaptation is common... in fact, it seems that now we get at least three high-profile films adapted from comics every year. And they are often films of spectacle, quality and excitement for audiences, as studios have finally begun to understand how just incredible, complex and important these superheroes and stories ares.<br/><br/>And there are two films that are often credited with getting the gears rolling on the Comic Book Movie... 1998's ""Blade"" and this film- 2000's ""X-Men."" Both took their source materials seriously and without irony, and both were box-office hits that were also warmly received by fans and critics. They paved the way for later classics like ""Spider-Man 2"", ""The Dark Knight"" and ""The Avengers.""<br/><br/>Bryan Singer directs this stirring, thrilling and often thought- provoking action film from a screenplay by David Hayter.<br/><br/>Set sometime in the near future, mutations have become something of a controversy in the human population- for whatever reason, many people exhibit strange, unique and often dangerous gifts that set them apart from others. We follow two such mutants- a teenaged girl who calls herself ""Rogue"" (Anna Paquin) and an amnesiac loner with a rough, violent side who goes by ""Wolverine"" (Hugh Jackman), whom are both rescued by a team of mutants calling themselves the ""X-Men."" Lead by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), the team aspire to be protectors for human and mutant alike, despite the prejudices they face from the non-mutants. They also fight against the ""Brotherhood""- a dark group of mutants lead by the nefarious ""Magneto"" (Ian McKellen), whom sees war with the non-mutants as their only option left.<br/><br/>This film is very much a large, ensemble film. And this is one of the great successes, as the cast is uniformly magnificent. Jackman, who has sort of become the lead in the entire series, having been given the spotlight in almost every entry, is fantastic as Wolverine. He brings a toughness to the role, but also a curiosity as he is unsure of his past, and even touches of sadness and self-hatred, as well as a touch of humor. Patrick Stewart is phenomenal as Xavier, bringing about both touches of a loving, fatherly figure as well as a fearless leader. McKellen is both frightening and tragic as Magneto, our villain who has become lost due to hatred. And other performances by the likes of Paquin, James Marsden, Famke Janssen, Halle Berry, Bruce Davison and many others are all just a joy to watch. I just unfortunately don't have the space here to properly address everyone.<br/><br/>The production is fantastic. Singer's direction is top-notch, and he is able to balance not only a bit of an origin story for the series, but also the action, pathos, symbolism and themes such as oppression and prejudice. This is definitely helped by a wonderfully crafted script by David ""Solid Snake"" Hayter, which blends together many themes and story lines wonderfully without them stepping over each other or losing focus. Those very themes are a large part of what makes ""X-Men"" work so well- while many superhero and comic-book films have issues for their characters to overcome or be defined by, ""X-Men"" makes the issue larger on a societal level, and the mutant heroes often come across as sort of metaphors for oppressed groups like African Americans, Women, Homosexuals, etc. And it does a lot to aid the film's realism, impact and provocative storyline.<br/><br/>The set and costume design is also a lot of fun. And the musical score by Michael Kamen, while not particularly memorable, is still a wonderfully crafted piece of music that adds mood and atmosphere to the images.<br/><br/>Really, this is just a darned-good film, with a few problems here and there. For starters, although Singer's direction is almost perfect, some of his action-sequences do feel a bit flat. He didn't seem to have too much experience with action prior to this film, so it can be forgiven. My other issues is that the film is perhaps a bit too stylized and therefore in retrospect, a bit too dated for it to be taken quite as seriously as it should be. While it is a well-made film, some of it just oozes ""late 90's, early 2000's"" style and it does sort of hurt the film in retrospect.<br/><br/>But those complaints aside, this is still a good film, and is definitely well-worth seeing and investing some thought into. And the fact that this series is still on-going, with the seventh entry coming next year, it should definitely be a priority film to see if you already haven't.<br/><br/>I give ""X-Men"" a very good 8 out of 10."

","Based on the Marvel comics, this is a great introduction to these characters. And that's the biggest job in this movie for director Bryan Singer. He needed the right actors to play these characters properly in a viable story. The fact that he did it well meant that a new movie franchise is launched.<br/><br/>Of all the actors, the most important ones are Hugh Jackman and Patrick Stewart. Jackman is a find. Before this, he's done mostly Australian TV. That's really lucky. He's not a meathead weight lifter. He's the real deal. Patrick Stewart is the more easier choice. Not only is he Captain Picard, but he's a great British actor with a vast repertoire.<br/><br/>The story itself is a great persecution and outsider story. The characters are already well established and well tested. As long as they had good actors, the good chemistry is almost automatic."

","With X-Men, the super-hero franchises get a push ahead. The setup is similar: superheroes with somewhat weird powers, villains & their confrontation. Although, X-Men has some kind of peculiarity in it that not only appeals but stands out.<br/><br/>I am not surprised by the plot, but the Singer's skill of introducing characters is amazing. With proper balance of story, character depth, CGI, X-Men marks one of the best-ever introductory installation. For one, the cast line-up is appealing. For another, dialogs and humor are proportionate.<br/><br/>But still, it lacks newness and borrows elements from published superhero movies. I am not accusing it, for any superhero movies will look the same.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: A decade later, if the charm of X-Men, evidently, sways in the atmosphere, it definitely gets a head up, ain't it?

","""We are the future Charles, not them. They no longer matter."" – Magneto<br/><br/>Bryan Singer's X-men plagued me with a wealth of interest based on my academic involvement in evolutionary science. It also deals with modern social struggles, superiority complexes among intelligent super-minds, quick-witted one liners and some downright incredible haircuts. This is a fond throwback to one of the key comic book films of all time, which I would argue gave faith to film companies to stick with the genre after some poor efforts in the late 90s.<br/><br/>The story is very simple: the antagonist, Magneto, has built a machine that can force mutations within human beings, at great cost to the operator's strength. By using the machine, powered by young Marie/Rogue (infused with Magneto's metal controlling abilities), Magneto will transform several world leaders and dignitaries, who are gathered on Ellis Island NYC for a peace summit, into mutants. Wolverine, Cyclops, Storm and Jean Grey must stop him, as his device is not only deemed immoral by the X-Men, but they have witnessed the potential for it to kill humans who's cells aren't equipped to deal with forced mutation. It is however, the sub-plot of mutant alienation and criminalisation/ victimisation, and how the mutant characters deal with the shackles placed on them by society, which makes X-Men a complex, original Superhero film, and indeed series.<br/><br/>X-men takes real life issues, such as homosexuality and disability, and places them in a surreal world, where mutants are feared by mankind because they are deemed unnatural by key figures in society. Senator Kelly (Bruce Davison) is that divisive figure in this film. Seeking to instill a sense of fear of the unknown in the American populous, he suggests that mutants could be dangerous, and are national security liabilities unless they can be registered. This causes a reaction within one particular mutant named Magneto, who is ready to initiate war against humans under the Darwinian theory that a species must adapt, or be replaced by a stronger, fitter one. Rather than forcing an entity of pure evil upon us in Magneto, Singer opens the film by showing the torment and evil that has befallen him under mankind; as a young boy he is separated from his parents in a concentration camp, triggering a dormant powerful mutation within him, along with a burning hatred for human beings. McKellen is the perfect Magneto. A man who has lived a life as a member of an outcast community understood the role perfectly, and was even able to offer help to Singer and his crew, understanding the more subtle social issues behind mutants. Equally convincing is his role as an ego-maniacal would-be-dictator.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Magneto's crew fall far short of the mark in representing what he stands for. Sabretooth doesn't have any dialogue, but offers nothing in the way of body language or facial expression to compensate. Toad makes an excellent, resilient fighter, and brings some comic relief to the Brotherhood, but his character just lacks the seriousness needed to fill the gap for the mute Sabretooth and the quiet Mystique. Mystique's make up is astounding, and her character is sleek and deadly in and out of combat. Although later X-men films focus on her a great deal more, she just doesn't get enough screen time or dialogue in the original film to have any real impact in the way that the ""lesser"" X-men do.<br/><br/>The X-Men, under the calm, yet powerful guidance of Professor X. (expertly portrayed by Patrick Stewart against McKellen's Magneto), seek to prevent all out conflict between Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants and man, with a goal to help the two understand one another and live harmoniously. The X-men are portrayed faithfully, but just seem a little diluted, which is a shame as some sparks of on screen chemistry are quite visible, particularly between Wolverine and Cyclops. Hugh Jackman really is the perfect candidate for Wolverine, forgiving him a 12 inch height difference. His accent, facial expressions delivery of both snappy one liners (""What d' they call you? Wheels?""), and confrontational snarls are all in perfect character. Call it teething problems, but his later performances are more naturally aggressive and cantankerous than in this film, but he's easily forgiven, as Wolverine is probably the strongest character alongside Xavier and Magneto.<br/><br/>Cyclops and Jean Grey are both competent on screen, but seem to rely (much like the entire franchise at times) on Jackman's Wolverine to help character development. This also holds true for Storm; her moral deliberation with Wolverine in Xavier's mansion is her most prominent non-battle scene moment in the film.<br/><br/>Rogue is the final main X-man, though she doesn't become fully fledged in this film. Her character is portrayed as an innocent, misunderstood teenager who has a mutation which leaves her feeling isolated from others of both human and mutant kind. Again, her character clings to Wolverine, but far more closely than any of the others. Several poignant scenes are shared between Paquin and Jackman's characters; indeed, Wolverine is the only one who can soothe Rogue's troubled mind when she is most vulnerable, though she did inadvertently almost kill him twice. She, along with Magneto, embodies the ideologies behind the film: isolation, suffering, and alienation from normality.<br/><br/>X-men was a very good film for a time when mainstream audiences were disenchanted with the Superhero genre. The expertise of actors such as Jackman, Stewart and McKellen, an inventive plot dealing with issues beyond just fighting bad guys and personal feuds, and, flaws aside, a passable gallery of superheros and villains immersed in a world where regular humans are an active component in the battlefield gave Hollywood something new, and arguably gave birth to the 21st century comic book film explosion.<br/><br/>X-men (2000)<br/><br/>Allan's Score: 6.5/10"
"Maziun","6","0","1","11 August 2013"," Less than stellar , but still nice
","""X-men"" offers the viewer good special effects , nice action and decent story . The movie suffers from the fact that this is kinda origin story, yet there is too little time to explore the X-men universe . In comic books there is endless time to explore characters and introduce them to reader . Here we get to know only about the few of them – Xavier , Magneto , Wolverine and Rogue. Others like Cyclops or Jean Grey are barely introduced . Some are just instrumental characters like Sabertooth or Storm . The characters aren't too complex , because time doesn't allows for that . Yet , thanks to the actors their likable and memorable. With the exception of Halle Berry as Storm (she seems too young and not too charismatic ) the casting is top notch . Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen seem to be born to play Wolverine , Xavier and Magneto.<br/><br/>There is nice love triangle here and good friendship/rivalry relationship between Wolverine/Cyclops/Jean Grey . Some things were changed here compared to the comic books. Still , the changes were good and logical (such as with the costumes). <br/><br/>The special effects are unfortunately quite outdated by today standards. The whole movie feels like a TV episode - pilot for a TV series instead of epic science fiction action movie. The action is nice , but nothing really spectacular. It feels like Bryan Singer (famous for ""Usual suspects"") doesn't feels confident with them. The story is rather thin and the whole movie really feels more like an introduction to the world of Xmen than anything else. Thankfully , in the sequel the action , story and special effects were improved.<br/><br/>It's one of the first of new wave of comic book movies. It's not one of the best , but not one of the worst either. I give it 6/10."

","The original ""X-Men"" movie has been roundly criticized as deviating too much from the official X-Men canon. I kind of suspect these people are the same ""geniuses"" who leveled the same criticism at Batman, so I will run the following question by you all: suppose that you had some kind of trait that made you extremely different from the rest of the populace. Would you be running around in multicolored spandex, parading around like a hero, or would you be having deep crises about how you react to other people's fear. As a sufferer of a present-day equivalent of the mutations shown in this film, I know what my answer is.<br/><br/>The modification of the story to show Rogue as a young woman who has only just discovered that everyone she touches is severely wounded by it was a master stroke. Not only was it great to see how human the mutants really are (more so than the minorities in this film, as a matter of fact), but casting a delicate, intelligent young woman like Anna Paquin in the role was a perfect capitalization on the writing. Coupling this with the way Wolverine is shown as the result of a horrid military experiment who is now just trying to survive as best he can was a brilliant idea, too. Hugh Jackman was a perfect choice for the role. As a man whose past combines pieces of these two characters' histories in a more figurative sense, I found these two actors utterly believable in all respects.<br/><br/>The only thing wrong with the movie, in my view, is that the think tank which made these excellent moves with the good guys ran out of steam when the bad guys were written. Mystique, Toad, and Sabre tooth just don't have the same level of character development allocated to them as Wolverine, Rogue, Cyclops, and Storm. Mystique gets one line in the whole film (the rest are her pretending to be someone else), and Toad is merely there to provide excuses for gratuitous special effects shots. Capping that off is the fact that Magneto is shown as a survivor of the holocaust who takes on the same kind of attitude as the Nazis. Granted, he is being somewhat provoked by the section of humanity that is afraid of mutants, but once again my experience as part of a small percentile of the populace that has had outright lies told about it by the rest tells me that more motivation would have been required for Magneto to become so like his real enemy.<br/><br/>Aside from the uneven development of the characters, however, this is another near-great modern adaptation of a comic book. It works on numerous levels and is extremely pleasant to watch."

The acting is pretty good, Hugh Jackman makes a great Wolverine and any movie with Halle Berry I believe to be worth watching (except maybe Catwoman). There are more good actors as well including Ian McKellen, who makes a great Magneto, and Patrick Stewart. The directing is good, but nothing to be too excited about. What makes the film good is mostly the special effects and the acting. Not much needs to be explained here, but the effects and the acting are really what make this film great.

"mitchell5954","7","0","1","25 June 2013"," Basic, but Quite Entertaining!
","The first X-Men movie is an entertaining film but an extremely basic film. It is definitely not bad, but it is not great either. I spoiled myself by watching X-Men United first. After watching that brilliant film a number of times watching this film for the first time felt very underwhelming. After watching in a number of times after that I came to enjoy the flick. I also thank the film for helping to open the doors to a long chain of superhero films throughout the 2000s and still going strong. If it was not for this film or the first Spiderman film, we might not have nearly as many superhero films as we have today let alone great ones. However, it is still basic superhero film compared to films compared to later movies like X2.<br/><br/>Most of the cast does a good job. I like most of the characters. The majority of the actors fit their characters perfectly especially Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Patrick Stewart (Professor X). Famke Janssen does a good Jean Grey and James Marsden does a really good Cyclops. One thing that this movie does right that the other after it does not is have Cyclops be relevant. This is the only movie that we get to see Cyclops do anything.<br/><br/>Some actors were miscast though. Anna Paquin does not do a good job as Rogue. I think she would have been better a Kiddy Pride. The character of Rogue in this movie is a far cry from the character in the comics and the TV shows. Rogue is supposed to be a spit-fire. This Rogue is the complete opposite of that. Halle Berry does okay as Storm, but there are plenty of people that could have played the role better.<br/><br/>The villain Magneto is a great in this film. He is played brilliantly by Ian McKellen. McKellen is one of my favorite actors. He does great in every movie he is in whether the movie is good or bad. He got the character of Magneto down to a tee. Magneto is one of the best parts of the film. I like him because he is not really a full villain but more of an antagonist. You feel for him and can see where he is coming from. I even like his ultimate plan in the film. It is really not that bad of a plan if it wasn't for an unfortunate side effect. The other villains are very one-note and not worth talking about.<br/><br/>The score is nothing special. The fight scenes are well done and entertaining. The effects are quite good too. I also love the social commentary the film presents, which X-Men is primarily based around.<br/><br/>Overall, I think X-Men is a decent and entertaining superhero film. If you are a fan of X-Men definitely check it out. However, do not expect anything too deep about the film. Watch X2 for that."

","X-Men (2000) <br/><br/>** 1/2 (out of 4) <br/><br/>Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart) builds a safe haven where mutants from around the world can feel normal among one another. Soon Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Berry) and Rogue (Anna Paquin) must come together when Magneto (Ian McKellen) plans to use some mutants for bad reasons. I don't see why any comic book fan will be disappointed with this film from Bryan Singer as the director manages to make it look extremely good and we're given a nice cast of actors for these parts. If you're looking for action you're certainly going to find plenty of it here and you're even going to get a few laughs along the way. To me this here was a fairly good movie that at least didn't run too long but at the same time it just seemed that the majority of the running time was just letting you get to know the characters as if the filmmakers were just using this here as an introduction film and then the real stuff would take place with the sequels. While this film has quite a bit of stuff going on, the majority of it is just scattered out as the characters try to come to terms with being mutants and of course we're introduced to them and what it's like being someone with special powers. All of this is well and good but I think there's a bit too much time spent on this because after a while you get it. I will say that I enjoyed the cast in their roles with Jackman clearly stealing the film with the angered up Wolverine. Berry was also quite impressive in her costumes if you know what I mean and Rebecca Romijn was extremely good as Mystique. The visuals in the film were quite impressive as well and there's no question that director Singer knows how to stage an action scene including a terrific one early on in the snowy woods."

","I remember looking forward to finally seeing a big Marvel Comics character on the big screen. While I thought the movie was OK, it really felt to safe and a bit like a TV Pilot. The movie actually starts off well and is well shot and until Sabertooth attacks Logan in the woods and we get a sense of what's to come. The major action sequences in the train station and Statue of Liberty are dark/poorly shot and staged as if there was no time to rehearse or train. The movie also feel like it's missing a middle act somewhere to build up to the finale. The highlight of the production design is the X mansions basement levels which do look pretty cool. It's unfortunate that the movie didn't have a larger budget/more time and a more experience crew. It could really have been a big blockbuster instead of an average summer movie."
"zurnd","9","0","1","12 February 2013"," The Film That Got Me In The X-Men Mood
","I have to admit, I wasn't the biggest fan of X-Men growing up in the late 90s early 2000s. I fell more into the crowd of Spider-Man, Power Rangers and Harry Potter fanatics. But then I saw Bryan Singer's X-Men, the live action adaptation of the comic book of the same name. Immediately, I was hooked and since then, I have become a hardcore X-Men buff, watching all the cartoon series (with the exception of Wolverine and the X-Men) and even breezing through some of the comics. <br/><br/>X-Men takes place in a time of mutant discrimination and protesting. On the good side, there is Charles Xavier, the leader of the X-Men who believes that mutants and humans can live together in harmony. On the bad side, there is Magneto, the leader of the Brotherhood of Mutants who believes a war is coming between mankind and mutant kind. Charles and Magneto are very similar to real life civil rights leaders like Martin Luther King Jr. and Malcolm X, and Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen do a magnificent job portraying their respective characters. In my opinion, it's one of Stewart's best roles since Jean-Luc Picard and Ebenezer Scrooge. <br/><br/>In the heat of all this tension and travesty, Xavier's X-Men get themselves into quite a few confrontations with Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants. Of course there are several members on both teams so everyone can have their favorite heroes and baddies. There's the optic blasting Cyclops, the weather witch Storm, the telepathic Jean Grey, the power absorbing Rogue, and of course, the adamantium claw clashing bub, Wolverine. On the enemy side, there is the hairy beast Sabretooth, the long tongued Toad, and the blue, shapeshifting Mystique. All these characters are just as classic in the movie as they are in the comics, although I believe that some of the characters should have had a little bit more character development and a tad more dimension. Some of the acting is wooden, yes, but that's not enough for me to totally despise the movie. It has a lot of things to love, and every time I watch, I find something I have never seen before in previous viewings. <br/><br/>I like to think of this movie as an end of the 90s and the beginning of the 2000s movie, setting the stage for more superhero flicks to follow. X-Men does indeed have some dated elements (like some of the special effects), but when you get right down to it, it's just a fun, entertaining, action packed, high flying thrill ride that has you captivated all the way to the end credits. This is the film that got me into the X-Men mood, and I was pumped up for more, and although the X-Men franchise has had it's share of scrutinized elements, it still has things I go absolutely wild over. Sure X2 and X-Men: First Class came along to take the place of my favorite X-flick, but I always look back at this film and say ""X-Men, what an experience this movie is"". And this would only be the beginning of a new age of superhero silver screen successes. <br/><br/>WE ARE THE FUTURE, CHARLES."

I went into watching the film not to be blown away by anything but at the end of the day, I was pleasantly shocked at how good this movie was. It was fun, it was exciting, it was thrilling, it was lovable and it certainly was epic! <br/><br/>The story of 'X-Men' is that of a group of mutants calling themselves the X-Men who must stand up to another mutant, the evil and powerful Magneto who plans on starting a war between the evil mutants and humanity after Senator Kelly applies a law that hopes to force mutants to reveal themselves to the public. <br/><br/>There were so many things that worked well in the movie. I thought Sir Ian McKellen was easily the standout of the movie and simply every minute of him was a scene stealer. At first, I didn't like Hugh Jackman playing Wolverine and thought he wasn't right but I was glad that I was completely wrong! He was amazing and Anna Paquin as Rogue did a decent job. Patrick Stewart playing Professor Xavier, the almighty mutant was brilliant. <br/><br/>The characters were portrayed very well and I certainly look forward to seeing all the other movies of this franchise.

","Energetic, surprisingly loyal action / adventure with some brilliant casting choices and a tight, cohesive visual style. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen are brilliant choices as Xavier and Magneto, dueling civil rights figureheads on opposite sides of the moral spectrum, but don't get nearly enough scenes together. Of course, Hugh Jackman absolutely defines the role of Wolverine, playing a very clearly defined, potentially cheesy character and pulling it off with vigor. The film's not entirely confident in itself, evidenced by a few hokey plot devices and a handful of godawful lines of comic relief (basically anything that comes out of Halle Berry's mouth), but considering its age and status as the make-or-break point for comic book properties (spoiler: it made) I can overlook a few missteps. Light fun with the kernel of a deeper message nestled beneath several layers of black leather, titanium veneer and bright, colorful effects."
"Wuchakk","8","0","1","10 April 2012"," ""X-Men"" laid the foundation for all the great Superhero flicks to come
","I think the X-Men films have been so popular because the X-Men dare to be different. The concept of the X-Men strays far from superhero conventions. If you approach the X-Men films thinking you're getting something akin to Superman, Spider-Man or Batman, forget it.<br/><br/>The unique concept of the X-Men is that humanity is starting to evolve to the next level and a small percentage of humans all over the globe are starting to manifest superhuman powers from the mutant ""X"" gene. Two mutant leaders, who are old friends, take totally contrasting positions: Charles Xavier starts a school for mutant youths in upstate New York. His attitude is positive and his goal benign. Eric Lensherr or Magneto, on the other hand, is fed up with the paranoia of non-mutants. He starts a ""Brotherhood of Mutants"" with an attitude of superiority. Unfortunately, power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely.<br/><br/>You could say that Xavier takes the approach of Martin Luther King Jr. while Magneto goes the route of Malcolm X, an interesting comparison.<br/><br/>Although everybody has their favorite, I feel all three films in the original trilogy are of the same general quality: ""X-Men"" (2000), ""X2: X-Men United"" (2003) and ""X-Men: The Last Stand"" (2006).<br/><br/>""X-Men"" naturally lays the foundation by introducing the principle characters and the plight of the mutants. Wolverine and Rogue are introduced and slowly develop an interesting big brother/little sister type relationship. They come into contact with both Magneto's Brotherhood and Xavier's school and nobly opt for the latter. Magneto's bunch includes Sabertooth, Toad and Mystique, while Xavier's team includes Cyclops, Jean Grey and Storm, as well as adolescents Iceman and Pyro. Both groups of mutants meet and tussle at Liberty Island in New York Harbor, which is the weakest part of the film, but not bad.<br/><br/>When ""X-Men"" debuted in 2000 it was easily the best comic-to-film adaption since ""Superman"" (1978) and ""Superman II"" (1980). It was the precursor to all the great superhero films that came out in the 2000s and has only lost some of its allure due to the quality of many of those films.<br/><br/>The movie runs 1 hour, 44 minutes with several interesting deleted scenes available.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","26 January 2012"," Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, what can go wrong.
","I have never really liked comic book adaptations all that much because they have always seemed to be to be quite dull. With the exception of Tintin and Asterix I never really got into comic books as a kid, or even as an adult. In particular I never really liked Superman, but when one takes some of these comic books and step back and consider the world in which it is set it begins to take on a new life. Most comic book heroes tend to be incredibly wealthy, and in their spare time they are off saving the world for super villains.<br/><br/>While it can be suggested that this is the case with the X-men, it is actually quite a lot more complicated than that. The Marvel Universe has three types of people. There are the normal humans, like you and I. Then there are the heroes, normal people who during their life have gained some form of superpower (such as Spiderman when he was bitten by the radioactive spider) and finally there are the mutants, people born with superpowers. It is these mutants that this particular film explores.<br/><br/>The setup is complex. First of all you have the humans than fear the appearance of these mutants, and because of the powers that they possess, they are threatened, and as such are looking for ways to restrict and control these people that are appearing. Then there are the mutants themselves, divided into two opposing camps. There are the X-men, who are lead by Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart), and they seek to protect and defend humanity, only using their powers for good. Then there are the mutants who follow Magneto (Ian Mackellan) who believe that because of their powers they should rule humanity. There are mutants that do not follow either of these two philosophies, but in this film it is these three groups that are fighting against each other.<br/><br/>The movie opens with Rogue about to kiss her boyfriend, only to discover that when she does so she drains all of the life out of him, so she is forced to flee. Running to north Canada, she falls in with Logan (Hugh Jackman) otherwise known as Wolverine. After convincing him to let her travel with him (he is a loner), they are attacked by mutants who are loyal to Magneto, but the X-men arrive in time and take them back to the Xavier's School of the Gifted (the X-men's base). It is from there that we begin to learn of Magneto's plan to cripple humanity and pave the way for a mutant takeover.<br/><br/>The question with this film is the continuity. While this is the first film in the series, there are films that occur before hand, such as Wolverine. In that film we discover that Wolverine and Sabretooth are brothers, but that does not seem to come out in this film. However, Wolverine has lost him memory (we don't know how that happened at this stage), but when he is told about Sabretooth, it seems to jog his memory slightly. As for Sabretooth, at the end of Wolverine he cries out 'nobody kills Wolverine but me!'. In this film this is suggested, particularly when Sabretooth takes a particular interest in Wolverine's dogtags.<br/><br/>When one stands back a bit, and considers the movie as a whole, it really comes down to Magneto having a plan to make him more powerful and to rule over humanity, and the X-men going out to beat them. However, one thing that was a little disappointing was how easy it was to kill Sabretooth. He got blasted with a laser, and that was it. However, in Wolverine he was much harder to kill. He had claws, and like Wolverine, he could regenerate. We see none of that here, however one probably does have to consider the comics a bit more, something which I really do not have the time of inclination to do. However, while the plot may be a little dull, it is the background (as well as having some heaps cool actors) that attracts me to this film.<br/><br/>There is also the issue of discrimination, and I guess it is a thing that we all need to confront. Discrimination is something created by fear. We fear that we are going to lose our place in the world, and because of that we will discriminate against another race. I remember in the 80s in Australia when the target of discrimination were the Asians, and it is true that the Asians are much more populous than us. We fear that by letting a few in, they will then flood in, and we will lose our identity and power in our country. It is the same fear that rules humanity here. Despite the X-men seeking the best for humanity, humanity fears them, and this is because it is clear that the mutants are so much more powerful than us. Discrimination is actually a theme that seems to not only run through all of the movies, but through all of the comics as well (though Wolverine has a somewhat different theme running through it, as does First Class)."

","The Xmen was one of the first of the decade long superhero revivals. It stands as one of the best and in many ways is a benchmark for most Superhero films. A lot of the action choreography will be (and has been) copied by many others. What I find most intriguing about this film is that despite the number of superheroes and villains, the film does not rely on a sequence of continuous bangs, flashes and superhero 'power dissipation' to keep the audience glued, the action is perfectly and often quite finely balanced. Another great feature is that it is often quite a challenge getting a good meaningful performance from a number of big actors brewed together into a blockbuster, that isn't the problem in this case, the performances are perfectly measured and significant nevertheless. In short, this is a good solid family blockbuster entertainment which may yet become quite timeless."

I really don't know (am not willing to investigate)who came up first with the idea of a ""special school for 'gifted'"" and why is everybody so obsessed with supernatural powers. In today's world being simply a bit more intelligent compared to average population makes one very, very special. Of course, only a few (rich) get the chance to develop their intelligence and contribute to the ""rest of the society"", basically packed with idiots. Nevertheless, the movie is pretty well done, considering ""the template"". Good directing, appropriate ""acting"" (casting could be better, though, at least for the supporting roles), sfx and the rest of technical aspects. As well as the other movies in the series (2 and Last Stand), it's a good entertainment. Don't expect too much (if you do, watch the ""prequel"": First Class) and have fun.

"veerazeguet","Null","0","1","6 August 2011"," A good intro movie. An action pack movie that you will forget in two days but does its job
","Rating: 7.5<br/><br/>X-Men is an introduction to the iconic characters from the comic book that has been around for more than 30 years. It tells the story of two mutants, Rogue and Wolverine, who are recruited by Professor X to fight the terrorist group led by an old friend, Magneto. <br/><br/>X-Men is the first film of the X-men franchise. It shows the audience who the X-Men are, what they are, why they do what they do, and who the archenemy of the X-men is. And that's all it really is, an introductory movie with fun and entertaining action sequences that provides background information on the characters. <br/><br/>As for performances in this film, everyone was cast perfectly in their respective roles. This is the role that brought the Aussie actor, Hugh Jackman, to the world's attention. He shined in this film as Wolverine. He brings Wolverine to life not with just his iconic looks as Wolverine but with superb acting. Others also gave good supporting performances that helped Hugh Jackman carry the movie to perfection. These actors include Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellen (Magneto), Famke Janssen, (Jean Grey), James Marsden (Cyclops), Halle Berry ( Storm), last but not least Anna Paquin who portrayed the young mutant Marie aka Rogue who ran away from home and hit the road with Logan aka Wolverine. A special mention to the writers of this X-Men who transferred the comic book to a fun action pack 90 minute movie. X-Men deals with important elements that good storytelling includes rejection, loneliness, hope, fear, distrust, love, selfishness, power, and doing what you believe is right.<br/><br/>In conclusion, X-Men succeeded what the movie set out to be; a good intro movie. This movie explains why Magneto is the person he is, or why Professor X is against what Magneto does. Now seeing this after watching X-Men – First Class, it's so fascinating to see the relationship between these two characters after what happened in X-Men First Class, how they disagree with each other's opinions but still have great respect for each other. <br/><br/>I can't deny that X-Men a fun time but it's the type of movie that you would forget in a couple of days. It's a good action flick and I had fun watching it. However, I felt like X-Men could do some work with the soundtrack which not only was it not memorable, it also reduced the intensity of the action scenes. If you're looking for incredible acting and superb dialogues I wouldn't recommend X-Men to you. But if you just want a good thrill ride to entertain yourself, definitely check out X- Men."

","Adapting X-Men (XM) is a hard task because there are so many teams and so many visions. Here, the production chooses its own path and comes to a great result: if the movie is original, they have captured the soul of XM and the flavor of hundred comics! XM is really that: evolution, political issue with humans, outcast and the dream of Professor X. Say like this it's seems very serious but the strength of Marvel (unlike the Direct Concurent) is that the philosophy is mixed with humor. Here, thanks Wolvie to be so funnily rebellious! <br/><br/>Next, if Spiderman could only goes for the red and blue suit, it was more difficult with XM. Thus, the futuristic and uncluttered design of the movie is a good idea. I like how the X motif appeared throughout the sets and props, especially the wheels of Pr. X. Locating the showdown at the statue of liberty is brilliantly symbolic.<br/><br/>Next, the cast is extraordinary: they are really like their penciled parts and the mix between newcomers (Jackman, Paquin) and old crew (Stewart, Jansen, McKellen) blends totally.<br/><br/>In conclusion,it's great to realize that all the movies we make reading those comics have also been shared by a true filmmaker.

"filmfreak-ochoa23","9","0","1","8 June 2011"," Good movie especially after seeing First Class
","X-Men- 2000 The movie that treated the comic book properties seriously still stands the test of time and it is comparable and matches perfectly with the recent X-Men First Class. Starting with the powerful introductory scene with Erik Lensher being forcefully introduced to his power in the form of anguish and pain that is comparable to any emotional scene from The Pianist or Schindler's List, this is a very good start. Logan and Rogue's relationship carries the movie because of their similarities of being outcasts and very good performance on both of their part when they are together. However, Paquin does come off a little dry when she is without her co-star Jackman though, but this is just nitpicking. The score is excellent and dramatic when it needs to be, especially at Magneto's defeat, pure epicness. Logan and Scott's bantering is hilarious with humor that is subtle but always hilarious. I personally criticized the film by stating that powerful characters such as Storm or Jean should never be intimidated by a weak mutant like Toad, but seeing it with closer examination, it makes sense how he caught them by surprise and Storm looks completely bad-ass when she rises out of the elevator, granted she does state one of the worst lines in movie history to Toad being ""What happens to a toad when he gets struck by lightning""? ""The same thing that happens to everything else"" Ridiculous and unnecessary, also it kills off the climax of seeing Storm at her peak. Charles and Erik feel like they have been friends for a long time and have genuine respect for one another and the scene at the end in the plastic prison summarizes their rivalry by comparing their battles to a chess match between old friends. This is especially resonant if you have seen X-Men First Class, as this film perfectly matches the friendship between the two as McAvoy and Fassbender were as powerful as Stewart and McKellen. Overall, the movie is definitely worth buying and is a nice companion to First Class to which they tied it nicely to this movie. Another flaw that has to be pointed out is the fact that Magneto does not seem to have that powerful essence when he used his power since he was not being as menacing when he controlled the guns for instance, he just stood there and bantered with Xavier for a while. Probably because I could not help but compare him to Fassbender in X-Men First Class who completely dominated that movie as Magneto, so I'm going to have to say that McKellen makes a better Magneto when he is planning or more of a behind the scenes villain, especially when he is with Xavier and they feel as if they have a history."
"Hocklife","7","0","1","29 May 2011"," Enormous Undertaking
","Background<br/><br/>Let me begin by saying I've never read a single X-men or better yet any Marvel comic book when I saw this film. Having no die hard fan anger over the liberties taken on this first installment of the franchise , I found this film to be good and in some parts even great. The story is about people with mutated dna ( mutants) having special powers that differentiate them from society and label them outcasts. There are three sides to the conflict in Xmen . The mutants who see themselves as the next stage in the evolution of humanity and believing they should rise up and seize the power of the world (revolution). Then there's the mutants who feels they should work with humanity towards some sort of common ground ( peace). The last aspect of the conflict are the humans who are afraid of the capabilities of mutants powers. <br/><br/>Story/ Characters<br/><br/>Xmen lives and dies primarily by its characters in this movie. While many different people are brought to the table only a select few are given any depth. The two chief characters that carry the weight of the film are Magneto ( Sir Ian Mckellen) and Wolverine ( Hugh Jackman). Magneto being the mutant supremacist leads to his group called the Brotherhood trying to take the power from humanity. Wolverine is a loner with living in Canada who can't remember his past. Coming across a special school for mutants ( Xmen) he begins to become an activist in the mutant conflict of the world . There are many many more characters introduced during this movie ( so much so that it seems to be its entire purpose) that many are left undeveloped in turn making them less interesting. Overall very well done with what they had to work with and setups possible plots and subplots for the sequels. <br/><br/>The story easily being the weakest component of this movie should only be an after thought in the mind's of the viewer. What sounds like a cheap comic book story Magneto and his group of badies built a convenient machine that can turn all people it affects into defective mutants. Naturally it is the Xmen's job to stop them. I don't want to write to much on the flaws of the story because it will diminish the already feeble attempt to make a good story more.<br/><br/>Miscellaneous<br/><br/>This section is for all aspects of filmmaking I haven't covered yet. The acting in Xmen is well done Magneto Proffesor X ( Patrick Stuart) and Wolverine really standout for me in the film mostly due to their very different opinions on the overall conflict. The director handles the movie well never letting it get to boring and his shouldn't be taken for granted since its an introductory story into a much larger world. The action sequences are surprisingly weak and only one or two scenes ever standout in the whole thing. The special effects were good for their time and don't really feel that dated with the exception of the mutant shape shifter mystique. The setting and atmosphere of the film is pretty large with a worldwide conflict focusing on the issues of minorities and the different ways to handle a problem (through revolution or peace) . With the exception of the story nothing feels cheesy and it all seems rather believable because of solid acting across the board.<br/><br/>Final Opinion<br/><br/>There was so many ways I could see this film failing from the artistic taste of the costumes to the special effects not holding up. Surprisingly though this film does work and at times it works very well. This is a character driven film not story! I can't stress enough how silly I find the first Xmen's story , between that and the action are the only reasons I didn't give this film a higher rating. Overall the varying array of characters saves this movie with their uniqueness although some don't get enough screen time. Another twenty minutes of building a firmer base and understanding of the different Xmen would have done this film well not just snap shot glimpses. <br/><br/>Final Rating 7.2 /10"

","I remember when this movie came out in France, some ten years ago, my brother was truly a fan of those X-Men and he would regularly talk with me about them, especially ''Wolverine''. Ten years later, I decided solemnly to watch the movie and guess what, I liked it. Though the plot is very simple, the action is far more better, as well as the dialogs, so that you cannot be bored all the film long - which is only 90 min. long ! Besides the FXs are not aging; of course, you can easily pinpoint them in the course of the movie but really, that is no pain in the ... The question that I asked after I saw this movie was : who on earth is Wolverine ? I used to read the comics, but I was surely too young to understand. For what I remember, the characters are pretty close to the comics - except the disguise; I particularly liked the Mystique character who is, to my mind, very well-done knowing that she probably was the most difficult superhuman to release, I mean, physically (you can see the make-up in several shots.) The only criticism that I may add to this review is that the end is too prompt while I hoped to learn what had happened to Mystique, Sabretooth... and Toad; that is probably the reason why I am going to watch the sequel tonight. If you have not seen the movie yet and it turns out that you hesitate to watch it (or buy it for Christmas?), do it, you will be entertained for sure!

","Three years had gone since the disastrous Batman & Robin. The movie had destroyed the Batman movie franchise and still today the low point of comic book movies. Then the genre was back on its feet with this smart and serious yet also fun and entertaining film. First of all the cast has been chosen with great respect for the characters. Hugh Jackman is spot on as the beer-drinking savage anti-hero Wolverine, Patrick Stewart is the one and only Professor X, Ian McKellen is wonderful as Magneto and Famke Janssen isn't half bad as Jean Grey. But great actors won't work without a solid screenplay and while the movie does have minor plot holes the story is unpredictable and well paced enough to keep you invested. Of course some characters have not enough time to develop in an hour and a half movie but that's OK because then the movie would have been much to slow. Director Bryan Singer is obviously aware that the comics themes of fear of the unknown is to be taken seriously but there is also a touch of humor and self-irony that makes X-men deliciously self aware. It doesn't really have that many action scenes but those there are really do entertain. All in all a great achievement for comic book movies."

After getting a little older and watching it a few more times it grew on me. I now recognize this movie as a classic superhero film that helped pave the way for other comic book movies.<br/><br/>The X-Men movie does away with the colorful costumes of the comics in favor of all black suits. For what this X-Men film was trying to do I actually think changing the costumes was the right way to go. The X-Men film was covering some pretty serious themes and the colorful costumes would have taken away from the seriousness. X-Men has just the right tone, seriousness, and believability to work. The plot focuses on the war between mutants and regular humans with Professor Xavier trying to make peace and Magneto trying to fight against them. The acting is a huge part of why this movie works. Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier and Ian Mckellen as Magneto was the best casting choices that could have been made. Both men brought so much to their characters. Hugh Jackmon as Wolverine was also probably the best casting choice that could have been made. Hugh was fantastic as Wolverine! <br/><br/>The downfall of this film is the lack of screen time for some of the characters such as Cyclops and Jean Grey. They try to make us care about Wolverine being in love with Jean Grey but we don't know her enough to really care. Cyclops is the most important X-Men in the comics and he barely has anything to do in the movie. Anytime he is on screen there doesn't even seem to be a purpose other than he's there because he was in the comics. Another downfall is that the movie lacks that epicness that it could have had. Although it's a cool movie and it entertains, the movie does leave you kind of disappointed. It ends with a generic battle against the bad guys and nothing about the mutant rights is ever resolved. <br/><br/>X-Men is very important to the superhero and comic book movie genre. Overall X-Men is certainly missing that certain something that could have made it great, but it's still a good movie. And it is a great set up for X2."

","Mutants are feared and hated, they have special abilities that humans don't. Magneto is a mutant who believes a war is brewing between mutants and mankind, so he sets out to turn everyone into a mutant. Professor Xavier and his team of X-Men believe mankind is good and can live peacefully with mutants, they must stop him.<br/><br/>There have been many comic book films before X-Men, the most notable ones are Superman and Batman, yet there have even been lesser known comic book characters getting their big screen debut before the mutants. Tank Girl, Blade and The Crow all got their chance and they did pretty well (well, maybe not tank girl) but I think it was X-Men that kick started this wave of comic book films that we have today. 2 years later we got Spider-Man and then every other film coming out was based on a comic book. X-Men, ten years later, still remains to be one of the better adaptations.<br/><br/>The key role in the success of this film was the casting choices. Patrick Stewart as Professor Charles Xavier is not only a stroke of genius, but the most obvious choice. Newcomer Hugh Jackman gives us a dead on portrayal of Logan aka Wolverine and since this film has become a superstar in Hollywood, even getting his own film, X-Men Origins: Wolverine. Ian McKellen plays the villain Magneto and even though his physical appears make him appear fragile, his use of speech and demeanor make him terrifying in a unique way, you believe that he is as dangerous as they say. <br/><br/>Being a big fan of the comics, I was anticipating this film with a big smile on my face. I liked it then and as I mentioned earlier, it still holds up today. There are some shoddy special effects that jump out at you more now than ever, but as a whole, this comic book adaptation hits the right notes. Bryan Singer uses homosexuality as a comparing theme for mutants. Being a homosexual himself, he seemed to be able to portray the issues of separation and isolation that mutants feel. This is further explored in the sequel.<br/><br/>I can help but feel that by the film's conclusion, they could have gone a little bigger. The conflict between Sabretooth and Wolverine is not as engaging as a fan of the comics would want and the changing of Rogue into the Jubliee character from the animated series might rub some people the wrong way. Sabretooth is not as vicious as he could be and Rogue is an annoying teenage girl. <br/><br/>X-Men is a good film that is shy of being great. Everything that was mishandled here was made right in the sequel. X-Men proved that comic book films can be smart and not just for fans/geeks who collect comics."

","X-Men (Bryan Singer, 2000) is a superior comic book yarn, thanks to intelligent writing and deft characterisation, alongside the whizz-bang thrills. Anna Paquin is Rogue, a teenage girl who goes for her first kiss and leaves the recipient in a coma. She's one of a breed of mutants left with powers they can't control after a leap forward in evolution. Allying herself with a fellow mutant, cage fighter Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), Rogue is taken under the wing of Professor Xavier (Patrick Stewart), who wants to forge a peaceful future for mutants and humans alike. Unfortunately his old ally Magneto (Ian McKellen) thinks a war is brewing and is keen to get in some pre-emptive strikes, ideally using the super-powers of Xavier's students. The film has its shortcomings, relying too heavily on CGI effects – which date very quickly and don't really have the requisite movie magic – and failing to flesh out several minor characters. But it's a very well-scripted, engaging film: sometimes funny, frequently touching and with impressive star turns from Paquin and Jackman."

","I'll admit I'm not one for origin stories. Even with the original Superman: The Movie, Iron Man and the rebooted Batman Begins, I'm thoroughly impatient for them to get to what I came/paid for to see: the character in the suit. That said, I enjoyed every minute of X-Men. Even the Nazi intro.<br/><br/>I don't even know how they could've made these characters any more interesting. Especially Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who seemed to fit perfectly in those claws. And though most of the superheroes were younger, the main characters were much older – a rarity in superhero movies. That was refreshing to see more of an adult and comic book adventure.<br/><br/>Dr. Xavier (Stewart) has taken the high road in educating young runaway mutants at his school while his old pal, Eric or Magneto (McKellen) curved left and wants to prove to the world mutants are the next big thing, by any means (he feels) necessary. Pretty much both were at opposite ends of the same goal: mutant acceptance. Unfortunately, this is an age-old story of true life wars on racism and homophobia, and it never seems to end. Here, in X-Men, at least we can enjoy an adventure movie while learning tolerance.<br/><br/>I definitely liked both characters, and Stewart was perfect for his role. But, McKellen was delicious as the deep Magneto. He played the ""bad guy"" as not so bad, if you pull back the layers.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, we have a least a dozen other characters, all given a perfect amount of time to develop and make us care who lives or dies. Wolverine, a personal favorite of mine, probably has the biggest background (so much so, they continue his journey into his sordid past through 2 sequels and a spin off. Enough already!) but it's also the most interesting this time around. The weakest is Rogue (Paquin) and, like Wolverine, they stretch out her story to the thinnest level in sequels to come.<br/><br/>While some of the characters were as weak as Rogue – namely Cyclops (Marsden), most were awesome to watch and even better on how each person's power and personality fed off each other to further the plot along.<br/><br/>And speaking of whichMagneto has developed the power to make us mortals into the evolved mutants and plans to use a summit to prove mutants are superior. It's the X-Men to the rescue! Though the movie had a decent budget, it almost felt like they held back a little, avoiding some of the more popular X-Men characters so they could test the waters, obviously for further installments. That was probably the movie's biggest flaw. They didn't do that with Superman: The Movie or Batman. Thankfully, the film was a (deservedly) hit and they were able to expand.<br/><br/>This movie is highly recommended. Great action, score, acting, depth, originality anda message! I would even say to see it for non-comic book fans. If they ever make a Justice League movie or The Avengers, let's hope it's even a 1/10 of how great this movie was."

","At first, I did not really care for this film because it was not true to the comic book story. But an old friend of mine gave me some advice: ""Just take it as a story from a different point of view."" Once I did that I really found this movie to be quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>The overall story is probably a little sub par. In comparison to ""X2"" and ""The Last Stand"" it is by far the weakest of the three. <br/><br/>Where there are now four X-Men titles out, we are accustom to the actors in the roles that they play, but when this originally came out I was astounded at the near spot-on job that they did with the cast. From Wolverine to Professor X to Magneto, I feel as though they did a wonderful job getting the characters to look like who they are supposed to be. And then there are new renditions such and the visually interesting Mystique. <br/><br/>However, that being said, I feel that they really missed the boat on Sabertooth, and to a lesser extent, Rogue. There could have been better actors to play each part and the character of Sabertooth could have definitely been more interesting. On a side note, they didn't get it right in ""X-Men Origins: Wolverine"" either. <br/><br/>The action was cool and had they not had to spend time with character introductions they might have had more time to develop a better story, but for what it is it's a good movie to see to get you amped up for the superior sequels that follow."
"Acolin_f","7","0","1","30 August 2009"," the audience is left siding with the evil Magneto
","I am not a fan of the comic book – never read it that I recall. But one of the things that bothers me is the role changes they made in the movie.<br/><br/>The professor is abrupt with Wolverine, defending his mind games with gorgeous Jean – which apparently lead her to the dark side of the force. This sets us up for his demise. We are disappointed, especially since new students with new abilities and problems coming to his school would be an ideal setting for continues the series, but not sad. In the previous X-Men movie, the evil Magneto wants the mutants to dominate the world because of their superior powers. This cause is muted in this movie. Instead the evil Magneto is merely fighting for humane treatment of mutants. One can't help but feel that he is right: a majority of mutants will choose the cure (except for those who excel at sports, entertainment and finance) and become normal. Not only that, but he is right about society too. At first, it will pressure young mutants to conform. When they don't and more mutants dominate the lucative industries, society will force the cure upon them. So in this movie, the audience is left siding with the evil Magneto, instead of the democratic Professor.<br/><br/>The best of the 2006 movie season may be upon us, for it is far too early for even whispers of what Hollywood contenders for the golden Oscar await us. Three very good blockbusters fill the start of summer for action movie lovers. The only other big action movie left to make the season that comes to mind is the painted face of Captain Jack Sparrow. (Ok, Superman with Kevin Spacey as the evil Lex Luther might be good.) So far each of these thrillers provides the goods. While not better than King Kong or Lord of the Rings, none of them was worse either. They are not too long or too blurry with CGI effects. Therefore, it is hard for me to pick a favorite among them.<br/><br/>The superstar status of Tom Cruise and modern weapons of MI3 provides a worldly edge to the first. The fantastic scope of powers and sights provides the hook in the comic book world of the last (think so?) X-Men.<br/><br/>Kurt Russell is on a roll, with what two, three movies in a row? This only proves what women know so well. Their shelf life is short. No more so shorter than in the blink of Hollywood's eye, while the staying power of men's graceful aging endures. In Poseidon, Russell and Josh Lucas, whose name I will now remember, give memorable performances in a fresh, gripping remake of the watery adventure.<br/><br/>Because some new movie theaters do have larger screens and sometimes slightly better sound than big ole horn systems, each of these thrillers rate 7-8 $s on my dollar scale: worth the price of theater admission. This scale also includes the lower cost of rental, and that is true. I think this trio is worth renting at the video store, but if I were the producers, I would not be rushing them into stores just yet.<br/><br/>Ownership? Well, I am not the one to ask. As much as I enjoy the thunder of Master & Commander, Total Recall and U-571 again and again for my reviews, I generally prefer to watch even mediocre new fare over a repeat costing several times the price."

","X-Men is a decent comic book film. Not quite as good as some of the ones we have nowadays, but I still think it's a good film. I didn't even think it was the best in the series. I preferred X2. X-men is from director Bryan Singer, who has done some damn good films. Like The Usual Suspects. Singer does a good job with the first two films and should've stayed with this series. Instead, he left the X-men films for Superman Returns, which wasn't so good. I found that film irritating, and too long. None of the X-men films are that long, and they kept my interest. The X-men are cooler, more unique, and more interesting than Superman. A big chunk of the X-men are interesting, like Wolverine, who had an unexplained cast until his prequel came out. I also like Rogue(Anna Paquin). Mystique(Robecca Romajn-Stamos)is sort of sexy, but kind of blue. I even think that Magneto(Ian Mckellan) even though he's an evil bastard. I can't quite understand why he's evil, though I feel sorry for him because he was in a concentration camp. X-men is a well made comic book film that deserves more credit than it's received. It isn't quite the best in the series, but it's a good entry. I won't go into much detail with the plot, but I think X-Men is definitely a recommendation."

","This film is based on the lives of America's greatest heroes the X-Men, men and women who were both experimented on and exposed to radioactive radiation and subsessfully their cells changed them into freaks. The American government ran these tests in secrecy in the hope to make an army of super soldiers who could attack the Germans and French in the First World War between 1970-1952. The Government hoped to give one man the powers of a spider, one the powers of a bat, one the powers of a superintendent etc. Of course things went wrong and they all escaped into hiding. The natural human DNA meant that good people stayed good and didn't want to fight the English, while the bad humans went worse and decided to gang up and destroy the world. This is why there are bad and good guys. Any time you see a film or book or TV with goodies and bad guys it is because of this incident, known as the Holy Resolution. This was mostly a secret until one of the robots (Auptocop I think) befriended a young boy called Stanley and told him his story. Stanley decided to write comics for a living when he grew up, and thus comics were born.<br/><br/>The X-Men is one of Stanley's most famous and least known works having been turned into a book, a play, an ice theatre, a series of TV series and a series of movies. There have been countless toys, posters, Cd's featuring all our favourite X-ers singing in their favourite styles- Wolfy sings Death Metal, X-Wafer sings Morissey covers, Storm sings Naked R'n'B, Jean Gay just cries for 3 minutes, Gandalf does prog-country, Rogue sings Blues songs about rapin' and a killin', Ham-bit does reggae, Debbie does Dallas, and Memento sings old Shakespeare bits but in rapping couplets. You get the idea. Of course there are plenty of action figures and other junk; top tramps playing cards, vehicles, games for your home video game entertainment computer system (the one for the Nintendy Segi-box in 1984- a rolling beat you up is a particle favourite), posters, bed quilts, condoms featuring Humphry Jackman's face on them, bubbly gum, guns, gum shields, gun shields, paint, ladders, mp3 players, diapers shaped like Captain Jean Luc Pickal's head, phones and answering machines, and of course staples.<br/><br/>This is the first movie based on the comic which was based on the real events of the second World War which was in turn based on the Vietnam war. Stanley pops up in the film as a young boy being crushed to death by a tree (sadly this actually occurred and Stanley is still alive). The film shows some of the histories of some of the main characters, but I was quite annoyed that Superman wasn't in it. He could have just punched all the bad guys across to India! Anyway, Magenta wants revenge for something that happened once and he tries to recruit Wolfy and Raque as they are very strong. He wants as many X-Men as possible so that he can turn the Statue of Liberty into a giant Sentinel which will then crush all the cities of America meaning he will become rich and indestructionable. Some of the fights and excitements here are second to none, second only to the second film which has scenes which are second to none, except when comparing them to those in the first. The fight on top of Her Majesty Liberty is a good, and when the statue comes alive and walks through New York it look like nothing can stop them. She eventually climbs the Entire State Building and is about to eat everyone inside when Slimer (being carried in Rogue's bra) jumps out and leaves a trail of slime around the top so Liberty loses her grip and falls into the ocean, carrying all the bad X-ers with her. Hooray! But will they return for a sequel? Probably not! One extra note- the music here is very good, written by Jon Willyams and merging his previous scores from other superhero movies like Big, Transformers, and The Princley Bride.<br/><br/>Best Scene: When Wolfmarine is fighting Beastor with trees- it's like Croucing Tiger, Hiding Lager but with 200 foot redwoods being swung around instead of swords. It is truly a sight to behead!"

","I'm too young to have ever read, or even had a glimpse at, any marvel comic, so I watched this movie having no clue about the X-men or their story. I only had other super hero movies to compare to, such as Spider-man and Fantastic Four.<br/><br/>X-men, in my opinion, doesn't compare to the other marvel films out there. Its a film on its own, not your average comic book adaption. It has more action than you could wish for, a brilliant cast of actors, and seems to have everything and more.<br/><br/>Other super-hero movies out there have a very 'power rangers' feel to them I feel, which make them too young and they hold back from the hardcore action we want to see, but X-men doesn't shy away from the violence, the occasional swearing, and the pure emotion and sense of actual danger and mystery that other super hero movies miss out on.<br/><br/>There is a real sense of threat throughout, which makes it so much more enticing and entertaining.<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it, from start to finish, each character was given their own part to play, their own meaning and given pretty much an equal amount of screen time, which I know the sequels ever so slightly lacked.<br/><br/>For the first in the trilogy, an excellent movie that I can easily watch again and again and not tire of.

","I've always enjoyed watching comic book and comic strip characters ""come alive"" on screen whether TV or movies. Even the cheesy serials of the 1940s & 50s were wonderful to watch as kids. With Spider-Man, and now X-Men, this genre has been reborn. As for X-Men, I couldn't agree more with the superlatives used by reviewers here. Brian Singer has given this film energy, style and class, sophistication, believability and he has raised the genre to a new level. Not being a previous X-Men follower I can say with honesty that he introduced us to the many X-Men characters and their world superbly and told a terrific story to boot. What a challenge that had to be! The cast is so perfect, from Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) on down to Sabretooth (Tyler Mayne) who we'd like to see more of. The special effects are absolutely dazzling, the music score, cinematography, everything is so perfect. Singer and his cast have made these complex characters believable and that alone is astounding. Kudos must go to Stan Lee (who has a cameo in the film), the genius behind X-Men and the Marvel Comics empire. Now his unique imagination can be shared with movie-goers. Even better is the fact that this is just Part 1 of a trilogy and hopefully there will be more X-Men films to come."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","8","0","1","3 May 2009"," The core is intact
","I base this on the 1.5 DVD. One option of that is to watch this with six extended scenes(that add character moments, and vary in quality) and 17 behind the scenes segments(that all automatically come on at their specific times), and I don't believe you can view any of these 23(all of which last between 30 seconds and several minutes) without also seeing the film. This brought graphic novels back onto the silver screen, and proved to/reminded us that they can be excellent, after Joel Schumacher took unsuspecting theater-goers back to some of the worst of the 60's(the colors, man!). Taking a note from Burton's two Batman entries, Singer, who is, by the way, clearly very talented, and completely made this thing come together, chose to make the costumes less showy. In general, he made it a lot more realistic, and, whilst keeping the point as sharp, the theme as poignant, as it should be, made this accessible to a much larger audience. Those who have never opened a comic book, while they won't quite ""get"" everything, will still be able to understand and enjoy this. The biggest issue in this, honestly, the whole series of movies, is the amount of people. There are too many, and most of them get so little time and development, their personalities are as two-dimensional as the drawings, instead of as layered as they are, at their best, on those same pages. This probably should have been a TV series, or at least a mini, but maybe there aren't enough out there who'd sit down for that... meanwhile, Superman gets one, yet, the heroes where the message is one of accepting those that are different... I digress. The abundance of superpower-wielding ones also means that efforts have to be taken to continually explain why they aren't using them in that situation, and even *that* doesn't always work out perfectly. The abilities are depicted rather nicely, however, and they're written in well. This and the second one contain some of the best shape-shifting stuff in motion pictures. There are fantastic and effective reveals in this. The effects are very well-done, and it isn't that evident that the budget is slightly lower than the typical Summer blockbuster amount. The casting is almost entirely spot-on. Jackman *is* Wolverine, Mane could barely be a better Sabretooth(he's got the physique, and he didn't have to do much acting), McKellan as Magneto... heck, even Romijn, who's really a model, does well and fits. There are good, strong women in this. The pacing is perhaps uneven. It should be known that this is a science fiction piece with action sequences(they are marvelous, though, don't get me wrong), not the other way around. There are fun in-jokes and references in this. All of the humor is great, really. The attention to detail is incredible. There is mild violence and language, and neither are excessive. This comes with a commentary by the director, well worth listening to. The second disc has extras, including five featurettes, interviews, tests, galleries, trailers and other material. I recommend this to any fan, and anyone who likes sci-fi and/or thrillers. 8/10"
"michielv-laarhoven","7","0","1","28 April 2009"," No superheroes in X-Men, something better
","The reason that this film is one of the best comic movies yet, is simply because of the characters. Especially Wolverine (played by Hugh Jackman) is a very interesting character. He's rather funny, cool and has an interesting past. And if you have some interesting characters, you'll need some interesting actors. That was the case in this film. We have Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, (our own) Famke Janssen and Ian McKellen, who all brought their characters alive.<br/><br/>But I think this film is too busy. It was like having a spectacular climax in every five minutes of the film. There were just too many visual effects, sometimes it just became too much. I think it had been better if the filmmakers took a little more time to tell the story. What about a running time of 120 minutes (instead of 104)? Fortunately they solved that in X2 (which has a running time of 133 minutes).<br/><br/>The plot was rather good, actually. It was renovating. It differed from normal superhero movies, from which the normal structure is: normal man - something weird happens to him - he gets special powers - he uses them for the good - another man gets powers too, but uses them for the bad - fight between the ""superhero"" and the ""villain"". This film wasn't a film in which the good fight against the bad. There was just no clear line between good and bad. And I thought that worked out very well. It isn't a cliché story about simple superheroes. This is a more realistic story where superpowers are seen as some kind of disease.<br/><br/>And I finish my review with a little minus point. That is the music. I love to see superhero movies which have beautiful themes in it. Think of Spider-Man and Batman, those films have very well composed music. I missed that in this film. There was no concrete theme in it, and the rest of the music wasn't rather special either.<br/><br/>So X-Men is a very nice story about people who have gifts. Not about superheroes who save people, but something much more interesting. There were good characters in it, which were portrayed great by the actors. They only had to take more time to tell the story, it seemed a bit over-stuffed to me."

","'X-men' and its sequels have always been notable for standing out from other superhero films. The reason for this distinction probably lies in the universe the films portray, a pseudo-science fictional take on a 'near future' reality where a conflict is brewing between ordinary human beings and the people who are considered the next step in the evolution of man: mutants. The mutants are of course a metaphor for the discrimination rampant in the world on the basis of caste, creed, religion, gender and orientation. The X-men mythos simply puts a sci-fi spin on a real-world problem and takes it to a whole new level: discrimination on the basis of genetic makeup! Once you understand this to be the context of these films, you will realize exactly what sets the X-men apart from other superheroes. Mutants are not just people born with extraordinary and superhuman powers and abilities, they are also a minority fighting for their civil rights, hiding from a world which fears and often hates them. And as with any other minority in the world, there are two opposing factions among the mutants as well: the hardliners who wish to eliminate their opposition and thus spare their brethren from persecution; and the negotiators, who wish to resolve the conflict by means of peaceful negotiation and cooperation founded on mutual trust and benefits. In the film, the former camp is represented by Magneto (Ian McKellen) and his 'Brotherhood of Mutants'; the latter camp is represented by Proffesor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and his X-men. The plot of the film itself is quite simple, and serves merely as an introduction to this dark world which shall be explored in greater scope in the next two films. The film, for the most part, follows the stories of two characters; Rogue (Anna Paquin) and Wolverine (Hugh Jackman), as they are drawn into the human-mutant conflict and find themselves, before long, at the centre of it. Wolverine, in particular, is a character who will be greatly explored in the sequels as well as in the upcoming prequel film. The other X-men are not particularly developed much, though the actors have done a pretty good job with their portrayal. Xavier and Magneto ultimately become seen more as representatives of their respective ideologies than characters in themselves; both are ultimately of the same type of personality-great leaders willing to spread their ideologies through the actions of their followers. So, while this film is certainly no where near as intricate and suspenseful as X2 or epic as the vastly under-rated X-men: The Last Stand, it is nevertheless an excellent prologue into an interesting sci-fi world which in many ways is a twisted reflection of our own."

","X-Men as a whole has to be one of the best things Marvel have trundled out so far. Each of the Marvel films shares a similar look, which helps to realise each of these characters are in the same universe. The first X-Men works well, largely because it abandons any attempt to fill in a long, overwrought origins story (see Spider-Man, Iron Man etc.) and just jumps right in there. Particular highlights of the cast include a hardened Hugh Jackman on growling form as Wolverine, Ian McKellen as Magento and Patrick Stewart who holds it all together as Professor X. What's great about this film is that it focuses on the team dynamic, something director Bryan Singer made his name for in The Usual Suspects. We have a good even spread of all the X-Men instead of being bogged down dealing with just one. It's also rather satisfying to see the baddie mutants (Magneto et all) making life difficult, especially for the slimy Senator Kelly. As you would expect, the graphics are spot on and there are some very memorable fight scenes. A worthy superhero movie."

The movie's thematic preoccupations are obvious and probably come from the comics- the mutants are fighting for a world which hate them, the discrimination against the mutants in the world of the X-Men is similar to racism and discrimination by sexual preference in our world. Nothing much is done with these concepts, they are merely presented. The cast is generally good but I was only really charmed by Hugh Jackman as Wolverine. I still don't see why Bryan Singer is so relatively highly-regarded. He seems to me a basically competent director but nothing special at all. I saw nothing even remotely special about the writing or direction or cinematography in this film. The action scenes are only moderately entertaining. Overall this is on the same level as ""Spider-Man"", and not on par with Nolan's Batman films, ""Iron Man"", or the Hellboy films. Not bad, just nothing special, and I'm kind of surprised this was such a huge hit. I will still watch ""X2"", mostly because I have heard very few negative things about it and the X-Men world is mildly intriguing."
"Dude_001","8","0","1","17 March 2009"," X-Men is a visually stunning special effects film that has some great substance to behind all the glam.
","In a world where children born with strange and dangerous powers-whether they be the ability to read minds, to control the weather, or even walk through walls- are feared and outcast, Professor Charles Xavier(Patrick Stewart), a 'mutant' with the power to read and manipulate another's mind, has created an environment, a school, where mutants can feel safe and welcome. Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue(Anna Paquin), two wandering mutants, find solace here for a short time, but are soon thrust into the action as a powerful mutant by the name of Magneto(Ian McKellen) plans to unleash disaster on the unsuspecting public.<br/><br/>First and foremost, I am not a comic book fan. From that you can conclude that I never read any of the X-Men comics. So when I approached the film I held no bias as to what I should expect: I wasn't looking for the same film a fan might of have been looking for. I was looking for a good time and thats just what I got.<br/><br/>One thing I really appreciated was that the line between super hero and super villain was blurred distinctly. The mutants can act as a metaphor for all minorities that exist today, and the film presents this in a way that is not subtle, but not in-your-face either. Humans hate and fear mutants, who we as an audience, in a slightly different universe, can see as kind, caring, angry, depressed, knowledgeable, moral,humane beings. Mutants in general are neither bad nor good, but human, and the title of hero or villain comes only in how certain characters react to the prejudice thrust upon them by humanity. Some might say that Charles Xavier is moronic for protecting the ones that hate and fear him. Is Magneto right for wanting to change the state of the world in order to favor his own kind? Though the 'bad guys' are usually more ugly and visually less human then their heroic counterparts, the idea is still in the air that not all is as well defined as one may think. The film opens with a harrowing scene that leads the audience to sympathize... with the lead villain.<br/><br/>Visually, X-Men is a definite treat. There are just so many memorable and surprisingly well executed shots in this film. I love the first time the audience witness Wolverine's blades pushing through his skin. The first time we see Jean Grey exhibiting her telekinetic power. Perhaps my favorite shot in the entire film is when the powerful shape shifter Mystique changes her appearance- in the middle of performing a mid air spinning kick to her opponent. The fight scenes are all very well choreographed, filmed with a great eye, and not too over the top or extravagant. There is a great variety of locations visited in the run of the 104 minute viewing time: From a vast, snowy Canadian landscape, to the almost futuristic school facility, to a mysterious island and more, these mutants are always on the move, and the audience is alongside them for the ride. The film also sounds quite good, with some impressive sound effects and a very fitting score by Michael Kamen.<br/><br/>The film progresses at a very smooth, fluid pace, building itself up to an explosive climax atop one of the world's grandest attractions. The script, written by David Hayter, strongly develops the mutants, the world in which they live, and their reactions to it. The film's script also has a nice sense of humor to it. Special effects wise, X-Men is a blast. Visual effects, such as a certain character's watery demise, are meticulously crafted and designed for the audience's enjoyment. The mutant effects and make up where also extraordinary, most notably the beautifully and expertly crafted Mystique costume, consisting of air brushed dye and prosthetics that look ridiculously life life. .<br/><br/>The acting for the most part is very good. The only two performances here I didn't totally enjoy where Halle berry's performance as Storm and Anna Paquin's performance as Rogue. Maybe it was the accents these girls spoke with, but both of their performances seemed pretty bad compared to the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Another of the film's flaw, that I found, is the view on evolution that is so strongly held. Since I am not a believer in evolution, this hardened view did not set well with me, not to the point that I couldn't enjoy the film, but just enough to make note of. This is much more of a personal issue than a technical flaw with the film.<br/><br/>X-Men is a visually stunning special effects film that has some great substance to behind all the glam. Fans of the comic books seem to have taken kindly to the hero's and anti-heroes jump to the big screen, and as a casual movie goer I had quite an enjoyable time.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","1","8 February 2009"," The evolution of the superhero movie begins
","If there's anything 90s movies did wrong, it's that they botched the superhero genre, namely with the slew of bad Batman sequels. ""X-Men,"" however, closes out the 20th century with hope that between special effects and renewed focus on characters, the genre is on the way up.<br/><br/>While 2002's ""Spider-Man"" was the film that really transformed the genre by use of the origin story, ""X-Men"" wasn't far off with its choice to tell the story with emphasis on a few of the characters. A comic book like ""X-Men,"" where there are multiple heroes on a team instead of one masked crusader, could have been adopted horribly with too many different characters trying to share the spotlight. <br/><br/>Bryan Singer (""The Usual Suspects"") picks fan favorite Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) as the focus and a vehicle by which to introduce the viewer to the X-Men world. He also chooses Rogue (Anna Paquin) to demonstrate that teenage feeling of being different and hiding from the world that makes X-Men such a human story. Lastly, he develops only Magneto (Ian McKellen) of all the villains to set the stage for the greater conflict between humans and mutants that will carry over into the sequels. The other mutants are used for visual fluff, to further the story, or to please comic fans. While you'd like to see all the mutants get attention, this is a concession Singer knows he must make to avoid his film crashing and burning.<br/><br/>The film's weak point is the general plot or evil scheme. While the movie is mostly based around scenes that are revealing of character and show how each mutant deals with his or her abilities, this element of the film remains ""take-over-the-world"" focused. With a bill on the verge of being passed that could force all mutants to register with the government, Magneto and the Brotherhood of Mutants (villains Sabertooth, Toad and the shape-shifting Mystique) plot to launch a radiation attack on a UN assembly in New York that would turn all the world's leaders into mutants. Professor X (Patrick Stewart) and his X-Men plan to stop them, believing peaceful cooperation with humans is the only way to get things done.<br/><br/>There's not a ton of action in the film. The fight scenes are short and far from exhilarating. Instead, ""X-Men"" hopes that a few scant special effects and mutants demonstrating their powers will be enough to entertain you. It does, but not in an exciting way. This is not a full- throttle blockbuster, it's a movie about characters with special abilities that affect their lives.<br/><br/>Singer does a great job bringing this franchise to the screen. While moviegoers love great action, it's nice to see a superhero film handled with sensitivity and being about what makes the X-Men so likable, not simply about bringing them to life and having them fight each other. That's where his camera-work, like when Rogue notices Wolverine's knuckles on the steering wheel and asks him if it hurts, makes an impact. His goal is to get you in touch with the characters--the stylish suits are secondary. <br/><br/>While you'd like to see characters like Halle Berry's Storm or James Marsden's Cyclops be more than just a suit with a special power, the specific character focus is still good enough. This movie essentially prioritizes characters and good storytelling over the action number of villains that Hollywood once thought was the most important aspect. That alone is something superhero movie fans can't ever be too thankful for."
"lopcar1993","7","0","1","22 January 2009"," One of the best comic book adaption ever made!
","exceptional!! X-Men is perhaps one of the best comic book adaption's ever made It has the style and humor the comic did, plus a little more just for your entertainment. X-men is a very well made, and exceptionally well acted film that will have you on the edge of your seat throughout. And you will also get a good dose of humor too, this film delivers what most comic book films don't, a sturdy well made film that allot of recent comic book films have followed. Iron Man, the Incredible Hulk, Spider Man, the Fantastic Four. They all follow the example that X-men set up, it's a film that you can look back twenty years from now and still call it the best. It doesn't matter how old you are, or if you even read the comic books or watch the original animated show. X-men is the movie that you'll want to see over and over again. I very highly recommended this great film. I hope my review helps~ C.R. Lopez 1.21.2009"
"roses_are_red14","8","0","1","23 December 2008"," Impressive!
","I have to admit I hired this movie purely as part of a Hugh Jackman fan phase, however I think the movie delivered far more than I required of it; a lovely surprise.<br/><br/>I've never read a comic strip in my life, so I can't compare the film with the comic series, and to be honest I wouldn't want to. Whatever the comic series may have or have had, the film stands strong enough all on its own.<br/><br/>The writing of the Wolverine character was brooding, intriguing, and totally believable, and Hugh Jackman slipped into the part with his usual ease and extraordinary charisma. Anna Paquin, as Rogue, was awkward at times, but seamless at others. Perhaps she has a great deal of natural talent, as long as she can be made to relax and forget about the acting? I expect she will continue to develop into an excellent actress. McKellen and Stewart were perfect in their roles, but I would have liked more screen time with Storm, as I felt her character was under-developed on screen and Halle Berry is capable of great things.<br/><br/>As for the special effects, they blended into the background, just as I feel special effects should. Due to the powers of the mutants special effects are crucial to the basic plot, and it was great to see the director and designers creating effects that served the story with complete obedience, rather than dazzling and distracting. The film, after all, is not about the powers but about the choices of the people use or abuse them.<br/><br/>The story flowed well, the pacing was just right and the plot was easy to understand but still captivating. The characters were recognisable and the themes were universal. In short, the script had all the compulsory characteristics of a typical pop film, however a fantastic collaborative effort between director, writers, actors and designers has ensured that X Men does not feel stale. Instead, this is an excellent film to relax to, and easy to watch with friends."
"TimBoHannon","7","0","1","3 December 2008"," X-Citing Movie That Changed Cinema Forever
","Thanks to the trend started by Marvel Comics' first movie, the comic book-movie genre has become the dominant force in the cinema. Marvel has planned four more movies leading to ""The Avengers,"" ""Spider-Man 4"" has been announced and a new Daredevil movie is rumored to be in the works. Christopher Nolan rocked the summer with ""The Dark Knight."" All of these movies are possible because of the legitimacy ""X-Men"" brought to the genre.<br/><br/>Patrick Stewart's opening statement explains that new mutations are causing the evolutionary process to take a giant leap. Members of the new species, derisively called ""mutants,"" possess supernatural powers that cause some ""regular"" humans to hate them. Congress, led by Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), is considering a law that would require every mutant to register with the government as do sex offenders.<br/><br/>A mutant named Magneto (Ian McKellen) survived Hitler's holocaust and worries that the Mutant Registration Act will begin a new one. Professor Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) believes in taking every step needed to avoid violent conflict. Cyclops (James Marsden), Storm (Halle Barry) and Jean Grey (Famke Janssen), who is also a physician, stand with Xavier. Magneto's followers are Sabertooth (Tyler Mane); who seems to hate Wolverine; Mystique (the lovely Rebecca Romijn) and Toad (Ray Park, who also played Darth Maul). Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and runaway teenager Rogue (Anna Paquin) are the newcomers to Xavier's School for the Gifted.<br/><br/>Whereas movies such as ""Spider-Man"" and ""Daredevil"" contain two or fewer characters with supernatural powers, it can be easy for a script to grow excessive with the legion of characters in the ""X-Men"" universe. Writer David Hayter, best known as the voice of Solid Snake in the Metal Gear Solid video games, demonstrates good self-discipline. He and director Brian Singer limit the mutant count to ten. Although each possesses a unique look, ""X-Men"" does not differentiate the characters on that trait alone. Only two wield similar powers, and the script includes a conversation distinguishing the two. The introduction of these powers provides much of the entertainment early. I watched the television show as a child yet was not familiar with some characters' capabilities.<br/><br/>Some of the personalities are poorly realized, but Hayter and Singer compensate with small details such as Toad's quirky attitude and Mystique's sultry body language. Some have complained that Cyclops is boring. Judging by what I hear from the comic book enthusiasts, Marsden's character is translated on target. Cyclops' ""Mr. Morality"" personality is much like Superman's. Unlike in the two sequels which totally cheated him, Cyclops plays a pivotal role in the story. Magneto is the most effectively developed character. His horrific childhood motivates him. He does not desire power or wish to exterminate all of humanity. He takes drastic action only when he cannot see better options.<br/><br/>With the future of comic book movies in serious trouble after ""Batman and Robin,"" 20th Century Fox allotted the production team only 75 million dollars. Some of the visual effects look shoddy and occasionally the timing is wrong such as during the incident where Wolverine is hurled backwards. That said, the fights utilize the mutants' abilities inventively and the choreography is above average. The only problem is the use of the hang-time error. The hang-time error occurs when a character flies threw the air, but does not fall closer to the ground. Thankfully, it appears only twice. The two outstanding scenes are Magneto's answer to a police siege and the Wolverine fights during the climax. The X-Men display good teamwork in their missions, especially at the end. Sadly, neither of the sequels comes close to matching it.<br/><br/>Acting-wise, Halle Barry drew disapproval from the X-Men nation. She is not great, but not bad either. Apparently I am not familiar enough with the drawn character to know what causes the uproar. McKellen, Stewart, Jackman and Paquin perform the best. Paquin has the most demanding role. Most people seemingly do not realize how tough it is to show the depth of emotion she does in the climax without being corny. Wolverine is an angry and independent person. At times it looks like Jackman is readying himself to bite somebody. Stewart inhabits Professor X as well as he does Captain Picard and no other actor has the combination of appearance and acting specialty to better Ian McKellen's Magneto.<br/><br/>Movies based on comic books had a bad name when ""X-Men"" was released in 2000. Batman and Superman were the two franchises to come before it. Both eventually jumped the shark and into unfunny wackiness. ""X-Men"" had to convince the public that comic book inspired films can still take their subject matter seriously. It did, and I assign the most credit to David Hayter. Although the series eventually jumped the shark itself, ""X-Men"" stabilized the comic book movie with its skillful construction and sober but not somber atmosphere."
"Tweekums","8","0","1","13 November 2008"," Excellent Mutant Superheroes
","I must state in advance that this film was my introduction to the X-Men so I had no preconceived ideas about what the characters should look like or how they should behave as fans of previous versions would understandably have.<br/><br/>Set in a world where mutants with super powers exist the story opens during the Second World War were a young Jewish boy is being separated from his parents in a concentration camp. As the guards try to pull him away from them the iron gates start to buckle and they are pulled towards them. After this introduction the action moves to the present day where we are introduced to Rogue, a young girl who sucks the life out of anybody she touches. When she runs away from home she heads to Canada where she meets Wolverine, a man who heals from any injury and has had metal parts attached to his skeleton including long claws that he can produce at will. As they drive along they are ambushed by a large man who we later learn is called Sabretooth, thankfully they are rescued by two other mutants who go by the names Storm and Cyclops.<br/><br/>The next time we see them they are at a strange school where mutant children are taught by Professor Xavier. He explains that there are two factions of mutants, one led by himself that wants to live peacefully with normal people and the other led by Magneto (The young boy from the opening scene) who believes that the only way for them to survive is to prepare for a war with humanity.<br/><br/>The rest of the film follows Xavier's X-Men as the try to foil Magneto's plans which seem to involve Wolverine for reasons the professor can't understand.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film, the characters were interesting and well acted and while the plot was the standard ""save the world"" type one expects in such movies it did have a few surprises and the actions scenes are fairly exciting. I'm sure everybody will have their own favourite mutants, mine are Rogue, played by Anna Paquin for the good guys and Mystique, who can change shape to look like anybody else for the bad guys."
"Wilson102","9","0","1","23 October 2008"," World War X
","In X1 there was the attempt by Magneto (played superbly by Ian McKellan) to convert humans to mutants. In X2 it was a plot by a corrupt Fed to kill all the mutants using Xavier (Patrick Stewart). In X3 a ""cure"" is found that makes all mutants human. Cure indeed. Who said the mutants were sick? Such is the view of the mutant self-proclaimed leader Magneto. In the final chapter, Magneto fears that the ""cure"" will be forced upon the mutant population and wages war against the source of the cure with the aim to destroy it and anything that gets in his and his loyal followers way. All three movies are suspenseful and exciting. No bathroom break urges in these films. New mutants are hatched in each film and some of our favorite mutants are dispatched (quite early on in X3). Special effects are 5-stars. If you've not seen any of the movies (or all of the movies) in the trilogy, this 3-pack is a great opportunity to see a classic tale in chronological order and own a classic 3-part tale in the genre that belongs in any sci-fi fan's collection. Hugh Jackman is excellent in the tough-guy roll as Wolverine (we like you better as a tough guy, Hugh); Halle Berry (Storm), Anna Paquin (Rogue), James Marsden (Cyclops) and Rebecca Romijn (Mystique) are all spot-on too. And Famke Janssen is Phoenix whose character is key to the trilogy. Beast is in X3 too, actually played by (to my surprise in the rolling credits)...Kelsey Grammar! Now there's a real mutation! All in all a very entertaining 6 hours of movies here. X fans won't miss these, and you shouldn't either if you're into the action, sci-fi or fantasy genres."
"max_tony","8","0","1","5 October 2008"," Great adaptation of classic heroes.
","While it'd be impossible for any films to do justice to Marvel's legendary team of super-powered mutants, I really feel that these films are almost as good an adaptation as we could have hoped for. The casting was strong, the action was solid, most of the characters were portrayed memorably, and the stories largely stayed true to the spirit of the X-men. The first film felt a little rushed due to the sheer number of characters introduced, but all things considered it was a very enjoyable film for both the uninitiated and old-school X-fans. Hugh Jackman was spot-on as Wolverine, the most iconic X-man and arguably the hardest to cast and Famke Jansen was a fantastic Jean Grey for at least the first two films. Patrick Stewart (Professor X), Ian McKellan (Magneto), and Rebecca Romjin-Stamos (Mystique) also delivered outstanding performances playing their respective comic icons. The story was a nice update of the comics and followed Rogue's induction into Professor X's school for mutants and Magneto's first big terrorist attack on mankind. All-in-all, a satisfying start to the series. The second film really kicked the series into gear and introduced more of our favorite X-men, including Nightcrawler (whose opening sequence was the highlight of the film), Pyro, and Iceman. The story involves Wolverine's past and the government's attempts to control the ever-growing mutant population. The result was one of the greatest comic book films ever made that firmly cemented the developing series as one to watch. For some ridiculous reason, at this point the powers that be decided that the third film would be the last. This was a bad choice that made no kind of sense, upset the films' fans, and severely hurt the quality of the third film. Ah, the third film; a mixed bag to say the least. The plot deals with two classic story lines involving a cure for mutants and the legendary Dark Phoenix. My personal list of complaints is a long one, but I'll just hit a few in this review. ""X-men: The Last Stand"" tries to cram two movies' worth of material into one film that is too short to begin with. The introduction of the Phoenix was obviously forced and no care was taken in this storyline which is one of the all-time classics in comic history, and the result is several pointless character deaths and gaps in logic, like why an all-powerful entity is content to hang out at an aging terrorist's side and just look menacing for most of the story. The series' former darling, Rogue, is reduced to a brooding plot-nuisance, has no real influence on the story, plus she never gains the fantastic powers she obtained in the comics that made her such a powerhouse of a character and a personal favorite of mine. On the other hand, more classic characters are given parts such as fan-favorite Kitty Pride and Collossus (both of which had cameos in X2), Angel, Multiple Man, Beast (played nicely by Kelsey Grammar), and the almighty Juggernaut (whose battle with Kitty was as awesome as it was unexpected). But as many characters as there were that made it into the three films, there were so many great ones that were reduced to either tiny, unnamed cameos in the series, or forgotten altogether. No Gambit, Emma Frost, Sinister, Apocalypse, Scarlet Witch, or Havok to name just a few. Furthermore, the final film's resolution in extremely unsatisfying and leaves little doubt that this franchise as we know it is dead, though they do leave us a glimmer of hope. There are talks of Wolverine and Magneto spin-offs and possibly a New Mutants project; promising ideas, but hardly a substitute for the ensemble we know and love. Still, in the end, I really did enjoy X3 as a film as it did have several great stand-up-and-cheer moments; it just upset me as a fan of the comics and as a fan of the the movies because there wss so much more that could have and should have been done with this series. In the end, whether you're a fan of the comics, the cartoons, or just a fan of sci-fi or fun movies in general, you really shouldn't miss out on these three movies. The series is full of memorable characters, fantastic battles, sly humor, references for hard-core fans, and, of course, the classic X-men social commentaries about discrimination and the importance of both individuality and cohesiveness. There doesn't appear to be much in the way of special features from the first two films on this edition; but for about $10 a flick, I'll let it slide since it is still a hell of a bargain. Highly recommended set."
"Dr_Coulardeau","9","0","1","24 September 2008"," So many models and yet some freshness
","The special effects are good. The characters are simple and varied enough to make us like that universe of monstrous mutants that look just like us but can turn into whatever they want. Welcome to Carrie, Christine, Firestarter, the Tommyknockers and many other Stephen King paranormal beings and situations. Of course, this film adds to that berserk universe a good old American wrapping but with a twist. The statue of liberty standing on its nice little island as the symbol of what it is called after and yet looking like a stiletto stabbing the sky and jutting out of a flat no man's seascape. The twist is in the fact that it is this very statue that is going to be the epicenter of the destruction of all the heads of states assembled at the United Nations for the general assembly of this world's forum. This American wrapping is the standard bigot position of a senator against mutants, against people who are different, who rejects them and kills them as fast as possible. And the twist is that this senator is kidnapped by the bad mutants, transmuted himself by them and then discarded to die in any odd place away from them. And before dying he is saved by the good mutants and he even comes to like them. Finally the main twist is that there are good mutants and in this film, temporarily, they win and save humanity from a cataclysm that would have destroyed both humanity and mutant-dom. Then the rest is not even sentimental episodes. It is pure action and mission and some fights, and a lot of visual special effects. That makes a nice entertaining film though on no matrix whatsoever except maybe the very very distant faraway relation to a certain Quasimodo in Notre Dame de Paris by Victor Hugo: the ugly monster is the savior of the beautiful gypsy girl all the normal Parisians want to victimize and kill.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines"
"retroguy02","7","0","1","27 August 2008"," A decent superhero film that's not very deep or outstanding, but enjoyable nonetheless
","Although I'm not a big fan of X-Men, I did enjoy the ""X-Men: Evolution"" animated series and am a fan of superhero films, so decided to get the DVD of this movie today. Read on to find out what I thought about ""X-Men"".<br/><br/>The story can get bumpy sometimes, but otherwise goes on smoothly and basically focuses on the relationship between Dr. Xavier's X-Men, Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants, and humans' relationship with mutants. The movie sensibly doesn't go too deep in the origins of the characters, since there's a bevy of them in the movie and all have the same tale more or less  that they're mutants. The movie revolves mostly revolves around Wolverine, while most other characters - except for Wolverine, Rogue, Mr. Xavier and Magneto - get little development and serve mostly to accommodate the action sequences. Needless to say, X-Men's story or characters aren't very deep, but considering the highly collective nature of the X-Men and the movie's sequel-orientation, I guess that the latter is not that bad.<br/><br/>There is a lot of smashing action, although the climax on the Statue of Liberty could've been better defined, and the choreography is also very good. But the action is somewhat offset by the lengthy dialogue sequences delivered by Magneto and Mr. Xavier. The acting is mediocre from the entire cast; no one gives an outstandingly good or bad performance, and most cast didn't really have a choice due to the tepid character development. Aside, there's some good contextual humor here and there, thanks in no small part to Wolverine.<br/><br/>The production design is also top-notch, especially the sterilely high-tech X-Mansion; however, the X-Men's costumes (especially Wolverine's), which are redesigned for the movie, could have been closer to the comics and animated series while being realistic at the same time. The best character design IMO goes to Mystique; the scaly prosthetics motif on her otherwise nude body looks sexy, sinister and feels just right for a cunning shape-shifter like her. Among the villains, the character design on Sabretooth and Toad is also very impressive; the latter even has a cocky personality to complement his repulsive appearance. Unfortunately, both characters are reduced to disposable henchmen.<br/><br/>Although ""X-Men"" didn't get me very excited, calling it terrible would be a gross exaggeration. It's just a decent superhero film, up there with ""Superman: The Movie"" and ""Spider-Man 3"", and should not disappoint anyone into superhero films  but frankly, for someone who's not a die-hard X-Men fan, like me, there are much better superhero movies out there. RATING: 7.5/10"

","My Take: Forgettble but a lot of fun.<br/><br/>I'm not a fan of the Marvel Comics series. Suffice to say I wasn't really wild with the big-budget big-screen series. I've seen all of them on the big-screen and enjoyed them (especially X2), and I've seen the repeatedly on television, but I didn't have much to talk about them. Their great entertainment but little else. Still, after seeing the original X-MEN a few nights ago, my original opinion has been improved. While I still won't have anything to talk about it the next day, I'm giving it more credit than the one i gave it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the special effects and the action the first time, but looking back, there's actually much more going for it. The characters were given enough depth. And that director Bryan Singer wasn't exactly the biggest fanboy of the comic book series makes his job in X-MEN much more impressive. Performances by Hugh Jackman, Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen and a young Anna Paquin are great, which is much to say considering that there's a lot of things going on with the action and effects. I may not be wild about it but, for what its worth, X-MEN is still fine entertainment.<br/><br/>Rating: ***1/2 out of 5."

Jackman's portrayal of the character is spot-on and he injects real life into the part. He's joined by a very talented set of actors including Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellen (as a slightly camp Magneto), Famke Janssen and Halle Berry.

"freemantle_uk","9","0","1","27 June 2008"," A Very Good Superhero Film
","X-Men is my favourite comic book series, I have been a fan of the comic books and the animated series in the 90s and I was excited when I found out that they were making an X-Men film. I was round 14/15 at the time it was released and the only bad thing about my experience seeing the film was the popcorn (American can't make sweets to save their lives).<br/><br/>X-Men is a wide ranging series which tackles a lot of plots and issues. It has been considered to be a metaplor for the civil rights movement in the 60s and the comics have tackled other issues like the role of the government, the AIDs virus and the Holocaust. There is also the issue that powers may be a curse rather then a blessing e.g. Rogue and Cyclops. There are also a number of characters and fractions which would have made the film difficult to make because there would have been no way to make the fans 100% happy.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is in the world they are mutants, people with powers that can range from being psychic to changing your apparent to healing to controlling the weather. They are met with fear from the general public and they are calls in the US Senate for the Mutant Regisration Act, to get details of every mutant in the USA. Within the mutant community there are two major factors, the X-Men and the Brotherhood of Mutants. The X-Men, led by Charles Xavier, want to have harmonious relations with humanity whilst the Brotherhood, led by Erik Lehnsherr/Magento, believes that the human race would never accept Mutants and that a war is coming. In the middle of this are two mutants, Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) and Rogue (Anna Paqulin). Wolverine can not remember his past and lives a nomadic lifestyle and Rogue is a teenage runaway, who needly kills her boyfriend just by kissing him. Mangento wants Rogue so he can complete his scheme to turn the world's leaders in mutants.<br/><br/>This film was not particular action packed; this was because the budget was $75 Million which is nothing special for a summer blockbuster, and the director was Bryan Singer, who's most famous film before was the Usual Suspects, a psychology crime thriller. He chose to focus on character development which was a good move. He also tackled the project as an outsider, he was not a fan of the comics, but I thought that was good because he was able to cut of the flak. He made the film into a realistic sci-fi film which could appeal to the fans and normal movie goers. He made a few jokes about some of the issues of the comics, like the codenames and the costumers. The film does tackles ideas like Wolverine's tortured past and his rivalry with Cyclops, Xavier's friendship with his rival Magneto, the human factor, Wolverine's need to protect children, the list goes on. The film also has a good international cast, Patrick Stewart, Sir Ian McKellon, Halle Berry, Famke Janssen, James Marsden and Anna Paquin. The film also made Hugh Jackman into an overnight star because before the film he was an Australian Stage actor and after it he became an A-lister and has a strong scene of loyalty to the franchise. To a lesser extent Rebecca Romjin has also become a major actress.<br/><br/>The film isn't perfect, I would have liked to have seen more characters like Gambit and Beast, and the film did ignore Wolverine's and Sabretooth's hatred for each other and the fact that they have a past together. X-Men was an introduce to the film franchise, especially to people who do not know the comics.<br/><br/>X-Men is a very good film, X-Men 2 is even better and X-Men 3 was one of my most biggest film disappointments. I would love to see Bryan Singer back in the director's chair and ignore the third film and do it the way he wants and the fans want."

","I really enjoyed this movie a lot when it first came out 8 long years ago and I decided to revisit it with my little brother tonight and enjoyed it just as much as I did back then. I think it's definitely one of the better Marvel films and up there with the first Spider-Man and Iron Man. I'm definitely glad I decided to check it out again.<br/><br/>There are a lot of great elements in this film and I thought the story along with the effects were both great. The acting was really good as well with great performances from James Marsden and Hugh Jackman. I thought they did a great job of adapting the comic book into this film as I've been a big fan of the comic books since I was very little kid.<br/><br/>Most Marvel fans have most likely seen this film, and a few times over. However, if you haven't yet, you really should do yourself the favor of checking it out. You probably will enjoy it quite a bit."
"johnnymacbest","9","0","1","3 June 2008"," Embodies the spirit of the comics almost perfectly.
","I gotta give my props to Brian Singer. Man, what a fantastic job he did in bringing my favorite mutant superhero team to the big screen. The X-men comics have decades of established treasured mythology and this film does it justice almost perfectly. Some story elements have been altered here and there but it never undermined the finished product significantly as to throw off die-hard fans, although I was disappointed that Gambit wasn't included. But the film superbly makes up for that with action, special effects (and what MARVELOUS EFFECTS they are!!!) and a plot that's intellectually stimulating actually. It's a shame that most action films today don't have that kind of pizazz and gravitas to keep it from being mindlessly entertaining. Not so here as X-Men challenges its viewers to ponder the nature of acceptance , fear, and prejudice. My one main complaint is that the villains such as Sabertooth wasn't fleshed out more and similar to his vicious comic book counterpart. I will purchase the director's cut for any bells and whistles not in the theatrical cut but for the most part ""X-Men"" is an exciting and exhilarating experience with something more beneath the surface even more so than action films today and I can say with all authority it embodies the spirit of the comics nearly spot on.<br/><br/>Great film."

","Based on the comics, the movie X-Men, while there are many important characters, follows Marie a.k.a. Rogue and Logan a.k.a Wolverine, who discover Professor Xavier and his ""X-Men"" as Logan labels them (Scott a.k.a. Cyclops, Jean Grey, Ororo a.k.a Storm), who help them after an accident. However, they soon discover that the Brotherhood, led by Magneto (or Erik), plans on using them for a scheme, which he tested on a Senator first. I think everyone's good, but it's always hard when there's at least two Oscar winners, two Shakespearian actors and some other awards winners.<br/><br/>If you like action films (which I do), this is a definite must-see."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","12 April 2008"," A comic book movie that works for the most part, unlike some of them
","I was introduced to the ""X-Men"" as a kid in the 1990s when I started seeing episodes of the cartoon show. Later, I started playing an X-Men video game, and during my comic book phase, I do recall reading some X-Men ones. Since then, the comic book series has been one of several to get the live action movie treatment at some point within the past ten years or so. I didn't see too many films on the big screen back in 2000, so I didn't see this this first ""X-Men"" movie adaptation. I finally watched this about a year and a half after going to see its sequel, ""X2"", but I have now seen it more than once, and it is good.<br/><br/>In the near future, many mutated humans exist. They are born with a special X-Factor gene, which gives each of them a certain superpower. Unfortunately, these mutants are generally feared by the rest of humanity, even though many of them mean no harm. In the X-Mansion, where many good mutants live, Professor Charles Xavier runs a school for students with the special X-Factor gene, where they learn how to use their gifts wisely. Xavier dreams of a society where mutants can live with the rest of humanity in peace. However, another mutant named Eric Lensherr (a.k.a. Magneto), who was once Xavier's friend, has different plans. He has a machine that can convert non-mutated humans, and he plans to speed up the process of human evolution with it! For some reason, one unbeknownst to anyone in the X-Mansion, Magneto and his evil mutants are after either Logan or Rogue, two recent arrivals at the mansion! <br/><br/>Comic book movies from recent years are generally not known to be flawless, so it's no surprise that ""X-Men"" has some fairly weak moments. After the first scene, which is set in 1944, and the story skips to the near future, where the rest of the movie takes place, the film gets pretty shaky, starting with Rogue in her room with her boyfriend, just before she discovers her powers. I would say the story really gets good around the part when Logan (a.k.a. Wolverine) first finds himself in the X-Mansion. After that, it doesn't stay completely steady for the rest of the film, but usually is pretty entertaining, with a decent amount of action and suspense, as well as good special effects, some intriguing futuristic sets, and occasional humour. I can't say TOO many of the cast performances here really stand out, but those of Patrick Stewart (as Xavier), Ian McKellen (as Magneto), and Hugh Jackman (as Wolverine) do. The script isn't perfect, but for the most part, it's better than the ""Hulk"" and ""Catwoman"" scripts (two very disappointing comic book movies), that's for sure. Here, there's a mixture of strong and weak dialogue and acting.<br/><br/>So, overall, this first ""X-Men"" movie does have its cheesy moments, but that certainly doesn't mean it has no entertainment value. Now, some people strongly dislike these recent comic book movie blockbusters in general, and if you're one of them, I'm sure saying that this one has its cheesy moments is a gross understatement to you, if you've seen it. However, if you don't like this kind of movie, it's simple, don't watch it. For those whose interest is often captured by comic book movies like this, there may be some films of this kind which are best to avoid, most notably the more poorly received ones, but ""X-Men"" certainly isn't one of those, even if it's not the best adaptation of a comic book series ever made."
"zardoz-13","10","0","1","6 April 2008"," ""X-Men"" is X-cellent!
","""X-Men"" rules! <br/><br/>As directed by ""The Usual Suspects"" helmer Bryan Singer, this top-drawer cinematic adaptation of the popular Marvel Comics series sets a whole new standard for filming superhero sagas. Unlike the gratuitously overblown but happily-ever-after DC Comics characters, ""X-Men"" differs because Marvel Comics forged superheroes with tragic flaws. Not only does Singer orchestrate an entertaining but intelligent yarn around titans of Good and Evil battling for supremacy with the fate of mankind at stake, but he also tackles important cultural issues integral to the plot that enhance its subtext about intolerance. Ultimately, ""X-Men"" qualifies as the best superhero comic book movie ever produced, thanks to a stellar cast led by Shakespearean heavyweights Patrick ""Star Trek: The Next Generation"" Stewart and Sir Ian ""Richard III"" McKellen, ""Matrix"" style special effects which compliment rather than eclipse the plot, and a literate script that parries childish pratfalls. Obviously, hardcore aficionados of either the animated TV series (1992-98) or the comic book itself may complain about the various liberties that Singer and scenarist David Hayter take with the subject matter.<br/><br/>Over the opening credits, Patrick Stewart narrates that ""in the not too distant future"" genetic mutations will trigger the ""next stage of evolution."" As the next evolutionary stage of life, mutants—a.k.a. Homo superiors—will suffer persecution because they are not only different but also potentially dangerous. The prejudice that mankind manifests toward these mutants serves as an allegory for our current climate of political, racial, and sexual bigotry as well as the uncertainty that older teenagers and younger twentysomethings encounter as they search for their niche in society. Some critics have compared the showdown between Professor X (Stewart) and Magneto (McKellen) with the rivalry between Martin Luther King and Malcolm X during the turbulent 1960s, while others have recognized mutants as symbols for any oppressed group forced to identify themselves, whether they be classified as homosexuals, communists, Jewish, or firearms owners. Like the famous ""Star Wars"" prologue, Stewart's voice-over neatly encapsulates the origins of the ""X-Men"" and the inherent conflicts confronting them.<br/><br/>While ""Superman"" and ""Batman"" unfolded in linear fashion, starting from the beginning, Singer picks up ""X-Men"" somewhere in the middle. The setting is Poland in 1944, and the Nazis are parading helpless Jews into the gas chambers for extermination. When young Erik Lensherr (Brett Morris, bearing an uncanny resemblance to the older Ian McKellen) finds himself separated from his parents as the Nazis are about to gas them, he experiences such heretofore unknown terror that he emanates an invisible force field with his fingertips. He destroys the high, iron, barb-wired gates while several soldiers struggle to restrain him. Finally, smashing Lensherr in the face with his rifle butt, one Nazi sentry knocks him unconscious. Nevertheless, his supernatural powers stun the guards. This grim scene in Auschwitz hearkens back to ""Schindler's List (1193), while the show of paranormal power recalls Brian De Palma's ""Carrie."" As introductions go, the concentration camp scene grips with its poignancy. Clearly, this horrific, downbeat scene is not the usual way to kick off a superficial movie about a comic book franchise.<br/><br/>Flash-forwarding through time, Singer brings us to contemporary Washington, D.C. Dr. Jean Gray (""GoldenEye's statuesque Famke Janssen), a telepathic mutant with telekinetic powers, address Congress on the controversial subject of mutant registration. Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davidson of ""Willard"") believes mutants with their extraordinary physical and mental prowess endanger humanity. The fanatical Kelly demands all mutants be required to identify themselves. Moreover, he campaigns for registering them since they cannot be trusted to supervise their powers responsibly. Some mutants, he argues, can eavesdrop on your mind and read your thoughts. While Kelly drums up support for his proposed legislation, Dr. Charles Xavier (Patrick Stewart) watches quietly from the balcony. Although confined to a wheelchair, Xavier is a super-telepath that can do what Kelly fears the most. Not only can Xavier read your innermost thoughts, but he also can exert control of another person's body and speak through them with the ease of a ventriloquist.<br/><br/>Unlike the cynical Erik Lensherr, a.k.a. Magneto, who insists war between humans and mutants is inevitable, Xavier contends that mutants and humans can co-exist in harmony. As far as Xavier is concerned, people like Kelly are well-meaning but misinformed. Xavier has established a School for Gifted Youth in Westchester, New York, where he teaches young mutants to curb their potentially destructive urges. Some of his long-time students, Cyclops (James Marsden of ""27 Dresses"") who sports special sunglasses to shield his lethal laser beam eyes; Storm (Halle Berry of ""Die Another Day"") who controls weather and deploys lightning bots; and Dr. Jean Grey serve as instructors when they aren't running errands for Xavier. Concisely, in a model of economy, Singer establishes the characters and creates the overall conflict between them while broaching questions about the enormity of segregation! Moreover, he inserts several amusing tidbits of humor that flesh out the characters without detracting from the storyline.<br/><br/>The conflict in David Hayter's screenplay that prompts Magneto and Xavier to clash again concerns tow mutants thrown together by fate. A teenage girl in Meridian, Mississippi, Marie (Anna Paquin of ""The Piano"") discovers her touch can kill. Also known as 'Rogue,' she can drain the life out of people. Horrified by her inexplicable power, she hits the road and eventually meets Logan (Hugh Jackman), a rough-hewn cage fighter nicknamed 'Wolverine,' an anti-social amnesia-stricken loner searching for his past.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer toils throughout ""X-Men"" to dispel any notions that it is just another disposable comic book epic. He triumphs in every department from superb casting to thoughtful plotting. Stewart and McKellen embellish ""X-Men"" and provide it with the kind of dignity that Alec Guinness brought to ""Star Wars."" When Magneto and Xavier speak, their conversations sound like the oral equivalent of a chess match. ""X-Men"" hits the mark because Singer and Hayter fuse superior dramatic elements in the best Aristotelian fashion; its heroes experience a tough time winning."

","It's not very often you get an action movie that has exciting action scenes, a strong story, and explanations of stuff without bogging down the entire movie. X-Men is one of those movies. This movie had me engaged from the beginning of a young Magneto going to a concentration camp and discovering his powers of bending metal and Rogue discovering the hard way of her ability to take another mutant's powers(or the life from a non-mutant). The action scenes were extremely exciting and engaging. From the small skirmish Wolverine and Magneto had on board a train to Cyclops and Storm's fight with Sabretooth and Toad inside the train station to the huge climatic duke-out inside the Statue of Liberty, the battle scenes kept me on the edge of my seat, wanting more. Even when Professor X was explaining to Wolverine about his school and mutantism, it didn't bog down the story at all, but kept it going as we got a better understanding of what was to happen. The end was great and left it open for more as Magneto sat in his plastic prison cell, telling Professor X on his way out that the cell can't hold him forever, leaving it open for the sequel.<br/><br/>If you enjoy action movies, Marvel comics, or superheroes in general, this is a must-see movie and an x-cellent kick-off to one of my favorite movie trilogies."

"Cristi_Ciopron","7","0","1","6 November 2007"," Quite competent,good,not the best
","This film is remarkable for its straightforward narration, its well managed action,and its sense of adventure. The cast numbers several nice women ( Halle Berry,Rebecca Romijn,Famke Janssen).The atmosphere is interesting and the film avoids the useless jokes and parody stuff. The general air of intelligence makes it a respectable movie. Anyway, the script is certainly not the best, and the need is felt for more information (about Stewart's past and about his school for gifted youngsters, etc.). The action needed to be broadened, more things about the world existing outside the mutants' milieu were necessary. The characters aren't particularly interesting, and the plot itself is average (the bad mutants want to take over the world by turning the politicians reunited for a summit into mutants and thus securing a privileged position for the mutants). It didn't seem to me a very thrilling idea; maybe the film didn't serve it very well. The best thing about X-Men (2000) is its approachnot looking like a spoof. Its constructive aim.<br/><br/>I started with a most favorable disposition towards this film, after reading a comment here on IMDb (the comment called ""XMen"" ""the best superhero movie ever"","" a good superhero film""). (That comment also exquisitely touched on the three most important things about ""XMen"": that the two leading characters are the only interesting characters also; that the plot is crap ; that the action demands a knowledge of the comics .) I was a little disappointed with the ""XMen"", I didn't find the film worthy of any superlative. But it's quite well made."
"blw37","8","0","1","8 October 2007"," Possibly the best comic book movie to date.
","I am a little cautious about the comment above, as I have not seen Batman begins, but this movie certainly beat all of the earlier super-hero movies I have seen, and several that came after. The success of this movie came from the focus on human relationships and in particular on the story of Rogue as she comes to terms with her, rather scary, power, her place in society and her relationships with others. Because Singer took the time to build up our rapport for Rogue, the later events, where she comes into danger and the rest of the team come together to support her, have much more emotional resonance than I found in any of the Superman/Spiderman movies.<br/><br/>Of course it also delivers all of the action and effects that we expect in a superhero movie, along with an engaging villain or two, and a devious plot that only becomes clear as the movie progresses.<br/><br/>A very solid opening round for the X-Men franchise, that unfortunately was not followed up on with the same flair."
"Lord_Crypto","9","0","1","29 September 2007"," First Good Comic Book movie in a long time
","X-men is the first good comic book movie in a long time. It began the Marvel age of movies and was a precursor to other Marvel movies such as Spider-man, Hulk, Daredevil, etc. Bryan Singer brought a fresh and original style to this film which made it a great movie and a great start to the Marvel age of movies.<br/><br/>The casting of X-men is one of the film's best characteristics. Patrick Stewart is perfect as Charles Xavier. Hugh Jackman brings a ferocity and laid back attitude to his character Wolverine which is fantastic. Rebecca Romijin delivers a terrific performance as Mystique and Ray Park is excellent as a repulsive and sick Toad. James Marsden, Famke Janseen, Anna Paquin, Tyler Mane, and Bruce Davison all deliver great performances as well. The standout actor is Ian McKellan as Magneto. He captures the seriousness, vibrancy, anger, and devotion of his character perfectly. His portrayal of Magneto is one of the best movie villain interpretations of all time and no better actor could have been picked for the role.<br/><br/>I really like the story behind the movie. The X-men must face off against the Brotherhood of (Evil) Mutants. Each of which is a distinct team of mutants fighting for a different goal. The X-men wish to protect humanity which of course ultimately hates and fears them. The Brotherhood looks to ""destroy"" mankind for the same reason. Each team is driven based on their own personal beliefs and experiences. The thing I love about the X-men movies is that it is more than just a battle of good and evil like Spider-man. It is a battle for acceptance and once you see the movie, you should be able to understand exactly what I am talking about.<br/><br/>X-men has one of the best opening scenes to a movie. Not only is it a great way to start the film but it is a great way to introduce Magneto's character. So much can be shown about Magneto's character in just that 5 minute scene. I love the way Singer started the movie.<br/><br/>Bryan Singer does such a great job in bringing the X-men to the big screen. He captures the teams spirit, the characters attitudes, and the moral beliefs of what everyone is fighting for. Not just what the mutants are fighting for, but also what mankind is fighting for. The X-men make such a great film in that the issues behind them make for a compelling and meaningful movie."
"brando647","7","0","1","11 September 2007"," Good? Yes. Uncanny? Not so much...
","I have never been more excited to see a movie than when I first heard that they were going to release a film based on my favorite comic book characters, the X-Men. I remember I watched the trailer online twice a day for the last two weeks before its nationwide release. I was there opening night with my friends and was blown away. They brought these fantastic characters to the big screen, and they did it well. And it was this movie that opened the floodgates for more comic book movies to come forth.<br/><br/>One thing I had to overcome when watching the movie was that it's not the X-Men as I know them, per se. They're a Bryan Singer-ized version. Keep in mind, that's not entirely a bad thing. Singer and the writers kept a majority of the comic intact when translating it to film, but there are differences. If you can look past some inconsistencies, as with any book-to-movie conversion, then the movie is definitely good fun. The visual effects were spectacular, from Wolverine's claws to Cyclops's optic blasts, and the fight scenes were great. The cast is near perfect and some seem born for the roles (i.e. Patrick Stewart as Professor Xavier or Sir Ian McKellan as Magneto).<br/><br/>I don't really have too much that bothered me about the movie (aside from the minor changes mentioned above). I thought the majority of the movie was too dark (I'm referring to light, not subject matter). There were a lot of scenes at night or in dimly-lit rooms/caves and I felt like it gave the movie a very heavy, serious feel. While I believe the movie should be serious, I also think that it should have some more exuberant lighting to keep with that extraordinary, comic-feel (Note, I said ""extraordinary"", not ""over-the-top"" or ""campy""). The X-Men may tackle some serious subject matter at times, but they still had their lighter moments.<br/><br/>My only other problem was that it felt the movie tended to drag on, despite it's short running time (barely 100 minutes). It seemed at times as if the story was slowing down to a crawl. Another action sequence may have given it the kick it needs to keep its pace, but the movie never fully stalls. It stills keeps you engaged until the finale.<br/><br/>Overall, Bryan Singer did a good job. This is an awesome way to kick off the X-Men franchise and open the doors for future comic book-based films. I was completely satisfied when I walked out of the theater in 2000 and I'm still satisfied when I watch it today. Now that Singer has a feel for the characters and actors, things will only get better as the X-Men continue into the future."

"my_dad_hussles_mooses","8","0","1","4 July 2007"," Groundbreaking comic book movie
","OK so Blade came slightly before it, but this was the first in the current wave of comic book movies to really hit the mark. It also remains one of the best despite being almost 7 years old now. Improvements in technology, a big budget, a willingness to splash out on star names and a decision to take the source material seriously all contribute to the success of Bryan Singer's blockbuster. The decision to focus on the more iconic Xmen from the 70s rather than the original Xmen lineup from the 60s was definitely the right one. Comic movies are as dependant on the villains as they are the heroes and again, Bryan Singer has made a good selection. Along with Magneto we see Sabretooth, Mystique and rather less impressively the lesser known but older foe Toad. Hugh Jackman made his name as Wolverine, a mutant with little memory of his past who seems to be at the centre of a devilish scheme hatched by the evil terrorist mutant Magneto(Ian Mckellen)and his Brotherhoor of Mutants. He is rescued from an attempted kidnapping by Charles Xavier's (Patrick Stuart) Xmen, a group dedicated to protecting mankind despite it's fear and loathing of mutants such as themselves. The stellar cast is rounded up by Halle Berry who plays Xman Storm, in a role that isn't quite what it could be as the character remains largely undeveloped. This is a bit of problem with the film as there are so many super powered characters for the viewer to get to know several of them go under nourished in back story and characterisation. This could be a blessing however as if we had to get to know the ins and outs of each of them we'd never get started on the actual story. To keep fans of the comic series happy there is a smattering of lesser known Xmen that we see in small roles and in the background throughout including Iceman and Shadowcat. A big blockbuster such as this relies on special fx to get noticed and shock and awe the audience and Xmen's do not disappoint. Particularly of note is Mystique and her transformations, as well as some mild body horror involving a liquifying senator. These FX were incedible at the time and still stand up today. Another crucial ingredient of the comic book film is the action sequence, and Xmen has them in bulk. The fighting itself is a bit Wire Fu for my tastes and has a strong Matrix influence. People tend to fly up the air for quite a distance with minimal provocation and it all looks a bit silly in places. This contrasts with the sequel which was rougher and harder hitting. That said there are some impressive set pieces such as the final battle inside the Statue Of Liberty and a scene involving Magneto, the police and lots of guns. A big hit and deservedly so, Xmen caters to the tastes of the comic book fans, but alters the story enough to make it enjoyable for the wider audience. This would be enjoyable for fans who are a notoriously difficult group to please whilst not being alien to people who've never heard of the Xmen before. A triumph."

","Once upon a time, director Brian Singer (The Usual Suspects) pitched a very ambitious X-Men to the studio, a $175 million extravaganza including all of the characters from the comic book (some to be entirely computer-generated). But the studio quickly clipped Singer's wings, demanding he keep production costs down. I suppose you get what you pay for.<br/><br/>For instance, the filmmakers wanted the plot to revolve around Wolverine - a muscle-bound mutant with razor-sharp metal claws. Instead the studio gave them an actual wolverine, a small but ferocious woodchuck-type creature. To make it worse, they weren't able to pay for a professional wolverine handler, so throughout the film you see one of the other X-Men carrying Wolverine around in a small cage. During the few scenes when Wolverine actually gets into the action, they just use a stuffed wolverine and clever editing. And don't jump on me for nitpicking - it's pretty noticeable. The animal in the cage is brown, with dark eyes. When it's out, all the sudden it's bright red and makes a giggling sound when somebody touches it. There are rumors they used a Tickle Me Elmo doll for the part.<br/><br/>Singer also wanted the popular character Cyclops (who in the comic has a visor that unleashes a devastating beam) to play a major role in the film. The studio replaced that character with StareMaster, a featureless man with the superhuman ability to stare motionlessly at an object for days at a time. StareMaster is played by a department store mannequin.<br/><br/>There are other complaints, more than I can get into here. The character of Storm (Halle Berry) no longer has the ability to control the weather (as she does in the comic) but can now only observe the weather. There's one scene at the beginning where she displays her ""power,"" and it goes something like this:<br/><br/>Rain slowly begins to fall on the group of X-Men.

The in-X-plicable budget limits the studio set on the X-Men are also the reason why the film has a grade C cast; for the part of Dr. X, the filmmakers wanted Patrick Stewart (Star Trek: The Next Generation) but instead got Patrick Swayze (Road House). For super bad-guy Magneto they wanted classical actor Ian McKellan (Apt Pupil), but got Dom Deluise (Cannon Ball Run 2).<br/><br/>Well, I say from now on if you're gonna do a big-time comic book movie, do it right.

Its suspenseful, breathtaking film-making by the one and only Brian Singer... i recently saw X-3 and think some people are being harsh about it.

","X-Men (2000) X-Men is an entertaining flick. This is not you typical ""comic book"" flick. X-Men is an energy romp that also sends a message. The X-Men, led by Charles Xavier stand to fight against the Brotherhood led by Magneto to save mankind, despite being oppressed by normal humans. The X-Men want to allow humans to understand that this is mere evolution and that mutants despite the obvious powers are no different than humans and were born humans. The Brotherhood wish to wipe out the humans who believe that humans will never understand and will always oppress mutants.<br/><br/>The performances are nearly great. Hugh Jackman nailed Wolverine. From the look all the way down to the personality. As Logan, who has no idea who he is, has a rough personality hiding the fact that he is alone. Another great performance is Patrick Stewart as Professor X. He acts with great conviction. Solid casting here.<br/><br/>There are drawbacks also. Halle Berry camps it up. Not the best performance here. Not terrible but campy. Another drawback is the lack of character development for X-Men: Storm and Cyclops. Cyclops is the leader with storm in second in command. A little back story would be nice.<br/><br/>A few more drawbacks: The Brotherhood. The only one who actually has a character is Magneto. Toad has no lines, Sabertooth barely says anything same with Mystique. As if all except Magneto are just pawns. A little background would be great.<br/><br/>Despite that, The movie is entertaining. A group of heroes who fight for the world despite being oppressed. Humans fear what they do not understand.<br/><br/>The Last Word: A fun movie. X-Men is filled with a solid plot, lots of energy and stylish battles. Lack of character development brought that rating down a few notches. I would like to know more about the heroes and villains. Makes them interesting. Otherwise they seem like nothing more than pawns."

","This movie is the achievement all comicbook movies should look up to. The casting is perfect. None of the performances are forced or cheesy. Every character is treated respectfully by Singer and their respective actor. Hugh Jackman brings a unique and different aspect to the character of Wolverine, but he still holds true to the original essence of the character. Certain aspects could use touch-ups. Halle Berry's wig just makes her character comical and distracts from what was a good performance. And, the story leaves Cyclops, Scott Summers, out in the dust as far as things to do. As the leader of the team his role needed to be bigger. More action and drama. Length and timing are perfect and the writing is to die for in this film. Despite its length, only an hour and forty some minutes, everything is taken to its conclusion without rushing. Singer brought the X-Men to film in the best way possible. Kudos."

","I knew about the ""X-Men"" graphic novels but never read them. Although I did find the movie fairly interesting, mainly because it shows how Sen. Kelly (Bruce Davison) tries to create a McCarthy-style fear of mutants. I guess that for the most part, this movie is not much different from other superhero movies, but worth seeing as a cultural reference. It was surprising to see Ian McKellen go from ""Gods and Monsters"" to this. A particularly funny scene is when Cyclops (James Marsden) has to verify Wolverine's (Hugh Jackman) identity. This movie does make one grow to respect mutants.<br/><br/>So why do you ask questions to which you already know the answer?"

","A world of mutants collide as there are the good guys (led by Patrick Stewart, Famke Janssen and Halle Berry), the bad guys (led by Ian McKellen, Tyler Mane and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos) and those trying to figure out their place in society (Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin). A U.S. politician (Bruce Davison) tries to make mutants outcasts, but his plan goes awry when McKellen has a deviant scheme to turn the entire planet into a diverse mutant race. ""X-Men"" will be difficult to follow for those not highly versed with the popular DC Comics. The movie feels like it starts in the middle of its story and the lacking background is a huge minus. None of the characters are very well developed and the potentially fascinating premise takes a backseat to loads of special effects and crazed action sequences. Stylish and somewhat interesting but poorly developed and only minimally realized, director Bryan Singer's picture does not mark the spot for cinematic greatness. 2.5 out of 5 stars."

","If you are a fan of the popular comics about the mutant super heroes, then you'll love this movie. It is mainly focused on Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman) who meets outcast mutant Rogue/Marie D'Ancanto (The Piano's Anna Paquin) and they both go to a secret place which has all young and old mutants studying, and of course, the headquarters of The X-Men. Patrick Stewart plays Professor Charles Xavier, the commander of The X-Men, he believes that Rogue and Wolverine can be part of the team, along with Jean Grey (GoldenEye's Famke Janssen), Scott Summers/Cyclops (James Marsden), Ororo Munroe/Storm (Halle Berry).

","There are certain types of movies that catch peoples attentions, they don't always have the biggest stars or the best known director (of course some people haven't heard of any directors other than Spielberg.) For example who before X-Men had heard of Brian Singer? I know I hadn't, his films before directing the movies with the mutants range from the Usual Suspects to Lions Den since then of course he went on to direct X2 and is currently working on another comic book movie in Superman Returns. Actor wise X-men does offer a lot of big names Patrick (Star Trek) Stewart, Ian McKellan and Halle Berry add to the list that is mainly led by the story of Hugh Jackmans Wolverine character.<br/><br/>After the little tale of Magnetos past X-Men starts off in a nice quiet town where very little happens, teens fall in love and have their first kiss and put there would be boyfriends into comasÂ….at least that is what happens on the day a young girl finds she's a mutant runs away from home and calls herself Rogue. Meeting up with a man in a bar isn't always a good thing, especially for a young girl but never the less that's just what she does when she meets the hulking Logan commonly referred as Wolverine, bring in the remaining X-Men and mutants who don't take the same hero look as them and you get an action packed movie that has not only spawned a sequel but a second and possible spin offs too.<br/><br/>In all this movie was probably more along the lines to the comics than some of the latest superhero outings (although I admit I never read most, but I'm going off what others have said) However I was impressed by this movie immensely and cannot wait to see the third instalment, and although Jackman plays Wolverine amazingly I would like to see the story revolve a little around another character than the previous two."
"mhajs","7","0","1","7 April 2005"," It's good, but the second movie is much better!
","*** out of ****<br/><br/>I first watched this movie on theaters in 2000, but only now I have rented it and I'm ready to make a review. I never was that fan of comic books or super heroes, never even read those books or watched the animated series. So this review is based on a writer who is making a review of the movie alone with no references at all to the comic books or animated series. Well, maybe, just a bit.<br/><br/>When X-Men came out to the theaters, I remember people were really excited. There was a boy who was almost dying in his chair before the movie even began, because of the excitement he was having and he even said: ""This movie is gonna explode!"" Well, the movie began. In the first movie, we see characters like Wolwerine, Cyclops, Storm, Prof. Xavier, Magneto and some others, just to name the most famous ones. I really liked the cast of the movie, Halle Berry is not that bad as Storm as she is in other movies, but even so, Storm was a very easy role she took. Special effects add a lot to her performance, as she stroked Toad (Ray Park) with a thunder while her face was built on glowing white eyes and wind blowing through her hair. In this movie, we may say that Berry is not that bad, but it's not that great. The others are much greater. Starting with Prof. Xavier (Patrick Stewart) and Magneto (Ian McKellen), these two really perform seriously like they were the same characters from the novel. Magneto may not be looking physically the same way as in the comic books or the animated series, but still, the performance was what count the most. And the special effects and costumes a lot also. Oh, I almost forgot about Rogue (Anna Panquin). The screams she was known for to win the Oscar for best actress in a supporting role in The Piano (1993) are here in this movie too, in the beginning of it, when she first meet with her special powers. Wolwerine (Hugh Jackman) is great also, but I still think that his hair in the movie is horrible. It was a great hair for the animated series, but for the movie, it just seems a little weird and ugly. The only time his hair is actually good (or as we may say, natural) is when he wakes up from the bed in the scene where Jean Grey (Fanke Janssen) is about to give him a shot. She's also great in the movie and beautiful the same way she is in GoldenEye (1995).<br/><br/>Well, all performances were great, special effects and all too. So, what am I complaining about? Well, I liked the plot and the school introduction too, even so, the plot seems to have been a little simple and the action is not that great. Maybe it was, but I really guess that the second movie was much greater. There are many more action sequences, the movie is longer, and more characters are introduced. It was a nice start for a marvel movie. But you should really watch X-Men, maybe if you are an X-Men fan, or maybe if you just want to see the movie, but the main reason in my opinion is that you should watch it just to watch X2 later on."

","First of all I don't read X-Men comics, but knew some other favorite characters like Spiderman, Hulk from it's company Marvel. When I heard something about this movie that, based on some fire popping sunglass man, and some other superheroes team like G.I.Joe, I thought to miss that Hollywood Chink. But years later when I saw this movie I was Blown away.<br/><br/>X-Men (Spoilers******) <br/><br/>Directed by Bryan Singer tells the first silver screen adaptation of Marvel comics flick X-Men. After millions and millions of years, evolution has gone up so far that it created a new race called Mutants, a type of species superior than ours Homo Sapiens. Humans hates and fears such paranormal super powered individuals, making a new discrimination among peoples. While the U.S government going on a thick discussion on this matter, a powerful mutant called Magneto decides to end the discrimination among the people by following his dream project. His idea is to transform all humans into mutants by a machine he invented with the help of an energy absorbing power source.<br/><br/>For that he has to go through his former friend Professor Xavier, a super-psychic mutant who believes that humans and mutants can live together in a peaceful world. He formed a mutant group called X-Men who helps for the goodwill of the world. For a good future of the both races X-Men finds Magneto and his evil mutants as their enemies. But things went wrong when a strange man named Logan and a girl called Rouge came between them.<br/><br/>Scripted by David Hayter for the story of Tom DeSanto and Bryan Singer himself tells the cinematic version of Stan Lee's creation. They really work hard to bring up the sci-fi universe with the backdrop of present world. I like the way they take on Wolverine's storyline blended with the main story and actor Hugh Jackman is so perfect for the part. He really looked as the Human version of Sean Chen's comics sketched Wolverine.<br/><br/>Also the soul created for X-Men was from legendary music genius Michael Kamen making the immerse of real world in futuristic tones. The other people who steal the show were Rebecca Romijn as shape shifting Mystique, Bruce Davison as Senator Kelly, and Darth Maul-Ray Park as Toad. All other were just OK or not perfect for the part, including old man Ian McKellen, teenage girl Anna Paquin. The Biggest loss occurred was Sabertooth, the movie reduced him to an angry monster even though Tyler Mane was perfect in the role, but the comic book version portrayed the character as a smart villain with animal instinct or someone like the WWE wrestler Triple H persona.<br/><br/>I will give this movie 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>A great movie that makes a non-fan to read X-Men comics."

","Hugh Jackman is Wolverine. I have loved the character ever since I watched the animated series as a kid. Even though nobody else in the X-Men gets anywhere near the same amount of attention, I don't really mind, but I am biased. James Marsden is not Cyclops. He can't match Wolverine's presence. It makes you wonder why Jean stays with him. Patrick Stewart is Professor X which is good, because Yul Brenner is dead and Billy Zane is all wrong for the role. Few men can pull off the no hair look. The rest of the cast is not bad, although we need back stories. The one thing that disturbs me about this movie is how neat and shiny everything is. It looks fake, it feels cold. The simple silver metal, the plain black costumes, and the drab colors make the movie almost depressing. The fight between Wolverine is and Mystique is my favorite scene. I think this is a good start to a series."

","Die hard fans will probably be disappointed with some of the changes. Those new to the X-Men will probably not appreciate it as much. But all in all, Bryan Singer did a great job. <br/><br/>It couldn't have been easy to adapt 40+ years of character and environment development into 104 minutes. But Singer rose to the challenge. <br/><br/>People who don't read comic books don't understand that it is so much more than childish amusement. My English teacher referred to it as all spectacle and no depth. ""Flash, boom, crash"" But if that were true, any comic book would do. However, the various X-Men books have held on to spots in the top ten sellers for many years. This is because they speak to the human condition. Sure it's exaggerated, but that's how they get their point across. <br/><br/>Any good story is first and foremost about people and how they deal with their situation. Movie, book, comic; sci-fi, drama, action. They are merely the vehicle by which the human condition is explored and no one genre is inferior to the other. Only the storyteller is inferior. <br/><br/>X-Men is about family through friendship, loyalty, betrayal, being an outcast and finding your place, death, overcoming, sorrow, happiness, anger, bitterness, love, and how our experiences shape us. It is about human beings. <br/><br/>When Bryan Singer set out to make the movie, he might have changed some superficial things (I was not a fan a Halle Barry's Storm), but he kept the core the same. And that is what makes this a great movie and adaptation. <br/><br/>Too truly enjoy this movie, look not to the action (which is great) or the special effects (which are superb), they are only window dressing. Look to the interaction between the characters. Listen to the words they say. Watch their emotions. They are human, and humans can relate to them."

","This 2000 film directed and written by Bryan Singer packs a wallop.  It's all about mutants and mutant terrorists who finally fight their battle on and around the Statue Of Liberty.  Terrific photography here and quite impressive stunts.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that Hugh Jackman shines in his incredible playing of Wolverine, a mutant.  His agility, looks and characterization was flawless.  I loved watching him when he was stalking his prey.  Heard him in an interview saying he based this on early acting exercizes relating to animals.  In this it was a wolf. Have seen this actor in several films as well as the Broadway musical, THE BOY FROM OZ, and he never ceases to amaze me with his talent.  Go, Hugh! Then there's the distinguished Ian McKellen as Magento, the arch vilain of villains.  He's so good.  Patrick Stewart, who plays on the opposite side as Professor X, doesn't fare as well.  Stewart, I felt a bit flat in his performance.  Also on the good guys side are the handsome James Marsden as Cyclops, who has the ability of wiping out people and such just by looking at them, Halle Berry as Storm, in long platinum hair, who has the ability to fly and flash lightening bolts at her prey.  Another distinguished actor, Bruce Davison, plays a Senator who is sacrificed for the cause.  The three evil accomplices to Magento are Tyler Mane as a wolfman/caveman type bully, Ray Park as a toad like guy who can jump to ceilings and making use of his extended tongue to grab hold of objects, buildings and people and finally the lovely Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, all in blue nude, who is able to transfer herself into any other character in the film.<br/><br/>The one disappointing feature in this is Anna Paquin who plays Rogue, a young girl who seems to have the ability to kill people by her touch. I got annoyed with her and kept wishing she'd fade away.  Fortunately, we don't see that much of Paquin.  See this flick and watch for Jackman's career to rise.  This guy is stupendous!"

","(spoilers **)<br/><br/>I've read some of the comments about this movie and I've had plenty of discussions with my movie friends about it.  I think this movie was very good, but it did have one major problem.....The Budget!!<br/><br/>Since this movie was filmed in Toronto I know some of the people who worked on it.  They told me of scenes that were supposed to be in the movie that were cut out for budget reasons.  It seemed to me that most of the scenes where the mutants would use their powers seemed staged.  Like this is going to be the Magneto lifting car scene.  And this is going to be the Storm using lighting scene.  Storm flew only once in the whole movie!<br/><br/>
When I saw Spider-man last summer I noticed that he used his powers in a very natural way.  He used them all the time.  And I said to myself, that is what X-men was missing.<br/><br/>What makes the second X-men so much better is that the budget was huge. The Mutants used their powers in a much more natural way.  Hence, more action scenes.  Also bigger budget means more mutants.<br/><br/>What I loved about this movie was the script.  The dialogue between Professor X and Magneto were amazing (especially there first exchange). The acting was excellent (Stewart, McKellan)  on the whole. (except for Halle and Anna) And the fact that the two leaders of the Mutants are friends and yet they fight for different ideologies.<br/><br/>If you like X2 go back and take another look at X-men.  The same people were involved with both, so how could one be so much better than the other??<br/><br/>Budget."

","After several years of low- life, minor comic book movies X- Men came along and made a huge splash. Two years later, Spider- Man came out also making a huge deal. X- Men sparked the comic book movie generation, and is probably the best one to date. It's much more character- driven and focused on plot then any other comic book movie I've seen so far. David Hayter's script is quite good, covering all the characters extensively and not really paving the way for a sequel as openly as movies such as Spider- Man. Bryan Singer's direction is focused and hard, making the camera constantly focused on the characters and the conflicts they face each day as the mutants are feared and hated more and more. The cast is led by Hugh Jackman in his superb performance by Wolverine, and is mainly supported by Ann Paquin, Ian Mckellen, and Patrick Stewart. They all turn in refined and believable performances, especially for a comic book movie. Also in support, though with much minor roles are Famke Jansens, James Marsden, Halle Berry, and Ray Park. They're all solid, except for Marsden and Berry who turn in some very cliche and weak lines with poor acting. The sequel to X- Men came out earlier this month and I have to say, it's on par with the first one. Unfortunately, this movie lacks enough action to drive it to be fully enjoyable. Some of the lines as mentioned above are too weak to be fully believable. ""Do you know what happens when a Toad gets struck by lightening?"" for example. 8/10"
"Comiccritic83","10","0","1","9 May 2003"," THE SECOND BEST FILM EVER AND BETTER THAN ""X2""!!!
","5/9/2003<br/><br/>
PLEASE NOTE: THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!! DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE FILM!!!<br/><br/>
Still with me? Good.<br/><br/>
I decided to review this film now, because, even though it's been three years since it was released, it seemed appropriate with the recent release of its current sequel now in theaters, ""X2"".<br/><br/>""X2"" was big on effects, but its predecessor, the 2000 film ""X-Men"", is better because it was big on character development and an easier-to-follow plot. People will say ""X2"" is better: don't believe them. There's no forced humor, there's a better representation of its cast (not as cluttered as it was in ""X2"") and the music, done by Michael Kamen in this film, is better than the music John Ottman did for ""X2"".<br/><br/>Kamen's music in particular is under-appreciated. It has action and heroic tones, but also softer and emotional ones as well (just hear ""Logan and Rogue"", a.k.a. the song heard when Wolverine revives Rogue on the torch of the Statue of Liberty - it's arguably one of the best samples of musical score I have ever heard).<br/><br/>Anyway, the plot is simple enough. The team of X-Men (consisting of Patrick Stewart as the telepathic wheelchair-bound founder Professor Xavier; the under-used James Marsden as Scott Summers/Cyclops, the team's visor-clad field leader who fires heatless energy beams from his eyes; Famke Janssen as Cyclops' fiancee, the telepathic and telekinetic Dr. Jean Grey; and the under-used Halle Berry as the weather-controlling Ororo Munroe/Storm) come to the aid of two fellow mutants.<br/><br/>The two mutants the X-Men meet, mind you, are a 17-year-old runaway named Marie/Rogue (the under-used, but lovely and talented Anna Paquin), who drains the memories and powers of others by skin-to-skin contact, and the fast-healing but gruff Canadian named Logan/Wolverine (Hugh Jackman, who pulls off the lead role perfectly). The X-Men encounter the duo after a mutant named Victor Creed/Sabretooth (Tyler Mane) attacks them in Canada, so they bring Rogue and Logan to their mansion-sized school to keep them safe.<br/><br/>You see, Sabretooth works for the Brotherhood of Mutants, led by Xavier's former friend and current enemy Erik Lehnsherr/Magneto (Sir Ian McKellen, who is one of the best performers in this film). The blue-skinned, shape-shifting Raven Darkholme/Mystique (the VERY under-used Rebecca Romijn-Stamos, complete with only one line of dialogue in the whole film) and the green-skinned, slimy, long-tongued Toad (Ray Park, bouncing around with evil glee) round out the Brotherhood roster.<br/><br/>You see, Magneto has a machine he uses to mutate humans into mutants. To test it out, he mutates the mutant-hating Senator Robert Kelly (Bruce Davison), the man who wants to administrate the Mutant Registration Act that would identify mutants' names and powers to the public. But the machine also drains the powers and life-force from its occupant (re: Magneto), so the Brotherhood abduct Rogue and plan to use her to power the machine from the torch of the Statue of Liberty, thus mutating every human in New York into mutants. But when the X-Men learn the machine kills humans several hours after it mutates them (Kelly dies by dissolving into a watery glob), the X-Men must save Rogue and stop the Brotherhood.<br/><br/>Got all that? Good. Now comes the praise.<br/><br/>Stewart, Paquin, McKellen, Janssen, Marsden and especially Jackman are the reasons for watching this film for their performances alone, aside from their cool moments demonstrating their mutant powers. The film also incorporates the famed rivalry of Cyclops and Wolverine over Jean Grey's affections from the comics perfectly, and the on-screen time between McKellen and Stewart is just wonderful. But the bond between Jackman's Wolverine and Paquin's Rogue is arguably the best part of the film, which is handled VERY nicely (something ""X2"", sadly, neglects to do). Their on-screen time makes the film work better, showing a perfect relationship between two very different individuals.<br/><br/>And keep your eyes out for a special cameo (no, not ""X-Men"" co-creator Stan Lee as a hot dog vendor, but good guess): look at the Statue of Liberty's head to see a certain blurred, but visible web-spinner swinging away while Wolverine is seen being blown up by Storm's hurricane to the Liberty Torch (I guess 20th Century Fox, not Columbia Pictures, actually had the first live-action, silver-screen appearance of Spider-Man in a movie). If you slow-motion it, you'll see it better.<br/><br/>But there are cons to ""X-Men"":<br/><br/>Some characters - like Storm, Cyclops and even Xavier - are underused. They don't even have back-stories (the only ones with any real back-stories are Rogue, a young Magneto at a Nazi concentration camp in the 1940s, and Logan getting the metal alloy called adamantium surgically bonded to his skeleton and the nine-inch-long claws that emerge from the knuckles of his hands).<br/><br/>The film never explains how Magneto knew of Rogue or of her powers, or even how he knew she and Logan were even in Canada. Then again, it doesn't explain how Sabretooth knew of Logan, either.<br/><br/>The film also isn't suitable for kids, because of the violence, language and sensuality. Just because the kids can see the cartoon series or comics, it doesn't mean the film version (or ""X2"") is appropriate for kids to see (it IS rated PG-13, after all).<br/><br/>And at 1 hour, 35 minutes (not including the nearly 10-minutes worth of end credits), the film is too short for such a cool action movie.<br/><br/>Regardless, ""X-Men"" is still the second best film I've ever seen, comic book based or otherwise (2002's ""Spider-Man"" is the current best film I've EVER seen -- EVER!!!).<br/><br/>Now go on and see this film. You'll be glad you did.<br/><br/>
Excelsior!"

","This ranks up there among the greatest comic book movies ever made. Thank you Bryan Singer. Thank you David Hayter. Thank you Patrick Stewart, Ian McKellan, and Hugh Jackman. And most of all, thank you Ray Park. In my eyes, you guys have done a fair bit to redeem the genre. Fans of the comic will probably find this a lot more satisfying than non-readers, though it's a pretty enjoyable movie regardless.  Hugh Jackman is incredible. He simply is Wolverine. I'm so glad they chose not to cast an established movie star in the role. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan are great as always, though the fanboy in me wants to have words with the wardrobe department about how silly Magneto's helmet looks. The biggest surprise by far is Toad. Ray Park breathes life into the pathetic little troll, turning him into an exciting, dangerous, and formidable X-Villain, even paying homage to his Darth Maul role for a moment. Magneto's lackey no more, he was beyond a doubt my favorite character in the movie.<br/><br/> I'd only venture some minor critiques. Firstly, we all know how  that one line of Storm's is. You know the one I mean. It's not Halle's fault entirely I guess, but it still makes me cringe every time I hear it. And Storm's character wasn't nearly developed enough in the first place. Then there's Magneto's plan. Though it does make sense and provides an interesting plot, it's just not his style. Genetic-engineering and DNA manipulation is Mr. Sinister's bag. Other than that, it's all good. 8/10."

","The X-Men movie didn't live up to my expectations. No, it far succeeded them and we can thank this wonderful movie for giving the superhero genre a shot in the arm.<br/><br/>This movie has been adapted extremely well for the big screen and the characters playing the parts are totally perfect. For example, Patrick Stewart IS Professor X and Hugh Jackman is totally Wolverine. And what can I say about Ian McKellan as Magneto?<br/><br/>The costumes for the X-Men changed for this movie but I think when adapting superheroes to the big screen, it can be corny if you use the comic book costume. Black suited these characters far better.<br/><br/>The storyline was very good as the good mutants battled the bad mutants to try and save a world which didn't care if every mutant on the planet died.<br/><br/>
I think a lot of comic book characters can teach us a thing or two. The X-Men is about bigotry and in a way I guess it is asking us to put aside our prejudices and to look inside a person. The X-Men are distrusted and hated because they have been born different; the world forgets that they are unique human beings with feelings and emotions. They have an illogical hatred of the mutants simply because of how they were born.<br/><br/>In a way, the X-Men is indicative of the world we live in where people kill each other on a daily basis simply because the other person has a different colour skin or follows a different faith. There are people out there who do judge other people on skin colour or religious faith and form an illogical hatred of said people without thinking that each person is different, that each person has their own dreams and ambitions and hopes and fears.<br/><br/>This is what I believe the X-Men teaches us. But all things aside, the X-Men is an action packed movie that did well and gave the studios the green light to make more superhero movies."

","As a fan of ""X-Men"" the comic book for years, I was skeptical about how the movie would turn out once it was made.  The thing I kept in mind was that they would stay somewhat faithful to the book.  For the most part, Bryan Singer did this for X-Men, with some small exceptions.  The costumes were changed to all black leather ~ ala Matrix, but it was all good.  Wolverine was about a foot taller than what he was supposed to be, and Jean Grey was much older than what she was supposed to be, but the thing is, Singer made this work.  I guess my only real complaint is that the movie was cut way too short.  This movie could have easily been two hours and I probably would have enjoyed it just as much, if not more than what I had for what I saw. All I can remember is that my only thought was ""I can't wait for the sequel.""  Christmas 2002 baby!"
"BaronBl00d","Null","0","1","19 September 2001"," Entertaining Comic Caper
","X-Men is a fun, fantastic, and futuristic look at what life might be like if human beings were surrounded with mutants(people that possess special powers).  Created from the famous Marvel Comics, Bryan Singer directs this material with a golden hand, turning what many might consider comic fodder into screen magic.  The special effects are wonderful and play a large part in the film, but what really sets this film off from others of its like is its very humanistic approach to different philosophical viewpoints with regard to evil and good.  Lots of grey here as the primary villain is a man that has seen evil in his own life and has grown to be distrustful of mankind in general. Ian McKellen plays the complex Magneto with a rich aplomb for finesse.  His scenes are probably the most entertaining, yet he is ably assisted by all the actors concerned.  Patrick Stewart does an equally good job as Professor Xavier.  Stewart and McKellen are two reasons why this film rises above the material.  Class acts.  Wolverine is played by relative unknown Hugh Jackman, who has a kinetic screen presence.  He does a wonderful job with his role as do Anna Paquin, and all others concerned. This is a great way to spend ninety minutes!"

","After watching the TV series & reading some of the comics, I was eager to see this film. I was not disappointed. They had simplified it of course but the characters were recognisable. Logan & Magneto are my favourites. They and the other mutants were brilliantly cast. The special effects were amazing. I couldn't get enough of Wolverine's claws. The plot was well worked out but as usual I wanted to side with Magneto. I respect him much more than Xavier. His attitude towards humans is understandable and he really does want to aid his fellow mutants. Perhaps some of his methods are a little extreme but I don't think he's evil as such. Xavier on the other hand is just too nice. But it's the fact that he and Magneto are such opposites that makes the relationship between them so interesting. Their scenes together send chills up the spine.   <br/><br/>Of course it's Logan who drives the plot forward. His affection for Rogue, his hatred for Cyclops & his lust for Jean Grey provide many memorable moments. His claws do the rest. I can't wait for the sequel. 9/10"

"the red duchess","5","0","2","18 October 2000"," Well-intentioned.
","'X-Men' does have its own integrity as a Bryan Singer film, showing continuity with 'The Usual Suspects' - bleak subversion of a popular genre; the vision of an America tainted by the decadance of Europe, a world run by tired old men; the creation of the world by a dubiously motivated power-broker (Verbal creates his film's world by words; Professor X by his mind).  The sets are nice and austere.  There are moments of pleasant Surrealism, and my instinct applauds the opening concentration camp sequence, even if my head says no.  But acting, action, plot, character, dialogue, inspiration, fantasy, awe?  Movies are too cool to bother with that kind of thing any more."
"rdarlington","Null","0","1","24 August 2000"," Not in same class as ""The Matrix""
","I love science fiction and fantasy films because they are the most escapist of movies and best differentiate the cinema from other art forms like the theatre. So I really looked forward to the `X-Men' and hoped that it would come close to the brilliance of `The Matrix', but sadly, while there are some excellent special effects and a few thrills, it is not in the same class. <br/><br/>Certainly it is a visual treat with no less than ten superb looking mutant characters with a variety of spectacular powers. Newcomer Australian Hugh Jackman is particularly convincing as the metallicly-enhanced Wolverine, but overall the casting is fascinating and includes once child star Anna Pacquin from `The Piano', the British Shakespearean actors Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen, and three former models, Halle Berry (`The Flintstones'), Famke Janssen (`GoldenEye'), and Rebecca Romijn-Stamos. <br/><br/>However, the film lacks effective pacing and compelling narrative, with the damsel in distress ending being particularly weak. At least the message is more meaningful and liberal than most SF movies: mutants Â– like ethnic minorities, or all groups who are perceived as different - can be good or bad and we should not be too quick to judge."

","I did not read X-men as a kid. I never heard of the characters until I saw the movie fragments. Nevertheless, I am a sci-fi fan, and I saw the movie in its first day. What I felt during the movie was not mentioned by the other critics, so here it goes.  <br/><br/>I am sure some clueless people may be surprised to hear this, but females don't go to see a movie to see the great special effects, or action scenes. Even though I see all the sci-film films, the ones I truly enjoy are the ones that have the touch of some romanticism, some degree of attraction between characters. This is why I and all the females I know enjoyed Mission impossible II better than I (Not a representative sample, but still...) My bf says romanticism is like a very important side dish to me. I don't like it by itself, but it has to be present with the main course for me to enjoy the dinner. From this perspective, X-men sucked. I am not saying there should have been new romantic interests developed between wolverine and rogue (I wouldn't mind this, but fans would go mad). I am saying, if Dr. Jane Grey is the love interest of cyclops, I have to be able to see this during the film. There was no attraction between the two, and she was flirting with wolverine (very unconvincingly). It was a mediocre film for me, but not because of its action sequences."

This movie clearly focused on Magneto's hatred and fear of humanity and humanity at large's hatred and fear of mutants in general.  The side stories of Jean Grey/Cyclops/Wolverine and Wolverine/Rogue were well handled and really brought the characters to life for me.  I've seen some comments complaining there were 'inside' jokes that only fans of the comic books would get; huh? excuse me?

","AFTER WAITING 15 YEARS (ever since the comic book became a monthly must read) I am pleasantly surprised at how satisfied I am with the new movie.<br/><br/>The actions scenes are well directed and the special effects stand up to post-Matrix expectations.  But the movie's strongest asset is its actors - particularly Hugh Jackman (Wolverine) and Anna Paquin (Rogue).   Who knew that an unknown Aussie and the girl from the Piano would be able to steal the show from Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellan.  Jackman and Paquin have an amazing chemistry - sometimes sexual other times fraternal.  Stewart and McKellan bring dignity to their roles (as always) and you leave the film wishing the two had more scenes together.<br/><br/>Cheers to Bryan Singer and everyone else involved.

"dr_foreman","9","0","2","24 March 2004"," superior to the sequel
","*minor spoilers follow*<br/><br/>I know many people prefer ""X2"" because it boasts superior production values and more action, but in all the important respects - character development, measured pacing, intellectual stimulation, etc. - this film BURIES its successor.  Whereas ""X2"" collapses under the weight of a huge cast and contents itself with running helter-skelter from one battle to the next, ""X-Men"" concentrates on a few characters and takes its time setting up a fascinating universe.<br/><br/>Believe it or not, Senator Kelly is the most important character; he establishes the essential moral conflict that faces mutants and society. And while he's clearly supposed to be wrong, the film allows him to have a point.  The Brotherhood is, after all, a sinister bunch (THESE are the mutants he's worried about!), and we are clearly supposed to feel sympathy for Kelly after he is tortured and killed by them.  Ultimately, the film does have a powerful (and Liberal) message of tolerance, but it treats its message's opponent with respect, and I admire that sense of fairness.<br/><br/>Aside from all the deep stuff, the movie is also a rockin' good time. Stylish direction, nifty effects (that are not overused, as in the sequel), and a few good action sequences keep the proceedings from becoming too pompous and preachy.  Magneto's origin segment is effective, if a tad thoughtless (I'm not quite sure if it trivializes the Holocaust or not), and poor Rogue's isolation is well-conveyed.  Jackman is a cool Wolverine (I'm glad he was basically unknown), and even Cyclops and Jean Grey aren't bad. The only real loss is Halle Berry as Storm, who can't act to save her life; I haven't seen ""Monster's Ball,"" but I can hardly believe that such a wooden performer won an Oscar for another film!  Perhaps she thinks that she's too good for this material; in that case, she shouldn't have been cast.<br/><br/>That bump aside, this movie is all good.  Kamen's score is over-the-top but it fits, and is certainly more engaging than Ottman's annoying orchestral blasts in ""X2.""  Production values are solid, if already dating (the rapid advance of computer technology is such a nuisance).  There are some great set pieces, especially Magneto's confrontation with the cops.  You know, there's really nothing to complain about, except that they hacked out some good scenes that are available for viewing on the DVD releases.<br/><br/>I don't even like the ""X-Men"" comic, but I LOVE this movie.  That's a testament to how good it is.  After the dramatic final scene with Professor X and Magneto, I was jazzed for the sequel; I wanted to cheer as the closing theme music started.  Too bad I was letdown in a big way..."
"The_Wood","9","0","1","5 May 2002"," How a super-hero movie should be 9/10
","Watching Spider-Man, I found myself asking certain questions like: what went wrong?  To answer some of these, I find myself turning to the surprisingly pleasing X-men.  X-Men is superior to Spider-Man for a number of reasons. First, I like the way Bryan Singer was able to take super heros and villains, and place them into the real world.  X-Men looks and feels very authentic to me, and I like that.  Spider-Man never seemed like anything but a a cartoon that magically came to life.  X-Men does the whole origin deal quickly, you get what you need to know, and you get to see a mutant trying to come to terms with her powers (Rogue).  X-Men doesn't waste time though. It quickly introduces its villains and their reasons, and quickly introduces us to the heros that must stop them.  X-Men is about 25 minutes shorter then Spider-Man, but it seems much longer because they are able to get more valuable things done in the running time.  I was never bored in X-Men, unlike Spider-Man.  X-Men was made for much less, but the CGI is much more convincing and the action scenes play out much stronger then they do in Spider-Man.  To final things off, X-Men has a strong cast, but it benefits mostly from a stand-out performance by Hugh Jackman.<br/><br/>In closing, X-Men stands alone as a great film.  Watching Spider-Man, I found myself wondering, why can't this be more like X-Men?"
"obiwan2005","10","0","1","15 February 2003"," Perfect Adaptation
","People's main problem with 'X-Men' was that it didn't follow the comic. Well in my mind it hit the nail on the head. Tolerance was the original theme in Stan Lee's X-Men. And was played out beautifully here. The movie is about the next step of human evolution. ""Mutants"" or Homo Superior are born with special powers. And are therefore feared and hated by regular humans. Professor Charles Xaiver (Patrick Stewart) wants to look past their differences and look toward a peaceful co-exsistance. But, Magneto (Ian McKellen) another mutant wants to wipe out humans to make way for his kind. He can only see the evil of homo sapiens, and will stop at nothing to destroy them. Like Malcolm X and Dr. Martin Luther King, they both had the same agenda, the same goal, but could not see eye to eye about how to do so. And thats where the recruitment comes in. The Brotherhood(Magneto's team) and the X-Men(Xaiver's team) go head to head with each other. One set on destroying man. And the other protecting those that hate and fear them. It doesn't matter if characters were left out. Or if their wasn't enough fighting in it. The message was perfect. And thats really all that matters.<br/><br/>RATING:***1/2 out of ****"
"noivad","8","0","1","21 March 2002"," X-men brand boosts up an ok Sci-Fi Action flick/Compared to comics
","This movie did get me out to the theatre simply because it was X-men. I rented it on DVD and enjoyed it, again because it was X-men. I bought it... well you get the picture. The X-men are simply cool. I collected them when I was a kid, so I have the origins of many of these characters.<br/><br/>As a fan of the comic book I was disappointed with how they handled intros, and rearranged history. Note the lack of Nightcrwaler and Colossus, Bobby Drake (Iceman) being younger and not in the X-men, while Rogue starts out completely different... this list goes on and on. I should have hated it, but I realize in a 2 hour film you can't pack in 200 + comic books. So, with that as a given, and I forgave director Bryan Singer a bit.<br/><br/>If you can get past that, you have incredible special effects -- except where Wolverine spins around the Statue of liberty spike (shown in the trailers) that was pathetically rendered. the Special Effects nailed Cyclops' Ruby red Optic blasts, Wolverine's regenerative ability and Storm's Elemental power. Even Kitty Pryde's ability, while a relatively simple effect, is pulled off just like an X-men fan would expect. They did screw up with Mystique, but that's because she can't imitate inanimate objects, apart from clothing -- we blame that on a lazy script writer.<br/><br/>The movie has some pretty good action scenes, but not the all out multi-mutant brawls in the same area we came to expect from the comic. The danger room is missing too... though, hopefully we'll find Nightcrawler in there practicing in X-men 2.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty simple. Evil Mutant A (Magneto) has a ""Pinky and the Brain"" type of scheme the the X-men find out about and must stop. The only character development and backgrounds that are explored are for Wolverine, Rogue, Magneto and Professor Xavier -- in that order. All the other characters come off as filler and window decoration that just happens to fight. (Again hopefully rectified in X-men #2.)<br/><br/>As far as the acting and casting goes: Halle Berry was a bad casting job. Storm SHOULD have been played by Angela Basset -- no one else. Berry just wasn't convincing as a strong willed very independent person. Though she didn't have much to do. A simple 20 second scene of Storm freaking out in the elevator (she's supposed to be clausterphobic) and have a flashback to being trapped inside a collapsed house would have done it for her character. Instead she comes off with 2 lines that even sound like a hack script writer wrote them. Famke Jannsen looks great as Jean Grey, but we didn't get to see enough of her acting to tell if she'd be any good as The Phoenix (let's hope for that in movie 3 or 4.) Cyclops, was ok, but also an underdeveloped character. The real acting is done by Patrick Stewart (Xavier), Hugh Jackman (Logan/Wolverine), Ian McKellen (Magneto), and Anna Paquin (Rogue). Stewart and McKellen deliver both great acting (as always) and play the characters in line with the comics. Their lines were idealistic morality plays but a bit interesting. Jackman and Paquin come off as the confused and messed up people that the comic characters are, so they both get nods as doing good jobs.<br/><br/>All in all, this is an enjoyable picture even to those new to the X-men. There's just enough action to keep it interesting with a bit of dialog here and there to keep it from being all flash. I gave it 8 (would have given it a 7.5 if available) out of 10 because of the lack of things in it, and the lack of polish on some of the scenes. The movie could have ran 2 hours and been much better (Singer could have developed the others with that time), but I suspect Singer was aiming it towards people who have a hard time sitting still for over 90 minutes (it weighs in at the compromise time of 104 minutes).<br/><br/>I'd recommend a rental before purchase for anything, this film is no exception. Watch it a few times, if you like it buy it."

The Special effects weren't by far the best, but were not horrible either, and the storyline was also good. <br/><br/>	Now the big question: is it close to the comic book. Well....being a fan of X-men and a retired comic collector, im naturally picky, and some details were not done right. Wolverine's claws only come out when he's angry, well if it was true to the book, He's ALWAYS angry, and therefore his claws should be constantly out! Also, Storms eyes flushed white when she conjured up her powers, but her eyes were always flushed in the comic books. That's why in all of her disguises, she always wore contact lenses and sunglasses, to hide her eyes. But besides that, they did get most of the details down. 	 And then there were some things I was very disappointing in. For one, Toad was far to helpless and unimportant to the story. Not to mention, they had Ray Park playing this part and they did nothing with his talent! very upsetting. Second, The ending was disappointing. While it was setup for a sequel, it made the whole movie feel very unfinished. I think they should of thrown that whole news report at the end in one of the first scene's in the upcoming sequel, instead of making it seem as if the heros never fully accomplished their task. Third, they spent most of the time enhancing Wolverine and Rouge's characters and didn't do much with the rest of the cast. Most notably with Jean Grey, sure she healed everybody, and yeah, she had Wolverines heart pittering-paddering for her, but she used her powers maybe, what, twice? she (along with Cyclops and Gambit) was my favorite character from the book, and she didn't do as much as she could of. Storm and Cyclops were well done, The actors playing them (Halle Berry, James Marsden) were well casted, but the most Impressive casted characters were Wolverine and Professor X (Hugh Jackmon and Patrick Stewart). No one in the universe could of been better for the part. Ian McKellan was by far the best actor (as always), but he didn't seem like Megneato to me...<br/><br/>
	 Overall, very good movie, not for children though. Crude language, very violent and not to mention Mistique wears only three scales away from making the whole film R, which is a shame, because the cartoon series and a lot of the comic books were written for kids. But, still a great movie, easily picked apart by die hard fans, but what did you expect? This by far the best comic adaption (though it's looking like the upcoming movie, Spiderman is going to match it...) Can't wait for the sequel. 8/10"
"blyss","10","0","1","16 December 2001"," You gotta see this!
","I give this film a 10! It had everything.  Most of the characters were developed enough for you to understand what was going on even if you have never read the comics or watched the animated series.  The best parts for me were the funny exchanges between the characters Cyclops and Wolverine.  I also thought it was wonderful that characters were chosen that looked somewhat like the comic book characters (e.g. Hugh Jackman as Wolverine, Halle Berry as Storm, etc.)<br/><br/>Most of all, the special effects were out of this world.  I enjoyed watching special effects that did not look totally fake.  The performances were outstanding, the effects were great, what more can one ask for?:)"
"Jaguar564","Null","0","1","4 December 2001"," Good movie overall but a few problems
","If you are a fan of the comic and cartoon series you should defintely see it if you haven't. The special effects are great and the casting for most of the actors and actresses are great. Patrick Stewart was definitely born to be Professor Xavier. Ian Mckellen was nearly as a perfect as Magneto. Hugh Jackman made a very good wolverine despite the height differences.Famke Jensen was also a good Jean Grey. I heard people said she was a bit to old but she was really perfect, its just that Jean Grey has such a mature character, that she appears that way. Clyclops was ok, James Marsden did appear a bit young in comparison to Famke but they had potential. Halle Berry as a storm was a bit empty. I was not able to tell if was Halle Berry not acting well in the storm part or maybe the storm part having such few lines that Halle Berry couldn't shine. Despite that she was ok. Anna Paquin however was the worst dissapoint to me in the whole movie. She is a wonderful actress but just not for the part of Rogue. She was a bit too weak and childlish even for a teenage Rogue. She was also a lot shorter and she just couldn't portray the southern belle who everyone grew to love. Rogue even as a teen when portrayed in the comics and cartoons series was much taller, vibrant, and stronger despite not having her powers yet. On the villan side it was ok. Tylar Mane couldn't do much as sabretooth so there wasn't much to improve on. Rebecca Stamos has a much potential, and she was great as mystique along with Ray Parker as Toad. Besides the casting which was for the most part ok, there was also the plot which focused to much on wolverine. Its very hard for book to screen adaptations to focus on one plot, but superman and batman did it successfully so x-men should have. But it didn't. Despite that just seeing the x-men use their powers was great enough so I would give this movie a 7.5. Go see it, but don't be too excited. Hopefully they will do better in the sequel. Unfourtunately they can't get rid of Anna Paquin. Wonderful actress but just doesn't portray a teen rogue. Get Natalie Portman or even better Jamie Lunar, a bit older but as the southern accent going."

","it's a great movie with great action scenes, fx, characters with some depth, cute chicks and everything else that turns it to be one of the best few action flicks well done. The only problem may be that it's sometimes predictable, and too short; also it may leave you waiting for more, but soon we'll have a sequel, pretty obvious there was going to be one. Above everything it's an incredible movie where you won't waste you're time."

","I thought this movie was really good.  The only problem I had with it is as a fan of Mystique I didn't like the way she was portrayed in the film.  She was more beastial than I thought she should have been, and I thought was she was (or was not) wearing did not fit the character the way she was done in the comic books.  But, overall the film was a really good one and I would recommend it to anyone who likes the x-men comics or cartoons."
"freakezette","9","0","1","21 November 2001"," Gets this X-Fan's stamp of approval
","I can't quite explain what attracts me to X-Men but when I was 13 I became an X-Freak. I watched the cartoon religiously, I read the comics when i could find them, and even now I still like to catch an episode if X-men evolution. Naturally, I went to see X-Men the day it came out, and I love it so much. <br/><br/>Comics are touch to adapt to the big screen, especially comics with 30 years of history and a cast that make the cast of a soap opera look like a small ensemble. Not every X-fan got to see all their favorite mutants on the big screen (I still pray Gambit at least gets a cameo in the sequel) but they did do a good job of narrowing the cast down so that everyone had a good portion of screen time.<br/><br/>The casting was great, all the actors portrayed their characters perfectly: The goody two-shoes Cyclops, the brilliant Jean Grey, the alienated Rogue. The most perfect casting of all is Hugh Jackman as resident bad-ass Wolverine. Considering he wasn't the first choice and got the part out of pure luck, Hugh turns out to be the best character of all, not to mention extremely yummy.<br/><br/>This movie is great for X-Men Fans, but for non-fans as well. You don't know a thing about X-Men to enjoy this movie, which is the best kind of adaption, the kind that pleases both fans and newcomers. Great Flick!"

","Since the age of about 8, I've been a fan of the X-Men. When the film was released I eagerly awaited it. Then I saw it and thought it was good, but it needed more action. Hugh Jackman is bad ass as Wolive and his performance makes up for the lack of action."

","From the off, this is a good movie. And i'm a fan of the comics. But this was still disappointing. Anyone who has read the 'Tommorow People' arc in Ultimate X Men will know what i mean when I say that is what the movie should have been. Quick introductions fr the characters and then a rollercoaster action pic all the way. What we get is a fairly slow movie, with only a few action scenes. It has a distinct lack of bite, Senator Kelly is underused and should have been accompanied by Sentinals, but that's all my complaints. Except why Toad? Why not Gambit, Colossus, Beast, Iceman (in a real role) or Angel? There aren't nearly enough Mutants used. However the film IS the best comic book movie yet. It does have lots of good features and the special effects are nice but it'll do. It isn't bad, but it could have been brilliant."

","What do I think of this movie?<br/><br/>Why do you ask the questions of answers you already know?<br/><br/>In 1963, Stan Lee wrote and Jack Kirby illustrated a team of heroes who not only fought crime, but also the prejudices of being born with their powers. They claimed that too many radioactive spiders, cosmic ray trips and gamma bombs would spoil Marvel, so they made the X-Men mutants. In 1975, Len Wein, Chris Claremont and Dave Cockrum made a new team of X-Men. Since then, the X-Men were the greatest heroes on the greatest comics ever made. The cartoon series, featuring Cal Dodd as Wolverine, Chris Potter as Gambit, Iona Morris as Storm and Ed Buza as Beast, was the best cartoon made by Marvel(next to G.I.Joe, Transformers and Spider-Man and his Amazing Friends). Now, the movie. Patrick Stewart, Professor Xavier. Sir Ian McKellen, Erik Magnus Lensherr. Hugh Jackman, Jonathan Logan Wolfe. Anna Paquin, Maria D'Acanto. James Marsden, Scott Summers. Halle Berry, Ororo Munroe. Famke Jansen, Jean Grey. Rebecca Stamos, Raven Darkholme. Tyler Mane, Victor Graydon Creed. Reg Park, Mortimer Toynbee.<br/><br/>These actors bought the X-Men to life in spectacular manner, especially Patrick, Halle and Sir Ian, who were the best of the cast. The chemistry between the X-Men teacher and the Brotherhood's misunderstood leader was Oscar material. The action of the movie was well done, with no one team dominating the other in the climax. My problem was the dialogue. The writing staff should have read more of the X-Men comics to understand that this film had no place for Hollywood PG-13 salty language. James' Cyclops was a royal JERK! And if Sir Ian had my personality when Hugh's Logan told him that he was full of you-know-what, Wolvie's neck would be full of puncture wounds from six adamantium claws, if you know what I mean. Conclusively, the film earned a B+ from me. 8 out of 10. Uncanny, but could have been uncannier. If you loved this movie, watch X-Men:Evolution on Kids WB! Great cartoon featuring Scott McNeil as Wolverine.<br/><br/>Note: If there is an X-Men sequel, don't forget Ed Buza as Beast, Roland Kickinger as Colossus, Yuji Okumoto as Sunfire, Lori Petty as Boom Boom, Russel Crowe as Mister Sinister, Lou Diamond Phillips as Forge and Chris Potter as Gambit."
"dimadick","8","0","1","1 November 2001"," The next step in evolution looks great.
","With the exception of Batman(1989) and Batman(1992) I hadn't been able to find a movie about superheroes that is not pathetic.But X-Men sure brings hope for the genre.It focuses on mutants as the next evolution step.And works with this idea fine.The ten main characters are supposed to be fine specimens of the new species.And they sure are: 1)Erik Magnus Lehnsherr/Magneto.Magneto has always been one of my favorite Marvel characters along with Dr.Victor von Doom and En Sabah Nur/Apocalypse.They do focus on his dark experiences during World War II.This edition of him is a serious and responsible leader,fighter and an revolutionary dreamer.His phrases as ""There is no land of tolerance"" do have meaning behind them.And his vision is realistic for the kind of world he leaves in.His magnetic powers make him one of the most powerful mutants alive. 2)Professor Charles Francis Xavier/Professor X is also a serious leader and dreamer.He talks of peace but he prepares his species for the future.Finaly a ""Xavier Dream""that makes sence.His abilitie to not only scan but control minds makes him dangerous. 3)Raven Darkholm/Mystique has never been of my favorites but her ability to morph along with fighting skills make her truly dangerous as an enemy in this one.I did like her as a Senator.I might change my mind about her if the comic book writers change her style. 4)Dr.Jean Grey.As the Professor's best student and as a Professor herself she works great.And her bpowers were in developing during this movie.I'd sure like to see them mature. 5)Victor Creed/Sabretooth.The comicbooks' version of Creed always bored me.Too savage and idiotic to be any serious threat.He can surely kill but nothing above that.But this version...A laconic warrior with a cause is great. 6)Scott Summers/Cyclops.As a calm leader and warrior he is grate.His lasers were powerful enough to destroy a station and hold Sabretooth back.I like it. 7)Mortimer Toynbee/Toad.The Toad has always been a joke as an adversarie for anybody.This klller version is a serious upgrading for him. 8)Ororo Munroe/Storm.The weather goddess works great in this movie.Desposing of Toad is way far from the pacifist she was in the comicbooks for decades.Kill for a worthy cause sounds more like this version. 9)Logan/Wolverine.The oldest and most interesting of the X-Men is rocking in this movie. 10)Marie/Rogue.Focusing on the vampiristic nature of her power was great.Explaining her white hair as Magneto's influence works.And the hint she permanently adopts some of her victim's traits is intriguing.Just in this movie she must have taken traits of Magneto and Wolverine.How she uses them should be mighty interesting. Great versions of the characters,a nice scenario,serious way of treating the situation,no confrontation of ""Good""and ""Evil"" just different Dreams.That works fine for me.But in a movie about evolution references to God don't really work and Magneto is an atheist not religious.8/10."

As it was, I waited for it for three months. I read all about it and when I finally went it failed to satisfy. For one thing, the characters were no good. Where may I ask was Gambit, for example? Since when is Rogue a confused little girl? What happened to the voluptuous back talking woman? I would have preferred more concentration on Mystique since she was just about the only interesting character in this washed out rag. I sincerely hope Spiderman will be better (I do not have any hopes for the future X-Men2/3)."
"koolkidjohnny","6","0","1","13 October 2001"," i don't know why people think this movie is better than it really is
","I don't think x men was done very well. Especially when i think about how good it could have been. There wasn't that much i liked about it. I'm pretty familiar with all the x-men characters and most of the storylines. Instead of using a good x-men plot such as days of future past, pheonix saga, etc etc, they went ahead and made up their own. A mutant ray that will turn everyone in NY into mutants? Puh lease.<br/><br/>However though i didnt like most of it, some of it was alright. Like the scene with mystique and senator kelly in the helicopter when she's telling him about her childhood while flash kicking him in the face. IF only the rest of the movie had the kind of deep seeded tension that this scene had instead of breaking down into less than exhilirating action sequences filled with lazy cgi. I mean, damn."
"mesotis","8","0","1","8 October 2001"," Where's Gambit?
","Personally, I thought the movie did the X-Men justice. Ian McKellen and Patrick Stewart did a great job bringing class and intelligence to a great film. I'm glad as I am sure most of the world is that the movie companies didn't go for top Hollywood actors to play these rolls, but wanted the movie to stand on it's own two feet, and not on the backs of superstars.<br/><br/>Only one complaint is to be heard from me: Where are Beast, Gambit, (and for that matter) Jubilee? They left out three great X-men, and I hope that they will include them in the next movie. To have all of the X-men in one movie would be one thing I think would make a sequel even better. Let's just hope."
"feifferman","Null","0","1","5 October 2001"," The acting makes this film a classic.
","The four lead actors give wonderful performances. Patrick Stewart and Ian McKellen give the film an intelligence that you wouldn't expect from a comic book film. And Hugh Jackman and Anna Paquin give the film real emotion. It's their relationship that defines the concept that the X-Men are tragic superheroes. He's a man who chooses to be a loner, she's a girl who's forced to be a loner. And though Jackman gave the most entertaining performance, it is Paquin who gives the best performance in terms of pure acting. She has to make you care about Rogue if you're going to care about the movie. And she does an excellent job of it. Paquin plays Rogue as a real teenage girl with a horrible affliction. You care about her because you believe her character. You feel for her.<br/><br/>Director Bryan Singer should be applauded for casting these four excellent actors instead of big name stars or Hollywood bimbos. By going with quality, Singer tried to give the comic book genre intellectual and emotional weight. He succeeded.<br/><br/>Great special effects, action, humor, and a great performance from the cast makes The X-Men one of the best comic book films, ranking alongside Batman and Superman. Let's just hope the X-Men sequels are better than the sequels to those films."

","Mr. Singer did an awesome job.  While the movie, X-Men, isn't great, it kept the flavor of the comic I love.  First you have to understand the X-Men universe is extremely complicated.  He tried to pare it down into understandable characters.  No one is going to be happy with that, since we all have different favorites. What he did do, was instead of going for the action adventure, and totally ignoring what made X-Men the favorite it is, he kept the humanity of it.  We lost out on some slam-bang action and kept what made the X-Men the beloved comic of our time.  The fact that these are people who are different.  Who are tormented because of the fact that they aren't like everyone else.  God knows, we've all experienced that bigotry, in one form or another.  The X-Men stand for all of us. Thank you Mr. Singer.  I went to the movie expecting to be disappointed. It's not the great movie I wanted, but it told the tale like it was supposed to be told. Oh, and Jackman didn't 'almost' steal the movie.  He stole it and ran away with it.  The Wolverine character is the one I really expected to be disappointed in.  Instead, he was absolutely perfect.  C'mon people. Wolvie has never been a nice guy.  He's short, cranky, stubborn, and a warrior. He's also the kind of guy a person could bet their life on, and win.  We don't like him cause he's nice.  We like him because of his faults!"

The fact that Patrick Stewart was cast as Professor Xavier was a big plus, as I generally enjoy any acting work he does.<br/><br/>The movie was a pleasant surprise.<br/><br/>The overall acting was done well, and Hugh Jackman did very well as Wolverine.  What special effects there were weren't overdone, and the storyline hung together very well.<br/><br/>In a way, I felt that the movie was more about Wolverine than anything else, but I suspect that if they make any sequels, they'll probably concentrate on other members of the X-Men.<br/><br/>Sure, the movie is a little short, but I came out of it satisfied that I had gotten my money's worth.<br/><br/>Talking to people about the movie afterwards I heard the following comments :<br/><br/>""It didn't suck"". - always a plus :-)<br/><br/>""As someone who has been reading the comics since the 60's, I thoguht the movie was good"".<br/><br/>And the most often heard comment from a lot of people was ""I don't know anything about X-men, but I really enjoyed it"".<br/><br/>Overall, I'd give the movie 8/10."
