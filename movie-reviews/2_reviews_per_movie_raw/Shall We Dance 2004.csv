","I saw the Japanese original film ""Shall We Dance?"" few years ago and I was charmed by its subtlety and delicacy. I did not plan to see the remake because I am not crazy about the remakes in general and I did not look forward to see Lopez or Gere in the movie together. When I finally saw the movie (my mom who's seen both films highly recommended the American version to me), I was surprised how much I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The cultural contrast of the Japanese film ceased to exist in the 2004 movie but there is still a lot to like in it. First of all, I love to watch good dancing and ""Shall We Dance?"" has plenty of it. Gere's and Lopez's dancing together has grace and passion, and it was a wonderful moment in the film.<br/><br/>Then, there are memorable and funny supporting characters that had screen time enough to become more than the lifeless shadows - Stanley Tucci (Link) and Lisa Ann Walter (Bobbie) for whom the ballroom dancing is the road to freedom, and happiness.<br/><br/>And the last but not the least, the movie is asking the question, how to make a man happy if he's got everything - the job he enjoys, the family he loves, his health, and good looks but something is missing? It would take more than any movie to answer the question but perhaps it would help one day just take a different road and open a new door?"

","I do not remember when was the last time I left the movie theater with such positive feelings and in such a good mood as after seeing this movie. Having not seen the Japanese original and having known only that the movie did not perform extremely well in the US, I did not know what to expect when I went in. I was very pleasantly surprised. The movie is very entertaining, sweet and kind in commenting on people's little quirks. Emotionally there is not a single false moment. And there a couple of genuinely funny moments (none better than the Gere-Tucci moment in the men's room). It does help, I guess, if you are over forty (like myself) to understand the yearning of the main character (Gere) who has no reason NOT to be happy in his life, yet he cannot help but missing ""something"". I loved all the little stories of the supporting characters and I loved the fact that the movie took the time to wrap up all the stories in the end. I guess the movie underperformed because it was seen as a star vehicle whereas it is more an ensemble piece. That is not to say that Gere, Sarandon or Lopez are miscast. Not at all, in fact now that I have seen the movie twice, it is difficult to imagine a different cast, they all seem to be perfectly chosen for their parts. But it is really the supporting cast which really makes the movie work. It is difficult to chose just one, but Stanley Tucci is quite exquisite in his role. Though the movie is rather light in its tone, Sarandon character's observations on the reason why people get married is rather interesting and stays with you after leaving the theater. I hope Peter Chelsom will continue making movies like Serendipity"" and this one: there are definitely not enough movies of this kind around anymore. This is a movie I will return to each time I will be feeling down. And a special mention goes to the soundtrack. Chelsom seems to really have a hand for picking the right tunes (Serendipity soundtrack is one of the best movie soundtracks ever) and here the choice of the music really helps to define the emotional core of the movie."
"bjones","9","26","32","2 October 2004"," Great Fun
","I went to this today at a Sneak Preview with my daughter. I was hoping to not be bored. I was more than pleasantly surprised to find this a greatly entertaining film, kudos to the screenwriter Audrey Wells who crafted an excellent presentation from a work originally by Masayuki Suo, who wrote the Japanese film from which this is a remake. There was so much I liked it's hard to decide where to begin. At times infectious with fun and genuinely funny this is a great look at several aspects of enhancing one's life. <br/><br/>The story was much better than most dance movies as it was less about dance and more about what it means to be human. For that we should thank Director Peter Chelsom whose only other notable work seems to be the film 'Serendipity'. In this outing, the experienced Richard Gere (who, BTW, is only a year older than me) plays a highly successful attorney bored with his life in spite of being married to a stunning and still very sexy Susan Sarandon. He seems to have everything on the surface (how could you not with Ms. Sarandon as a wife?), everything that is, except fun in his life. He longingly spies a brooding Jennifer Lopez staring out the window of an old dance studio in decline as he passes by on the L train each day as he goes home from work. She raises his curiosity enough that he thinks he wants to meet her. It's a dance studio with a sign that says that watching is welcome. Lopez immediately scoops him up for a dance class for beginners in ballroom dancing and there it takes off. His initial interest in the famously callipygous Ms. J is finally supplanted with a genuine love of dancing. He is hooked and it changes his life for the better and we have a great time sharing his new found joy. I was pleased beyond words that this did not fall headlong into what could have been a film of nothing but infidelities. That it didn't follow that path is a laudable tribute to scores of real people who do the same every day; turn away from temptation. I think this is just about my favorite role I've ever seen Gere in. He played the part with great skill and brought out just the right emotions from the audience who applauded at the end. Even the great Ms. Sarandon adds an unexpected turn as philosopher with a comment on the realities of marriage that ring fully true. She made the perfect counterpoint as the amazing superwife who made us all wonder if Gere was nuts for being so unhappy at the start.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, Anita Gillette was wonderfully cast as the studio owner Miss Mitzi. Her portrayal of the older woman who has her best days behind her is both touching and sweet without making us feel sorry for her. She seems in her element here. She did a wonderful job. Bobby Cannavale as 'Chick', whom I last saw playing a ruggedly handsome paramedic in the TV series Third Watch, did a terrific job as one of Gere's fellow beginners. He also gave one of the biggest laughs of the film just at the end. We should be treated to more of him on the big screen, he graces it well. The previously unseen Omar Benson Miller as 'Vern' and Mya who plays his girlfriend both added some warm moments of their own, his in a more literal sense. The very good Lisa Ann Walter plays Bobbie, a very funny character role she wore so well she nearly owned every scene she was in. Just about the best in the film was Stanley Tucci, who did an absolutely brilliant turn as - and I paraphrase - 'Just about the only hetero guy on earth who like parading around dancing in sequins.' He was great, so great in fact, that if he doesn't get a nomination for a Best Supporting Actor award he'd be robbed. He did steal a lot of scenes with no apologies needed. He deserved every one.<br/><br/>The rest of the elements in the film worked very well to paint just the right mood. The sets were realistic and not overly noticeable, leaving the attention to the actors where it belonged. The costuming was great and added some great moments of their own, from Sarandon in a T Shirt to Lopez in an amazing gown near the end to even Gere's tuxedos and natty business suits. But it's the costumes of Tucci and Walter that are the most entertaining. The musical score was great too, just right for the dancing and mood of the film. The sound editing was outstanding, very enjoyable.<br/><br/>We all left the theater with smiles on our faces talking about bringing friends back to see it when it comes out. It is a film well worth the price of admission."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","47","62","4 November 2004"," Passing grade remake
","I should start by admitting that it was quite a while ago (New Years Day 1997, to be exact) that I watched the Japanese original, 'Shall We Dansu' (which, incidentally, IS THE ORIGINAL; the Astaire/Rogers 1937 flick, which happens to have the same name, IS NOT). However, although I don't remember every single detail, the essential feelings as well as some of the vivid images still seem fresh in my mind, particularly the glittering performance of Koji Yakusyo and Tamiyo Kusakari.<br/><br/>The Hollywood remake, while not as good as the Japanese original, is at least passing grade, in capturing the essence of the film, 'a man seeking not so much a woman as an answer to his question. Why is she sad? What is she thinking' (Ebert, on 'Shall We Dansu', NOT 'Shall We Dance'), as well as everybody's passion for ballroom dancing.<br/><br/>Richard Gere continues to exude his charm on the female audience. Jennifer Lopez, following Maid in Manhattan, continues to get more comfortable with more matured roles. Oscar best actress (and 5 times nominee) Susan Sarandon is dependable as ever. I'm trying very hard to think of a movie in which I can't find Stanley Tucci and  darn it, the more I watch the guy, the more I like him!"

","In Chicago, the workaholic lawyer John Clark (Richard Gere) is feeling bored with his routine life, limited to work and stay at home with his wife Beverly Clark (Susan Sarandon) and his teenager's son and daughter. One night, while traveling home by train, he sees the beautiful face of Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) in the balcony of a dance school, and a couple of days later, he decides to visit the school and take dancing classes every Wednesdays. However, he becomes ashamed to tell his family his ""little secret"". Meanwhile, Beverly feels the changes in her happier husband, and hires a private eye to investigate whether John is having an affair.<br/><br/>""Shall We Dance?"" is a delightful entertainment. It is pleasant to see a nice cast like the sexy Jennifer Lopez, the charming Richard Gere, the surprisingly great dancer Stanley Tucci, the funny Lisa Ann Walter, the wonderful Susan Sarandon and excellent support actors and actresses playing and dancing great music along 106 minutes. After watching this feel-good romance, the viewer will certainly feel lighter and relaxed. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Dança Comigo?"" (""Dance With Me?"")<br/><br/>Obs: On October 15th 2005, I saw the original ""Shall We Dansu?"", which is better and better than this remake."
"mlsbas-1","10","87","126","2 January 2005"," Shall We Dance? Of Course !
","What a match-up of performers! Richard Gere with Susan Sarandon - very strange initially, but very successful. While we typically identify Mr. Gere with younger, more stereotypically ""beautiful"" actors, his pairing with Ms. Sarandon was most fitting with his role in this film.<br/><br/>As he attempted to connect with himself, the natural entry of Jennifer Lopez into his life was perfect. It was great to see the two characters go from one end of the spectrum to another - hoping to see it go all the way. While initially disappointing (really wanted to see them together), it was a very do-able end result.<br/><br/>Of course, the dancing and music were a great focal point to the story -I loved seeing Mr. Gere and Ms. Lopez doing their ""thing."" The statistics of the voting on this site for this film were most puzzling. One can only surmise that there were a great many voters who lack a great deal of romance in their souls. Further, as many voters must have lacked an appreciation of great music and dancing.<br/><br/>Clearly, one of the most enjoyable films of 2004."
"moviefan2003va","Null","40","59","22 October 2004"," Feel Good, Magical Movie
","This was a decent movie. It will never be as good as the original but it was effective and made you feel good in the end. This is the third Chelsom film I have seen. I didn't see the British movies that brought him the most acclaim but only Town and Country, Serendipity and now this one. The first was clearly a disaster. The latter two should not have worked but they do. Chelsom depends very much on the charisma of his actors to pull off his movies combined with the whimsy he adds with his direction. <br/><br/>With that being said, Gere is very effective in his role. It is his character's likability that sells this movie combined with the colorful supporting actors that show up in Chelsom's movies that provide the final sell for the movie. I predict this movie will spawn an increase in dancing lessons. Like the movie Serendipity, people will leave this movie feeling there is magic in the air and seek out ways to find the magic in their own lives..."
"babuon","10","7","8","30 May 2006"," A delightful film with a perfect cast
","Rarely does one see an American version of a foreign film that is as satisfying as ""Shall We Dance"", perhaps it's because it's possible to identify with virtually every character in the film at some level. Richard Gere is persuasive as a professional man having a mid-life crisis and charming in his shyness as he decides to learn ballroom dancing; Susan Sarandon is perfect as his first oblivious, then perplexed, wife, and Jennifer Lopez is very fine as the dance instructor at Miss Mitzi's. The tango scene between Gere and Lopez is glorious, and the waltzes are elegant. The film's supporting characters are as talented and noteworthy as the leads. ""Shall We Dance"" is one of the rare contemporary films that makes one want to see it again -- and to take up ballroom dancing."
"jotix100","7","20","29","3 January 2006"," Lost in translation
","One of the worst things anyone can do is to try to tackle something that was made better. Hollywood doesn't seem to learn its lesson at all. In trying to ""Americanize"" the great Japanese film of the same name, the film makers had no idea what they were getting into. In fact, the original film, directed with great flair by Masoyuki Suo, loses all its charm with this reincarnation.<br/><br/>That said, this edition of ""Shall we Dance"" directed by Peter Chelsom, is not a horrible movie, but the freshness and subtleness of its Japanese model was lost in the translation. While the Japanese version was light and captivating, this adaptation is a bit heavy handed. The editing of the film has a lot to do with out enjoyment, and when the dance sequences in the competition are clumsily handled as it's the case here, one wonders what could the creators have been looking at?<br/><br/>The idea of seeing Richard Gere as the man who is intrigued by the dancing he sees as he passes the dance academy, is not as credible as one would have expected to be. Mr. Gere is versatile enough as he already showed with his role in ""Chicago"". The idea of his character pulling the wool over his wife Beverly's eyes doesn't come across as too credible. It seems to be a cultural difference that a Japanese wife might be less vocal and accepting a straying husband than in this country by an American wife. That's basically the fatal flaw with the movie, in our humble opinion.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lopez comes across better. As Paulina she shows a professional attitude toward her students, but her chemistry with Richard Gere doesn't create any sparks. Susan Sarandon, as Beverly, the wife who suspects her husband's betrayal, underplays her role with better results than some of her late screen appearances. Stanley Tucci's character is irritating, at best and Lisa Ann Walters does what she can with Bobbie.<br/><br/>Since you probably have seen this version, take a chance and rent the original Japanese film and compare."
"michaelann-1","10","6","7","29 May 2006"," A funny, intelligent, romantic film! A must see!!
","When I first saw the commercials, I was intrigued by this film, even though I have never liked Richard Gere. I like Jennifer Lopez's singing, but I have never seen her act before. Also, being a big fan of Flashdance & Thank God it's Friday. <br/><br/>I absolutely loved this movie. It was sweet, romantic, intelligently-written & very enjoyable. Probably one of my top 5 favorite movies of all time . I would recommend it to anyone who likes romantic movies. If you enjoyed Ghost, or Up close & personal, I suspect you'll love this movie , as much as I do. I just wish I could give it an 11!"
"christian123","5","21","33","6 June 2005"," Enjoyable but Forgettable
","Shall We Dance doesn't break any new ground but those who just want a good time will find it with this film. Richard Gere plays John Clark, a lawyer who feels the need to spice up his stagnating marriage (to Susan Sarandon, no less) by taking ballroom dance lessons from a beautiful and mysterious younger woman (Jennifer Lopez). The plot is okay it just sounds kind of boring. The movie for the most part isn't boring. Its actually quite entertaining. I have never seen the original so I can't compare the two but the original is probably better. I was expecting this film to be horrible as the trailer and early buzz weren't that good but they must have fixed the problems. The cast is pretty good with the best being Susan Sarandon. She does a very good job and she has a fair amount of screen time. Richard Gere does a good job playing John, nothing great but nothing terrible either. Jennifer Lopez's performance isn't very strong and the role didn't really seem to fit her. She gets by with an average performance though. The rest of the supporting cast are very funny and they keep this film moving. Out of all of them, Stanley Tucci was probably the best as Link. His performance of trying to be a young dancer was very funny. There are other interesting characters as well that are in the dance school and are fun to watch them. Peter Chelsom directs and he sure knows how to make this type of film work as he directed the very entertaining Serendipity. The only problem with this film is that its too predictable. Its very by the numbers and doesn't even try to stray away from the familiar path that most romantic comedies take. There was also a lack of chemistry between Lopez and Gere so there scenes together weren't very good or interesting. The running time of 106 minutes goes by fast. The dancing itself was actually pretty good. It wasn't the best but it wasn't terrible either. In the end, this is better then most romantic comedies that have come out in the past year and this film can be enjoyed if your just looking for a good time. Rating 7/10, entertaining but forgettable."
"jboothmillard","4","3","3","29 December 2011"," Shall We Dance
","Whenever I hear this title I first assume that it means the Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers musical, but this one is actually based on the same title as a song featured in The King and I, from director Peter Chelsom (Funny Bones, Serendipity). Basically John Clark (Richard Gere) has a good job as a lawyer, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) as a loving wife and a happy family life, but he seems bored by all of this and fancies something new. He passes it every evening, and sees the same beautiful woman through the window, so he decides one night to enter the place, a dance lessons class, and he signs up hoping to be taught by the woman, Paulina (Jennifer Lopez). He may instead be being taught by the older Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), and he is just as clumsy as other dance students, such as Chic (Bobby Cannavale) and Vern (American Pie Presents Band Camp's Omar Benson Miller), and for a while the woman he glanced at doesn't seem interested. After a while John does eventually get to meet Paulina, she only wants to teach dancing not have a date, but they do become good friends, to the point when he has fallen for her. He has been keeping the dance lessons a secret from everyone, all his friends and family, and eventually he has become really enraptured in the dancing as well, he is training for a championship Chicago dance competition. For this John is partnered with dancer Bobbie (Lisa Ann Walter), and he is against fellow dance student Link (Stanley Tucci), he obviously has Paulina watching from the audience, but he is unaware that Beverly and his daughter Jenna Clark (Tamara Hope) are there as well. This distracts him at the crucial point during the performance, and in the end he decides to quit, but his life returns to a happy normality, Linkn and Bobbie get together, Paulina gets a new dance partner for a Blackpool competition, and John and Beverly enjoy a dance together themselves. Also starring Stark Sands as Evan Clark, Richard Jenkins as Devine, Nick Cannon as Scott, Sarah Lafleur as Carolyn, Onalee Ames as Diane and Diana Salvatore as Tina. Gere is alright being reasonably charming as trying to escape his drab lifestyle, Sarandon doesn't get much to do at all as his wife, and of course Lopez looks gorgeous thrusting her moves and poking her bum out, even though her mood is low most of the time. If you are a fan of dancing films, and specifically ballroom, then I guess this has a fair amount in it to satisfy the eyes, as for the story in between it is lacking in originality, only the dancing is worth watching, otherwise it's probably only worth seeing the once, a slightly lame romantic comedy drama. Okay!"
"fatbob03082","1","8","12","8 November 2009"," More Hollywood rip off!
","Hollywood is so bankrupt and bereft of ideas and original thinking that it seems that the only thing they can do is to copy and imitate badly. And so it goes with ""Shall We Dance"". Japans ""Shall We Dansu"", a charming, delightful, warm, appealing, wonderful movie is poorly imitated by the money grubbing, artless, self-centered Hollywood barbarians. It is so disheartening to see this constant parade of lumbering, badly over-acted, poorly produced, in-your-face, Californicated, tedious, ponderous, undirected, empty, Hollywood rip-offs. Is it the money or the ego that drives these people to violate something wholesome and decent or is it just plain nastiness. If Hollywood wants to continue making senseless empty adolescent wastes of time then that is just fine but please don't insult the rest of us by trashing real art."
"joelsloane","1","4","5","24 February 2011"," A bankrupt remake
","SPOILERS (although this lame remake could not possibly be spoiled any further). The first, most basic rule a beginning writer (including screenwriter) is taught is ""Show, don't tell""; that is, let the readers, or viewers, realize for themselves what emotions a character may feel, from his actions, not from his words. This wholly unnecessary remake of the wonderful 1996 Japanese original breaks this elementary rule. Indeed, would any viewer have guessed that Richard Gere was so much in love with Susan Sarandon, had he not said so to her (and therefore to the audience) in the manipulative scene in which he appears at her work in formal dress with rose in hand? Certainly nothing from what we see of their relationship before this scene hints at such deep love. (Incidentally, whenever the screenplay departs from the Japanese original, as in the above-mentioned scene, it becomes totally bankrupt and unoriginal: the scene is lifted straight out of ""An Officer and a Gentleman,"" when Gere, in full white uniform, appears at Debra Winger's job to carry her away.) I'm a great fan of Stanley Tucci (who is good in everything, even in this), but I almost lost all respect for him to allow himself to appear in this atrocious movie. How could he not realize that the dialog was so poorly written? I have no doubt that this remake will be very successful, judging from the taste of the American public, which seems to have sunk to new depths. If you absolutely MUST see this movie, I recommend that you first rent the DVD of the Japanese original, and then compare it to this remake to appreciate the truth of my critique."
"bho314","3","4","5","15 February 2005"," Chelson's atrocity against the Japanese
","The central tension in the original Japanese Shall We Dance is that the main character is a dork, a nerd, a nebbish that has to overcome social taboos to pursue his passion.<br/><br/>Since neither apply to suave Richard Gere in the socially unfettered USA, Chelsom resorts instead to a commentary on materialism. A nice try, but a pale imitation. Without the central tension, the film is effectively castrated.<br/><br/>The large cast of quirky but likable characters don't quite work and come off as flat and stereotypical, the one exception is the PI's preternaturally wise assistant who gets far too few lines.<br/><br/>The only redeeming point of the adaptation is Susan Sarandon's performance despite the poor writing, and watching Jennifer Lopez dance. Lopez fully embraces the venerable dance of ballroom and truly invigorates it with her raw sensuality. A delight to watch."

","I am so sorry that the Producer, Director, and Writer of this film did not carefully and faithfully follow the l996 Japanese film script SHALL WE DANCE. It is unfortunate that they acknowledge in the closing credits that they adapted their script from the aforementioned one. <br/><br/>Their insensitivity to the l996 script corrupted their story to the extent I was unable to see any redeeming qualities. The apparent belief that they could ""update"" the script is almost unbelievable to me. Yet I presume that they thought this was necessary to please the American viewers as well as have it be acceptable to the global community of viewers.<br/><br/>I do hope that this film will not be popular. I hope that some viewers will pick up that this is an attempted remake and then see the l996 Japanese version. <br/><br/>One final note, the Japanese script could have been completely used for an American film that would have conveyed the very meaningful and rich story that viewers would have throughly appreciated."

","18 October 2004. This much funnier version of Shall We Dance, is a delicious, romantic comedy that doesn't require magical, unbelievable script devices to make this movie work. This movie is compelling for those who believe in second chances and first chances for those who have never taken chances. This movie comes at a good time in American life when our lifestyles are such that we may be coming to that age that for everything we have, we still are empty. I don't imagine that this movie will dazzle any male ego and will probably be restricted to females who can only wish their partners might somehow be so interested. A good date movie for the emotionally sensitive and artistically inclined. This new version based on the Japanese original explores the comic motif well, doesn't take a lot of liberties on the sexual romance angle that so often befalls American movies, and ends up with a definitely American tie off but with a much more realistic and hopefully plausible note than most gushy romance movies.

"xxitalianxx","Null","2","2","9 May 2006"," Shall We Dance
","After watching the movie Shall We Dance, I could say its fair enough to compare it to Billy Elliot in the sense that John and Billy were both afraid to tell people they were taking dance lessons. This movie was considered to be a romantic comedy where a bored, overworked Estate Lawyer, upon first sight of a beautiful instructor, signs up for ballroom dancing lessons.<br/><br/>The main character John Clark seems to be having a great relationship with his wife. But he feels like he can not tell his wife about him taking lessons. The reasoning behind this is unclear, but it seems like he will cheat on his wife with the dance instructor. Of course after watching the movie you see he doesn't commit such an act. In the scene where he travels home everyday on the train and passes the dance studio is very affective. We are uncertain if he will follow through and end up taking the lessons.<br/><br/>When John finally starts dance lessons he really isn't that great. He hides it from everyone at home and work. His family starts to see strange behaviors in him, such as peeking in on him in his room and he is dancing around by himself. They are curious to know what he has been up to; his wife goes on and hires a private investigator to see if he is cheating on her. He then follows John and sees he goes to dance classes.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie is when John has to perform in the dance competition. He realizes he is really good at something and debates sharing it with his family. When his wife and daughter found out, they went to his dance competition. He messed up when he saw them and his daughter yelled ""yeah dad."" His family then walked out on him and his performance. From that moment he decided he didn't want to dance anymore. His wife wouldn't let him do that because she saw how good he was!"
"sinanonline","3","11","20","3 January 2005"," Comparison to ""Shall We Dansu, "" J-Lo Acting, and Few Comments on Dancing
","I have seen the 1997 Japanese movie ""Shall We Dansu?"" only partially. The movie was successful in presenting the audience an insight about the Japanese culture, and the contrast created by the traditional Japanese family and societal values and the spirit of the Latin and Ballroom dancing.<br/><br/>This movie does not make sense as a remake. The cultural contrast so delicately pointed out in ""Shall We Dansu?"" (1997) ceases to exist in the 2004 movie. The most important message of the 1997 movie is related to the Japanese culture. This message disappears when the setting is changed to USA.<br/><br/>To illustrate, let's take the example of Gere being ashamed for dancing: There is no cultural reason why Gere (John Clark) would be ashamed of his wife (played by Sarandon) because of his dancing: What aspect of American culture shuns ballroom dancing? Why does he not just ask Sarandon to join him? The reason stated by Gere that he is ashamed to want more happiness in his life is absurd. There is no concept such as ""shunning pursuit of happiness"" in American culture, and as audience, we are presented no reason why Gere should be ashamed of this.<br/><br/>Another theme in the movie that does not fit to the American culture is the reaction of Lopez to Gere when she thinks that he is hitting on her: Kusukari's (Mai Kishikawa, counterpart of J-Lo in 1997 version) reaction to Yakusho (Shohei Sugiyama, counterpart of Gere) ""This may sound rude, but I hope you don't join the class with me as your goal"" is one of the peaks in the movie where the audience is presented with the dilemma Kusukari faces as she is torn between her position as dance instructor and her cultural disposition towards Yakusho. Her reaction is soft and measured, and takes care not to offend Sugiyama. Paulina's (played by Lopez in the 2004 version) reaction is extravagant: She risks injuring a stranger's feelings to the extend that he may give up dancing, and also risks losing a potential student to an already troubled dance studio. Although her cultural disposition to the issue is much ""liberal"" than her Japanese counterpart, her reaction is much more extreme and thus unrealistic.<br/><br/>Comments on the dancing technique: The actors could not dance. Period. This is understandable for Gere and the other students. It is unacceptable that supposedly professional dancers, played by Walter, (Bobbie) Gillette (Miss Mitzi) perform such unaesthetic wriggling on the dance floor.<br/><br/>Final note on Lopez: It is unfair to present her acting as ""bad."" She gave the character everything that the character needs. None of the characters in the movie required too much depth. Her acting is not comparable to a professional actress such as Sarandon, however it is more than sufficient for such a shallow and unrealistic character. The fact that the character is shallow and unrealistic is the fault of the director and 2004 screenplay writer, not the actress.<br/><br/>In addition, Lopez's dancing technique was significantly better than the rest of the supposedly professional dancers, contributing much to realism, or better stated, contributing to decrease the unrealism of the movie. Her dancer's training and background, including the fact that she actually took night dance classes when working in a law firm, makes her a natural fit to this role. Her short performance of Paso Doble set in the darkened dance studio was very well performed."
"tedg","Null","9","16","20 October 2004"," Limiting Tracks
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>As films unfold while we watch them, there's a curious balance between the world of the film and the world of the viewer. Usually the world of the film bulges into our world, the 'real' world. But sometimes it is the other way around. I haven't yet seen the original, but I understand it exploits this notion, the notion of the viewer simply stepping off the fixed track of reality into a richer world of flowing expression.<br/><br/>It leverages the by now common device of dancing and trains, in addition to using the train as a metaphor for drudgery and routine. We know that the already mythical Baz Luhrmann went to great lengths to insert a train in 'Strictly Ballroom.' And we have the cinematic ally unique train sequence in 'Dancer in the Dark.'<br/><br/>I maintain that today, trains exist more in the cinematic world than the real world, at least for Americans, and one reason this remake fails is the lack of understanding how to employ its nature in the service of the story. It would have failed even if the disaster of Lopez had been rectified, and the many translations from Japanese repression to that of privileged lawyers was somehow made.<br/><br/>If you can get past the fact that this is as lifeless a remake as 'Tortilla Soup' (and for the same reasons), and overlook Lopez this script has one of the most interesting concepts in film marriage: marriage is about having a ""witness"" to your life. The original build this into their concept, the shifting of that line between who sees what to the stretch of the film seeing the viewer.<br/><br/>There's a piece of trivia here. Of all the worlds of dance, ballroom dancing - especially competitive dancing of the type that schools promote - is the least emotive, the most proscribed and predictable, even fluidly mechanical. Usually the ballroom dancing movie is about transcending those limits. Here, it is the opposite: Lopez's speech (itself mechanical) about dance making you truly alive is a bit ironic if you understand what the competition is all about.<br/><br/>Bette Midler can relax now. She's become a sort of female Elvis with a recognizable stereotype for actresses to merely copy.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 1 of 3: You can find something better to do with this part of your life."

","I absolutely loved this movie and liked it better than the original. I enjoyed the fact that the movie showed that even though you may have a so called perfect life there could still be something missing which I think most of us feel at one time or another. I found this movie to be extremely funny and touching at the same time.<br/><br/>This movie is more of a telling of peoples lives and emotions than a story of dance. The dance helps them to bring out their inner selves. I liked the fact that John Clark (Richard Gere) reflected back on the people that had wills done in his office and that the happier ones were the ones who took that extra step to get as much out of life as they could possibly do before it was too late.<br/><br/>This is a story about a man who does take that extra step and follows his emotions. He sees a beautiful girl in a window three times from the train each night coming home from work and one night he gets off that train in hopes of meeting this girl who works in a dance studio. He ends up signing for dance lessons hoping to be able to dance with her and instead finds happiness in dance.<br/><br/>The movie does an excellent job showing how John Clark (Richard Gere) and the others who are inept and shy and a little ashamed at the beginning become confident in themselves. The scenes in the dance studio are extremely funny. The movie goes on to tell how his wife Beverely (Susan Sarandon) thinks he is having an affair and hires a private detective.<br/><br/>This movie shows how each of their lives have been affected by dance. The acting in this movie is superb. Richard Gere does an unbelievable job of dancing, he is terrific. His acting is second to none and this is the best romantic comedy I've ever seen him in. This is by far the best movie I've ever seen Jennifer Lopez in, she actually does a good job. Susan Sarandon was great and would love to see her and Richard Gere do more movies together. The rest of the supporting cast did an excellent job in their roles.<br/><br/>I went to the pre showing of this movie and the theatre was packed and some people had to turn away because there were no more seats available but they did say they would be back to see the movie when it opened up. There was a lot of clapping and laughter during this movie and everyone I spoke to said they loved it, some even said they would be coming back to see it again, as will I.<br/><br/>This was perfectly casted movie and you won't be sorry if you go and see it.<br/><br/>This is a feel good inside movie, A MUST SEE."

","It was that time again for me to sit down and watch another chick film with my wife. She got the popcorn and I got the bamboo shoots for my fingernails. The movie was better than I expected, however. It was about this bored guy who was happily married with two teenage children. Everyday he went to the same job where he was a lawyer at a small firm and every evening he rode the same commuter train home. He loved his wife and children but was asking himself that eternal question that haunts all of us from time to time, is this all there is? Is there anything more? Until one night on his way home he looked through the train window and noticed a strikingly beautiful women looking out the window of a dance studio. Intrigued he began to look for her every night on his way home and low and behold she was there every night. Until one night he decided to get off the train in attempt to meet this woman. He signed up for dance lessons figuring that she would be his instructor unfortunately his instructor turned out to be the owner of the studio, and old bag who needed a little nip from her flask now and then to make it through another session. Until one night his opportunity came when the old lady was gone and Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) taught his lesson for that night. He seized the opportunity when upon walking her out of the studio he asker her out for dinner for which she harshly rejected him.<br/><br/>After the rejection he soon discovered that it was the dancing that was filling the void in his life and not so much the fascination he had for Paulina. <br/><br/>Richard Gere was good in his role as John Clark. From the movies ""The Cotton Club"" and ""Chicago"" we all know Gere's talent as a musician and a dancer. (Both ""The Cotton Club"" and ""Chicago"" were far superior films; ""Shall We Dance"" is not in the same league. Gere's performances in those pictures were standouts compared the movie I am reviewing here. If you have not seen either one of those films get out and rent them. If you liked Richard Gere in ""Shall We Dance"" you will love him in ""The Cotton Club"" and ""Chicago."" The surprise for me in this movie was the performance of Jennifer Lopez. After being lamb basted by the late night talk shows for her performance in ""Gigli"" and ""Maid In Manhattan"" she did redeem herself a little here. Her talents as a dancer is undeniable and it was show cased beautifully here. She is without a doubt a very beautiful woman. I think her creditability suffers from her, self-inflicted off screen troubles, the on and off again marriages and romances, the see through dresses etc. We get a lot of J-Lo over kill from the media as well, if she changes brands of toilet paper Diane Sawyer has a 10 minute piece on ""Good Morning America"" the next day.<br/><br/>Susan Sarandon is always solid and has that ability to make even a bad film mediocre. Stanley Tucci is good in everything I have seen him in and he has been in a lot of movies and did a good job here as well except that his role was a week one. His Character was responsible for the comedy relief unfortunately it was not funny. Embarrassing may be a better word. The wig and fake wash off suntan just did not work. <br/><br/>All in all I have to give ""Shall We Dance"" two bamboo shoots."

But despite of all these things that he possesses,he still feels that something is missing big in his life as he makes his way every day inside the train through the city of Chicago.<br/><br/>Each evening on his train commute home, John sees a beautiful woman, staring with a melancholic expression through the window of a dance studio. Haunted by her sadness, he impulsively takes off the train one night, and signs up for ballroom dancing lessons, hoping to get to know her. It seems like a mistake. His teacher turns out to be not Paulina, but the older and alcoholic owner of the dance studio,Miss Mitzi.He proves just as clumsy just like his classmates on the dance-floor. Even worse, when he does meet Paulina, she rudely tells John to seriously study dance and not to look chance to get to have dinner with her.But, as his lessons continue, John falls in love with dancing. Keeping his new obsession a secret from his family and co-workers, he works hard and get himself involved for Chicago's biggest dance competition.<br/><br/>The movie basically was a love story between John and his wife and how dancing gets involved in it instead of a man losing his inhibitions and not worrying about cultural and society expectations about dancing.This is where the remake falters.Aside from that,the acting by Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez are far from being decent. Also, the rest of the cast does not compare with the original.The movie as a whole lacks subtlety and fails to provide many laughs as some characters are forced to be funny especially those played by Stanley Tucci,who portrayed Link; and Lisa Ann Walter,who tried her best to be annoying as Bonnie. One simply cannot prevent from comparing this remake to the original.<br/><br/>Nevertheless,this is still a decent remake unlike others like the horrible My Sassy Girl remake starring Elisha Cuthbert and Jesse Bradford from the great Korean classic of the movie with the same title.But not as good as The Departed,a remake of the Hong Kong Classic Infernal Affairs.Overall,it is still a good movie to watch especially for Richard Gere and JLo fans."

","Saw this film on free-to-air TV and even then felt gypped. Staying the course till the end I was interested to see if it got better - but it didn't. The main problem is Gere - he seemed to be sleep-walking through this part, and he and Jennifer Lopez were totally unengaging. It's as if both main performers accepted these roles to pay off a new house. The middle-age-infatuation-with-youth theme is not new, but in this film, what could have been innocent becomes somehow creepy. I did not see the original Japanese version that this film is supposedly based on, but I would hazard a guess that it it leaps and bounds better than this limp effort. The only redeeming factors are the performances of Tucci and Sarandon (when the script allows it) and some of the contest dancing."

","I vaguely remember enjoying the Japanese version of this film. However I also remember its limited impact.<br/><br/>Deep breath! My partner had tears in his eyes. People were dancing down the stairs of the stadium style theater at the River in Rancho Mirage. People waited until the very last credit & sound before leaving the theater.<br/><br/>(A problem reviewers who think they're too important to be bothered by audiences face, when they sit in the cold comfort of a studio & couldn't' care less what the average moviegoer thinks.) This film celebrates the joy of music and dancing while it also explores the difficulties of marriage, growing older, and keeping long-term relationships alive.<br/><br/>Some things we expect to happen don't. Something we expect to happen do.<br/><br/>A lonely dancer stares out a dancing school window. An older man, Richard Gere, who's afraid his bones are turning cold looks up & sees her. He comes home to his wife and family. Susan Sarandon who loves him but feels she's being shut out of his life. As Richard Gere comes alive when he finally takes the dancing school plunge, so do we the audience and everyone in the film come alive. Richard is having such a great time learning his ballroom dancing that we can't help but take the ride with him. Problem with this film is the age barrier. I don't think anyone under 40, who is insensitive and filled with the arrogance of youth can really understand how wonderful this film is with its depth of understanding about the human condition and the joy of being filled with music that moves you to movement yourself, and, more importantly, revives your joy of life and living."

At the beginning of this film I was so intensely bored I couldn't concentrate properly on it. The acting was appalling and even though I had extreme faith in Susan Sarandon to redeem this film however she didn't have enough screen time. Richard Gere severely boring and J.Lo's acting was the same as usual, horrendous. The concept of the film was generally creepy and the fact that Richard Gere fancied J.Lo gave the movie a seedy, uncomfortable feeling. I being someone who never even considered leaving a cinema screen before, left 25 minutes before the predictable ending. I have never in my life hated a movie as much as this.

I am sure many would accuse me of just not entering into the spirit of the piece, after all this isn't Bergman. It is meant to be light and frothy and if we are all being honest completely unchallenging. So what is wrong with a little frivolous distraction?

The two of them just made me remember those movies of Audrey Hepburn, in which she had very aged partners in her first movies.<br/><br/>The whole movie was to me like a French film, with no so much action but beautiful pictures, strong impression, characteristic atmosphere - many moments when you just have to sit, watch, and feel. I also liked the idea that Gere gets back to his wife in the end, but J.Lo. also gets her dance, everyone is happy. There have been a number of unpolished spots, too, but I can forgive them this time.<br/><br/>Shall We Dance was really the kind of movie I expected, a relaxing 90 minutes with an enjoyable setup and some rhythm that makes you feel to join a dancing course. 9/10"
"katydid4819","4","2","3","24 October 2004"," I'd Rather Not 'Dance'
","Sometimes it seems that the film should have been a musical. Sometimes there are just too many spots where it seems more logical for the protagonist to break out in song then deliver his sorrowful speech about the human condition. In Shall We Dance? they already have the dance aspect down. The most colorful moments are the dance sequences between Jennifer Lopez and whichever man she is pulling the hand of off her ass this time.<br/><br/>John Clark, played by a sullen Richard Gere, is happy but not happy. He wants something more from life. Despite a successful marriage to Susan Sarandon and two kids, he feels that monotony has taken over. On passing a dance studio one night on his way home, he sees the face of Lopez from the window. She externalizes everything he is feeling inside and he finds himself compelled to talk to her. Upon walking into the studio, he finds himself signed up for beginner's ballroom dancing. You know the rest  wife fears there's an affair, Clark discovers an actual love for dancing, befriends Lopez, they change each other's life, etc.<br/><br/>Singin' In the Rain used dancing in the place of sex. When they're dancing together, they're sleeping together. In Shall We Dance? they may have been going for something along the same line. Why else would Jennifer Lopez spend the entire movie looking like she is about to have an orgasm? It surpasses the serious dance face that some were going for. In actuality, the dancing is the best part of the movie. It's well performed, minus a few facial expressions, and obviously had the most time put into it. Richard Gere shows the he still hasn't lost what he acquired for Chicago, although that was a smarter career move.<br/><br/>Shall We Dance? is supposed to be a comedy. There are some funny spots but mostly the problem is that the filmmakers felt a sentimental aspect was lacking and went overboard on their attempts to fix that. Every scene is rank with a brooding Gere or Lopez. The script and acting falls second to the dancing and costuming. However, if you want to see good dancing, there are so many other movies that get that aspect at the same time as the script. See Singin' In the Rain or Chicago instead of this. <br/><br/>**/*****"

","The tight ensemble cast works well together including alphabetically such familiar movie names as Bobby Canivale, Anita Gilette, Richard Gere, Richard Jenkins, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter. Its nostalgic portrayal of a Chicago I remember includes an elevated CTA train and station, the Loop, the Chicago River along Wacker Drive and a pricey visually tony section due west in the city whose residents lack the social graces expected of other tonier city neighborhoods. Its characters have the plain spoken no putting on sophisticated airs characteristic of its region of the midwest. Their day to day problems are real as are their attempts to over come the seeming mundaneness of their life in which physical comforts seem easier to grasp than sophisticated city life pleasures. This aspect lends a depth and trueness to this glorious remake other might see as a letdown from the Japanese original films in a big city culture in which plain folks see things differently."
"SimonJack","6","1","1","3 January 2017"," Enjoyable film just for the lessons and dancing
","Miramax made this film after a 1996 Japanese movie of the same title became a huge hit. But this film doesn't have the aura of cultural nonacceptance that the Japanese film had Without that, Richard Gere's John Clark is not so stigmatized to have to hide his taking dance lessons. Of course, he does, but It seems almost awkward and even contrived at times. We know that his wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon) would not be shocked to find out that he is taking ballroom dancing lessons. Nor would his coworkers. So, it comes across somewhat in this movie as though he doesn't want to advertise it because it's not the male or macho think for a man to do. As I said, it seems implied that way. <br/><br/>Other than that, I think the characters all are good and probably had much fun making this movie. Paulina's character (Jennifer Lopez) may be just a little overboard. She comes on too strong in her dancing, for what she has experienced. The Japanese actress in that film, emoted a sense of emptiness and loss for her experience. And through the duration of the events there, she gradually recovered. <br/><br/>This film is fun to watch, even if some of the plot is a little hokey. It's nothing special but most people should enjoy it."
"thehappycow","5","1","1","9 January 2015"," Waste of talent
","This movie is entertaining primarily because of the support cast. The standout is Richard Jenkins (who was nominated for an Academy award for The Visitor). He is in a class by himself here. Bobby Cannavale and Stanley Tucci were also very good but hardly on Jenkins' level. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lopez is her usual one dimensional actress self in pale pink everything as an emotionally-injured-princess-in-pain only this time as a dance instructor in, surprise! - ridiculously tight clothes. This movie would have worked with the right excellent support cast (for a very limited actress - Jennifer - in case we need to clarify that).<br/><br/>Why the movie does not work at all? Look no further than Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon. Richard is totally miscast in a role which required actual depth as an actor and Susan is just boring and seems to be yawning her way through it. It's like watching Thelma become a the dreaded housewife in Chicago. <br/><br/>Richard Jenkins, who was just outstandingly funny as the private detective here, should have had the lead here. He was just hilarious and would actually have made Susan Sarandon much better. He adds so much texture to any of the scenes he is in. I loved the scene in the bar with him and Susan, did not want it to end. I could have watched much more of them and wished the movie went in another direction with the two of them. I do wish however that Susan Sarandon could do a scene that didn't showcase her boobs. I mean, what woman goes to a bar in Chicago with her boobs hanging out like that?<br/><br/>The movie could have been so much better with better casting. Richard Gere in particular brings the quality of the other actors down. Susan did not belong in this role either and must have needed the money or something. <br/><br/>Without a doubt, the difference between this movie and both The Wedding Planner and Maid in Manhattan (two very enjoyable movies) is the quality of the casting opposite Jennifer Lopez. I mean, let's face the obvious fact that Jennifer Lopez can hardly carry a movie. But with actors of the quality of Matthew McConaughey & Bridgette Wilson-Sampras and Ralph Fiennes & Natasha Richardson, it really worked allowing Jennifer to do her emotionally-injured-princess-in-pain-thing. This movie, however, does not work at all because there are not enough quality actors around Jennifer to make us care about her pain or her pink."
"revival05","4","1","1","5 October 2009"," Disqualified
","Sometimes you see movies that exemplifies just what a machine Hollywood is. Movies are rushed into becoming productions almost like exploitation films. You like dancing? Oh, we've got just the movie for you! Look at the box cover, that's Richard Gere! And isn't that smile of Jennifer Lopez' just adorable? And that's that Sarandon woman too, yes, I remember her from that death row movie whatever it was called... it won't matter that the screenplay is a parade of dangling loose ends and that the movie presents some stunning contradictions in their vacant characters, the frame will be glued together by some good acting and a lot of rumba, shot in close-ups.<br/><br/>To conclude an even more un-original trait of the movie, it's a remake (what do you know!) to a Japanese movie which I have not seen. I wouldn't know the similarities between the two movies then, but I suspect that the original movie was consistent enough to make you understand what it was about. This 'Shall we dance' leads you astray very early on, and keeps you out of focus and end up with a happy ending which leaves you unsure about what the problems the characters had in the first place. Clearly, you are not meant to think too much when you watch this movie.<br/><br/>Well, sorry, my bad, but I kept using my brain upon watching this movie. We are introduced to Richard Gere's character, a happily married lawyer who likes his life but, apparently, ""something's missing"". It never gets specific, but he does become interested in the beautiful face of Jennifer Lopez on the subway. It turns out that she's a dancer, working as a teacher at a night time dance class. She used to compete for real, but it went bad with a partner that was more than just a dance partner. Anyhoo, Gerie stops of the subway to check in at the dance hall and subsequently starts to hang out there frequently. He learns to dance. Is he really interested in Lopez? Maybe, maybe not. He however keeps his mouth shut to his wife, played by Susan Sarandon who eventually starts to get suspicious.<br/><br/>Now what this movie at one level at least tries to be (I guess there was some kind of real motivation involved in the making of it) is a movie where a guy who's got it all gets intoxicated with dance because it gives him something exciting next to his satisfying but mundane life. But regardless of what the idea is, the movie starts out as a drama about adultery. The dancing is shot straight, and when the characters start to get ready for a dance contest - which is what the big showdown of the movie is supposed to be all about - it's impossible to care about any of it. The elephant in the room is Gere's marriage, and the question ""what the hell is he doing?"" somehow switches to ""aw, who cares, look it's a dance contest coming up!"" But I really can't imagine anybody getting a high temperature out of Gere trying to dance waltz in a series of medium close-ups. Compare it for instance to Baz Luhrmann's Strictly Ballroom. Now there was a movie all about dancing. We are led to believe that this movie is about Gere and his unspecific affection towards Lopez. Then we are to believe that it's all about the magic of dance. But there's no magic involved. It's stale and dead, and while the director is the most guilty I think a lot of the failure lies in Gere too, who is far too robotic and two dimensional of an actor to express a character like this. When he says that he got to like dancing, I'm not really getting in the mood to take classes. Lopez is another story, not just because she is a natural born dancer but also because she's an underrated actress who makes quite a believable and realistic girl next door-type of great and professional dance lover. Many other actors serving as comic relief are also good, Stanley Tucci for instance, but they are definitely by the numbers.<br/><br/>But by far the greatest problem I had with this movie was letting Susan Sarandon play a semi-hysteric role, making the worried wife a comic relief. She becomes the visible object of the big flaw of the movie - What is it supposed to be about? Does she ever find out that her husband went to take dancing classes by following a beautiful young woman he got interested in? It's as if the movie forgets about this along with Gere's character and that's just, if not an outright shame, than at least sloppy storytelling. We don't get to know anything about how Gere's life was changed by his dancing experience. We don't get to know if the marriage is flawed, or if Lopez' character was a threat to it. Or what any of the events in the movie actually mean. It all ends up utterly pointless.<br/><br/>As passable enjoyment I accepted this movie about one third into it before I found it totally lost it's concepts. After that it was straight downhill and I just wished somebody could have come along to clean up the script and switched the director. You know, made the same movie only better... oh, wait a minute, right, there was the Japanese original. Better check it out."
"MarieGabrielle","7","1","1","14 August 2006"," Standard fare, but....
","this is an okay movie, especially if you are in need of something light (I hate to say a ""feel-good"" movie).<br/><br/>Richard Gere is good, although it is sort of a surprise to see the years added to his age; Susan Sarandon is also an added plus. JLo is not really the main focus, and the side-story of Gere's passing interest in her is never developed.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci is very amusing as the uptight estate lawyer with a penchant for ballroom dancing (Reminded me of ""Strictly Ballroom"" from the early 90's).<br/><br/>Basically, the film does not have many surprises, may have been nice had it ended with a twist (i.e. Gere does something spontaneous). The scene with the red rose and him in the tux is reminiscent of ""An Officer and a Gentleman"" circa 1983.<br/><br/>It would be somewhat disappointing, if the director actually did focus groups with American audiences, and this is what they prefer. Overall though, you will get a few laughs; at least this film has a positive message, and there was no gratuitous violence."

Seeing Richard Gere learn to dance with the other ""two-left-feet"" members of his class is pretty funny.<br/><br/>They do leave out an important fact in this version compared to the Japanese version and that is the main reason the dance teacher broke up with her dance partner and why Richard Gere did the right thing when he protected his dance partner.<br/><br/>If you can get a chance to rent ""Shall we dance"" in Japanese, I'm sure you'll enjoy it."

","The film was a nice diversion for a Sunday afternoon. Since 'Shall We Dansu?' is one of my all time favorite films, I was very wary and ready to pick this one apart but Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon do well as a middle-aged couple set in to their routines of family and career. Of course we already know that Gere can dance, however, he is still realistic and lovable when beginning the lessons. Face it, who doesn't like watching Richard Gere? Hmmm? Jennifer Lopez' dancing was very good showing off years of gut-busting training, but she needs to have roles where she doesn't have to open her mouth. She is not an actress. Nice to look at, no depth to her characters. The biggest difference between the Japanese version and this one was the character played by Stanley Tucci. Although he has fun with his character, 'Link,' the Japanese actor makes the character more eccentric, absolutely hilarious and more memorable. The new friends met at Miss Mitzi's are all great fun. Even though you leave the theater feeling good, I would strongly encourage a viewing of the Japanese version."
"johnfredricksen","Null","3","6","25 November 2007"," Dancing. Emotional Adultery
","I am bit late to the dance, so to speak. I just recently watched this ""romantic comedy"". The movie attempts to dance around the underlying emotional adultery at the heart of this story. A middle aged, successful lawyer is hot for a sexy looking, much younger, dance instructor.<br/><br/>Doh! Who would have thought such things happen? She turns him down, but only rather reluctantly. Our ""hero"" belatedly turns to his wife and marriage.<br/><br/>Yeah sure...<br/><br/>It is an all too common theme of romantic comedies--chick flicks--that adultery, whether emotional or physical is just what a marriage needs.<br/><br/>How often has anyone ever seen this happen in the real world? Most women, and some men, admit that emotional adultery is far, far more difficult to forget and/or forgive.<br/><br/>In the real world, again unlike the world of chick flicks, adultery most often leads to worse not better marriages, to divorce not living happily ever after. Seeking your ""bliss"" in the arms of someone other than your spouse may be sexy, may be romantic, may be a hell of a lot of fun, but it will not, or seldom does, rejuvenate a marriage gone stale. It is almost always the signal that the marriage is dead, dead, dead.<br/><br/>But not so in the fairy tales called chick flicks or romantic comedies.<br/><br/>Just an aside: I have seen so many chick flicks in which it is the wife, not the hubbie looking for a little on the side and she usually gets it--gets it all. I wonder why in chick flicks the male with the wandering eyed doesn't go all the way with the object of his desire? Would it have anything to do with the fact that audiences for chick flicks are--surprise--chicks? Nah...<br/><br/>Anyway, if you have bought into the premise that adultery, either emotional or physical, is the way to brighten up a marriage go see this movie.<br/><br/>If you have a hard time buying this cliché of Hollywood do something more constructive with your money and time--like perhaps, spending a romantic evening, dancing or otherwise with your spouse and not the hunk or skirt down the street."

Susan Sarandon is okay in her scenes (and actually good watching Richard Gere dance), but then they have an argument out of nowhere. Maybe a scene was cut. Maybe the script never made sense.

Jennifer Lopez, it seems, has been taking dancing lessons since her breakup with Ben Affleck but her acting is still atrocious. She should have done the reverse. As for Richard Gere, I think he should punch out Julia Roberts for sucking up all his energy when they made Pretty Woman because ever since that movie, all his movie projects thereafter have been boring to terrible. <br/><br/>The story is about a wills and trust attorney, played by Richard Gere, who in his middle age, married to wife (Susan Sarandon) and two teenage children, finds his life a tedium until he sees Jennifer Lopez peering out of a window of a dance studio, while commuting to and from work. He takes dance lessons to meet Jennifer Lopez but instead finds his passion renewed from learning how to dance.<br/><br/>The part where Richard Gere is trying to learn how to dance was funny but that was about it. The rest of the movie is pretty much boring. I cannot attribute that to the acting because everyone gave a good performance but the story and script did not match the acting.<br/><br/>Oh well, better luck next time Richard Gere.

It's just a gimmick to keep the audience alert until the end. Gere is a nice actor who really looks good on characters like what he did here. Jennifer Lopez is extraordinarily beautiful but extremely serious, and her performance here is somewhat hampered by her lack of joy, playfulness and strength of character. It even seems that the actress was making the movie unwillingly. Much better was the rendering of Susan Sarandon or Anita Gillette. A word of appreciation, too, to Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter, to whom we owe most of the film's comic moments.<br/><br/>With a good photo, well-made costumes (highlighting the dance costumes) and good scenery, the film excelled by the soundtrack, which is truly interesting, appealing, fun and eclectic."

","Shall We Dance? (2004): Dir: Peter Chelsom / Cast: Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Richard Jenkins: Romantic comedy about invitation or risk. Richard Gere is bored with his routine life and marriage. He arrives home by subway but always gazes upward towards the dance studio where Jennifer Lopez stands motionless. He secretly enrolls in ballroom dancing thus giving him fulfillment but his wife suspects foul play and hires an investigator. While repetitious the setup is catchy and the ending is rewarding. Director Peter Chelsom does a fine job at examining ballroom dancing within the relationship established but Jennifer Lopez is disappointing in a stiff performance. She begins the film as an image observed in a window with a blank gaze on her face. From there it is pretty straightforward for her. Gere has fun as a guy stepping into a hidden passion that will ultimately prove rewarding. Susan Sarandon is well cast as his suspicious wife who is speechless to the sudden new behavior from her husband. Stanley Tucci steals scenes as Gere's boss who secretly dances donning a wig. That of course, gives way to lame homosexual stereotypes but Tucci wings it. Richard Jenkins plays a private investigator hired by Sarandon, who will be flustered at the facts he unearths. Celebration of dancing and its inner circle relationships result in a charming film. Score: 8 ½ / 10"

Gere is not an action hero but everyone else seemed to me to be fine in their roles (Jennifer Lopez can dance!), the story is a bit drippy but not sopping, the dancing a treat, and as I said, Tucci's performance makes it worth watching, for me. That smile beneath a black wig is an image I will hold the rest of my life. I notice many of the poor reviews reference the original, which I have not seen.

","Richard Gere films fall into 2 categories me: ""really like"" and ""really dislike."" There seems to be little gray area. Count this one strongly in the ""really like"" column.<br/><br/>An Americanized-version of the original Japanese film, the story is centered on Mr. Gere's character and his willingness to break his routine looking for more from life (some people do not appreciate how good they have it). His life from the outside looks enviable – great job, great wife (Susan Sarandon) and great family. But as Mr. Gere commutes home every night he spots the lovely and lonely-looking Jennifer Lopez peering out the window of a dance studio. On a whim, Mr. Gere jumps off the train and into the studio hoping to meet Ms. Lopez. He is quickly taught that there is no hope there, but in the process learns that he loves to dance. As his wife becomes suspicious of a change in his routine and attitude, she learns of his secret lessons and questions the reasons for them and the secrecy. To say more would spoil the plot, and that would be just wrong.<br/><br/>I recommend this as a wonderful movie to watch – for young and old, for a great date movie, and even a great Valentine's movie. Just a warning to the male viewers, your woman may visibly swoon at the sight of Mr. Gere in a tuxedo carrying a red rose for his lady. Hard for us normal guys to live up to that image."

I like both versions well enough to watch more than once. I thought Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon were good. Detective Devine was a little lacking compared to his Japanese counterpart simply because you wouldn't expect the Japanese detective to respond the way he did to the surveillance. Jennifer Lopez was the weak link in this story; her character wasn't as developed as the Japanese, and her performance was one-dimensional. She didn't bring enough personality to the part to be the big catalyst the story line demands. Other than her weak performance, I thought it was a pretty good movie."

Richard Gere holds everything together well, Susan Sarandon as wife Beverly gives some feeling to what is essentially a functional part, and Jennifer Lopez does well as the emotionally conflicted Paulina, a rather awkward and angular character.<br/><br/>I liked it: if I actually liked dance, I would have liked it much more."

Lopez plays a dance teacher, Richard Gere plays an overworked corporate American and Susan Sarandon plays his wife. One evening, John Clark (Gere) misses his train and decides to take a walk before catching the next one when he spots a beauty(Lopez) in the window of a ballroom dancing class and decides the next day when he sees her again that he will take up dancing as a hobby. Now, you may be thinking that he is looking to have an affair, but that's far from the story. <br/><br/>The minute John arrives at the dance studio, the audience is given an in-depth look into the lives of those who pay good money to go to such studios to learn the art of dance. Some do it because they must learn how to dance for such occasions as their wedding day, some do it to keep in shape, some do it for sanity, some do it because if they don't they might lose their sanity and others, well you know. <br/><br/>When Beverly Clark (Sarandon) upon hearing one too many sob stories of cheating boyfriends and husbands at work, begins to notice that her husband has increasingly started to come home late, she hires a private detective, who sends out his boy, Scott(Played by a hilarious Nick Cannon) to keep an eye on John. Meanwhile, the detective has an eye for Beverly as well. John and Paulina(Lopez) get close but nothing more than friendship develops between them.

","Every year, there are dozens of films made that try so hard to reach a little deeper, to hold on a little tighter, and to leave us breathless. Every year there's either one good one or (most often) none at all. This film was the exception. From the opening moment of getting to know this main character, we get the instant feel that is portrayed throughout the entire film- a feeling of real life. This movie is brilliant simply because it is so believable, and so filled with love. It grabs you from start to finish and never lets you go. It is a story about real life, and the beauty that it holds. It is a sensible and decent story that provides a look into what our lives could and should really become. <br/><br/>This is the story of a man searching for a meaning throughout the film, only to realize that his meaning has been right in front of his eyes the whole time. An ensemble film at heart, this is one of the greatest casts I've seen in years. Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon, and Jennifer Lopez all turn in fantastic lead performances, and share the screen well together. It's the supporting cast that really makes the movie, thoug, Stanley Tucci and Lisa Ann Walter stick out in particular as two dancers made for each other. Both actors are quickly making their way to my favorites list. The entire cast puts in superb work.<br/><br/>Yes, it's a story about life as we all can live it. As Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez dance in the dark studio alone at night, you worry, for a split second, that the film will slip into the old and used form of movies- but it stays better. Because life is not a fairy tale and it's not a passionate romance- but if we learn to appreciate what we already have around us, we can, in essence, find the fairy tale in our own lives. And that's what makes this movie so great. It teaches us to appreciate and love the beauty of our own lives, and it's a lesson we can all learn. 9/10 stars!!!"

John decides to enroll in a dance class and finds that he truly has a passion for it and that it makes his life more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Many reviewers compare this film to the Japanese original and it seems this version suffers in comparison. I have not seen the Japanese version but I liked Shall We Dance quite a bit. The fact that Gere's character felt there was something missing despite him having a good life is a feeling I think everyone can relate to, to some extent. Feeling guilty about wanting something on top of what he already has makes the character more real, to me anyway, and it explains well why he kept it a secret from his wife.<br/><br/>Gere's moments in the dance class provide the film's real laughs and it's fun to see those guys get the feel for dancing. Jennifer Lopez, for once, gives a good performance as the moody dance instructor and her low-key presence is a huge plus. Where the film falters somewhat is when Sarandon hires two private detectives. Their characters are a little too silly and they don't fit comfortably in the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Overall I found Shall We Dance to be an enjoyable romantic comedy.

","The Japanese movie Shall We Dansu was charming, funny and a bit of a mess. This remake actually fixes some of the weaknesses of the plot but loses way too much of the charm and humor.<br/><br/>You really can't expect a lot from a movie starring too of Hollywood's least charismatic romantic leads, and it's no surprise that Gere and Lopez turn in forgettable, generic performances. Arguably this is acceptable from Gere; he plays a rather colorless drone to begin with, but it would be nice if Lopez had shown a little spark. She's pretty awful in this, tending to seem colorless but occasionally reaching the point of tears with little justification.<br/><br/>On the bright side, Lopez's turn around isn't as jarring as in the original, and Gere's behavior and his wife's makes more sense. This is not to say that the movie isn't painfully Hollywood, but its probably no worse in the respect than the original. And the supporting cast is decent, although Stanley Tucci isn't nearly as funny as Naoto Takenaka was in the original.<br/><br/>The last thing to note is that the dancing is poorly filmed. Now, this isn't a dance movie per se, it's a movie about how dancing effects people, but one still would expect the few dance scenes to be competently filmed. Instead, one gets no sense of movement or dance throughout the movie; the camera seems to unerringly go the opposite direction from where it should.<br/><br/>None of this makes it a horrible movie, but it's certainly a weak one."

","A professional ballroom dancer would like this film because it does promise to encourage greater participation in dance.

After doing so it offers a blessed sense of warmth and well-being that is generated by a complete fulfilment of wishes for the characters.

","Lovely almost tear-jerking dance movie. Makes you wanna pick-up the old lessons again. Great dancing by the actors but consider the DVD which show a lot more lovely dance acts as Bonus material....!<br/><br/>The music also is fabulous. Besides some modern versions of standards such as Shall we dance, there is a great piece of tango music. It accompanies the highlight dance of Gere and JayLo. The tango they dance could very well give a push to ballroom dancing as a replacement for the silly dancing one sees in the party scene. Ballroom dancing for sure will be the next hot thing here in Europe, but I guess also in the US and elsewhere. Hence the great popularity of TV-programs like BBC's Strictly come dancing where celebrities and pro's contest on the dance floor. The popular program already is widely copied by other networks here on the continent"

","The Japanese film, ""Shall We Dance?"" was one of the most commercially successful foreign language films ever released in the United States. The almost inevitable American remake, now set in Chicago, follows the original very closely in terms of both storyline and spirit.<br/><br/>John Clark (Richard Gere) is a successful middle-aged lawyer who has spent virtually his entire adult life devising wills for other people. He has a happy marriage and two teenaged children who adore him, yet something still seems to be missing from his life. One night, while riding the train home as he has done hundreds of times before, he finds himself transfixed by the image of a beautiful young woman staring out from an upper-story window of a second-rate dance studio. Intrigued by the sight, John musters up the courage to get off the train, mosey on into the studio, and sign up for dance lessons. As John begins to find meaning and purpose in his life, his concerned wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), fearing that he may in fact be having an affair, goes to a detective agency, headed by Richard Jenkins, to have the man she loves discreetly followed.<br/><br/>Gooey moments and plot contrivances not withstanding, this is a sweet and charming film that, in its own quiet way, makes a profound statement about finding meaning in the second half of one's life. Although the narrative and humor often have a sitcom feel to them, the overall breezy tone and good-natured ambiance of the movie win us over anyway. And although many of the subsidiary people who populate this tale are really more caricatures than characters, at least they're colorful and well-delineated enough to add to - rather than subtract from - the central drama.<br/><br/>Gere, Sarandon, Jenkins, Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale and Lisa Ann Walter all give winning performances. In fact, of all the actors, only Jennifer Lopez, as the beautiful young woman who teaches John a thing or two about dancing, falls short of the mark. Ms. Lopez, for all her other undeniable talents, simply has not developed an actor's confidence on camera, and, as a result, she is unable to rise to the level of the professionals.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the dancing alone makes the film worth watching."

I would have liked to have seen someone else play that role because, compared to the other women in the show, she seemed colorless and uninteresting, especially for the leading man (Gere) to have been as much in love with her as he was supposed to be. Maybe someone softer and not as self assured as Sarandon came across. The dancing is great and I've always enjoyed a brassy blonde as appeared here. She really stole much of the show.

Sarandon is his busy wife and Lopez is a defensive ballroom dance teacher. The wife of course assumes he's having an affair and hires a detective. The odd ducks in the dance class all become friends and become supporters for each other. There is a dance contest and some nice storyline resolutions.<br/><br/>Gere is loose and funny as the lawyer and actually does better dance moves here than in his acclaimed performance in Chicago. Lopez also does some good dancing, and Sarandon smolders as the jealous wife. Gillette has a good role as Miss Mitzi the dance school owner. Cannavale is hilarious as the tough guy who thinks dancing will draw women to him. Tucci is also very funny as the closet heterosexual who loves to wear sequins and dance. Jenkins is winning as the detective, and Miller is good as the fat guy. Walter almost steals the film as the loud, obnoxious woman who spends all her spare time training for the big dance contest. <br/><br/>Shall We Dance starts slowly but once it gets going it's a winner."

(I was shocked to learn that she had never ballroom danced before filming ""Dance""). As I am a Black man from Chicago (and the movie is set there), I appreciated that there were two likable, African-American characters in the movie. Nick Cannon (who was great in ""Drumline"") had a small, but smart and well-written role. Addressing the comedic side of ""Dance"", Stanley Tucci was very funny! I think it took a lot of guts to play his ""two"" characters. Aside from one major F-word (from Tucci) my wife and I liked that there was very little profanity in ""Dance"". People do actually talk without cursing every sentence. Also, since Gere's character truly loves his wife, I REALLY liked how Gere's late-night dance scene with Lopez concluded.

"CharteredStreets","6","0","0","25 February 2005"," As light and silly as you expect, but not as formulaic
","""Shall We Dance,"" a remake of a Japanese film I have not seen, looks like it's going to be an ancient formula picture: bored married man spots beautiful dance instructor; they dance; tension; sex; conflict; happy ending. Yet it somehow manages to break free from the mechanics of these movies, and I found it surprisingly entertaining. It does not offer any insight, and there are no scenes in it which have any weight (although there are some that think they do), and yet its characters do not feel like they are trapped in a plot. You actually feel like the characters, however lacking in depth they are, make their own choices. It scrapes a pass.<br/><br/>Richard Gere plays a lawyer married to a... well, her job has something to do with fashion, I think. She's played by Susan Sarandon. The Gere character feels his life has grown monotonous and repetitive, and his marriage stale. His name is John, but you've probably already gathered that.<br/><br/>Every day, on the train home from work, he looks up at a certain station and sees Jennifer Lopez looking out the window of a dancing studio. Soon enough he is signed up for dancing lessons. Well, one can hardly blame him. The problem with seeing Jennifer Lopez in any movie is that she makes everyone else look like... well, like mere human beings.<br/><br/>The dancing school is filled, naturally, with a Cast of Colourful Characters. Omar Miller is the overweight man trying to lose some weight before his marriage, and Bobby Cannavale is the lady's man who believes that if he can dance well, women will drop to his feet. The school is owned by Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), whose smile, we suspect, hides the tracks of her tears (the way she knocks back booze from a hip flask when no one is looking is a dead giveaway). Lopez is Paulina, a professional dancer who is sick of people joining dance classes to get in her pants.<br/><br/>John keeps his dancing from his wife, who begins to suspect, inevitably, the he's having an affair. In an absurd but amusing subplot, she hires a cartoon private detective to follow him around. Another subplot involves Link, a co-worker of John, played by Stanley Tucci. He is a serious businessman who watches a lot of American Football, but who secretly, Gere discovers, goes to dancing lessons too, wearing astonishingly flamboyant costumes. Well, the trailer gives that away anyway. Tucci often plays characters with a business-like seriousness, as in ""The Terminal,"" and in this movie I liked the way that the seriousness is actually masking his inner extrovert.<br/><br/>You no doubt think you know where the plot is going, and you would not be entirely wrong. You would also not be entirely right. We suspect that sooner or later Gere will sleep with Lopez (or, at least, kiss her), but no, their brief flirtation leads to some sweaty dancing in place of a sex scene. Gere doesn't have much of a sex drive in the movie; we suspect that he really does just want to dance with Lopez. I guess I'd settle for that.<br/><br/>I don't know how closely the movie follows the Japanese original, but on its own, it's entertaining enough. It's light and fun, and it doesn't execute its story in the ways I expected. Yes, it leads up to a big dancing competition, but even then it doesn't pile on the clichÃ©s. Most of its appeal comes down to the actors; Gere has effortless charm (though not much else; he's completely unconvincing when he tries for the big emotions), and Lopez is simply a star, in the best sense of the word. John's two children are almost embarrassingly phony (the movie could have done away with them completely, no harm done), but the sense of fun that the movie has is contagious, and I caught myself smiling enough to recommend it. Part of the reason I liked it is that it rarely felt like it was trying too hard for the smiles."

One day he notices a dance studio out his train window, and he wonders. He sees beautiful Paulina (Jennifer Lopez) wistfully gazing out the window. One day he decides to investigate, the sign says ""You are welcome to watch"", so he goes in. I'm not sure there is any message in this movie, but I had a great feeling of joy watching these adult men dance. No sex, no murders, and only one curse word. An entertaining 100 minutes.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. For some reason John decides to take ballroom dancing lessons weekly without ever mentioning it to his wife or children. That seems unusual to me, but I suppose sometimes a husband or wife just feels they want to do something as an individual rather than as a family. He is obviously attracted to Paulina, but we never get the impression that he is considering cheating on his marriage. He learns to dance, while Beverly gets suspicious and hires a PI to see what he is up to. At the dance competition, the PI tells his wife and daughter, they go, cheer dad on, who freaks out and freezes, dropping his partner, when he realizes they are there. But all ends well as he inspires Paulina to return to England to work seriously for competition, and the dancing gives John a new joy in life. John shows up at Beverly's work, with a red rose and an intention to teach her to dance.<br/><br/>John taking dance lessons and entering a formal competition without ever telling his wife seems, to me, a bit far-fetched.

Oh no, this was going to be another of his 'Intersection', 'Autumn in New York' and 'Unfaithful' types of movies. The movie turns out the be reasonably good. The story line is down to earth but I especially like it because he does not cross over (I use this term deliberately as I do not want to spoil the movie for readers). Usually the man or woman crosses over but there are no cross overs for Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez. The relationship borders between intensity of a male and female and yet at times they seem so detached and distant. The soundtrack is absolutely fantastic. This is not one of the best of Jennifer Lopez's films because her character is not allowed to develop. Richard Gere is Richard Gere - minimal dialogue but when he does speak, the words jump out and hit reality right smack in the middle of the head. All in all, an ordinary movie.

Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon did a fine job and created a believable couple. Susan Sarandon pulled things together in my view. I liked the PI, he was very good. Gere's dancing office mate also did a fine job, but the believability of that character is the responsibility of the director. The actor did well with what he was given.<br/><br/>Plot: Someone else said that the original worked better in the framework of Japanese culture. I agree. This movie had to make some concessions to work in an American setting.<br/><br/>Directing: Hmm, pretty good I'd say, except for JL. Perhaps he did his best with what she had to offer, maybe they did 50 takes on her scenes, who knows. The pace of the movie was quite good, and that's important.

Tucci shows us another facet of his talent, and while he doesn't portray the closet dancer character as flaky as the Japanese counterpart, he is convincing, showing us how much he'd like to be something he isn't allowed to be in the ""real"" world. He is courageous in his ""coming out. This is a delightful confection and leaves you feeling satisfied."

","This movie, ""Shall We Dance?"" is a delightful comedy. Richard Gere is excellent. The characters at the dance studio are such fun. His two fellow members of the beginners class are good. I remember Anita Gillete, the actress who plays the the dance studio owner, from the movie ""Moonstruck"". She has a much better part here and is very good in it. Jennifer Lopez mostly stands around and poses. Susan Sarandon has a really minor role. Lisa Ann Walter is effective in her part.<br/><br/>This movie will probably be a great box office success, strickly from word of mouth. It is a light comedy and it is a time when Americans need some lightness and laughter in their lives."

He joins a dance class and falls in love with it. Jennifer Lopez does a superb job of playing the dumped-by-her-old-partner dance instructor who almost falls for Gere. Susan Sarandon does just as good, portraying the role of Gere's wife who is unaware of her husbands dancing. The dancing that is performed by Gere and Lopez is unbelievable and is greatly performed.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone who likes dancing, music, or romantic comedies.

This was a very nice Friday romantic comedy that I found appealing, sweet and, while not particularly clever, completely in keeping with the American woman's heart. We like Romantic Comedies. We don't want to think too much either (we do enough in our every day lives thank you). I admit that I was a little dumbfounded by the casting of Gere in this part, but I bought it (along with my popcorn and large coke). I found all the character actors quite charming and stellar in their roles. And frankly, when I left the movie theater -- I left with a big smile. In the political climate of today - I kinda needed that smile and thankful that Shall We Dance was able to deliver.<br/><br/>I loved that dance scene between Gere and Lopez: hope they do an MTV release for it.

","What does a man who has achieved the proverbial American dream do when he realizes he is bored with his life? A middle-aged man who feels too embarrassed by his riches to admit his feelings of apathy to anyone. Not his coworkers, not his friends, and certainly not his wife. A man whose conscience tells him that revealing his innermost thoughts would be tantamount to admitting personal failure and give rise to a sense of unworthiness for the good life he has achieved despite the happiness he hasn't found or retained. <br/><br/>Richard Gere is faced by this dilemma in Shall We Dance, a remake of the popular 1996 Japanese film of the same name. Gere plays Chicago lawyer John Clark who seems to have it all---good health, white-collar occupation, house in the suburbs, attractive wife (played by Susan Sarandon) and well-adjusted children---but realizes that all he has is a life marked by a routine broken only by the daily train commute to and from work. His stable, secure and contented home life, which would be the envy of most, simply lacks spirit, excitement and, for Mr. Clark, joy. In any other film looking for easy solutions, Gere would have to become an embezzler or have an affair. But not in this entertaining and warm-hearted film. <br/><br/>Gere's character transcends his humdrum existence through ballroom dancing. Sounds simple, but it's not. He's got to learn, which means taking lessons. Jennifer Lopez is his inspiration, but he also meets other interesting people, emerging with a renewed lease on life as a result of his musical quest. There are a few bumps along the way, but the movie's tone is nothing less than nice and pleasant. It entertains without insulting its audience.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lopez is also very good in a minor role, and proves she still has her moves as the assistant dance instructor who helps Gere get his rhythm. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as the straight-laced lawyer with a secret alter ego he unleashes on the dance floor every night. Much of this is in the original Japanese film, including tap dancing under the desk and dancing while waiting for a train. But this American remake is definitely worth seeing to experience the elation that Gere experiences on screen.<br/><br/>While the original Japanese film had more drama, pathos, and suspense, this version achieves its cinematic vision by a comfortable comedic touch that is sure to please. This is a nice film with nothing to offend. It's bright and charming entertainment that also gives viewers pause for thought. Shall We Dance deserves an 8/10."

Everyone can relate to the rookie learning a new hobby or sport. There is also the underlying theme about being able to achieve some level of success even after a short period of time. I especially enjoyed watching the ""real dancers"" at the competition in the movie. I think Lisa Ann Walter steals some of the limelight from the major actors in this film.<br/><br/>It reminded me of old movies because I realized there was nothing that would cause this movie to be rated ""R"". Although it doesn't have the chase scenes or the fight scenes, guys might want to take their date to see this movie because it surely puts a woman in a romantic mood. <br/><br/>On a practical note, there were a few things that didn't make sense from a dancing point of view, but I can't disclose them here or it will ruin some of the enjoyment.

The premise in the original is that the gentleman is culturally ingrained to be ashamed of public displays. I thought it might be difficult for anyone to convince an audience that a middle aged American man had that problem.<br/><br/>They solved the problem by ignoring it and creating another form of tension in the form of the American accountant feeling guilty for his lust for the dance teacher (Jennifer Lopez) and not wanting to admit it to his wife and family.<br/><br/>The dancing was fun, the costumes were fantastic. Stanley T. was exemplary.<br/><br/>The man who played the detective, and his assistant were both outstanding.<br/><br/>I liked that a number of the scenes were true to the original. <br/><br/>The vignettes at the end, where it wrapped up the lives of all the persons in the movie seemed a bit like overkill, but then, it was nice to know what happened to everyone.

","I saw this movie in a invitation only preview with a followup Q&A with the director. It was a totally enjoyable experience and I will spend my own money to see it again with my husband and tell al my friends and relatives that this is ""not to be missed"". <br/><br/>Richard Gere plays the hardworking probate attorney with the beautiful home family and wife whom he loves but rarely sees because of her demanding work as a top buyer. Is it so unusual that a man would have a yearning for something more? Initially lured by the vision of a beautiful woman he sees looking out the dance studio window from his train home from work, he decides to take ballroom dance lessons. What is unusual... is for a movie to depict that this inner yearning is ultimately for more expression of beauty and creativity in one's life which is necessary for real happiness.<br/><br/>The dance lesson scenes provide great laughs while encouraging compassion ...and if you love dancing anyway there is much to enjoy in the ballroom competition scenes. Richard Gere does a great job and may even encourage your spouse to learn to dance...if you're lucky. <br/><br/>The elitist movie critics will probably pan this one because its message supports the concepts of loyalty and morality and everyday kindness to our fellow human beings....all of which are not deemed sophisticated or 'deep' enough motivators for the tastes of most movie critics who see themselves as superior in intellect to the rest of us. <br/><br/>The people involved in making and directing and producing this beautiful movie can feel good about contributing something so entertaining and beautiful to watch while courageously reinforcing the values of moral faithfulness and goodness of the human spirit.

I won't say anymore in case I blow the entire plot. And while it's not laugh-out-loud funny all the time, there are a lot of nice moments, and the film has a lot of heart. And everyone in it is good, even Jennifer Lopez, who actually isn't in the movie a lot. This is really Richard Gere's film, and he does a great job in the role of a happily married, successful man who is just missing that certain spark in his life and finds it in an unusual place.<br/><br/>This will be a great date movie, a nice way to spend an afternoon and evening.

","A movie about a Richard Gere-looking lawyer (Richard Gere) who has a mid-life crisis and decides to take up dancing after seeing a beautiful J-Lo looking dance instructor (J-Lo) on his way home from work. Susan Sarandon stars in a forgettable role as Gere's wife.<br/><br/>Run, do not walk to take this off your Blockbuster on-line queue.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lopez has starred in one good movie, ""Out of Sight."" The reason that movie worked was a) she was beautiful and b) she shut up and let the real actors perform. She's still beautiful in this movie, but now she is a real-life star. That means she actually gets to read lines - lots of them - all at our expense. You know how I know when J-Lo's ruining a scene? Her lips are moving.<br/><br/>The worst part about this movie is that Susan Sarandon would lower herself to taking a role in it. I guess after you spend screen time with Julia Roberts in ""Step-mom"" you just go numb. Maybe her and husband Tim Robbins had a bet to see who could do the worst movie of their careers. He had just finished shooting ""code 46,"" so a movie with Lopez was Sarandon's big chance.<br/><br/>The one redeeming moment of this movie is the ending which I won't reveal, not that it matters. We wish this ending came much sooner, but at least Lopez is nowhere in sight. Here, we get a chance to see Gere and Sarandon act for the first time in what seemed like a million minutes. The movie would have done better to close with this scene. Instead we're treated to a last chance look at Jennifer's body in a provocative yellow costume, followed by a ridiculous curtain call of the movie's primary and supporting cast. Perhaps the director knew we weren't paying attention to these characters during the movie. Who knows. What I do know is these aren't the first d-list actors in a J-Lo film whose performances were less interesting than staring at her ass. Worse, they won't be the last."

","I was enchanted by the original '96 version. It was sensitive, charming, enduring, wonderful. This is none of those things. I love Peter Chelsom's work, he's always had something meaningful to say in his previous films, especially Hear My Song. I can only imagine his entire family has been kidnapped and making this was part of the ransom. The original was firmly bedded in the Japanese culture, whereby a man absolutely would not flaunt himself in such a public display as ballroom dancing because it is considered taboo. What excuse has Gere's character got? None. Therefore the whole premise of the film is absolute nonsense. He could have gone home from work, told the good lady he wanted to take dance classes, and Bingo... he takes dance classes. It is simply preposterous to imagine this is something he would have to hide in present day America. Total baloney and shows complete disregard for the outstanding originality of the 96 movie.

There is not one single new element in it; every scene seems like a bad copy of something you have seen done better in a different movie.

","Chicago lawyer John Clark is drawn to the lonely face at a dance studio window he sees from his journey home each evening. Finally one day he decides to jump off the train and go sign up for dance lessons, thus filling a void in his near perfect life. Trouble is, is that his wife thinks he's having an affair and hires a private detective to tail him.<br/><br/>Shall We Dance? is the American remake of Masayuki Suo's beguiling and much loved 1996 picture, Shall We Dansu? Met with the usual howls of derision that comes with the announcement of another Asia remake from Hollywood, it's somewhat refreshing to find that Peter Chelson's film is actually charming and proof positive that American remakes can work if handled with care. Fuelling it with a more comedic tone than the original obviously helps the piece, and not being the kind of tacky romance picture so hated by many is surely a bonus. Outside of the zippy nature of the dance sequences, after the natural funny set up of the two left footed gentlemen, what chiefly works is the dynamic of the characters at Miss Mitzi's dance studio, each one having their own little reason for being there, as seemingly poles apart characters share one delightful goal.<br/><br/>The cast, led by the sadly undervalued Richard Gere {John Clark}, work real well, even Jennifer Lopez {Paulina}, who at a stretch could be called an average actress, works well within the tightly scripted piece. Honours arguably go to Stanley Tucci as wig wearing, tan sprayed, work colleague of Clark, Link Peterson, whilst Anita Gilette {Miss Mitzi} is positively wonderful. Truth is is that it's an ensemble piece where it comes together nicely to form a charming picture, it's only main flaw being that we are asked to believe that modern day men feel stigmatised by ballroom dancing. Utter rubbish as far as I'm concerned, there are few things as elegant as The Waltz, or as sensual as The Rumba, and you can take that to the dance studio! 7/10"

","If you're looking for a film that you can zone out to, feel good about by the end of it, and really feel like you're dancing along with Richard Gere's character throughout the entirety of the movie, than this is the right place for you to be. A simple, light-hearted romantic (in the sense of whimsical) getaway from reality, that I'm sure more than a few hard-working Americans can relate to, who go to there nine to five jobs each and every day.<br/><br/>There a few problems with this film, however. First of all, Jennifer Lopez. She's good...but...let's consider this. If you've seen the original (which btw, was much better than this remake), you know that it was an Asian film, and so the girl that was casted was obviously Asian. To cast, the Latino, big-bootied J-Lo, is a bit of a stretch considering that their charisma is completely different. The other problem I found, was that although it's been a while since I've seen the original, as I recall it was more of a drama, rather than a comedy, and though this isn't hysterical every moment, the remake pokes fun at a lot of what the original movie's purpose was, and this is just more comical at times, than I think it should be.<br/><br/>All in all it's an enjoyable film, and I greatly enjoy Susane Surandon the most in the movie. I think her performance in the role as Richard Gere's wife, is achieved with brilliance, as so many of her roles are.<br/><br/>Again, if you're looking for something very light, this is your best bet. Enjoy it, though if you're trying to decide between this and the original, stick with the first, it's much better and more realistic."

She really did do a great job. This movie just took my breath away. It's a fun, happy. sad, and great date movie. Go see it, you won't be disappointed. If there was another remake for this movie I would 100% do it, no questions asked. The soundtrack as well is one of the best. When I saw the making of this movie and the music that goes along to it I was just taking away by it. I knew I was going to have to see it. I was convinced. Just go see it and judge for yourself I know you'll love it. Go see Shall We Dance today and get ready to dance yourself."

","""Shall We Dance (2004)"" was good movie and it was obvious to me that Richard Gere has more star attraction than Jennifer Lopez. I also saw the Japanese version and I liked it a lot. The inclusion of Ben E. King's ""Save The Last Dance for Me"" was wonderful. I replayed this part of the movie several times on my VCR.<br/><br/>If there is going to be a sequel to the 2004 version, JL's role should be strengthen and there should be more dancing, more rhythm dancing (swing, cha-cha, etc). Hey, how about a subplot where Mr. Clark and his daughter train for a big competition? Followed by the main plot where Paulina and Mr. Clark dance at ""Blackpool"". Mr. Clark comes to the rescue of Paulina at Blackpool because her original partner left her for some unknown reason. I know this is silly, but its fun to describe it.<br/><br/>Julius"
"helluva-1","10","1","2","9 June 2005"," Shall We Dance?
","Dance. Secretly everyone longs for and has a desire for dance. Though it requires the perfect harmony of the soul and body of the partners anyone who has ever danced knows that the feeling is wonderful and rewards for every desperate moment of preparation.<br/><br/>The protagonist of the film ""Shall We Dance?"" is an initially boring and unhappy estate lawyer called John Clark (played magnificently by Richard Gere). He secretly engrosses in ballroom dancing and soon he finds friends and a subtle kind of love with the beautiful and enigmatic dance teacher, Paulina (played by Jennifer Lopez), who has a passion for dance but seemingly something hurts her. Later John's jealous wife turns up at the dance competition and something tragic happens. However, everyone finds his/her true love in the end.<br/><br/>Every moment of he film holds the attention of the cinema-goer. Half of the film consists of impressive dancing scenes. Lopez acts incredibly as the sensitive beauty hiding a harm of the past and dances excellently. Though Gere can be still charming to women we should admit that the age of 56 is not the most appropriate to pick up dancing.<br/><br/>All in all, ""Shall We Dance?"" is an excellent movie about a recently neglected but otherwise beautiful pastime activity. I can recommend it to everyone who likes romantic comedies and dance and is interested in the story of a shy but kind-hearted middle-aged man who finds happiness in the joy of dance and opens others' hearts."
"angelapop","10","1","2","24 May 2005"," a great lesson of love and dance
","I recommend this movie to everybody. It is very romantic and passionate. It is also about loving somebody and showing that to the person you love. It underlines the importance of living with somebody, of witnessing their live and of supporting and accepting their needs. A great lesson of true romance and the most beautiful expression of what a marriage should be. As for the performance of the actors, they did a great appearance in the movie and gave that special something to it. Richard Gere, with his charm, gave life to the bored lawyer that found a great relief in the dancing school. Also, Jennifer Lopez proved to be a great actress. As a fun fact, the movie got me into taking dancing classes."

","I'm not pretending to be a professional movie critic, only that I can write to you, as being a common person in this sometimes mean world we live in.

We, as much as a lot of couples have been fascinated by ballroom dancing for a long time and I guess it would be easy for us to be attracted to this kind of film. I can tell you ""being a very warm blooded man"" if you know what I mean, I've always enjoyed looking at other women like Jennifer Lopez and I have fantasized very much. At this stage in my life, much like in the movie with Richard & Suzan, I'm finding out that my wife ""IS"" and will always remain; THE GREAT LOVE OF MY LIFE. and that is pretty hard to beat in any Movie. please excuse my spelling my mother tongue is French.

","Same time every night a bored and tired lawyer takes the train home from work, looks out the window, and sees a beautiful yet sad dance instructor. He signs up for dance lessons, and although it seems he is motivated by innocent curiosity, he hides it from his wife, and the triangle begins.<br/><br/>Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez both seem a bit too old now, but thats what the story is trying to portray, it manages to show they have emotional pasts, but the details aren't really explored. Every character has a weakness, but they seem real, and I enjoyed their progress. <br/><br/>You wont see any great dancing here, but the music is good, the cast is likable, and it had a few laughs. I don't usually go for romantic comedies but I would recommend this one."

I'm also not a big fan of Susan Sarandon, but she pulled her weight this time.

","I really enjoyed the movie. I thought it could have been better by eliminating a couple of scenes, but it is totally fun to watch and there was lots of nice music as well.<br/><br/>Jennifer is a great dancer and a very sexy lady. I never really thought her acting was the best ever, but in this movie she did well. In addition, her role centred on her dancing not dialogue.<br/><br/>Susan Sarandon is a great actress as usual, and the role fits her well and Richard Gere is actually very funny and his character is absolutely likable. Stanley Tucci is hilarious as Link and I am not sure how many scenes he appears in, but they were quite a few.<br/><br/>The movie is a total success as a remake of the Japanese Shall we dansu? I believe it was well translated into the North American culture without imposing any foreign cultural traits which the American viewer would not understand.<br/><br/>I only gave it a 7 because of what I mentioned about the unnecessary scenes (I will not specify so that they are not spoilers).<br/><br/>Finally, I think the movie is clean enough for an enjoyable afternoon with the entire family. I am very surprised with the US PG-13 rating. In Canada it is more appropriately rated as PGÂ…. Well there is I believe one F word (coincidently, in one of the scenes that I didn't like)."

I'm always seeking good entertainment that doesn't resort to raw sex and violence. This one stands on its own with a good story. The story is believable and well shot.

","I was skeptical as to whether I'd like this movie. I'm not usually a fan of remakes as they usually pale in comparison to the originals. I was a huge fan of the Japanese original of this movie, so I wondered how this version would compare.<br/><br/>I'm delighted to say that even though the storyline is exactly the same, it was not boring to see another version of this film. Jennifer Lopez and Richard Gere both do wonderful jobs convincing us they are ballroom dancers and Richard Gere's ability to laugh at himself is charming. The chemistry between them is believable and adds to the movie's appeal.<br/><br/>This is a light-hearted, fun movie; it is not an award winner or full of gut-wrenching emotion. But the reason to go to a movie is to be entertained and this one definitely does that. I saw it with three other people, one in her thirties, one in his fifties and one in her eighties and we all enjoyed it. We all agreed we liked it well enough to see it again and two of us would buy it."

","SPOILERS!<br/><br/>I will be the first to say that I wasn't holding out much hope for this movie. I mean it has J-Lo in it, for heaven's sake! And Richard Gere dancing? You gotta be kidding me! I thought Susan Sarandon must be crazy getting mixed up with a movie like this!<br/><br/>I was wrong, on all accounts!<br/><br/>It's the story of a man who is searching for his identity (Gere) and finds it in ballroom dancing and the lives he touches along the way. His inspiration is the lovely, but aloof Paulina (J-Lo). One of the things I liked most about this film, is they didn't go the traditional cheating husband route.<br/><br/>OK...that's simplified a bit, but you get the idea.<br/><br/>J-Lo proved to me that she is not only a good actress, but a wonderful dancer too. I was tired just watching some of the routines!<br/><br/>I had heard that Richard Gere could dance, but never seen any proof of it (the tap dancing he did in Chicago is MUCH different from ballroom dancing!)<br/><br/>Susan Sarandon, as always, was superb!<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci was touching and impressive as Link Peterson, a straight man with a passion for dancing. Lisa Ann Walter steals many of the scenes she's in. Not only can she dance, but she has wonderful comedic timing.<br/><br/>That's not to say that there weren't some wholes in the plot. OK, one major one. I have taken ballroom dance classes. You don't get to the level the newbie dancers got to in just 8 weeks! Maybe one of them could POSSIBLY be a quick study, but not all of them!<br/><br/>Bottom line....This movie brings us back to the old-time Fred Astair/Ginger Rogers movies (the movie even gives a a brief no to them !)"

The dancing was wonderful. <br/><br/>JLo - Absolutely beautiful in the role of Paulina. I haven't seen her in a while (other than the stupid tabloids), so I had forgotten how really pretty she is. She's a talented actress and quite a dancer too. And, I have to say this: the shape, size and form of her body are very near perfection (at least by my standards). <br/><br/>Richard Gere is another of my favorites. He plays the role of the quiet, nervous, awkward and sexy guy taking dance lessons to meet a girl. Gave me an idea that I might use. LOL"

Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon had awesome chemistry and did a great job. It was so refreshing to see that Lopez and Gere did not have an affair as I thought at first.

"michaelzstuff","10","1","2","6 November 2004"," A fairy tale remake that tugged at my heart strings!!
","That's what it is: possibly the ultimate ""feel-good"" Hollywood movie. And a fairy tale. And in my humble opinion, there is absolutely nothing wrong with that.<br/><br/>I am a fan of classic films (and the opposite of a fan of the Hollywood film industry). And while I am always interested in seeing remakes, I am usually compelled to admit that the original was better. <br/><br/>But in this case, I honestly think that the remake is actually a far, far better film than the original (which is a delightful classic). It does not hide that it is a fairy tale - in fact, it emphasizes it - and handles it with an intelligent humour that very often surpasses the humour of the ""original"". <br/><br/>Personally, I also feel that there is more ""chemistry"" between Richard Gere and Susan Sarandon than between the original characters. (Or, to be quite honest, maybe it's just that I find Gere and Sarandon a more attractive couple."
"mariposarosa2","9","1","2","16 October 2004"," sweet and refreshing...better than original....
","I went to see ""Shall We Dance?"" purely because I needed a diversion from the stress and burdens of daily life. Gladly, I can say that it was worth the price of admission. Jennifer Lopez was glowing and striking as Paulina, a sad and broken dancer who hides out, teaching dance lessons at Miss Mitzi's, a failing ballroom dancing school. Paulina catches the eye of John Clark (Richard Gere), a man caught in a mundane but successful lifestyle as a successful accountant with a loving wife and children.<br/><br/>What sets ""Shall We Dance?"" apart from the majority of films, today, is its lack of cynicism and its warm sense of humor. This is a throwback to another era of movie making where romance and integrity prevail. It was great to see Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez dance together. Jennifer definitely displayed her years of dance training, here, and it was a great vehicle for her many talents as both actress and dancer. I was so happy to see a film where a man doesn't have to engage in an extramarital affair or run away from his responsibilities to open his eyes to a new way of life filled with dance and self expression.<br/><br/>Take someone you love to this movie!"

Don't just go see this movie, RUN AND GO SEE THIS MOVIE. I could see it again tomorrow. It is nice to come out of the movie without<br/><br/>the movie having a message.

"nottoman","10","1","3","7 March 2011"," Thoughtful and engaging. So many people are closet dancers
","This movie has many great textures - the opposite sex attraction, the dancing, the dynamics and stresses of relationships, and then on a deeper level, the thoughtful narration of Gere's character concerning people and their wills, their lives, and their hopes and regrets. I was impressed by the acting of all the main characters, and was especially surprised by Lopez's performance. This movie is so much a story about the dreams and hidden desires of most people, who deep inside want to break out of their mundane routines, and do something that's in their heart. Personally I related incredibly to Gere's character -- sure, deep inside I would love to dance, to express myself, to become skilled at something I did on the dance floor in the 80's...but am afraid of what people would think of a 46 yr old father of six doing something like that. The music was outstanding and added a very specific flavor to the film, invoking a mood of thoughtfulness and self examination at the right time, and the spice of exuberance when appropriate. Closet dancers - enjoy!! I loved it and watch it once a year at least."

","Shall We Dance is a charming movie, and not as bad as some critics make it out to be. The dance routines and the dresses are wondrous, and Richard Gere makes an appealing lead as he usually does. Susan Sarandon is also excellent. Jennifer Lopez looked miserable at times, but I can't help admitting what a lovely woman she is. Shall We Dance is well photographed, has a nice idea, and will certainly appeal to those who like romantic comedies and dancing. The script is good, a little patchy in places but not too bad, it is a tad predictable, and the direction if a little leisurely was assured on the most part. This film, despite the flaws is an appealing film, and I will definitely watch it again given the choice. 7/10 Bethany Cox"
"ianlouisiana","6","1","3","11 April 2009"," We marry because""We all need a witness to our lives""? Yuk...
","Come off it!That is exactly the sort of psychobabble that gives wealthy middle class American women like Mrs Clark(Miss S.Sarandon) a bad name. In ""Shall we dance?"" she utters it straight-faced and with every appearance of deadly earnestness.No one in the movie questions this statement so we are left with the impression that the producers actually believe it and that Mr Clark (Mr R.Gere) not only needs Miss Sarandon to witness his life but also Miss J.Lopez to witness it as well and to hope that Miss Sarandon doesn't witness Miss Lopez witnessing Mr Gere's life........I could go on but life(witnessed or no)is too short....... So,apart from some cringe-worthy dialogue,what does ""Shall we dance?"" have to offer?Perhaps surprisingly,quite a lot.Mr Gere exhudes charm as the lawyer slightly bored with the apparent perfection of his life.Spotting the winsome Miss Lopez on a balcony from the passing El,this aspirant Romeo leaves the train and joins her Dancing Class with a motive that is not Strictly Ballroom.She rebuffs him and he settles for learning to dance instead. Later,warming to him,she is all dilated nostrils,half - closed eyes and heavy of breath whenever he is within ten feet,but it is too late by then;she has had her chance and lost it. Mr Gere's fellow students are a righteous mixture of race and gender so everybody in the audience except perhaps the odd Eskimo (sorry,Innuit) can feel comfortable. But it's easy to be hypercritical,and the raison d'etre for ""Shall we dance?"" is the wonderful music and the dancing that is made to seem accessible to even the least likely tyros. This is a movie awash with great tunes even though Mr Gere is shown to be sufficiently down with the kids to enjoy a sanitised Rap performer with his son and the son's girlfriend.And if it isn't really him dancing with such elan and grace,well,I don't have to believe it if I don't want to. Because of Mr Gere's charm I can forgive the crass dialogue,I can forgive Miss Lopez's inadequacies,I can even forgive Mr Tucci for wearing a wig.Such forgiveness brings with it a heavy burden for his slim shoulders,but he bears it well. He is also carrying,like a torch,the hopes of many middle-aged men,wrinkly of skin and droopy of butt,that experience and wisdom can triumph over energy and youth.Ah,keep on dreaming lads..........."
"realdancer","5","1","3","4 December 2005"," Trying to improve on a good thing
","I am a ballroom dancer. I saw the original Japanese version. I thought that version had a bit more humanity to it than the American version. This version was a bit too Americanized. The main plot was not believable. The actors could have been better chosen. While Jennifer Lopez is a dancer she is way out of her league with the main players (Gere & Sarandon) and the supporting players (Tucci & Gilette). She is unable to convince an audience of her character. One never forgets it's her playing a part. The background for her character as the daughter of a dry cleaner inspired to do ballroom because she liked the costumes is a bit of a stretch. Anything could have been more believable than that. The Bobbie character was a bit too contrived. Her fixation about her ""Butt"" was over the top and unnecessary. Maybe this was an in joke about JLo's butt. I don't know.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the ballroom dancing. It is clear that Richard Gere and the other two students put more time in than JLo. Stanley Tucci certainly pulled off the comedic element of the character. However he was no ""Mr. Aoki"" as from the Japanse version. All in all this is nothing more than a ""B"" movie version of an ""A"" movie foreign film."
"dgcasey","9","1","3","30 November 2005"," Stop comparing apples and oranges.
","I don't know how many times I've read reviews of this movie that slammed it because ""the Japanese version is better."" No, it isn't. The Japanese version ""different"" and different is good. Okay, the Japanese version deals with the social stigmatism of showing off in public and ballroom dancing is one target of their uptightness. That's a great angle to tell a story from.<br/><br/>In the U.S., obviously, we don't have that kind of social convention. We have a totally different outlook on such things, but they can run quite parallel to the Japanese way of life. In the American version, John Clark has pretty much everything he could ask for. A beautiful wife, two great kids, a nice home and much more. And he is bored out of his skull and has no idea why. When he finds that he loves ballroom dancing and then is found out by his wife, he doesn't have to deal with the social implications of public displays as in the Japanese version, but the embarrassment and heartache of having to admit that his ""perfect life"" was missing something.<br/><br/>Though our society doesn't condemn you for wanting to dance, or more specifically, ballroom dance, you will find out how many morons there are around you that will assume that if you are a guy and you love to dance, you must be gay. Link Peterson was absolutely correct in keeping his passion secret for as long as he did and he was dead right on about the reaction that would occur if the people in the office found out about it.<br/><br/>So I give this film ten stars just because, as a dance movie, it has great dancing. As a romance, it shows what can happen when secrets are kept and how much better off our relationships would be if we didn't try so hard to hide them. Get this movie and enjoy a good story and quit worrying so much about how Japanese society is ""this"" and Japanese society is ""that."""
"novella221","2","1","3","27 July 2005"," No thankyou!
","This film is very weak. It has a boring and predictable storyline. Basically a middle aged guy, John Clarke (Gere) travels on a train to and from work and every evening as it passes a dancing school he sees Paulina (Lopez) hopelessly gazing out of the dance hall window. John decides to join the dance class but his intentions are unclear. Firstly you think that John is joining to win over the heart of Paulina with his funky dance moves but then you see him happily married to wife Beverley (Sarandon). His relationship with Paulina is slightly confusing. After (many) dance lessons John and Paulina do a 'steamy' dance together where at any point you're waiting for John to land a smacker on Paulinas' lips. Unfortunately, this moment never does happen because I guess in the films' favour that would be predictable. No, John stays faithful to Beverley but you still feel sorry for Beverley because husband John is out having all this fun and he doesn't tell her a thing! In fact he neglects the poor woman. The film does come to one big happy ending which is always nice.<br/><br/>The film I feel is boring and not half as funny as critics made it out to be and trust me, I do have a sense of humour. To give some hope to any readers, it may appeal to people of an older generation, however, I think even Gere fans will be disappointed."

Some of the scenes are so predictable, one can easily guess what the actor will say next. And there are some very cheesy lines. I am a fan of Audrey Wells' work so I was disappointed that this movie did not live up to its cute premise and to her stellar reputation.<br/><br/>It's a movie that means well but tries too hard. The result? Scenes that feel fake and there really isn't anything anyone can do about the bad acting especially by J Lo. Schmaltzy is a good word that describes this movie and how it makes one feel.

"howard.schumann","9","1","3","21 March 2005"," A subtle commentary on cultural taboos
","In Masayuki Suo's Shall We Dance? a suppressed middle-aged accountant on his way home from work spots a beautiful woman gazing pensively out of the window of an upper level dance studio. Determined to get to know her, he gets off the train and enrolls in dancing lessons at the studio but, because of the taboos in Japanese culture against physical touching in public, does not tell his wife. Learning basic waltz, rumba, and mambo steps under the tutelage of the graceful teacher Mai (Tamiyo Kusakari), he gradually releases some of his repressed energy and begins to re-experience the joy of being alive. He practices his steps in the street, at the beach, and underneath his desk at work. Things become a bit complicated, however, when his wife notices a positive change in his attitude and hires a private detective to see if he is having an affair.<br/><br/>Koji Yakusyo strikes just the right note as the repressed accountant, conveying a man who has closed down but has a hidden reserve of vitality just underneath the surface. He is ably supported by fellow dance students: Mr. Aoki (Naoto Takenaka), a co-worker who wears a black wig and imitates a famous Latin dancer, and Toyoko (Eriko Watanabe), a brassy Bette Midler type who constantly changes partners and berates those who do not meet her standards. She admires Sugiyama, however, and is a big factor in changing his outlook when he wants to quit. Mai, the dance instructor, it turns out, is a world-class dancer who was cut off by her father after an accident in a competition in Blackpool, England and is now teaching part time at the studio but dreams of returning to competition.<br/><br/>In an emotional scene, she confronts Sugiyama as someone more interested in her affections than in the art of dancing. Later, however, she helps him overcome his fears and both gain the courage to follow their dreams. While Shall We Dance? is essentially a comedy, it is also a subtle commentary on cultural taboos and the restrictive nature of Japanese society. Though the film is subdued and without a big emotional payoff, Suo's strong direction allows us to identify with the characters and glimpse the possibilities in our own life that are open if we are willing to take a chance."

The sense of simplicity, tenderness well all the Japanese work was very right spoiled by the commercial Hollywood style when tries to make with charming actor what was absolutely well done by foreign (OK, unknown !!!) actors and producers of good pictures. I saw the original ""Shall we dance"" in HBO/Brasil unexpectedly - since after all I'm not very fond of Japanese pictures.

This American remake might then have maintained the grace, charm and delicacy of the Japanese original.<br/><br/>Alas, instead we have the ""heavy hand"" clobbering the audience over the head with the clumsiest lack of subtlety, the broadest stereotypes, a lackluster script and -- as a result -- a singular lack of true-to-life characters that we feel for and care about, a woeful absence of on-screen chemistry among the principals, let alone the bit players.<br/><br/>Stanley Tucci should sue his agent for landing him the part of Linc, the bald solicitor who expresses his ""true"" inner self by donning a wig worthy of Tiny Tim and gaudy satin tights like some flamboyant superhero.

His smouldering sensuality panders to gay male desire, yet frustrates any possibility of identification with the object of desire.<br/><br/>The only moment of truth, the ""one true thing"" in this film, is a speech by Susan Sarandon about the purpose of marriage. We all need ""a witness to our lives"", she says.<br/><br/>It's too bad that ""Shall We Dance?"" fails to witness the lives of gay men who are obliged to pass for straight, and straight men who are unfairly branded as gay.<br/><br/>This film should have been called ""Silly Dunce"".

","SHALL WE DANCE? (2004) *** Richard Gere, Jennifer Lopez, Susan Sarandon, Stanley Tucci, Anita Gillette, Lisa Ann Walter, Bobby Cannavale, Omar Benson Miller, Richard Jenkins, Nick Cannon, Mya. Pleasantly charming remake of the 1997 Japanese film of the same name with a never before better Gere (very carefree and letting down his guard), a decidedly cast-against-type, as a mild-mannered happily married family man and bored accountant in Chicago who one day impulsively gets off his commuter train to go to the beacon of a dance studio he passes each day featuring the lovely Lopez as a sad instructor who he attempts to get to know while rekindling his joy for life.<br/><br/>Well cast ensemble including Gillette as the owner of the studio, Cannavale and Miller as rookie dance students sharing Gere's time and Jenkins as a private eye Sarandon, Gere's beloved spouse, hires fearing the worst about the sudden change in her mate's demeanor. Tucci steals the show as a colleague of Gere's who gets in touch with his inner Ben Stiller, as a nerd with the heart of a Latin dancer and Walter gets in touch with her inner Bette Midler as a professional dancer who speaks her mind in all its brassy detail. A hoot and a holler with fine comic moments and some sweet stepping to the light fantastic. (Dir: Peter Chelsom)"
"norjieb","2","1","5","25 July 2006"," MUCH too predictable
","For every movie there is always some people saying that it's a really GREAT movie, and some saying the opposite. Even professional film critics does not always agree, but most of the times they do. No one can get away from being subjective, there is no such thing as being 100% objective. We all have experiences in life that effects how we see things, so much for being ""objective"". That goes for film critics too. But the difference between common people's point of view and the professional film critic's is huge... A film critic probably has an education when it comes to movies, has seen more movies and a lot more different kinds of movies than the common people. Having seen a lot of movies, different kinds of movies, from a lot of different countries makes it easier to compare, movies, acting, directing, stories and so on. To write about movies isn't any different from writing about any other form of artistic expressions, like music, books, art and so on. But to be honest about it, some film critics ARE snobbish, they could never dream about giving certain kind of movies a high ranking, no matter how good. I guess there are some good movies in any genre. The best way of avoiding seeing movies you will hate is to find some film critics that likes the same movies as you do, then use him/her as a guiding light... There's no guarantee that you ALWAYS will agree, but I'm sure that you most of the time will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>You disagree about film critics? Well, who would you trust the most, someone who has seen all kinds of movies from different countries, or someone who never seen anything except horror movies? Most ordinary people like of certain kind of movies more than others, can be comedies, horror movies, action movies, dramas, romantic movies or whatever. They will always think highly of their favorite kind of movies, because they almost always get what they want, seeing only a certain kind of movies. If they, by accident, end up seeing something else, they will probably get very disappointed.<br/><br/>Your experiences in life is important. Have you never had any deeper thoughts, never had any problems in your life, never ever questioned what life is all about, you would probably not like any of Bergmans movies, nor movies by the great french and Italian movie makers from the 60's. If you think life is without complications, like fairy tales, always with happy endings, you will probably only like movies that confirm that opinion about life.<br/><br/>Now, this movie ""Shall we dance""... Have not seen the Japanese original, so to compare is impossible for me. I really didn't plan to see this American version of ""Shall we dance"". The story doesn't sound too exiting, the actors doesn't turn me on. Susan Sarandon is OK though. Saw it on Star Movies, it was for free, but most of all, there was absolutely nothing else to see, I like movies and I am always willing to give ANY movie a chance.<br/><br/>Shall we dance is a very sweet story, TOO sweet. Hard to believe the story, an American ashamed of taking dancing lessons? Ashamed of liking to dance? WHY? Can't believe it. In the western culture dancing is normal. Until the end the movie is ""so and so"", if you like this kind of movie, I do NOT. Then in the end the movie gets really sentimental, BUT IT'S TOO MUCH, it gets silly, really stupid.<br/><br/>So don't waste time and money on this one, there are so many nice movies to see, this one is NOT one of them."

","This movie had only one good scene and that was when Richard Gere goes to see his wife with a rose;otherwise, there was nothing worthwhile. J-Lo didn't seem to have much screen time, mainly because her character basically does nothing. All she does is watch dance lessons and cheer on the dancers at the end. Richard Gere dances more in this than her. Her character should have just been deleted.<br/><br/>And I didn't get why Gere was ashamed to tell his wife about dancing lessons. It's not a big deal. That's why the movie isn't much good because the topic is boring. There just isn't much drama about dancing lessons.<br/><br/>Plus the little cutesy jokes fell flat. None of the characters were charming.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: A movie about a middle age married man signing up for dancing lessons is not my idea of entertainment. I don't recommend it."

God help me, not on this time! So I had to continue watching the film and suddenly I thought it was very funny even though the film is not supposed to be funny, more like a light comedy. Some scenes were so ridiculous that I saw myself laughing both of the scene and the characters and the story. It's; you know like the middle aged professional lawyer that has an extremely boring family and job, he doesn't care for his wife but suddenly he sees a beautiful dance instructor through the train window which motivates him to change all his way of life. He just didn't know that he was a dancing talent like Fred Astaire or Gene Kelly! And this fabulous woman makes him see it just by swinging a little in the floor, and pang! he can dance Argentinian tango, American fox trot, waltz from Vienna, you name it; it was a miracle I was astonished. But I must admit it was a little frustrating that there is no real conclusion, I mean, like, there was this dancing contest that everybody was so interested inÂ….. and we never see the ending of it so we will never know who won the contest! Oh; I know, they are surely filming a ""Shall We Dance II"" where we will know who won! So if you are bored go and look at it. Its surely worth the trouble to have your eyes open."

","Spoiler alert. I think this is really an exceptional, unusual ensemble movie. I've said I'm not a Richard Gere fan but I notice more often than not I really enjoy his work. He has a very modest way and sense of humor that I appreciate. In this one he is an attorney needing a little spark in his life (without knowing it), who notices JLo in the window of a dance studio and decides to dive in. Along the way he finds that his law partner (exquisitely, as always, played by Tucci) is a wig-wearing closet dancer himself. Walters is also great as Gere's eventual dance partner. If this was ordinary stuff Gere would end up with JLo and that would be that, as it is things don't go that way. My one complaint is the way they handle Gere's contest performance, which slightly flaws an otherwise intelligent movie. Otherwise, it's as fun and upbeat as they come."

","""Shall We Dance"" succeeds because it avoids predictability and goes in a direction you don't expect. <br/><br/>Richard Gere is John Clark, a lawyer who leads a safe life. His wife, Beverly, played by Susan Sarandon, calls most of the shots in their marriage, and the people in the office where he works pick on people who do not conform to the norm. <br/><br/>Each night as John Clark commutes home on the train, he notices a woman sitting in the window of a dance studio. One night when she isn't there, he gets off the train to investigate. He enters Miss Mitzi's dance studio, and almost despite himself, enrols for lessons.<br/><br/>Miss Mitzi's is a rather run-down establishment, and not as funky as the popular studio downtown. However, from the start John becomes involved in the lives of the other students and the teachers. <br/><br/>Everyone at the studio is pursuing a dream of one kind or another. This is true of Jennifer Lopez's character Paulina, the overly serious dance instructor. Although Gere's character was initially drawn to the dance academy because of her presence in the window, there is no romance between them. ""I prefer not to socialise with students, she tells him, I take dance very seriously and if I was your goal, you have wasted your time"". However, she isn't, he loves his wife and he has another agenda altogether. <br/><br/>John's wife, Beverly, suspects he is having an affair and hires a private detective.<br/><br/>The detective quickly discovers that John is not having an affair and forces Beverly to accept that he is trying to find some hidden aspect of himself. The movie does not dwell on this element for long; the real themes of the film are discovery and fulfilment. Eventually, John goes to the department store where Beverly works and takes her away in a scene that is reminiscent of the ending of an ""Officer and a Gentleman"".<br/><br/>Although the overly quirky Stanley Tucci as Link threatens to overbalance the story, his character becomes more rounded as the story unfolds, providing some uplifting moments when he conquers personal fears.<br/><br/>Music is an important element in the movie and although it features recognisable standards such as ""Moon River"", ""Sway"" and ""Book of Love"", they have been given a contemporary twist.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lopez's character, Paulina, lives only to dance, but has been rejected by her lover and dancing partner. She is attractive enough to catch the attention of men, but is aloof and lost in her own world. J.Lo fits the role perfectly with a low-key performance that also allows her to display her genuine dancing skills.<br/><br/>At first it is a little hard to accept Richard Gere playing a somewhat repressed man. Although he is a lawyer, he is not dominant at work or at home. However, this is probably his best performance since ""Pretty Woman"", but very different. <br/><br/>""Shall We Dance"" is an engaging movie, and the two powerhouse stars play against type, making their performances all that more effective."

","I found this movie to be well acted and with quite entertaining scenes that kept me interested for most of the movie. It was well acted by virtually all of the actors, without anyone being particularly outstanding. Where the movie fell down in my opinion, was that it was too melodramatic. I thought that there were too many scenes where the reaction or rather over-reaction of the characters was far to pronounced. I almost stopped watching it for this reason. I persevered with it however, and my final view of it as a movie is 6 out of 10. From my point of view, the director must take responsibility for that, because it could quite easily have been a far better movie. In some cases, humor could have been used in place of the melodrama to a far better affect."

","Remakes of successful foreign films seem to be a Hollywood passion. The simple reason is profit. So, that they turn out stuff that tends to be pale reflections of the originals is no surprise. Sadly, this too is a poor imitation of the original. However, the surprise is that it does have so much charm. Keeping the original screenwriter and having a talented cast surely helped.<br/><br/>Usually, I rail at the travesty done to originals and continue to do so, but I accept that many films which would receive scant exposure have a chance to reach the English only audiences through these remakes. Now, I tend to accept that the price of experiencing good film is having to sit through these remakes and then to seek out the originals.<br/><br/>If you like this film, you will adore the original. Some others such as ""Nakita"", ""The Vanishing"", ""The Magnificent Seven"", ""Last Man Standing"", and ""A Fistful of Dollars"" have overseas origins. If you make the effort to track down their progenitors, wonderful treats await you.<br/><br/>A cautionary note - It is always wiser to watch the remake first; then the original. That way you can avoid disappointment - the experience gets better each time. Also, when searching for the originals - the titles may be translated very loosely. IMDb is a great help in title searches and ""Comments"" will usually offer up the original title."

","Shall We Dance is the furthest thing from ""Romantic Comedy."" To explain it or put it in that genre seems silly and will therefore disappoint anyone who see this film. Shall We Dance is exactly what one would expect...a dance film. Dance films are their own genre beginning with the incredible Dirty Dancing and extending out with films such as Flashdance, Mad About Mambo, Footloose, Saturday Night Fever and so on and so on. Shall We Dance is the newest addition to the family and scores on that level.<br/><br/>Director Peter Chelsom does a great job focusing on what is important in this film which is two things...emotion and dance. The emotion comes from the focus on the main character played by Richard Gere. He is sad, he is in the midst of a mid life crisis and despite his initial attraction to Jennifer Lopez's character the attraction is really just something different, something new and exciting which he finds in dance. Gere is really the focus of the film and he does a fantastic job. He's always charismatic and an incredible screen presence, and a great dancer. He's very different from the typical dance Genre star. He's not young (Gere is 55 years old and looks incredible) but they don't try to make him seem younger. For the first time since I can remember they match him with the perfect wife in Susan Sarandon. Their romance in beautiful and time testing and not perfect but they fit each other and have amazing chemistry.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lopez is very subtly used in this film. Her character Paulina is a quiet, hidden, emotionally void dance instructor who was hurt in her past both professionally and romantically. Gere's fascination with her is more about the dance then about her. The woman is a beautiful dancer and fits her role nicely and although her and Gere don't share a lot of screen time, their chemistry is not stellar but then it's not meant to be. This is NOT a romance between them. This is about her bringing him to life. They do have one dance scene that is downright steamy and they look great together. The rest of the cast works so well together and they become such a great team that you can't help but feel like you're friends with all of them. Stanley Tucci is amazing as Link (he can also dance like nobodies business), Lisa Ann Walter is great as the annoying but emotional Bobbi, and Bobby Cannavale and Omar Benson Miller as Gere's friends and fellow students are also great additions. Everyone just seems to be having a good time, and they become such a great team together that they are fun to watch...like a family.<br/><br/>The film doesn't try to be overly serious and it hits the mark for a dance film. There is some real emotions there and I think everyone will enjoy it for what it is. Ignore harsh critics and check it out!! It's a beautiful story. 8/10"

","Shall We Dance is a fairly good adult film that might bore younger viewers.<br/><br/>The movie was definitely made with more mature audiences in mind, and moves at a relatively fair pace. Not a great movie by any means, it does manage to entertain throughout.<br/><br/>John Clark (Richard Gere) is a fairly successful estate lawyer who seems to be finding himself a little bored with his life. He has a good career, a loving wife (Susan Sarandon), 2 children, and a beautiful home, but something seems to be missing. On his way home from work each night on the subway, he passes Miss Mitzi's dance school. Intrigued by the beautiful women who he often sees standing in the window (Jennifer Lopez), he decides on impulse one day to give it a shot, and take a look inside.<br/><br/>From there on, he decides to enroll in ballroom dancing, which he comes to find as quite refreshing and therapeutic to his ""mundane"" life. The rest of the film has to do with Gere learning to appreciate dance, and not being embarrassed by it. He keeps this secret from his wife and kids, and develops a whole new set of relationships with his dancing teacher Miss Mitzi (Gillette), instructor Paulina (Lopez), and other fellow students.<br/><br/>This was a good supporting role for Lopez, and she shines here much more than in her other starring roles from previous years. As Paulina, she plays an ex competitive ballroom dancer turned instructor who has become a little jaded with life, with men, and with dance.<br/><br/>It all leads up to a amateur dance contest, with Gere and his other fellow classmates taking part. He's coached mainly by Miss Mitzi (Anita Gillette), with a little help from Lopez. There is a great dance sequence between Gere and Lopez that I found to be the highlight of the film. Both dance exceptionally in this movie, with Lopez doing some really fine work.<br/><br/>In the end, Gere learns to be open about his love of dance with his wife & kids, his co-workers and even with himself.<br/><br/>There are not too many adult films like ""Shall We Dance"" being released by the studios these days, so in that sense, the film is a little refreshing. At times far-fetched, ""Shall We Dance"" is still an enjoyable ""one time watcher"".<br/><br/>Recommended for more mature adults, I do not feel that this is really a movie to be enjoyed by everyone.

I have only one gripe with how it is available within IMDb ... namely, as a movie about music and dance -- and how it affects and identifies the characters and story -- it weaves a volume of songs and dance tunes into the emotions -- yet IMDb has failed to list the songs and dance tunes of the soundtrack that are integral to the story.<br/><br/>That scene where Jennifer Lopez dances a modern tango with Richard Gere ...... what IS that song/tango they danced to?

","This movie would have been pretty good had J.Lo not ruined it. Is it just me, or does she turn every character into a flat, whiny, beyotch-y, angsty cameo of herself? I thought Richard Gere was well cast for his role, as were Lisa Ann and Susan Sarandon, and several other characters, but here we have Paulina, the tragic heroine, played by J.Lo. She makes the character unlikeable. We are supposed to care about Paulina, and we want her to succeed. Gere's character does not seem to be impressed with her at all except that she's ""attractive"", although she never smiles or is all that friendly until the end of the movie. J.Lo as Paulina has no depth, no personality, and no reason why I should like her. But Lopez's whole crummy performance is overlookable because of the quote about being a witness to a person's life. I think that line is so true and is really what makes this whole movie pull together with a theme. Subtract one pouty annoying diva-turned-superstar and you get a winner."

","Shall we dance is one of the most romantic movies I have seen in recent times. The movie stars Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez.<br/><br/>The movie opens with a narration from John Clark (Richard Gere), a busy attorney in the ""Big Apple"". He is content with his life. He is happily married to Beverly Clark (Susan Sarandon), a fashion designer, for 19 years. The couple is blessed with two kids who are in their teens. John Clark is so content and happy with his life that on his birthday when his wife asks him to name something that he wants that ""comes in a box"" - He says that he is so happy that he cannot think of anything else! The uneventful and content life of this busy attorney takes a turn when by accident he chances upon seeing a beautiful woman with an expression less face (Jennifer Lopez who plays Paulina) from the window of a train and enrolls himself in a dance school hoping to meet her! There he meets two other people - an overweight colored man, who is looking to master a few moves to impress his girl friend before he actually proposes to her and a gay man. There John Clark finds that his teacher is Miss Mitzy and not Paulina! At first John is clumsy and so are his batch mates. When he tries to break into a conversation with Paulina - she cuts him off saying that he should be more serious about dancing and if he has enrolled there looking for a date, he has come to the wrong place. This icy comment makes John only more determined about learning how to dance and he along with other members enroll for a dance competition. Paulina and Miss Mitzy train them to dance. John starts spending more time on the dance floor. Beverly grows suspicious. She employs a private detective to know what John is up-to. What the detective finds out baffles her wildest imagination. Finally on the D-day John sets his foot on the dance floor for the competition and Beverly and his teenage daughter are there to watch him. On seeing them John loses his balance and he loses the competition. In the final moments Paulina gets her groove back and wants to leave for London to continue her career. She asks for one final audience with John - ""Shall we dance Mr. Clark?"". Whether he accepts her invite or not forms the rest of the story. At the end Beverly discovers ""something"" that her husband wants ""that comes in a box"". The flame in the relationship between Beverly and John rekindles. The movie is romantic and the way it unfolds on the screen is simply superb. There are certain cracker of a dialogs like ""Why do people marry? - Your life will not go unnoticed - Because I will notice. Your life will not be unwitnessed - I will be the witness to your life. We marry because we need a witness to our lives"" There is one more from John saying ""You gave me so much - that I felt guilty to tell you that I wanted to find happiness elsewhere - that I enrolled myself in a dancing class"" Richard Gere is perfect, Susan Sarandon looks great and Jennifer Lopez gives a controlled performance in this romantic comedy of the year!"

","I watched this movie 3 times in the theaters and bought the DVD. It's just one of those movies that makes you come away from it with a lighter step, a smile on your face and a song on your lips. The characters are believable as is the plot, and what do you know? - the principal couple stays married and their relationship improves - no affairs or splits. That's not something you see too often in movies these days. <br/><br/>I also thought the music choices were very good. The Pussycat Dolls ""Sway With Me"" was a great upbeat version of Dean Martin's original. The use of other movie music - ""Shall We Dance"" and ""Moon River"" and the modern Latin styles were a good mix of the old and new. The dance scenes were well choreographed and those actors sure put a great deal of work into carrying them out in a believable style.<br/><br/>Call me old fashioned but I do like a good romantic comedy and Richard Gere is a real sweetie! a real Sweetie."

","I really had my doubts when I decided to watch this. I had seen the original ""Shall We Dansu"", which made more sense in the context in Japanese culture, while presenting itself as a breath of fresh air to the stale climate of the films I have recently been seeing. After watching this version, I can say that the film was relatively straight-forward copy of the original, and the performances were pretty good. Richard Gere does a good job reprising the role of the straight-laced businessman who decides to dance, and the supporting cast (including the always reliable Stanley Tucci) hold the movie well. Jennifer Lopez, surprisingly, has a relatively small role in the film, and while she doesn't butcher the role, she doesn't hold the charm the original actress did. If you can't get ahold of the original, this version will suffice. I think I might have given it a higher rating were it not for a) I did see the original, which puts me at a natural bias, b) a few scenes were too far extended, and c) if they had a more charming actress other than J.Lo in the role of Paulina."

"vin_joy_chin","8","0","1","10 February 2005"," Marital issues on Shall we Dance
","What i've seen in Shall we Dance are marital issues. First, they work on different hours. Gere works on daytime and Sarandon works at nighttime; and they practically get used to it. I mean, they come and go without even kissing and i don't think that's a healthy sign for married couples who barely see each other. Second, Gere indulged into a new career without even telling his wife anything about it. So technically, they do not really have open communication with each other; which caused Susan to think her husband is into another relationship. Third, Susan didn't interrogate Gere on her thoughts about his 'extra-activities' but switched into detectives and snooped on her husband. But the good thing about her is that she respects her husband's 'private life' which i think is really amazing about her. I mean, do married couples need to have private lives of their own? Third, it's kind of really uncomfortable to see your husband dancing with a younger, sexier, and more beautiful woman; although Lopez's character is strong and very professional. But then the issues were resolved at then end and i think that's that. There were just questions hanging on my thoughts: what if Lopez swooned over Gere (because she did not) in the movie? Would Gere still revive his marital relationship with Sarandon?"

","Despite some of the negative reviews and the modest viewer rating, my view is that this is still a movie that is impossible to dislike. It's a warm, wonderful, funny, feel good fantasy, set in an almost ""never never land."" (Winnipeg never looked so good!) The casting in perfect. Susan Sarandon is ideal. So is Gere. All the others are made for their parts. Much of the film's charm is the soft pastel hue of the colour and the delicate, sometimes diaphanous lighting. It's also very sexy without being overly erotic. Jennifer Lopez has a great body but it is a dancer's body more than that of an ingenue. I thought Lisa Ann Walter was fabulous although she works too hard at being a Bette Midler clone. But that's okay. I like Bette Midler too. I'm surprised at the lukewarm reviews of the professional ""literati."" But I suppose these days a movie is regarded as hopelessly ineffective if it does not brim with groping, gunfights and in your face grossness. Surprisingly, in a script refreshingly free of profanity, the ""F-word"" makes one appearance. It was totally needless and its presence surprised me. This is a charming, creative movie. Sure, it's not hard to guess how it will end. But getting there is a delightful way of spending an evening!"

In ""Shall We Dance"", early on I thought John was trying to surprise his wife with learning how to dance since so many men have clumsy left feet while their wives are usually much better dancers. I liked all the actors in their parts. Tucci was hilarious. Sarandon was veteran, capable and qualified. John's daughter finally came around and admitted Dad was okay, when she saw him in that tux dancing in the competition near the end. Wow, Dad has grace now. Even in this day of hip-hop, Dad isn't so bad after all. John's fellow male dance students were very sweet, and I liked the part at the end where Vern finally has his wedding and dances with his bride, and the 3rd guy is even able to dance at a gay bar -- to boogie down with the best of them.

It was nice to see the unexpected ending - older woman keeping her husband AND learning to loosen up and have fun in the process.<br/><br/>And of course, there was Richard Gere (for me to sigh over) and Susan Sarandon and Lisa Walter (for my husband, who likes older AND plump and forthright women!) - who just seem to be getting sexier with age!"

","Not to be cynical, Richard Gere has been great in my humble opinion; for so many years he's survived one film after another; after all the critics he has a niche; he can show up anywhere and create an interest and $$$ in whatever he does. However, why didn't someone else take the lead in this one; can you see Nicholos Cage and maybe Jennifer Beals as the dance instructor? So Richard's character needed the dance lessons (and maybe some vavoom) at his age. So maybe Richard wished for the lead in ""Saturday Night Fever"" almost thirty years ago. He never had a chance against Travolta on the dance floor, admittedly, so one way to get some free dance lessons.<br/><br/>Did we all notice an element of ""Officer and a Gentleman"" as he goes to his wife at her fancy department store job? And the ""Animal House"" resemblance as one of three 'nerds' on the bench during 'pledge week' only at the dance hall; the list of comparisons and bits of humor are available. However, that's what makes the film disjointed with juxtaposition. The dance contest appeared to be a high school football game with all the clamoring and cheering; then the Cinderella story in reverse (poor little rich estate attorney) as he's distracted by his yelling daughter at the dance competition and crashes to the floor along with his hopes of finally doing something big for himself. <br/><br/>Then his wife played by Susan Sarrandan, who he must have really been attracted to at one time until the mid-life caused this streak of independence. He didn't have the wisdom or respect to tell her he was interested in dance; maybe she could come along too? But then we wouldn't have this particular movie; shows us what may happen as we just consider ourselves rather than include our partners.<br/><br/>Then the complication, expense, and conflict this secret caused in their lives with the PI. Although funny at times I'm thinking all this could've been avoided with intelligent people; so why are we watching this movie? Once a movie leads to predictability and frustration I've lost interest. Similar to 'ffolks' with Tom Selick and Don Amiche, the first half looks interesting while the second half drops like a rock with sadness and frustration.<br/><br/>This movie could've been better, sexier, especially with all these stars noted for that. Susan was great for that in 'Bull Durham' and even the 'Banger Sisters' while Richard has gotten through many movies on charm alone.<br/><br/>The only indication of spark between the two that I'm still curious about was the sticky note on the bathroom mirror; was that a love note or just a shopping list?<br/><br/>Seems like the ""Dance Hall Association of America"" (DHAA for short, a fictional name as far as I know about dance associations) would really like this movie; not too much on the negative aspect of dance halls we should be aware of by now (see many news items); the appearance of dance as a positive, family oriented activity like Saturday night bowling was a message in the background, an imaginary fancy of the DHAA perhaps. Maybe dance studios could've experience a renewed interest if only this movie had been better. Well, Richard got to learn to dance a little better with some added money in the bank, maybe for a ""mid-life"" Porsche (with all the maintenance expenses, ha)."

","Last night at the Bijou I wasn't bored, but I was disappointed. Richard Gere as in ""Chicago"" once again has good editing and schtick to sneak by as a dancer. Frank Sinatra in his narration of ""That's Entertainment"" said of Astaire, Kelly, Powell, Charise, ""you can hope and pray but you won't see the likes of them again"". Films like this prove it. Dance sequences are edited 80% with close up and waist up shots. The few full body shots (where you actually see feet dancing) are cleverly edited in no more than a couple of dance steps lasting a couple of seconds. I imagine they worked long and hard with many takes getting some decent head to toe footage. Jennifer Lopez, who I understand was trained as a dancer, is at best 2nd rate. Gere cannot be rated, he's not a dancer. You do get to see some great dancing, but its cuts of Astaire and Charise on TV in the background. A harsh reminder of how poor Gere and Lopez do it. Poor Susan Sarandon is terribly miscast as the suspicious wife, but she tries hard to make convincing the implausible spouses conflict sub plot which is near laughable.

She put it on way to thick, that it was beyond annoying. Richard Gere on the other hand I expected more from. It is like as if her bad acting rubbed off on him or something. Their scenes together were real eye rollers, mind you the script for those scenes was pretty bad too. I was very happy with Susan Sarandon however. She helped make the movie more bearable. But Stanley Tucci was by far the saviour here. He was fabulous. funny, and lovable. He is a very talented man. I hoped for a bit more action on the dance floor, but what you do get is pretty good. Except for the ball room dance between Lopez and the other instructor, where they are trying to give a foretaste of better things to come for Gere's character and the other dance students. Her lip hung lower then her skirt. So over-dramatic. Bottom line if you go in expecting the worst ever performance from Gere and Lopez, your expectations will be reached. And you will enjoy Susan S. and the supporting cast."

","Hey I totally loved Shall We Dance because Susan Sarandon and Richard Gere are freakin awesome!!!! Richard and Susan are the cutest couple I've ever seen. This movie is very romantic and sweet and I think everyone should see it. Richard Gere is soooo sexy in this movie,I've seen it 5 times already and still going to see it!! SHALL WE DANCE FREAKIN ROCKS!!!!!!! Richard Gere is a Chicago lawyer and Susan Sarandon is a major person at a clothes store. Susan suspects her husband of having an affair, and hires a detective to see whats up. Her husband starts taking dance lessons and is really good at it. The cutest scene is when they are dancing in the kitchen together after she finds out he isn't cheating on her! I REALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE A lot!!! GO SEE IT NOW LOL!"
"cd0727","Null","0","1","25 October 2004"," I got what I expected...with a Tucci surprise!
","The best thing about this movie? In a word, Tucci! Stanley Tucci was incredible and thoroughly entertaining and I wouldn't be a bit surprised if he won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor. The second-best part was Richard Gere's entrance on the ""up"" escalator in that tux with the red rose. WOW! I will never get tired of looking at him. Richard Gere will never win any awards for dancing, but he was very believable as a dance ""student"". All he really had to do was be Richard Gere...and that's what he did. The scene with Bobbie's yellow dress should have been completely cut out. It added NOTHING to the movie. JLo's scenes were boring. On a scale of 1 (yuk) - 10 (great), I give it a 7."
"TXastorian","5","0","1","25 October 2004"," Cute, Enjoyable, but Badly Cast and Too Predictable
","As chick flicks go, ""Shall We Dance"" was less painful than most. It had a likable supporting cast and it gave me a few laughs, so I didn't mind enduring this film for my wife's sake. But it COULD have been a lot better, and the problem starts with Richard Gere. No, I'm not saying Gere gives a bad performance- he's perfectly okay. The problem is, the male in this film's lead role should be an ordinary Joe with an ordinary white-collar job, and a humdrum life. Why else would he find ballroom dancing an appealing escape from his otherwise dull life? But even though Gere gives a decent performance, we just can't forget for a second that he's NOT an ordinary Joe! He's Richard Freaking Gere, a handsome, rich, suave movie star who looks great in a tux! That makes it hard to buy the central premise, that his character needs an escape from reality.<br/><br/>I don't wish to insult Mr. Gere for being good-looking! But in this case, I think the part called for an actor who wasn't so glamorous. Of course, while that might have made for a better movie, the theaters wouldn't be as packed with women as they were last Saturday!"

","This movie was wonderful. Please, if you are reading This and have Not seen it-go! Right now. A wonderful and exhilarating movie, strongly underrated.<br/><br/>This movie is about finding yourself through the power of dance. It is beautifully filmed, sweetly sentimental without at all being maudlin and the dance scenes are equisite. Now if one is not a fan of movies that center on dancing they may not like this but I think all should give it a chance as it will probably charm you. There is One dance sequence between Gear and Lopez that will take your breath away.<br/><br/>The movie is an ode to the power of dancing and you do not have to be a fan of ballroom dancing to easily love this movie. I had a more enjoyable time watching this on the big screen then almost any film I've yet seen in 2004. Even JLO who I've never been particularly impressed by, was great here as the fragile dance instructor. Gear and Sarandon deliver as always but it is the quirky supporting cast I recommend you watch for. This movie is not by the numbers-you will not always be able to guess what is gonna happen. It is funny, touching, completely different from other films out there now, contains great dance sequences and virtually all it's characters are humanized in a way that will be relateable to almost everyone. I give this an 8.5 as a whole but a 10 of 10 for pure enjoyment purposes. Watching this is absolutely exhilarating and movies like this should be made more often."

","This movie was exactly the kind of feel good movie that was needed for this season. It was lots of fun and had laughs intermixed with tears.<br/><br/>I love a movie that showcases it's supporting characters and really gives them a story that everyone can relate to, and this movie did just that. <br/><br/>I found myself falling in love and rooting for Vern, Chic, and Link as much as I was for Richard Gere.<br/><br/>I also love how he didn't have an affair and really just wanted to be happy despite his happiness.<br/><br/>Great movie which I would recommend for anyone!"
"ManticoreL7","10","0","1","19 October 2004"," Charming and harmless fun
","I'll be honest. I saw the original Japanese version of Shall We Dance a few months ago and loved it, so I didn't think the American version would live up to its standards as remakes tend to lose the charm of the original. This movie has shown me that it's possible. Richard Gere and Jennifer Lopez are wonderfully cast in their roles, but the two who are worth mentioning most are supporting players Stanley Tucci (Link) and Lisa Ann Walter (Bobbie.) As far as behavior is concerned, Ms. Walter is a spitting image of her Japanese counterpart and grasps the perfect note for her character, she must've seen the original film and if not, that makes it even more amazing. I recommend seeing both the Japanese and American versions of Shall We Dance, as both are equally enchanting and what we need now is more harmless, charming movies like this.."
"sstiles","6","0","1","18 October 2004"," What other demographic can we pander to?
","The film-makers have tossed a bone to about every audience sliver they can think of, they just left out any real sense of the existential angst Richard Gere's character is supposed to be going through. This movie has the same soft-sell moralistic sense of ""Pretty Woman"". Forget the fact that Gere's John would be having wild monkey love with the pretty dance instructor if it were up to him. But thank goodness she's ""on the shelf"". The whole redemption through dance, and it's apparent social stigma never plays true. It's not REALLY the super hot dance instructor he wants, it's DANCE!! It might have worked for a Bill Macy, but Richard's a little stretched on making this one believable. The height of this silliness culminates in the parking garage scene where Gere is outed, but which made absolutely no sense to me."
"jon_shimamoto","8","0","1","18 October 2004"," The original was better... still an okay chick flick...
","Most of you already know that this movie is based on Masayuki Suo's 1996 Japanese ""Shall We Dansu?"". Most of the lines from the original film was used in this remake but somehow does not come across as well. The characters in the Japanese version were better developed and a lot funnier.<br/><br/>Richard Gere was adequate but J.Lo's performance seemed distant. Stanley Tucci's character was okay and the rest of the cast was adequate.<br/><br/>Still, it appeared most of the audience in my viewing enjoyed the movie but I think if they were to watch the original it would have been a lot funnier to them. Amazingly, the Japanese version is still NOT available on DVD, only VHS, especially since it won numerous awards in the Japanese ""Oscars"" that year. A bit of trivia, the film apparently was not eligible for any Oscar nominations for foreign film in the U.S. since it was aired on television in Japan before the Oscars. Oscars disqualify any film once it is shown on television."
"Stark-MySideYourSide","Null","0","2","16 October 2004"," No...let's not. You might think I like you or something.
","Eeeeeuuuugh.<br/><br/>OK, let's not pander here. Bearing in mind that the original film carried with it a social significance that this version lacks, a strong effort from performers such as Richard Gere and Stanley Tucci is weighed down by the two-tone performance that Jennifer Lopez phones in. Lopez should be blocked from any further attempts to make films. This is a cold, cruel fact, and yet it seems to elude most people in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Looking at the other performances in the film, Richard Gere seems to have finally rediscovered his niche in Hollywood. Following his work in ""Chicago"", giving a graceful man a chance to show that he can not only dance, but dance incredibly well, bodes well and seems to hearken back to the golden days of cinema. Danny Kaye, Gene Kelly, and Fred Astaire are poorly represented these days when ""You Got Served"" is the closest approximation we have to the Fosse legacy. <br/><br/>Susan Sarandon...well, she has her fans, she has her talents, but I will never understand the idea of her being ""sexy"", looking to me more like the aliens in ""They Live"". Casting her as Gere's wife seems confusing given her own dominating screen presence; she seems through a chunk of the film to be closer to handing him his butt than wondering why he's suddenly shaking it. A talented woman miscast. <br/><br/>Stanley Tucci...brilliant. If this doesn't give him at least consideration for a Golden Globe or Oscar for Best Supporting Actor, then he will be the most robbed man since Prince John. <br/><br/>And then there's J-Lo. To paraphrase Bill Corbett, she wanders around either looking like she's got gas or has been slapped with a dead fish. The effects to make her skin seem lustrous instead make her look like she's about to re-enact a female-led production of ""Halloween"". Michael Myers-ballroom style!<br/><br/>There is almost no chemistry between Lopez and Gere. He is outgoing, reaching his co-stars with a vibrancy reminiscent of his heyday in ""Pretty Woman"". Lopez, however, turns even being aloof into an exercise in tedium, doubtless wondering whether or not she can add a slash to her name (""...singer/dancer/actress/pro bowler...?"")<br/><br/>Would I recommend this film? The original version, certainly. If this version were on TV, sure. Watch for Gere and Tucci primarily. Better still to get the video out so you can, like most people, fast forward on to the better parts and get pics of her elsewhere."
"keckeroo","10","0","1","6 October 2004"," Bring your significant other - what a great couple movie.
","Richard Geer is an estate lawyer - plodding through life like the rest of us - seemingly having everything - but has an emptiness in his life.<br/><br/>Wishing to become 'more happy' he seeks diversion by taking ballroom dancing lessons. This film is a very touching look at how our lives can be so caught up in the drudgery of day-to-day routines that we can overlook how simple changes can make a difference.<br/><br/>When his wife finds out about his extra-curricular activities she's quite upset. This is where we find that pride and shame, the reason for hiding what he was doing, can be such an obstacle in any relationship.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent movie, in which the ending scene brought a lump to my throat and a tear to my eye. Romance can be found in any relationship - no matter what the duration. You just have to take the time to stop and smell the rose."
"Kellchecker","10","0","1","25 September 2004"," I HIGHLY recommend this movie!
","I just got back from viewing a special sneak preview of this film held at one of our local theaters. Let me say that I thoroughly enjoyed it from the beginning all the way to the end.<br/><br/>It is a wonderful combination of comedy, romance and heartwarming events that center around a middle-aged man's discovery of dancing and how it awakens him from his state of mediocrity.<br/><br/>Realizing that his life is rather boring, doing the same things every day, John Clark wanders into a dancing school one night and signs up for lessons, much to his own shock and chagrin. As he begins taking classes, he realizes that he loves it. <br/><br/>Feeling self conscious and embarrassed about it, he hides it from everyone he knows - including his wife and daughter. The dancing gave him something new, something enjoyable that he had no idea he had in him.<br/><br/>Through the course of his lessons, he develops lasting friendships with his classmates and instructors, while at the same time reawakening his romance with his wife. <br/><br/>This movie is the best movie I've seen in a very long time. I highly recommend it as a heartwarming story with stunning performances by Richard Gere, Susan Sarandon and Jennifer Lopez. Two thumbs up, for sure."
"diogo_filipe","10","0","1","4 October 2004"," A surprisingly good movie...
","I have just finished watching ""Shall We Dance"", the remake of the Japanese movie with the same name. <br/><br/>I was expecting an entertaining movie and it was exactly what I got. ""Shall We Dance"" is definitely a lift of fresh air. I was delightedly surprised.<br/><br/>Richard Gere is an overworked lawyer who discovers that dance lessons is what he needed to fulfill his life with happiness and joy.<br/><br/>I know that the plot might sound pretty lame and it does. On paper it does sound pretty cliché and pretty lame. Why would anyone want to watch this? The question - the actors. <br/><br/>The cast is what raises the bar in this movie. It isn't just a sweet comedy with bland, underdeveloped and uneven performances like all the other sweet comedies. The actors in their roles completely shine.<br/><br/>Richard Gere brought for the first time in years the charm and charisma that he once had. He is perfect as the main lead and I really think he will have a shot in making my Best Actor ballot at the end of the year. I really expect him to be nominated at the Golden Globes for Best Actor Comedy/ Musical. It's just the type of performance that they love to recognize.<br/><br/>Susan Sarandon can do no wrong. And once again she showed that she is really one of the best actresses working today. She doesn't have big scenes or strong moments. But she is absolutely great during the whole movie. I really loved her.<br/><br/>And now Jennifer Lopez. As many of you know I don't hate her like everybody does but I also don't like her. I found her a talented actress (she already proved that in Out of Sight) with some terrible bad choices in movies and of course in personal life. At the beginning her character seemed kind of bland and uninteresting as did she. However as the movie keeps going Jennifer Lopez turns out to give an extremely and surprisingly sweet performance. And wow she really can dance. I think that people will be warm to her again after seeing this movie. <br/><br/>All the supporting cast is hilarious. I loved Stanley Tucci in this and I don't think he was overexposed. One of his best performances to date. And I absolutely loved Lisa Ann Walter - the funniest performance (Quit looking to my ass!!! ). <br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me in this movie is the strong chemistry that Richard Gere has with both leading ladies - Lopez and Sarandon. It's really unbelievable. <br/><br/>All the dance scenes are great, especially one in the middle between Gere and Lopez. <br/><br/>One of the few things that I really didn't like was the Score. It was a bit annoying.<br/><br/>I really think this movie will do great in the box-office. Of course it won't be a critical success but it is definitely a crowd pleaser and it will have a good word of mouth. <br/><br/>""Shall We Dance"" is one of those movies that can't do no harm. It's extremely inoffensive and also sweet and cute. Of course it isn't a masterpiece. Far from it. But trust me you will have a good time watching this.<br/><br/>A surprise.<br/><br/>Rating: *** 1/2"
"snowfox121","10","0","1","2 October 2004"," An enjoyable show
","I saw this at a sneak preview. The theatre was full, 75% of the audience appeared to be 50+ years of age. This was a solid, enjoyable show. Lots of laughs and many whimsical moments. Gere and Lopez did not appear to have much chemistry, but this did not detract from the movie, as the chemistry between Gere and Sarandon, as well as other actors, was excellent. No crude language. No foul humor. A meaningful storyline. Not a movie for anyone who ever says, ""But life isn't like that--it wasn't 'realistic' enough."" The only part of the movie I felt was a bit forced was near the end where Lopez was dancing alone in the studio, but my wife says this is ""normal"" for a dance movie. (Excuuuse me!)"
"jessie-39","10","0","1","2 October 2004"," The Perfect Movie!
","Wow! We saw the sneak preview and it was simply spectacular. Richard Gere is simply wonderful as a dancer in this terrific role. He shines throughout the movie as does the one and only J Lo. SHe is gorgeous, sexy a fantastic body and wonderful dancer. And not a single kiss in the entire movie with Gere. The other members of this cast will have you rolling in the aisles. Stanley TUcci shows more of his versatility and is equally wonderful as is Gere in the movie as a closet dancing lawyer. Bobby Cannavale who is beginning to show up everywhere on the small screen in roles as tough guys is a fabulous dancer and comedian in this movie. The very huge Omar Benson Miller who you have seen time and again in a stereotypical ""Black man"" role is wonderful and a dancer, comic and just wonderful in this quite a jump from his usual roles where is has been a fine fine serious actor. We loved it and recommend it highly. We hope that it catches the attention of the Academy as it is so refreshing and different that it deserves nominations for any and all of the folks in the movie and I am sure it will garner many golden globe awards because it is a ""musical"" love story of sorts... the love of dancing."

","I haven't seen the original to compare, but this was such a great movie. I haven't heard much about it, except that the local theater was having a sneak preview, which doesn't happen often. First, if you've ever had any bad blood for Gere, Lopez or Sarandon, this movie can definitely help to repair that. The entire cast (including bit parts) were all incredible actors. Every character had such a warm, funny vibe, there's no way anyone can leave the theater without a smile on their face. Gere turns out to be a good dancer, Lopez reminds everyone that she's an incredible, focused dancer and the quality of acting by all, is much better than most recent rom. comedies. The theater was packed (another surprise). We all laughed, smiled and cried and the movie received a standing ovation. I'm not writing this message because of being a fan of the actors, but because I came in the theater with low expectations and left smiling..Everyone left smiling"
"jhs39","6","0","1","26 September 2004"," Entertaining but stumbles badly during final reels (spoilers)
","This remake of a 1996 Japanese film works surprisingly well for much of its length, a fast-paced and funny piece of work about a middle-aged man (Richard Gere) bored with his life who decides to take dancing lessons after seeing a pretty teacher (Jennifer Lopez) staring out the window of the studio while taking the L home.<br/><br/>The film is shameless but effective in wringing laughs from the uptight businessman slowly discovering the joys of dancing and loosening up, keeping the lessons from his family who notice that he is happier lately and that he seems to come home late every Wednesday night with a different excuse. The man's wife (Susan Sarandon) becomes convinced that her husband is having an affair.<br/><br/>The movie chugs along effortlessly for its first hour, hugely entertaining. Then during a dance competition after one character stumbles badly so unfortunately does the movie. The pacing becomes jerky and trips under unnecessary and pointless narrative complications. Unfortunately pretty much every decision the filmmakers made during the final reels is completely wrong, none more so than the ending. After showing us for an hour how dancing brought pleasure back into the businessman's life there probably isn't a person in the theater who would actually want him to give up dancing at the end, but that is essentially what happens. The film creates a false choice between dancing and marriage that is never justified or believable (even his family doesn't want him to quit). <br/><br/>Maybe the filmmakers shot multiple endings and this was the one that test-marketed the best but it really doesn't work. It's a shame. For most of it's length Shall We Dance is graceful, funny and effortlessly charming, but the last half hour is a terrible mess. Still, the preview audience I saw this crowd-pleaser with seemed pleased enough, cheering during the end credits and smiling and chatting on their way out of the theater, so maybe the flaws aren't serious enough to keep this movie from becoming a modest hit."
