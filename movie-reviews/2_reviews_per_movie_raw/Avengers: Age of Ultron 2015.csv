"charzhino","6","882","1383","25 April 2015"," Grossly underwhelming (spoiler free)
","Spoiler free review. Let me first start of by saying that I am not a Marvel ''fanboy'' or a DC nerd. The comic book genre of films have made it to my personal top 3 favourite genres in the last decade and the MCU has been a strong contributor to that rise. I hold the first Ironman, first Avengers and Captain America 1+2 in high regard. I did not like the direction they took with Iron Man 3 (more on this below) or Guardians of the Galaxy but Winter Soldier was a gem in terms of balancing solid action, drama and levity.<br/><br/>That being said, my initial thoughts on Age of Ultron (AoU) are quite negative. To me, its essentially a carbon copy of IM3. There are problems which strike you repeatedly as you progress throughout the film. The 2 biggest complaints I have with AoU is 1) the tone (comedy) 2) the script/writing.<br/><br/>So starting with the tone. I like to laugh as I'm sure most people do, but there is a time and place to exhibit your comedy writing skills in an action film. In AoU, its a constant, recurring and predictable theme. It's not limited to one character either, everyone is popping one liner jokes as if its the Expendables and yes, most are not funny. The timing of these moments of levity are horrible too, desensitising the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed in not worrying about possibly dying, then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience? This plagued IM3 in a bad way and its arguably worse here. The comic book films which achieved great success in this regard were XMen DOFP, The Avengers 1, Cap 2 even Dark Knight Rises! Can you imagine at the climax of Xmen DOFP if old Magneto and Storm and Bishop start pulling one liner jokes as the army of sentinels came charging at them? It would kill any tension! 2) The script. I won't say too much since this is a spoiler free review, but it really feels rushed and unorganised. I watched Fast 7 around 2 weeks before AoU and I got similar vibes. Again, its not the fact that the film is 2.5 hours long or has too many characters, that isn't am excuse since The Dark Knight and Xmen DOFP shows how to navigate these theatrical obstacles. There are a few completely unnecessary subplots in AoU and useless characters which do not impact the story overall. The villain himself, Ultron is another massive let-down in Marvels already growing catalogue of mishandled villains.<br/><br/>So as a summary, if you want mindless action and cool CGI, which this film does offer in the form of some spectacular visual fight scenes then you will like AoU. If you are after a darker, grounded and more moving story like the trailers promised, you will be severely disappointed. Final score 6/10 and I am being kind since Cap is my fav Avenger and they finally gave him some good screen time."
"ivo-cobra8","10","128","197","8 May 2016"," Avengers: Age of Ultron is a damn good Superhero flick, excellent sequel!
","Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a MARVEL damn good superhero flick and an excellent sequel! Yes it is miles way better than Jurassic World and Star Wars: The Force Awakens and Terminator Genisys I have enjoyed this film much better than Jurassic World, Star Wars and Terminator the new movies. <br/><br/>This film is fun, popcorn, Action and entertaining action sequel flick. I like the first one but I love this one much more. The first time I watch it, I did not like this film at all, it did not work for me, but the second time around this flick was awesome and it become one of my favorite MARVEL superhero movies. I love this film so much, more than the first Avengers. James Spader made the movie for me! So much better than Loki. <br/><br/>
James Spader and Robert Downey Jr. played together in a teen movie Tuff Turf in 1985 and 30 years later they teamed together to star in a MARVEL comic book super hero film. I like Tuff Turf but Avengers: Age of Ultron is far way better film to me. I love this film so much and I will never get the backlash. Joss Whedon gave me everything I wanted in a sequel. This and the first film are in my top 10 films of all time. <br/><br/>I waited a long time for this universe and I am loving every minute of it. Superhero movies come out all time but something like this is what I love about movies. <br/><br/>
Plot: Tony Stark creates the Ultron Program to protect the world, but when the peace-keeping program becomes hostile, The Avengers go into action to try and defeat a virtually impossible enemy's to get. Earth's mightiest heroes must come together once again to protect the world from global extinction. <br/><br/>I really enjoy this movie I don't get the backslash and a lot of people were disappointed with this sequel that it is not so good as the first film. Age of Ultron is in my top 3 favorite comic book films. Number 1 will always be Captain America: The Winter Soldier and number 2 will be Captain America: The First Avenger, I just love those two films: Captain America is my favorite superhero character in MARVEL comic books. <br/><br/>Captain America in this movie is the most decent hero in this movie, he did not want the leave the island with people stuck on it, he refused too, I have seen a hero in him. <br/><br/>People are keep getting upset over Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), ""oh look what they did with Black Widow."" I saw the film and I am seeing her kicking ass or calm down the Hulk, which is a pretty ballsy thing to do. Specially for someone who has no balls and she is kicking ass and driving motorcycle, driving around shooting for Cap, helping them to get vision android to beat Ultron and she is the only one with no powers, except Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), she has the to get the thing for them. I think it would be weird to kidnapped Thor, if you put Thor in the scene duh. I enjoy this movie much more than the first film, the first film I liked okay, I like the first Avengers film. This is a fun popcorn entertainment flick that I really love. <br/><br/>
I like the romance between Black Widow with Hulk it was really good fast paced entertainment. I love Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch I like the twist by the end of the film that she turn her side around when she found out that Ultron wants to destroy everything on this planet I love that. You have Aaron Taylor-Johnson in it from Kick-Ass film as Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver sadly he dies on the end of the film, but he saves Hawkeye and a kid from Ultron firing bunch of bullets on them I thought that was pretty decent in the film. In my opinion Aaron Taylor-Johnson did a good job playing his character. I love that they return Samuel L. Jackson to the movie back as Nick Fury and that he help them out fighting Ultron. James Spader did a terrific excellent job playing Ultron.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 2015 American superhero film based on the Marvel Comics superhero team the Avengers, produced by Marvel Studios and distributed by Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. It is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the eleventh film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). <br/><br/>You have a lot of action in it, I also love that Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton work together after Ultron failed to destroy them and they go in to safe house to Clinton's family, I like that. When Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) touches Black Widow, Iron Man and Thor I like that you see a background of Natasha Romanoff's childhood, I like that. I love the African shipyard you see them on a ship and I love the last stand. I love that the Vision helps Avengers to destroy and stop Ultron from extinction. Btw I love to death Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) she is so beautiful and charming I love her.
Overall: I am giving this flick 10 out of 10 for me Age of Ultron is my #3 favorite super hero movie. I can't wait for the next movie: Captain America: Civil War."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","19","25","8 May 2016"," Messier, for sure, but still plenty of ""Avengers"" fun
","The task of bringing together Earth's mightiest heroes took Joss Whedon into uncharted territory with 2012's ""The Avengers,"" and, despite the weight of the Marvel Cinematic Universe on his shoulders, the results were staggeringly entertaining. The task of making a sequel to that ground-breaking, monumental event film, however, and being expected to deliver on par or better results, is an entirely different beast.<br/><br/>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was definitely built on the bullet point takeaways of ""The Avengers,"" which are: Make time and space for wit, banter and humor for the sake of humor to prevent the film from taking itself too seriously; give each character a story arch and independent moments; choreography clever action sequences with well-timed glory shots. These components are in full force in ""Ultron"" and make enjoying the blockbuster as easy as shoving a lollipop in your mouth.<br/><br/>Yet ""Ultron"" is infinitely more complex than its predecessor. The number of heroes featured barely fits into a single action figure play case, meaning more subplots and back story, in addition to creating an arch of the creation and life of Ultron itself. With a plot that takes the Avengers from the eastern European country of ""Sokovia"" to New York to the African nation of ""Wakanda"" to Seoul, South Korea to Sokovia again, much of ""Age of Ultron"" is a non-stop blur.<br/><br/>The film opens with the Avengers leading an assault on a secret HYDRA facility where they have located the staff that Loki used to lead the Chitauri invasion in ""The Avengers."" When they secure it and bring it back to New York, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover that its power source contains a blueprint for artificial intelligence, which would allow Stark to proceed with his Ultron project, an initiative to create peace-keeping robots that could defend the world in place of the Avengers should another alien invasion occur. When Ultron (voiced by James Spader) becomes conscious, however, he interprets his peace-keeping instructions as an imperative to wipe out humankind.<br/><br/>Added to the mix are the Maximoff twins, Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) – also known as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch – who decide to serve Ultron, with the latter using her powers to give each of the Avengers dangerous visions that could tear them apart.<br/><br/>The fight scenes and action sequences are in such abundance in ""Ultron"" that it's impossible to remember them all, and the ones that are most distinct, such as Iron Man chasing down and taming a rampant Hulk using his Hulkbuster armor, are ancillary to the narrative of finding what Ultron is up to and stopping it. In other words – it's all for show. The creativity of the fight choreography also gets lost in the whirlwind of action. Captain America (Chris Evans) probably does 12 different awesome things with his shield, but they happen so fast you'll be hard pressed to recall any one of them in detail. Really clever sequences are only as fun as the build-up and payoff and those pieces are given no time to breathe.<br/><br/>Whedon does allow for pauses in the chaos, such as the swanky Avengers Tower party featuring the film's best scene, when each Avenger tries his hand at lifting Thor's hammer, or a quiet retreat to an unexpected safe house in the countryside, but it's simply a trade- off: instead of busy action sequences, we get character relationship dynamics and back story.<br/><br/>""Ultron"" is inundating, to be frank, but for the everything-but-the-sink mentality, it's carried by its sense of humor and a cast whose members have each proved themselves time and again to be magnetic both on their own and as part of this team. Some of the novelty has worn off, but seeing all these characters together remains a treat that even the most convoluted of stories cannot entirely dismantle. Marvel Studios truly proves with ""Ultron"" the credibility that it has built with fans, to the point that even when it gets a little ambitious and mettles a bit more (you can easily see Whedon at odds with them in this final cut), its reputation remains intact and the fans placated.<br/><br/>As ""Phase III"" begins, adding even more characters to Marvel's cinematic universe (and even sliding Spider-Man into the mix) en route to the two-part ""Avengers: Infinity War"" slated for 2018 and 2019, it will be interesting to see if Marvel Studios barrels along into more unwieldy but delicious chaos, or reins it in a touch. Either way, should be fun.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading! Visit Movie Muse Reviews for more"
"xamtaro","6","62","99","14 December 2015"," The son of Megatron and Skynet meets Tony Stark and his Amazing Friends
","In 2012, there came a day unlike any other day where the worlds greatest heroes were united against a common threat and THE AVENGERS blew away audiences of all ages with the first ever comic book movie crossover. In 2015, there came another day unlike any other day and this time the world is threatened by a Ultron, the cynical critical atypical child of Skynet and Megatron...... No actually he's just a wisecracking artificial intelligence with delusions of godhood and all round evil. Turning on his creators, he threatens all life on earth with his sidekicks ""illusion- woman"" and ""not-the-flash""....I mean, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, and it is up to the Avengers to take him out before he can usher in THE AGE OF ULTRON. <br/><br/>Instead of the robot dominated dystopian future that we saw in the comics, what we do get is more ""the next few days of Ultron"". No matter, it is an exciting few days with director Joss Whedon balancing the intercharacter dynamics with awesome action pieces from claustrophobic close combat, to a freeway chase, to the much advertised no holds barred beat down between the Hulk and iron man's new ""hulk buster"" Armour. All this is supplemented with beautiful special effects from Industrial Lights and Magic ILM. Flawless work befitting the movie's massive Budget.<br/><br/>In The villain, Ultron, the Writers have crafted a memorable though under utilised bad guy. Ultron could have been the vehicle to explore deeper themes, themes that were merely hinted at but never fleshed out. Instead, His cynical yet refined snarling courtesy of James Spader reminds me of the those magnificently passionate Super villains that were so common in Saturday morning cartoons of old.<br/><br/>And that is exactly what this is. AGE OF ULTRON can be described as a true live action cartoon. The dialogue is light hearted, the story is straightforward, the tone is fun and the action is immense. And this is not exactly a good thing. Intense scenes are interrupted and spoilt with poorly placed humour and once again the story does not seem to take itself seriously. <br/><br/>Fights are over-choreographed, more like some fancy ballet than an all out battle. The fact that it cuts to graceful slow motion once in a while only emphasises the dance like nature of the fights. <br/><br/>And yet the movie felt like pieces of it were cut out. The narrative does not flow as smoothly as the first with inexplicable scenes like Thor suddenly going off on his hallucination trip. Much of the premise and the characters development up to this point very much depends on the viewer watching prior marvel movies. <br/><br/>It is here that Marvel studio's continuity heavy Creative direction rears its ugly head. To know what is going on in this movie, one would have to watch the previous movies. Captain America the winter soldier, iron man 3, the first avengers movie. But perhaps that's the point? Force people to go buy the Blu rays or the video to rewatch and get up to speed. In the end, the real big winner is distributor Disney. Ka-Ching $$.<br/><br/>I like a good comedy. In in a big action blockbuster, I like to believe that the stakes are real, that the dangers faced by our heroes are real, that they are really fighting for the fate of the world. Instead, we get this cartoony violence, with equally cartoony superficial story, where heroes joke around with quick lighthearted quips in the middle of a fight scene where people could die. This kills tension. And if it weren't for the magnificent effects, action and direction, AGE OF ULTRON would have scored a bit lower."
"sam_smithreview","5","98","165","26 April 2016"," What a Shame, we live where Studio's take control
","being a huge Marvel fan, and also Josh Whedon fan I was super excited for him to come back and do another Avengers movie. The first film was pretty brilliant. But with this film, Whedon wasn't given much air to breathe, with constant Studio interference and orders of certain shots to be re- done, or scrapped if not worse. Put in.<br/><br/>So, you thinking why is this film so bad, if you are a fan, you should love it. Well the film changes pace, very quickly and abruptly, which is a poor sign of movie making. The Characters do not act like they would usually act in the same scenario, the progression of the story is all over the place, Scene's that just have no weight or meaning to the film, but in there because it looks cool or is setting up another independent super hero movie, the Villain that is so smart, but doesn't use the internet and his ability to control everything just to wipe out everybody, but rather has this ridiculously stupid plan. The Hero's that are suppose to be smart, intelligent and some what Spanish do not see all of the stupid plot hole that get infiltrated. <br/><br/>The fighting was also a problem for me, it was the same. Once you saw it in the first Avengers, you see exact same thing in the second one too, and it doesn't even change a little.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is bunched up due to the constant interference by Studio as Josh has stated so many times now."
"michaeljohnmetcalfe","9","398","723","1 May 2015"," One word: Mjollnir!
","I have noticed a trend of negative reviews directed at the humor in the movie. Listen...humor is subjective. It's also a big part of these types of movies. When I read someone criticize the movie because the heroes are dropping one-liners during intense fighting scenes and to them, this downplays the seriousness of the situation or shows a lack of concern for safety from our heroes, I shake my head so hard I get dizzy.<br/><br/>This is a comic book movie! It's a fantasy/fiction/whatever you want to call it! I'm not a comic book expert, but have been a big fan of the Marvel Universe on film since Iron Man 1. I found the writing in AoU to be sharp and witty. And yes, I laughed more than I thought I would. <br/><br/>""There's not enough character development!"" I've seen this in the negative reviews, too. Look, we've had 3 Iron Mans, 2 Captain Americas, 2 Thors, and a Hulk movie to develop the characters. At this point, there isn't much more we really need, is there? Yes, we see more about Hawkeye's personal side here, but to me, that only feels fair since he's not big enough to carry his own film. And given that he's very much just a human with a great set of physical skills and is less protected and faces his mortality far more than the others do, I felt like it made perfect sense here. We see and learn more about Black Widow in this one, as well. So the complaints about character development don't hold any weight to me. It sounds like the angst of a group of people expecting to see the Empire Strikes Back version of the Avengers. <br/><br/>In Age of Ultron, we get immediate, sustained action. I don't know about you, but if I'm going to watch a movie with a cast of characters that have the abilities of the Avengers, I want to see them in action! The creativity of the collaborative fighting was improved as well and was featured much more so than in the first one. That was something that I think the first film lacked, the side by side teamwork. This movie held my attention from start to finish. <br/><br/>As my summary says above, Mjollnir is a pleasantly surprising star of the movie. When you watch it, you'll see why and in my opinion, if you don't enjoy its role here, you really just have a bad attitude!"
"tieman64","Null","101","173","5 March 2016"," Behold, the world's largest conveyor belt
","""People stopped being people in 1913. That was the year Henry Ford put his cars on rollers and made his workers adopt the speed of the assembly line. At first, workers rebelled. They quit in droves. Now we plug right into repetitive motions of a hundred kinds."" - Jeffrey Eugenides <br/><br/>Produced by Marvel Studios (now a subsidiary of the Walt Disney Company), ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a gazillion dollar superhero movie. Most of the film consists of dull, unimaginative action sequences in which powerful ""good warriors"" battle powerful ""bad warriors"". These action sequences - which have no sense of style, tempo and which are totally devoid of tension - are rolled out like crude, Pavlovian commands; the chemical rushes cynically demanded by corporate candy factories.<br/><br/>Breaking up the monotony of these monotonous actions sequences are equally monotonous and equally mechanical scenes in which our heroes ""talk"", ""reveal their personalities"" and ""share their feelings"". These scenes exist, not because Marvel Studios has any interest in drama, characters or continuity, but because ""films are supposed to have these scenes"". In the Marvel universe, nothing really matters. The individual plots and over-arching plot lines of Marvel's films don't matter. Characters don't matter. These things are only present to present the illusion of storytelling. They are filler. The constituents of a factory assembly line whose sole goal is the procurement of money.<br/><br/>You can't have a Marvel Movie without a super-villain. This time around our villain's a Really Bad Guy who wants to do Really Bad Stuff and who ironically pokes fun at Conventional Movie Villain Dialgoue whilst actually totally adhering to clichés. This villain (spoiler?) is defeated. Along the way, the film ""comically"" delivers its obligatory ""one swear word"", but not before a room full of lawyers and marketing executives run up the data, salivate over pie-charts and double check with global ratings boards.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios has a history of roping in ""irreverent"" and ""edgy"" directors. Afterall, you can't sell cookie cuttered dough to zombies without pretending it's the work of a rebel. As such, ""Age of Ultron"" was directed by Joss Whedon, a geek-king with a flair for zany dialogue. But like Tarantinospeak, Woody Allenspeak, Mametspeak and Coenspeak, Joss Whedonspeak is now officially annoying. Indeed, everyone in Whedon's ""Ultron"" now sports the same voice. Every character, be they villain, hero, co-star, robot or computer, is an ironic, sarcastic, wisecracking master of zany one liners. This orgy of flippancy, non-sequiturs and ""cool dialogue"" reeks of desperation; cool stops being cool when everyone speaks cool.<br/><br/>Watching most Marvel Movies is a bit like being forced to watch a pornographic movie for a full two hours past the point of ejaculation. ""Ultron"" in particular bludgeons you with bludgeoning. It's filled with CGI muscle-men pounding and stomping, blowing up buildings and tossing cars back and forth, and then doing it again, and again and again and again, and then again in the sequels and then again on the directors' cuts, and then again in the reboots, and then again in the reboots' sequels and then again and again. And then a few more times. And then again and again.<br/><br/>Today, Marvel Studios now rolls like one of the world's largest conveyor belts; factory film-making as the epitome of the self-perpetuating capitalist machine, repackaging and marketing to every inch of the world. Art subservient to product cycles, product obsolescence and schizoid brains. And all the while, the Studio keeps expanding, pushing their movies in the summer, their TV shows in the fall/winter, and their streaming shows in the spring before the cycle is repeated all over again. With the new mantra of #ItsAllConnected - ironic, considering no Marvel show/series meaningfully connects to another - Marvel moves like the cinematic equivalent of malware. And now that Disney's acquired the ""Star Wars"" franchise, we can expect it to similarly start squeezing new ""Star Wars"" movies out of its mechanical orifices like diseased clockwork.<br/><br/>Incidentally, like most recent Marvel movies, ""Age of Ultron's"" chief villain is essentially a Western defence contract run amok. So we have another ""anti violence"", ""anti military"" Marvel film which gets its kicks from violence, mass murder and the flattering of whole cities. Lazily written and acted, the film finds actor Mark Ruffalo continuing to be excellent, soulful and layered. He plays the Hulk, a property damage loving green dude with magical pants.<br/><br/>3/10 – What was Ultron's age anyway? Was that dude even legal? Worth no viewings."
"drew_atreides","8","73","127","4 May 2015"," Solid, if slightly flawed, entry in the Marvel Universe
","...Phase 2 of the Marvel movies had been batting .500 for me. I did not enjoy Iron Man 3 or Thor: Dark World, but really dug Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier (Cap 2 is probably the best film in the entire Marvel series!)<br/><br/>Based on that, I don't think I am surprised that I came out of Age of Ultron with mixed feelings. Overall it is a solid entry, but it is by no means flawless. <br/><br/>The good:<br/><br/>Really liked the intro of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. I liked the horror-movie tropes tied to Scarlet Witch (she is a Witch afterall!) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver had a lot of personality.<br/><br/>The action, of course, was great. And Hawkeye actually had something to do in this film. <br/><br/>The Vision: They did such an incredible job building mystique around this character.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>Wasn't a fan of that extended scene at the Farm. That stopped the movie cold. I know some people say ""It was necessary for character development"", but the previous films had done such a poor job of giving Hawkeye any character that seeing him on the Farm did absolutely nothing for me.<br/><br/>The romance: Ugh. Talk about forced. I like Ruffalo's Banner. I really do. I was surprised how much i did in the first Avengers, cause i'm usually not a Ruffalo fan. But I just did not see any chemistry between Ruffalo and Scar-Jo. And where was the build-up to this? Last time we saw these 2 together Hulk was trying to smash Black Widow. <br/><br/>Marvel needs to work on their female-story lines.<br/><br/>Ultron was kind of a lame villain. I don't think there was enough build-up for him. He just sorta showed up and was evil.<br/><br/>Overall: Is it worth seeing in the theatre? Yes of course it is. But it is not without its flaws, and sure doesn't top Cap 2."
"pinkled5","5","814","1613","1 May 2015"," No one was more disappointed than me
","It hurts to rate this so poorly, but it certainly deserves the low marks. There were so many things that ruined this movie for me.<br/><br/>1) The Storytelling - Or lack thereof. There was not a compelling story to be told here. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story and it felt flat and unfulfilling.<br/><br/>2) Plot? - The movie opens with our heroes in the middle of a battle for reasons that are largely unimportant. That pretty much sums up this whole film<br/><br/>3) The Love Interest - Totally underdeveloped. We're basically told by the script writer that these two people are in love, but never are we SHOWN that they're falling in love. It rang completely hollow.<br/><br/>4) The Humor - There were WAY too many jokes in this movie, and that wouldn't have been all that bad if so many of them weren't eye rollers. Many of them left me groaning.<br/><br/>5) Ultron - This guy appears out of nowhere and is woefully underdeveloped. Plus, he's supposed to be some kind of AI but he's constantly cracking off stupid one-liners and making facial expressions that I thought were inconsistent with what and who he was supposed to be.<br/><br/>6) Character Overload - There were WAY too many characters to do any of them any justice. I would have liked the film to focus on a smaller group of characters and their relationships with one another, instead, we got a who's who of the entire Marvel universe leaving a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>I could go on, but my heart is still aching and I don't want to talk about it anymore. I see that a lot of people liked it and I'm happy that they did. I only wish it hadn't been such a colossal disappointment for me."

From out of nowhere, the characters involved suddenly had an interest for one another? Without any build up of it in past movies nor in this one, it just felt empty.<br/><br/>Camera angles that were purposefully shot for the intentional thrill of 3D is like any other angles used in any other 3D-movie-going-experience. I wonder when will this gimmick/trend go away.<br/><br/>All in all...it is still watchable. It just left a disdain taste of yet another repetition of the Marvel formula.

"BiiivAL","8","93","170","13 June 2018"," Quality of manual assembly (Simple opinion about ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"")
","At the moment, ""Simple opinion"" certainly will do without the husks and garbage. If that's all Weedon cleaned, then what am I? Number ninety-eight, ""The Avengers: The Age of the Altron""<br/><br/>It seems that in advertising, neither the cinematic Marvel, nor their apogee - ""Avengers"" certainly do not need. Especially, the second part of them. But, if you somehow managed to distract / not notice / or just sleep in the ice of the Antarctic for the last twenty years, then the easiest way to describe what you are going to is to go to the amusement park. At what this is the second, improved version of this, which came last time.<br/><br/>The only claim that can somehow put up the ""Era of the Altron"" - the presence of the previous film, which though not on purpose, but leveling part of the effect. Nevertheless, we have already seen something similar, and we approximately know what to expect. A group of diverse heroes forced to unite for the common goal, a charismatic villain at the head of a crowd of faceless clones ... It's not that we would not see it, or we did not want to look again ... And it looks like Joss Weedon knows all the pitfalls in itself a sequel. It is no longer necessary to tell the stories of the main characters (just like last time, actually), and we do not even need to disclose the reasons for their interactions, and therefore the movie tells the stories of the characters who were deprived of attention last time. Altron is a jerk, he sings songs, runs over himself and avengers, sincerely not understanding why they are needed, if he is - all such in vibnium. And the Scarlet witch and Mercury, having lost the status of mutants, contributed a huge share of diversity to the action and history, not to mention that there are not many sympatians in the frame.<br/><br/>The narrated story serves as a flip bridge to the further development of the cinematic universe, but it was done in a large and effective way, being a worthy continuation of the first part. Joss Weedon thus secured us with you, yourself and the co-owners of the need for the third part and the story of the same story for the third time. Wisely, considering that the history of cinema has repeatedly proved that the same approach in a trickle does not work in ninety-five percent of cases.
One way to hide the roughness and surpass the original is an action, and it was brought here with a surplus. Beginning exactly with what the original ended - the interaction of the Avengers as one, one-piece team, shown by one shot, the second part thus hints that there will be even more. And, believe me, ""The Age of Altron"" does not disappoint, and the viewer will receive a huge amount of beauty and effects, the performance of which is honed in all the previous parts of the universe. Well, we will not forget that this is Marvel - there will be plenty of humor, and even the hammer of the torah will become a real joker.<br/><br/>The second phase of the cinematographic universe is coming to an end, and the result of its evolution was presented to the audience. This is no longer a novelty, but no one promised, honestly on the heart. ""The era of the Altron"" - an ideal blockbuster, which is the result of the development of entertainment movies.<br/><br/>This is not a streaming production, it's not an attempt to keep up with someone, or to prove to someone something - it's a one-off product, quality and collected manually.

","I'll say this: If you don't mind more of the same you'll probably love this movie. If you wanted something different, some change to the Marvel formula, you'll be disappointed. Age of Ultron is pretty much the same movie as the first one. Especially the ending which feels like it follows the first movie beat by beat.<br/><br/>There are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Tony Stark retired in Iron Man 3 and now he's suddenly back? They don't even try to explain his return. Tony Stark also creates Ultron, the main bad guy of the movie who goes to cause some major mayhem. The movie just glosses over the fact that everything is Stark's fault. Aside Hawkeye there isn't any character development. These movies always just seem to be about ""setting something up"" for the future movies and I think I finally figured it. The only thing they're setting up is more characters running around, bigger CGI punching bigger CGI and bigger thing falling from the sky. In the middle of all this it's just so hard to care about anything. All those previous movies build to this?<br/><br/>Age of Ultron seems to just be in a hurry and jump over the story and get to the CGI punching CGI and oh boy there's plenty of that. The Avengers fight an army of generic, faceless and harmless CGI robots for 2 hours, roll credits. I just didn't care. There's no stakes in the action. When the characters are just joking around I'm not worried if they'll make it till the next movie.<br/><br/>Marvel should have gotten serious in Age of Ultron. You can be serious without being all ""dark and gritty"" too. Joss Whedon said he was influenced by Empire Strikes Back and Godfather Part 2. Joss Whedon promised we'd see some superhero blood. Joss Whedon failed."
"bandobutt","10","384","769","14 April 2015"," Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream come true. Great Sequel Indeed!
","Yes, the Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream come true. This is exactly the sequel to a great film that we have been dreaming about. It's superb on every single level. It honestly has no real flaws that I could see. How great does a movie have to be given the inherent difficulties in making a film like this in the first place? Writer/director Joss Whedon did an admirable job of balancing the screen time of the sprawling and expanding cast.<br/><br/>As for the new characters, I loved what they did with The Vision and how they did it. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be. What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch.<br/><br/>Marvel's done a great of making its superhero movies about the title characters more than the villains. In both team films now, the bad guy has stepped up and been phenomenal. Both films delivered true treats. This movie actually tops the first in scope and drama and that's in no small part to a superb villain. I feel that Ultron tops any bad guy since Darth Vader himself. His presence, manipulation and motivation leads to the best action sequences ever put to film. It also leads to an intriguing story and remarkable performances as this fine cast is allowed to flex their emotional muscles as well as their superhero muscles. <br/><br/>I can say without hesitation that movies just don't get better than this one sequel or otherwise."

"TonightTurnYourWeaponsToSnow","1","318","635","30 April 2015"," Remember the amazing teaser trailer? Expect the opposite.
","There's no one word that can some up this movie. I won't use 'eh' because that's a bit too vague, and I think it's a bit better than that. But things like 'good' or 'amazing' are too crazy to use. Welcome to my review.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron opens to a fine start -in fact, an amazing start- with a fresh, intense, action-packed sequence. The Avengers are introduced for the sequel, and so are two new characters: Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. These ended up being my favourite (Yes, I'm spelling it right. I'm not American, y'know) characters in this movie. Unfortunately, they get tossed a side a bit. Considering they're new characters, and considering one is in an upcoming movie and the other dies, they should have gotten more development. I adored Scarlet Witch and her powers, at least in the parts that she's ACTUALLY IN.<br/><br/>After the opening, everything goes downhill, at least SLIGHTLY. Ultron's introduction is quite terrible. Can anyone explain to me how this invisible force can suddenly SPEAK inside a whole load of technological material? I don't know... It just felt pretty dumb to me. If this was how it was in the comics, then I suppose I can't really complain much. But I guess I could say that it doesn't translate to screen very well. <br/><br/>After that, the movie becomes kind of dull. I kept twitching in my seat various different times. If I can say one thing, it's that the action sequences were fantastic, and they're the only things that hold this movie up. Ultron was nothing like he was in the teaser trailer that got me hyped, nor was the movie. I wanted a dark, gritty, intense, heart-breaking, half-horror movie! The advertising for this movie is false, almost to the point where I could sue. Remember Scarlet's gut-wrenching scream, or maybe Ultron saying ""There's no strings on me"" in the teaser trailer? Well guess what? Nowhere to be found. <br/><br/>But there's one last thing that makes me feel at least a bit satisfied with the movie, and that was the last act. When Ultron's plans were finally revealed, everything turned amazing. The CGI effects were absolutely incredible, and there are shots in the trailers that would reveal his plan if they were extended by a few seconds, so keep an eye out...<br/><br/>By the end of this review, I can finally figure out one word to sum this up. 'Overrated.'<br/><br/>You can mark this review as unhelpful, but I don't care. It's my opinion. This movie is definitely NOT a must see, but I guess it is for any fans of the comics.<br/><br/>Just be prepared for a completely different film to the film marketed in the trailers.. Thank you for reading, and I know that at least somebody will agree with me.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>So I was sippy sipping on my mug of tea and I almost spat it out all over my screen. This movie is rated 7.9. I have now changed my 6/10 rating to 1/10 simply to try and lower the rating to what it deserves. <br/><br/>Before you Marvel nerds attack me, I am doing this because this movie is average at most. You are crazy if you rate it higher than 6.<br/><br/>Goodbye."
"matt_hew","3","60","108","10 May 2016"," Same as the first movie (but with robots)
","It's quite an achievement to make a boring Superhero Movie so well done to all involved.<br/><br/>Remember the first average at best Avengers Movie? A baddie in control of the Tesseract uses it and an alien army to try and take over the planet. Whilst this is happening the Avengers are brought together where there are a few internal issues involving having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the alien threat.<br/><br/>Well.... <br/><br/>This movie is about a baddie who was in control of the Tesseract which then becomes the catalyst for a new robot baddie and it's robot army trying to destroy the planet. This again creates a few internal issues involving the Avengers having their minds controlled &/or beating each other up, before joining forces to beat the robot threat. <br/><br/>It's just the same movie repackaged (again) which tries to be intelligent but comes across as dull. <br/><br/>Some of the Avengers presence have little or no no point in being in the movie (Hawkeye just being there for example to offer the others a weekend retreat to go to).<br/><br/>But as with the first movie and the upcoming Captain America: Civil War it seems as long as the movie is crammed full of as many Superheroes as possible and they all kick off at some point during the movie, then this is enough to keep an audience happy.<br/><br/>Stick with the X-Men at least they make an effort!"
"prospectus_capricornium","9","144","279","22 April 2015"," Explosive and Visually Extravagant, Yet Also Profound
","Given how teeming with multiple awkwardly-diverse characters the AVENGERS franchise is, you can imagine how difficult and mentally-exhausting it is to gather all these uniquely vivid plot lines, with all their interspersing expositories and asides, and still be able to form one coherent and fluidly-constructed narrative. The first Avengers movie proved itself able to carry the weight of such challenge, and came out successful in delivering one the most poignant superheroic tales ever told. This year, AGE of ULTRON blasts into cinemas carrying the load of mammoth anticipation. While it is expected to perform better—if not as well as the previous release—it will not be totally surprising, and will still be forgivable, if it falls just a feet beneath the staggering anticipation. Well, you can thank Joss Whedon for helming this projec. This movie soars past expectations.<br/><br/>In AGE OF ULTRON, as the characters further expand, new names join the team, proving how much more difficult it must be for the screenwriters to still cling to their material's soundness, and make that further engaging and compelling. Nevertheless, Whedon and his prolific team of scriptwriters, come out triumphant over these apparent hurdles, managing again to weave all the heroes' divergent story lines and confine them together into one solid plot. Whedon effectively mines the capacities of these individuals and turns them into the very foundation of his epic superhero saga.<br/><br/>Robert Downey's Iron Man/Tony Stark remains as a formidable figurehead in spite of his ever cynical and highly confident posture, while Chris Evans provides a dependable alternative with Captain America's leadership. There's an implicit undertone playing beneath the trajectory of these two leaders' relationship, and that might serve as an indirect catalyst to what is set to unfold in Captain America: Civil War. Chris Hemsworth's guileless 'Thor' is ever militant, yet innocent. This movie also draws more of the previous installment's less-utilized characters, into the scopes of its spotlight. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, enjoys his expanded character whose interaction with other avengers, has immensely improved, and he also has some of the best jaw-dropping action sequences here. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk still smashes, he's as diffident as he is dangerous, and yet still charmingly funny. Scarlett Johanson's character, Black Widow, has been treated with bigger attention, and her presence is never less if not as strong as her male counterparts. To forget the newcomers, Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, is totally unfair too, as these two cemented their fiery presence right at the very first battle sequence of the movie. Same can be said with Paul Bettany's Vision, whose mysterious power might be the very weapon that could propel the Avengers to winning their battle against their biggest enemy: ULTRON. James Spader's voice strikes as the perfect embodiment of the indomitable android ULTRON who is hellbent to rendering the planet to extinction. Spader has the utmost command of the character and has fueled it with utter rage and bitterness, and calm and ease when needed. You're not going to forget Sam Jackson's Nick Fury too, and the rest of his team, including Falcon. He's as effectively leading his team here when he is needed to be as he was, the first time Avengers were called to assemble. It features Andy Serkis' entry to the franchise too, and while it's brief, he manages to established a commanding presence in the movie. The film grants everybody the right amount of exposure to shine, letting both their inner fragilities and physical prowess speak volumes for who they are. Their imperfections claim pivotal share in their greatest undertaking—winning their very own internal battles so they could emerge able to save the world from the wrecking weights of annihilation.<br/><br/>Straightaway at the beginning, Age of Ultron throws our heroes into roaring action, drawing us immediately into a surfeit of explosive and visually-omnipotent action extravaganzas that allow every smashing, pounding, flash of beams, flight, and basically everything, assume near-impossible forms of eye-squashing spectacles. It is when all these heroes engage together in combat against their enemies, that the movie subjugates all those hungry eyes, and grasps total domination over the audience's attention, letting the awestruck reception hum along the visual drama as it extends its reach beyond imagination. It is also when all the death-defying sequences and breathtakingly choreographed action set-pieces, spin out to full throttle, that the underlying cause why this band of superheroes fight with their lives, becomes blindingly evident—humanity. This is what had put them into this circle, in the first place, and it's what they are now aiming to preserve even when they have to wrestle with death. Whedon has never deprived these characters of humanity, making each of them similar, albeit their much readily-perceived differences. This summons affection for these characters, which right away the film gathers, whenever it puts the narrative's soul into the spotlight.<br/><br/>AVENGERS: Age of Ultron is without fault, but too few and little that they're not even worth-noting. To be able to gather all these radical personas and bring their different worlds into one concrete universe, is already a colossal feat. Whedon proves to be capable of pushing the limits of the movie's accomplishments past that milestone, and the result is never less than monumental. The whole experience imparts an overwhelming sense of satisfaction, yet it also makes the audience hunger for more. Well, the movie lays ground-works and unleashes potential backdoors for the franchise's next chapters, and that makes everything that follows something to look forward to.<br/><br/>AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON is visually enthralling as it is emotionally profound, a cinematic achievement soaring above the previously reached heights in the ever expanding universe of superhero movies. 9/10"

","The humor, angst and drama are remarkable for a superhero film. In fact, most will consider them remarkable for any type of movie. I can't think of a weak moment in the film, as it is strong from beginning to end. <br/><br/>Anyone doubting that this entire cast (new and old) couldn't work well together or that characters would be cheated out of screen time need not worry. EVERYONE gets to shine. Downey as well as Evans are Oscar caliber good in this movie. (Setting up what has to be an amazing next installment in ""Civil War"") All the performances are straight to the point perfect. Hulk is again perfect in his CG transformation and Spader's Ultron uses his wonderful voice and mannerisms to perfection. Each new character is exquisitely cast and the old school guard has never been better. That includes RDJ as Tony Stark. We all loved what we've seen before from him and this evolution of Stark is even more intriguing. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent years. People are going to want to see a LOT more of her Scarlet Witch in the future. Also, Jeremy Renner is finally given Hawkeye material worthy of his abilities and worthy of the character itself. He truly does steal more than one scene and has some of the best one-liners imaginable. <br/><br/>This easily fulfilled and the exceeded all of my expectations. I can't wait to see where they branch the Avengers team and concept from this point forward. There are so many great possibilities. This really is everything anyone would want in a movie.

"utopian-92350","10","119","234","23 April 2015"," Truly a MARVEL of a movie!
","****NO Spoilers**** I went to see the latest installment in the Marvel canon of films last night at one of the UK midnight screenings.<br/><br/>My expectations for this movie were sky-high, but not only were those expectations met - they were blown clean out of the water.<br/><br/>Is it as good as 'The Avengers', arguably the best comic book movie of all time? It is...and it is so much more. It may be lacking the magic of seeing these characters assemble for the first time, but it makes up for that with many goose bump moments throughout.<br/><br/>Does the movie have flaws? Of course it does - how could a movie with this scale and this ambition possibly not have any? These flaws, however, are so minor (a couple of plot contrivances, some shaky character accents) compared to what Joss Whedon was able to achieve that anyone who focuses on them extensively is just nitpicking for the sake of it.<br/><br/>This is as close to perfect as a summer blockbuster movie can possibly get. You get a bit of everything: character development, great individual character moments, a rich and interesting plot with a great villain and the usual rich dollops of Whedon humor (yes, the movie is 'darker' than the first, but it is almost as funny even so). How he manages to balance so many screen presences so magnificently is beyond me, it comes off as an almost completely effortless master class in rapid-fire plotting and dialog. As in the first Avengers movie, everyone gets their moment in the spotlight and the characters that may have come up a little short in the first installment, most notably Hawkeye and Black Widow, get to shine especially in this iteration.<br/><br/>The action sequences are breathtakingly, mind-bogglingly well choreographed and directed and there are numerous shots that seem to leap from a comic book page. There are several moments where - if you feel any connection to these characters and their rich comic book history at all - you will feel the urge to leap from your seat and pump your fist in the air. There is so much to care for, so much to cheer for, so much to marvel at it is quite literally too much to fully appreciate in one viewing. <br/><br/>...and this is where we get to what (some) of the critics are griping about: Yes, the movie is long (personally, I could have sat there watching this spectacle another hour). Yes, it is crammed with content (characters, plot lines, setups for future movies) in every single frame - but never to an extent that you are taken out of the narrative. This movie will stand up fantastically to repeated viewings because there is so much to enjoy, so much to soak up and there are so many great moments to savor.<br/><br/>Finally, the stand-out character of this movie is a new arrival: The Vision. Paul Bettany delivers a perfectly balanced performance in this role and when his character soars through the air, golden cape and all, it is a joy to behold. This is truly a comic book come to life...and I can't wait to see where the story takes us next.<br/><br/>Boy, do the Russo brothers have a mountain to climb for the upcoming 'Infinity War' saga - this will be a tough act to follow."
"slatteew-120-652838","1","123","243","4 May 2015"," One Big Joke
","This movie was a failure on many levels. There was a serious lack of story, the humor was very forced in an overabundance of one-liners, bad CGI in some places, and a very under-developed Villain. The movie focused a lot on the characters in the movie and developing them, but not even that much. We get a few tidbits about each, except Thor, Stark/Ironman, and Hulk/Banner. Thor was hardly in the movie, only shown on screen for a few minutes after leaving the team to basically setup the next movie and where the story is going (Infinity War), but is glossed over so quickly most people won't catch it, especially those who have no idea about story arcs in the comics. Ultron's reveal was absolutely perfect, it set him up as an intimidating and powerful villain, then when he gets his own mechanical body, he turns into a comedy act and does not look real because the CGI metal looks terrible, along with the stupid moving mouth when he speaks.<br/><br/>Every character in the movie was trying to be a comedian in the movie. The only moment that felt serious or dire was the reveal of Ultron (and then turned into a joke later). The ending of course has a big battle with all the Ultron bots, but seriously, why do they even have Thor in the close quarters fighting with them? His lightning could have fried most of them, then they have Thor not fight Ultron back just so Vision (Which they never called him by his name) could be seen holding Thor's hammer again and make a stupid remark about the balance of the hammer.<br/><br/>Stark/Ironman is basically having amnesia forgetting the events of Ironman 3. And then turns into a ""mad scientist"" with Banner to create Ultron, totally against his way of thinking after the events of Ironman 3. Ironman also does everything he knows the team will get mad at him for doing, but does it anyway without consulting them.<br/><br/>Black Widow is basically the Avengers ""Mattress"" in that she is now flirting with a 4th Avenger (1st was Ironman in Ironman 2, 2nd was Hawkeye in The Avengers, 3rd was Captain America in The Winter Soldier) and now the 4th is Bruce Banner/Hulk. She is a better character than that, but all she gets is flirting with everyone.<br/><br/>We are introduced to 2 other characters dubbed ""The Twins"" though they never give them names. Probably because of Fox owns the rights to X-Men, but their names are Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Quicksilver dies, and of course, says a one-liner, and yet we feel nothing for his death as we never knew him......he is a 1- dimensional character. At least in X-Men Day of Future Past we get to know Quicksilver in there, and his special effects were a hell of a lot better.<br/><br/>This film was a catastrophe, and should not be praised in anyway."

If you are a Marvel fan you need to see this movie. I will admit I was a bit upset when I found out Loki/ Tom Hiddleston would not be in this one but Ultorn delivered an amazing performance as well.

The writers and director are so much into showing off their destructive action sequences that they didn't pause to consider whether soneone would actually give an F. Superthin plot. The occasional quip grom Ultron or an Avenger gets old quick with nothing else to support it. We're clearly dealing with high school humor here.

"c_razz_y","10","105","210","18 April 2015"," Avengers assemble once again!!!
","Let's just get straight to point here, Avengers Age of Ultron is the best marvel movie to date. You can make a strong argument for it being the best superhero movie of all time. Yes it's really that good. <br/><br/>The plot line was very intriguing. It was far from the cliché superhero story. The script was funny and very witty. Joss Whedon did a wonderful job, it's a shame that he won't be directing the next 2 avengers films. The only upside is that he will be still there as a producer for phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. This story really sets up phase 3 and one of the most anticipated movies of 2016, Captain America: Civil War. My one regret in terms of the story is that it could be slightly longer, even though the entire film ran smoothly. I would have still liked to see more of the movie, I guess we will have to wait for the DVD release to see some extra scenes. <br/><br/>All the actors, unsurprisingly, played their roles superbly. Robert Downey jr again played the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist, which we all love. This performance just adds to the argument that he is Iron Man. Chris Evan always brings a sense of honesty and heart to the role of Captain America. Scarlet Johansson again showed us that a male isn't the only one who can be a badass that young boys look up to. Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Samuel L Jackson, Jeremy Renner, Cobie Smulders, Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie all reprised their roles wonderfully and each one of them added an extra dimension to their character. The newcomers Thomas Kretschmann, Andy Serkis, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson were all great additions to the already extremely talented and lively cast. The newcomer that really gave the strongest performance was clearly James Spader. His intimidating robotic voice really brought the character to life and added sense of realism, in an otherwise unbelievable character. He brought our future fears (from terminator) of an AI trying to wipe out humanity. Marvel are not known for their memorable super villains, in fact they're known for the opposite of this, but this villain is up there with Loki, Ultron is one of the more terrifying and surprisingly relatable/understandable villains in the MCU. However Paul Bettany's performance as the vision stole the show. He took the spotlight for every scene that he was in and I can't wait to see him again. The cast really gel well as a unit and you'll be thinking that these actors grew up with each other, after you've seen the movie. The chemistry between everyone holds the film together. <br/><br/>The action in the movie, let's just make this quick, was mind blowing. For anyone who's seen the trailers, you will already know that the action shown was amazing. For any of you that think that they've showed too much or every action piece, from the movie, in the trailers, you couldn't be more wrong. When you watch the movie you'll notice that the action scenes are orchestrated beautifully and that every character has upped their game since the last time we saw them on screen, especially Captain America. This is a big budget movie and this is clearly shown in the stunts and the action sequences. The movie was shot all over the world this time and that helps to show that these group of people don't just fight for one nation but the world. The locations were beautiful and i will always prefer a real natural set over a green screen. <br/><br/>This movie was a fantastic treat to watch and it's really a shame that this movie wasn't longer, so that we could all enjoy it for 20-30 minutes more. I had high expectations coming into the theatre and when I left, I was more than satisfied. This movie will be enjoyed by people of all ages, it's got cool action for the kids and the plot is more than interesting enough to hold the attention of the adults. This movie delivers on all levels and can be considered as one of the best, if not the best movie of all time. It's clearly the best movie in the past few years. P.S. Stay for after the movie ends (mid-credits) for a treat for phase 3. <br/><br/>I will be uploading a video review to this movie soon.

The Avengers must assemble once again to fight this menace that wants to kill all the humans on this planet. But Ultron is powerful and the way he is presented makes you wonder how our heroes can defeat him. Just you wait and see...<br/><br/>What I liked best about Age of Ultron was the fact that all our favorite heroes get equal screen time to show of what they can do. Although the action scenes are great (Iron Man in the Hulkbuster versus Hulk!) the thing that really makes this movie work is the interaction between all the people involved. Stark and Banner, Banner and Black Widow, Hawkeye and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America... like in real life you can see with whom each of them get along best. It's also nice to see that Hawkeye gets a lot of screen time. He even gets the most interesting background story of the bunch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch make a great addition to the team (sort of) and there are a lot more cameos in the movie (although I don't think anybody spotted Lou Ferrigno!).<br/><br/>The movie runs about two and a half hours and that's pretty long. It could have been a little bit shorter, but overall I didn't mind. With great action scenes (pay attention to the opening action sequence in which he introduces the Avengers in one mighty shot!), nice humor, a lot of cameos and a satisfying finale writer/director Joss Whedon has everything under control and that pays of.<br/><br/>This year (2015) The Avengers Age of Ultron will shatter all box office records and that will be a fitting reward for giving most Marvel fans and 'normal' moviegoers this big treat. Even Pixar slipped (with Cars 2 and Brave) so everybody's waiting for Marvel to produce a real stinker. Although that day may come, The Avengers part 2 is not the movie that will be responsible for that!<br/><br/>8,5 / 10"

","this movie was honestly a train wreck it started too slow, the ending was rushed so many lines delivered were unneeded and seemed forced in an attempt to seem witty when actually the result was making them look like a generic stereotype 'witty character' and character development?<br/><br/>OK they scratched the surface on a few characters but not enough to make me feel anything when something bad happens to them. i get there's a lot of characters in the avengers but when you kill a character its supposed to actually make me feel something, instead it just seemed like a terrible attempt at shock value. another thing on character development.... has Joss Whedon seen Captain America 2? or like. looked at a comic? maybe read the wiki? he ignored the development of Steve and Natasha completely, fitting them back into the stereotypes he'd created in the first movie that language line? Steve got in fights in back alleys probably every day. his best friend was Bucky Barnes. he was a part of the HOWLING COMMANDOS! you're telling me he tells people off when they swear? i think you'll fond they probably tell him off for being TOO foul with his language. also, the entirety of the previous film he was filled with angst over Bucky but what he gets mentioned offhandedly and thats it? not even a brief appearance in the fear-flashback? and Natasha. such a brilliant witty character in cap 2, got squashed down into the role of the belle to Bruce's beast. don't get me started on the choice of going with 616 back story for Hawkeye. i mean really guys? really? i could go on but even thinking of the film puts me in a bad mood. i mean i kind of had low expectations going into the film but Christ even they were too high."

","In the first AVENGERS, the villain was Thor's personal albatross, and now Tony Stark's invention is out to save the world by destroying it, or something like that And while it took over half the original movie for the eclectic group to warm up to each other, now we begin with so much bantering camaraderie it's like hanging out with the popular kids after prom <br/><br/>And there are about five jokes per minute, as if Robert Downey Jr's quick-witted sarcasm was infected onto everyone else – even Ultron, Tony's dominating Artificial Intelligence Robot, who's full of wry wisdom: His nefarious motivation to do very bad things but unlike Loki, with an entire THOR film to catapult his dastardly menace, the titular heavy's purpose is completely forced and thoroughly confusing. Making the few good action sequences like Hulk and Iron Man squaring off impressive eye candy that lacks any rhyme or reason.<br/><br/>With such an immense fan base, it's pretty dangerous to not like THE AVENGERS. They are perfectly cast, and proved themselves a beyond-worthy franchise. The problem with AGE OF ULTRON is that the plot's as dull as the lame newcomers including a mind-reading witch girl giving everyone trippy hallucinations; a blond-haired Russian boy who runs really fast; and a red-faced crusader as strong as Thor, deleting the big guy's main asset. And with so much excruciating downtime this time around, you would think the gang was saving up their energy but for what, exactly? With all the jesting, where's the danger? The urgency?"

","Avengers age of Ultron is by far the best Marvel movie to date. It has all the elements of the first movie, but steps it up in the action, character and dialog. I went into this movie with very unrealistically high expectations. So when I saw this movie, I was very worried but excited. <br/><br/>All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Juinor was amazing as Ironman. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. Scarlett Johanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films. Her role was substantially bigger this time around. This can also be said about Hawkeye, who's role was way bigger in this movie. In fact, Hawkeye even has some of the best lines and the best action sequences. Mark ruffilo was once again amazing as Hulk and Bruce Banner. The one character that stole the show, would be James Spader. He embodies an evil AI robot perfectly. He can be really calm and yet menacing and sometimes he can be full of rage and anger. Aron Taylor Johnson and Elisibeth Olsin are also a great new edition to the marvel universe. The scarlet Witch character has a big part in the film also.<br/><br/>The action has been dialed up and the set pieces are bigger and better. The cgi can seem a little off at times, but other than that, it looks fantastic.<br/><br/>The movie also spends time on the relationships and past of some characters, which leads to some great character moments. This is much more emotional, than the first movie. I would defiantly say that this movie is better than the first Avengers Movie!"
"skullislandsurfer","1","145","303","18 May 2015"," Dull and Bland, and Pointless
","What made the original AVENGERS so good is the characters didn't know each other. All with various powers and skills, and personalities, they clashed. <br/><br/>That clash made for humor that had a logical place within the focused storyline: a problem that needed to be solved. Thus this sequel has the problem of characters getting along too well. Where they were once very unique and on their own having to join forces, they now sit around drinking like the actors who play them. <br/><br/>Meanwhile Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark, well, he's really good and funny, but now he can't be serious enough to deliver any lines that we need to listen to without giggling. The villain is beyond weak: a brooding robot created by Stark who tries telling jokes, and badly. Captain America and Thor are all but invisible this time around. Second stringers with nothing to add. <br/><br/>So in a nutshell, no one really shined here. A2 was just plain dull."
"erinparker9","1","142","297","10 May 2015"," Everything a superhero movie has, but not what it needs
","I am a Marvel ""fangirl"". I loved seeing Avengers (the first one) and have anticipated this movie for quite some time. Unfortunately it was nothing special. It fitted in with the ""HOW TO WRITE A SUPERHERO MOVIE"" checkbook that one may give out in a creative writing class for 8 year old but (because of that) it was the most mediocre movie I have seen in a long time. Here are a few reasons why, written in list form for easy reading!<br/><br/>1) Bland Villain Tom Hiddleston as Loki was amazing. ""Ultron"", however, was not. Yes he had the whole I-will-destroy-the-human-race-and- triumph ideology but it was all without substance to back it up. Why did he hate the avengers so much? That was never fully explained. Nor were his motives to wipe out the human race. I love villains as characters. I find them the most interesting characters due to their often- troubled backstories and how they managed to reach the point of 'evil' but Ultron lacked any of that.<br/><br/>2) Character Development??? What happened to Captain America with his struggles in defining his moral compass in The Winter Soldier? All of a sudden he is back to being the clean-cut good guy. That's great, consistent character development guys! I've also always thought him and Natasha have been flirty in previous movies but in this a romance between her and Bruce appeared from nowhere! I wouldn't have minded if it was a slow process of them casting coy looks and flirty remarks in this movie and perhaps in the 3rd movie the romance formation but instead it was all forced on the audience too much too soon. The same for Hawkeyes family - which, in turn, I also didn't care for at all. And if Hawkeye is so secretive about his family why does he carry a picture of them with him all the time? Surely if he is murdered the picture will be found and his private life exposed.<br/><br/>All I can say is - the movie was too focused on action. This set the characters back any decent character development. Im also annoyed that no one was struggling at the cold air/lack of oxygen when the city was floating miles above ground but hey, its sci-fi right?"
"BigTenPower","Null","96","196","20 April 2015"," I just love Avengers Age of Ultron! Such a superb sequel.
","What's the old saying? ""Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see."" Well, Joss Whedon is officially a genius and the talent of this cast was evident in every scene. They all hit it out of the park. Yes, I just love Avengers Age of Ultron. This movie works on so many levels and makes you draw on absolutely all of your emotions. The last time I enjoyed a movie this much was the last time these characters assembled. Again, they managed to deliver a remarkable cool factor. What makes it extra special is following this film after all the other solo efforts from each character. I enjoyed the others films quite a bit but they all delivered something different. Winter Soldier delivered conspiracy thrills. The Iron Man trilogy factored in Tony Stark's complete dramatic arc, character flaws and all. The Dark World was pure sci-fi fantasy. Seeing them blend together in Avengers and the sparks that resulted is an extra special treat. <br/><br/>It all works so well and is grounded enough to carry the story and the audience through an unbelievable ride. In fact, it doesn't just fit, it's an exciting symphony and that dichotomy and difference in characters and how they interact are what makes this movie truly great. It's why Avengers stands so tall above any other franchise at the moment. Things like Transformers, Fast/Furious, and even Star Wars or Star Trek all operate with monotone restrictions. Avengers covers all angles and even multiple genres all by itself. It delivers depth of character with its fun and amazing action sequences. There's a reason why these movies make as much money as they do. They deliver a lot of everything and do so at a high quality.<br/><br/>Right from the beginning of the movie, where we get the all in one tracking shot, through the epic final globe smashing conclusion, everything is on go and everything delivers superb intensity and spectacle. This is going to be many many people's favorite film of 2015."
"coreyjdenford","8","55","107","24 April 2015"," Avengers re-assemble.
","Avengers:Age of Ultron my just be the best film of 2015 it started off great with a lot of action. Why I think this is the best superhero sequel ever.<br/><br/>Okay first thing this film is action packed there is a lot more action than the first one so basically the story is still there but the action literally takes over.<br/><br/>Second thing is the Hulkbuster now you may be thinking is it as awesome as it looks on the trailer the answer is yes...it is a lot more awesome than on the trailer and plus that action sequence goes on for quite some time. <br/><br/>Third thing Ultron now Ultron may have been toned down to how he was in the comics but in this film he is still as malevolent and vicious as ever but with limits obviously with it being PG-13. Ultron in this film is played by James Spader and he doesn't lack at all you can still tell that Ultron is one of the most dangerous villain The Avengers have ever faced. <br/><br/>Fourth thing the plot the film this time doesn't rely too much on it's story it's more the action that builds the film obviously there is still a story and it's a very good one there are some bits where the film slows down for it but that is really what a superhero film is about especially generation, when we rely on origin stories in superhero films. <br/><br/>Fifth and final thing does it feel like too much Disney? the answer for that question is no it doesn't see the first film really felt like it was too much Disney but in this film it's a lot darker than the first film because you see some of The Avengers literally feel pain. Plus the first film was more of a full on introduction to The Avengers and what they do. This film is far from Disney now and well in that case that's better I did love the first film too. <br/><br/>If you are a superhero fan and loved Ultron in the comics then you are going to love him even more in the film. This film was worth every penny and I think that well mainly superhero fans should go see this movie don't wait for it to come out on DVD just go see because it is amazing and is far better than the first. 8/10 must see superhero film."
"qsup","9","50","97","3 May 2015"," Almost Lives Up to the Hype
","Now, before you question me about the title compared to my rating, let me clarify. This movie is absolutely fantastic; it's witty, it's action packed, and even emotional. But before you see it, you have to put aside all the hype that you have been building up for the past couple months.<br/><br/>I think the main reason people are disappointed about this movie is the fact that they bought into the unimaginable, unobtainable hype. This movie is hands down, better than the original Avengers, yet people are rating it worse. The only reason I can think of, is the fact that they watched the trailers, and believed that would be the beginning level of the movie. News flash, they put some of the greatest parts in the trailer to get you interested in it.<br/><br/>If you enjoy movies on a big scale, have great acting, great chemistry, some easter eggs for the next movie, and solid jokes, you will like this movie. If you are expecting this movie to be something like the second coming of Jesus, then you will be disappointed."
"natecollins","10","48","93","4 May 2015"," Amazing Movie...But of course the majority doesn't see that...
","One thing people keep saying is the problem in the avenger films and in the MCU(marvel Cinematic universe) is that every film is only a stepping stone, like its leading up to something. but is juts putting the story off. whats the problem here? Yes every film is leading to the big ending which Im certain will be the infinity war. So yes every movie plays an intricate part in leading up to that. But its called a Story. Thats how you build a story, especially a super awesome one like this. You don't just skip to the end. Its like people don't see what amazing film making is done here. There's never been so many movies that connect and every decision made affects another movie.Nobody complains about that with the hunger games or the harry potter series, but guess what its the same thing. Only much more difficult here since all of the big players get their own films.<br/><br/>Another complaint is hulk and the black widow's love relationship. I'll admit it threw me for a loop too. Didn't see that coming at all. But why is it so bad? I mean if you really think about it, we learn a little more about black widow each film shes in. And in this film we really learn that she did things in her past she isn't proud of. She feels like a monster inside. Who else on the team feels like a monster? and literally turns into one? The Hulk. It makes sense they have a connection. Hawkeye has his own family, and captain America and her really just don't click on that level, not to mention he seems as if he is still stuck on Peggy carter from his past. Somebody said the MCU seems to be very sexless? I'm not sure if you mean there isn't enough nudity or sexual content, but if that's the case, you are sadly mistaken. Its under Disney for starters and its based on children's comic books. Kids are definitely going to go see it. Or if you meant there isn't enough love stories, then you are also not paying attention and mistaken. Tony Stark/Pepper Potts. Thor/Jane.Captain America/Peggy Carter. Hawkeye now has a wife we see. The Hulk had a love story in his own movie and now with black widow. So to say the MCU is sexless, doesn't make sense. One thing I keep seeing from people is they don't understand how Ultron is basically alive and can talk. they say right in the film more than once. its artificial intelligence. That means he has ""the ability of a computer or other machine to perform those activities that are normally thought to require intelligence""Tony stark and Bruce banner uploaded him into there system and he takes over . The reason they did this was because tony stark wanted shield the world from invaders, like the first film. and then people said nobody blamed tony stark for this?!! were you watching at all!? Over and over again everybody was mad with him, captain America especially. Then Someone said they thought this would build up to a iron man vs. captain America civil war but then nothing it falls flat! seriously the next film after ant man is Captain America Civil War! Why are people mad Hawkeye has a family? He got screwed in most of the first film, he was just a pawn. In this film we get to see the real Hawkeye, and people are mad at this? Give the guy a break. He is a part of the avengers and doesn't get his own films, So why is it such a big deal he got some quality screen time, and it was a big plan to set him up for his death which we all thought was going to happen only to see quicksilver go. And someone said the movie is predictable?!That totally threw everybody for a loop. And they are saying it's random he has a family? He said He didn't want anybody to know. so why would you know about it if nobody did He fights bad guys all day, why would he be spreading around he has a wife and kids. Somebody said the beginning is pointless and makes no sense to the story line? Once again if you watched the last film before this one, which was the second Captain America the whole storyline was about Hydra taking over Shield, and destroying it. Hence why there is no shield in this movie until the end. In the start of this film they sort of wrap that storyline up, by taking the hydra base and getting the plans for Ultron to start this story. If every movie had the same story it would be boring, also the beginning set up the twins to be in this movie, since it was Strucker who experimented on them and gave them their abilities. So to say this opening seen wasn't important, is ludicrous because it was. I've heard people say the visions the witch gives the heroes is dumb, and they don't care about it. Well if you watched Thors' at all, its what all of these movies have been about, the infinity stones. And he is going to start figuring that out. We've seen 4 of the 6. which by the time infinity war comes around, all 6 will be revealed. and is what its all about. How can you say its not important? And its beyond me why you would say there are too many characters!? They get there own films for a reason. Because in these films, it about them as a team. There characters have been developed, and they still are but obviously it will be harder with more characters. But that's the whole fun in the avenger films. All of these awesome beings together. Every body is aloud there own opinion, I understand that, But the majority of things being said make absolutely no sense."
"thenopeman","7","65","130","30 April 2015"," Action, action and action
","Spoiler free review.<br/><br/>I can't say the film didn't lack action because it didn't, every minute was filled with brilliant effects and amazing shots. An action packed adrenaline ride all through. However this said the film lacked story. At first the film was taking over from the first avengers, the story was good. But somewhere into the film the story fell apart with too much happening and without the solid story line it felt weak, with no real connections at all there was just fighting and action all over. I thought from what little story this film had to offer it was a lot more comic based than the previous one. The main villain in this film felt like a weakly based character, he had little to do with the story and was probably a contributing factor into it's downfall.<br/><br/>In conclusion I thought that the action, acting and effects are among the best, however the weak story left me with a far different feeling to the first. I thought although this film was great for a sequel it wasn't as good as the first. The film felt like it was meant to put a story across ready for the next film, which I hope will have a better story and live up to my expectations! However if for now you're looking for a great action film this is definitely a great one to watch, even though the story was weak and lacked that edge it is still a great film and hopefully will make an even better trilogy!"

","OK. So let me start off by saying that action movies are not my absolute favorite genre in the world, I do enjoy action but I dislike when a scene of action goes on so long that you forget exactly why they are fighting in the first place. Well. Avengers Return of Ultron was action packed AWESOMENESS. They knew exactly how to break up all the action with GENUINE humor (not groan worthy puns. I'm looking at you Furious Seven) and class. This movie is the whole package for EVERYONE. You have action, romance and humor. This is SURPRISINGLY better than the first one! The story line that they put together was genius and the cinematography of the final battle scene sincerely took my breath away. This is a must see for fans of action, the Avengers, but also movies! It's what action movies in the 21st century should be like! The WHOLE package."
"jakobgf-95","6","117","249","23 April 2015"," Guardians of the Galaxy started a horrible trend
","It's both funny and sad at the same time that this movie has the exact same flaws that Guardians of the Galaxy has. But first something positive.<br/><br/>The action is awesome, the effects are, for the most part, pretty good, there where two or free good jokes in it and it is decently directed. I also like the fact that they used some parts from the score of the first movie. There was also a cool scene where Ultron talks to the twins and they tell him what happened to their family. Ultron talked neutral to them and not like someone who is about to wipe out humanity. Finally, though i start to notice that in a lot of Films recently, i want to point out the very first scene which is a Really good action scene and it is done in one shot. But that's about it.<br/><br/>This film is just as lazily written as guardians and i'm beginning to fear that this is a trend that will continue. So let me just point out all the things that are wrong. <br/><br/>The character development sucks. The old characters are not further developed and the ones that are, are extremely forced. Also, the new characters are just not interesting. It doesn't help, that the performances are really not that good either. They're OK, but nothing great and all of these actors can do so much better.<br/><br/>The villain is just bad. Aside from his clichéd motivation, which i don't mind that much but i want to point it out anyway, he is just not intimidating. And the stupid attempt to make him funny by having him have goofy reactions doesn't help.<br/><br/>The dialog between the characters is 90% one liners, especially during the intense action. With this cheap attempt to constantly be funny i cant get sucked in because i permanently have the impression, that none of the characters takes anything seriously. And the jokes where almost never funny.<br/><br/>There is a huge load of plot conveniences in this movie and a ton of things that are never explained.<br/><br/>That's about it. For the rest, i would enter spoiler territory and then i would write forever. <br/><br/>Overall this film is sadly average and gives us nothing new. But i think the main problem with this can be clearly detected with the help of a certain scene. Don't worry, i won't spoil anything but in this scene a character has a vision about the infinity gems and he only sees the ones that have appeared in a movie so far. The images can't come from his own mind because he has no idea about the orb from guardians, at least it's not explained that he might know something about it, which means something different showed him the gems. And whatever made him see the stones, it was somehow aware of the fact that the Last two gems haven't appeared in a Movie so far because there is absolutely no reason for not at least showing them. Which leads me to the conclusion, that those images where not for the character in the film, but for the audience.<br/><br/>Instead of writing a really clever movie we should just through in a bunch of one liners and some images that the audience is going to jerk off to. Why make a peace of art when we can make lots of money?"

Tony's invention overrides it's original settings, Ultron having a mind of his own--thinking that change means the planet should be covered with metal minions and not human beings. ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was absolutely stunning, with many great comedic jokes and moments, more character development involving some of the most secret-keeping of characters, new and old faces on screen, the element of surprise, plenty of great action and many elements from the comic books. Multiple scenes tease upcoming movies, adding to the suspension and excitement of what will happen next with one of the world's favorite super-hero teams."

It's less like watching a film and more like logging on to youtube and watching gameplay of the latest state of the art computer game <br/><br/>AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON gets off to the exact start I'm talking about . Most of the iconic Marvel Superheroes - and the audience are thrust in to an opening action sequence . It's very vague what this mission is , something about East European baddies in league with Hydra working on some artificial intelligence . Ignore the narrative because the opening involves lots of stunts , ramping and explosions with the occasional one liner thrown in . You want action you've got it . You want intelligent , stimulating storytelling ? Go and read a book . I can understand what the producers are pandering to but I found this pre-title sequence rather uninvolving and the rest of the film continues in the same way <br/><br/>One thing the film does try and do is merge high concept action with character driven moments . On paper it does have a relatively good cast and it'd be a pity to waste it on overblown action but it's not really an actors type of film and while the production team deserves some credit for trying to concentrate on character but it's not developed enough to be entirely successful and comes across as rather shallow <br/><br/>Despite this short review I'm big enough to stick up my hand and say this movie isn't produced for grumpy , middle aged men like myself , it's produced for younger people who can't get enough superhero movies and for this market the prospective audience will probably love it so much so that that'll be a contender for biggest grossing film of 2015 and we'll be getting more Marvel movies for the foreseeable future"

","Even up to this day, I regret not seeing The Avengers in theaters when it came out! I'm in love with the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Iron Man, Captain America and the Guardians of the Galaxy... Just writing down the titles gets me excited. The Avengers would be the culmination of all these epic superheroes! And by god it was! It was clever, it was fast, it was epic, it was funny, it was awesome! The Avengers set the bar at such a level, the curse of bad sequels was bound to pop up its nasty head. Well, with great pleasure, I can say it hasn't. Avengers: Age of Ultron (without ""The"" for some reason) is so much fun it's crazy. The action is quick, epic and on point. The teamwork is so awesome: just think about combining Cap's shield and Thor's hammer and let your imagination run wild. That's what the creators of AOU did with the action scenes: just let their creativity flow and use these amazing super abilities and just mix and mash them together to create some epic visuals. <br/><br/>The story is quite interesting: Tony Stark wants to create a robotic army of peacekeepers to take over from the Avengers and make them no longer needed. This backfires when his creation Ultron activates and his A.I. concludes that humanity's extinction is the only way to ensure peace on earth. It's interesting to see the cracks develop within the team. The twin who were teased at the end of The Winter Soldier come to the scene and start stirring up trouble. I was so happy to see Hawk Eye shine in the flick. In part one he was just a stool for the freaking awesome Loki for most of the film but now he gets so much more to do and he's just such a lovable character! <br/><br/>Visually, Age of Ultron is up to par with previous Marvel movies. It looks great, especially the climax of the movie is just a joy to watch. <br/><br/>I had some gripes with the film though. For starters I found it quite odd to see Iron Man just doing his thing when it wasn't explained how he came back from his retirement after Iron Man 3. I'm glad he's back but some info would be nice. Secondly there's a romance which feels out of place because it wasn't earned in previous movies. It kind of feels forced and out of the blue. <br/><br/>The music is epic and grand. The Avengers theme is back and it's awesome! <br/><br/>Summary: Fun and epic sequel with minor gripes."

","The second outing of Whedon's Avengers is bound to be compared to the first, but I cannot help but simply see this movie as a bridge between the first and the third that is yet to come. Don't get me wrong, I loved this movie, but as is inevitable with ongoing series the middle part is a lot of continuation and no resolve. The opening dives straight into the action without any prelude as to how the team have reassembled after the events of Iron Man 3, Cap 2 and Thor 2. The audience are left to assume that at some point between Iron Man 3 and this movie Tony Stark decided to rebuild the Avengers after Shield went down, thus donning his armour once more. With a few episodes of Angents of Shield still to air perhaps we will get a more thorough explanation but for now one can only conclude that Stark was the driving force of the idea and Cap the elected leader. The Maximoff twins are well executed away from the forbidden mutant element, the Avengers following Coulson's terminology of enhanced persons and dancing around the potential connection to the Inhumans that we may see in the future. Without giving too much away I'll briefly touch on the romantic entanglements portrayed, the main twist meaning that many a Barton/Romanov shipper are to be disappointed. I however found the development of Barton's character to be endearing and by the end of the movie was cheering on Hawkeye more than any other Avenger, now desperate for a solo outing for the character (TV series anyone?). As for Romanov, her romantic interest seems a bit forced and probably has more to do with the chemistry between the actors than the characters. There is a spark there no doubt but from a character standpoint it makes little sense and seems to just serve to pull at our heartstrings later on when the inevitable happens. It's a pleasure to see Paul Bettany on screen at long last, his JARVIS becoming a fully formed Vision and by films end becoming a New Avenger in his own right. The myriad of cameos are enjoyable and thankfully purposeful as the end of the movie sees the New Avengers forming out of this 'B-Team', hinting at the potential for Phase 4 of Marvel's plan as the current cast's contracts start to run out. In conclusion, this movie is a wonderful continued romp through the Marvel Cinematic Universe and leaves you desperate for the next instalment and doesn't drop the ball, which as the ninth movie in the series is an achievement in itself. Let the good times keep rolling!"
"ultron77","8","65","135","29 April 2015"," A great follow up; but two major problems
","My first impression of Age of Ultron is that it's a great film. The action scenes are spectacularly done. The interactions between characters, except for a few, are wonderful. And, needless to say, we get a fantastic villain out of James Spader playing Ultron.<br/><br/>But there were two things I found wrong. The first is the beginning. While we were given this good prologue to explain the setup of the main story, it was followed up with yet more exposition to start the main story and lengthy party sequence with too many nameless extras (Stan Lee's cameo being the only exception) that dragged on. This is all before Ultron even begins to function, and we're already twenty to thirty minutes into the film.<br/><br/>The second is the romantic relationship between Hulk and Black Widow. Alright, I confess. I am a Steve Rogers/Natasha Romanoff fan. But this pairup was so badly mishandled. There is no leadup to it; it just comes out of nowhere. At least with Cap and Hawkeye, there was chemistry to found on.<br/><br/>Besides these two things however, I would go as far to say that this movie is so well done that it could practically be The Empire Strikes Back of Avengers movies. Instead of being focused on the action like the first Avengers film was, Age of Ultron focused more on the characters and their developments as they deal with the situations they are being put through, or putting themselves into in some cases. I won't say anymore as I will spoil the film if I do. Go to the cinema and see it for yourself."

","I hoped for a better instance than the brainless, tavern brawl movie that was the first Avengers but it ended up being worst. Much worst. Result is some kind of Michael Bay movie mixed up with Iron Man 3 and all the clichés that Team America was laughing at but that Hollywood (and audiences) didn't seem to get.<br/><br/>Disaster of a scenario designed to show up ultra fast and over-packed scenes of senseless action, with a villain that never really gets to look like some sort of threat after all.<br/><br/>Oh and Marvel, in case you didn't realize, having 150 iron man suits in the same scene makes Iron Man look... well... trivial. Boring. You know? And when Tony Stark's spare armor can defeat Hulk and then Hulk defeats the movie's main villain with a single punch, it kinda makes your villain ridiculous. Especially, also, after he hit Captain America in the chest with his ""laser"" and all it does is bump him out of a truck. We thought he was transforming himself into the next evolution... something verrryyyyy dangerous... well that was evolution into uselessness obviously.<br/><br/>Also, don't you get all tired of those magic cubes or gems each containing the ""Universe's absolute power""? It's what, 5 movies now about those? It's frustrating because when you look at the first Spiderman movies, the Batman franchise by Nolan, and some others, these have been huge successes and yet were movies with character development and a story you could buy. What is this urge of making an absolute mess with a scenario so thin it makes Michael Bay stories decent? Guess I'm back at waiting for the next X-Men, the last decent superhero franchise it seems."

","This film is the same as the first one, instead of aliens we have robots. It doesn't explain why there is a half metal half red guy that Thor brought to life after having a bath. Hulk isn't hulk he's Sulk, the dude's just depressed the whole way through even though he's now in love with a woman who is terrified of him ( when did that happen?). The film is dry and lack's any originality, its all been done before in the last film especially the ending. The last 20 minutes or so could have been cut and pasted from the previous film. The only decent part about it was the fight between Hulk and Super iron man. Good to see the avengers back together again but i think people should wait for the DVD don't waste your money in the cinema and line the pockets of the people who made this so they can make more crap."
"anyamorse","10","40","79","3 May 2015"," Exactly what we wanted AND needed
","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is more well-balanced in comparison to the original film. There's more variety as nearly every character gets an appropriate amount of screen time. There's also this cohesive balance between the film's story and its action. It's very much about action and entertainment, but there are also new characters to introduce, a blossoming love story between two Avengers to showcase, the infinity gems to gather quietly in the background, and a new villain to develop. While Whedon's wit and sharp writing are clearly very much an integral part of the film the humor doesn't seem quite as on the mark as it was in the first film. You simply just don't laugh as much during ""Age of Ultron"" and that's a little disappointing.<br/><br/>The opening sequence of the film is incredible. It's pieced together as this seamless flurry of advanced weaponry, explosions, and Hulk smashing. The Ultron army circling sequence near the end of the film is just as impressive. The fight between Iron Man's Hulkbuster and Hulk is probably what everyone is looking forward to the most and it absolutely delivers. However Ultron himself may be the most enjoyable aspect of the movie. Ultron is born from a failed experiment by Tony Stark, so it's only natural that he possesses some of Tony's quips and attributes. James Spader is fantastic as Ultron. His facial expressions, body language, and hand movements are very clearly Tony Stark-inspired, but his purpose is completely monstrous and inhuman.<br/><br/>Tony is haunted by the nuclear wormhole he flew into at the end of the last film. In fact, it's the key element of his creation of Ultron. The camera angles utilized in the film are even more dynamic than they were in the previous film, especially during the Hulk sequences. They found a way to make the audience feel like the movie seat they're sitting in at the theater is in jeopardy of being within radius of Hulk's immeasurable wrath. Hawkeye's role in the sequel is also meatier this time around. Clint Barton proves that he's extremely essential to The Avengers team despite his lack of superhuman abilities.<br/><br/>While more screen time is given to the likes of Hulk, Hawkeye, and Black Widow, Thor and Captain America are seemingly left to pick up the scraps. As leader, Cap gets his fair share of one-liners and running gags but Thor's little side story is pretty weak. Excluding The Twins and Ultron, newer and additional Avengers members are practically nothing more than cameos. Introducing Vision is a cool concept, but he doesn't really do much of anything. War Machine and Falcon are mostly thrown in for one very important scene, but otherwise aren't around long enough to leave lasting impressions.<br/><br/>The second Avengers is better than its the original in many ways. The spotlight is spread amongst the six key members of the team much more efficiently than in the first film and the villain is a homegrown threat that is even bigger and deadlier than Loki was. The visuals and action sequences are considerably larger, as well. Even with regards to its few flaws, ""Age of Ultron"" is the most substantial and significant Marvel film to date that is equally entertaining and electrifying."

","Never watch this movie it is an insult to the superhero movie category. Their is simply nothing good about this movie the scene were they are drinking and chilling was OK but 99% of the film was cringy and simply bad it ignored all sense of relationships or personal lives the characters may have and pited them against a hastily put together villain with the personality of a child who often had looney tunes references and scenes, for example near the end Ultron is about to be hit by the hulk and the whole world pauses while he has some cringy unfunny one liner along the lines of ""hey how about we call it a truce"" then he is punched away into the distance as the world starts back up again it felt like the director had fallen asleep watching a wille e coyote cartoon the night before filming this scene.<br/><br/>The visuals were as great as ever but their comes a time when explosions and different coloured iron man suits don't progress the narrative look at the later transformer movies they made a lot of money yet are awful films, it is disheartening that this trash is the highest grossing superhero movie. The scripts are pathetic the MCU isn't known for good script writing but this film is the worst of the worst every single sentence feels like they are trying to get a cheap laugh out of the audience and that might be OK if it was just iron man up to it but its not every single hero and the villain are cracking wise in every single scene and it isn't funny anymore the script writers need to be sacked it just reminds you of green lanterns cringy script in his standalone. <br/><br/>A couple of the biggest mistakes in this movie from the endless list of flaws would be how they killed off quicksilver... as any comic fan knows you simply cannot kill a speedster with bullets it is the dumbest way to get rid of such a character and this film did it proud by making the stupidest portrayal of a speedster of screen their has been. They didn't only mess up the characters origin because they don't own the rights to the xmen which could be forgiven but they then released the movie along side his actual portrayal in xmen Days of future past and then went on to kill him off in the same movie he was introduced in i mean really? Visions introduction in this movie has to be one the most forced origin stories i have seen it didn't fit at all with the narrative and they just kept pushing it down the audience throats it was very poorly handled but as spiderman now holds the throne for worst introduction into a superhero movie after Civil Wars lame ass representation of the character it is less shocking as it seems like the norm for the MCU to not give a crap about their characters :'("

","Jumping right in to the action, this is one heck of a thrill ride only slowing the pace for a few moments to give a little back story to several characters that have not had their own film, and the new characters. I enjoyed the fight scenes immensely, with one in particular that had me grinning like the Cheshire cat.<br/><br/>Fans of the Marvel movies will already know what to expect from Thor, Iron man and Captain America, and the real delight for me came from the new arrivals, especially Paul Bettany as Vision.<br/><br/>The Real highlight for me was the villain Ultron. The way he looks and moves combined with the amazing voice from James Spader gives Ultron real screen presence and a great sense of menace that sets it apart from other robots in film.<br/><br/>The only thing I would have changed in this movie was to give Anthony Mackie a bigger part in it because i really enjoyed his performance in Captain America: the Wintrr Soldier, and was disappointed not to have him alongside Chris Evans again where he seemed to fit perfectly in his previous appearance. Vastly enjoyable film for all except the art crowd."
"kaianmattmckay","5","21","38","13 February 2017"," Somewhat disappointed
","I'm a big fan of Marvel and have seen the other Avengers titles, and so I went into this one with certain expectations. They weren't met.<br/><br/>As opposed to earlier installments, barely a few minutes seem to pass in AoU without one of the characters making what is supposed to be an amusing, throwaway remark/one-liner. There's nothing wrong with injecting a little levity into the proceedings, but in this case, I found it excessive, and detrimental both to the flow of action and to the characters and how you engage. Wisecracking is usually one character's responsibility, specifically to provide comic relief. When all the characters are doing it, it gets tired very quickly.<br/><br/>I found the plot to be a bit messy, perhaps because I'm a comics purist, and the introduction and treatment of several new characters here is only tangentially related, if even that, to their actual origin stories as per the comics. With apologies to James Spader, I found the portrayal of Ultron in particular to be bordering on the ridiculous, and inappropriately ""human"", as in my imaginings, Ultron was always more of a Terminator-style killing machine with tyrannical tendencies, whereas we're presented here with more of a lovable but psychotic rogue with as much dangerous charm as he has nuts and bolts. The whole effort seems to be held together by an abundance of action, new characters, and cameos from previous characters (Samuel L. Jackson, or Idris Elba) to distract from the general lack of substance.<br/><br/>All in all, it was 2+ hours that I don't totally regret spending, but would not see it again, or recommend it - unless it's just for the voyeuristic pleasure of seeing your favourite eye-candy protagonists in biker leathers and latex."

","**Spoiler-Free**<br/><br/>Word among those in the know is that Joss Whedon butted heads with Marvel regarding this sequel's storyline. Whedon, a truly gifted writer and director, wanted the same heart and soul as the first Avengers; Marvel wanted to ""Michael Bay"" the film with over-the-top fight scenes and explosions, as well as overstuff it with new characters and interconnected story lines from other films. (And, yes, ""Michael Bay"" is a verb for mind-numbing, plot-less, soul-sucking codswallop.) In context, Age of Ultron is actually enjoyable in that Whedon DOES manage to insert some soul into the film – a feat that would have been nearly impossible in less capable hands. With that said, I would give the film a 6.0 or so.<br/><br/>Apparently, Marvel is planning to continue the trend of overstuffed, interconnected story lines. Director Edgar Wright left Ant-Man last year amid similar complaints. This is concerning because based on the sheer number of superhero trailers I saw before Age of Ultron started, Marvel's omnipresence will soon know no bounds – but Marvel fans want quality, not quantity. Please don't confuse us with Transformer enthusiasts. Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier were unexpected gems. Last I checked, their box-office intakes weren't too shabby either. More of that please."
"UncleTantra","2","78","166","6 May 2015"," Clearly, comic books really DO lower people's intelligence
","Please bear in mind that the person writing this is a BIG fan of Joss Whedon's earlier work in TV and movies. It's the fact that I really AM such a fan that made going to see ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" so upsetting.<br/><br/>I managed to sit through the whole film, but just barely. Instead of the ""Wow! Look at that!"" I was supposed to feel, all I felt was sadness that one of the best storytellers of our age had sunk so low. ""Ultron"" was 141 minutes of Biff! Zap! Pow! Boom! Zoom! CGI madness, punctuated with a few lines that clearly were intended to be funny but only could have been considered so by pimply-faced 14-year-olds whose standards for comic one-liners had been set by Beavis and Butthead.<br/><br/>In other words, I hated it. I wish Joss would wake up from his comic book-induced stupor and remember how to write characters and plots again. ""Buffy"" used to cost $1.1 million per episode. ""Firefly"" used to cost $2 million per episode. And they were great.<br/><br/>""Ultron"" cost over $2 million PER MINUTE of running time, and it's crap.<br/><br/>There is a lesson here. When Joss is working with his own ideas, it doesn't take huge amounts of money to create wonderful entertainment. When he is working with other people's comic book ideas, it doesn't matter how much money the producers throw at it -- it's comic book-mentality crap.<br/><br/>Stop making crap, Joss. Tell the guys at Marvel to keep their money and keep their mediocre plots and characters. Come back to making entertainment based on your own ideas."

","If disappointment had lost a literal definition, it would be 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. A lazy, soulless sequel, that shames its prequel & also the prolific superheroes. Despite the best of graphics & stars in hand, this summer bigger suffers from a stilted narrative.<br/><br/>'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Synopsis: When Tony Stark tries to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.<br/><br/>'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has only one saving grace & that's its graphics. The visuals are marvelous & the action-sequences are expertly choreographed. But, the narrative is stilted & soulless. Also, the pace is dreadfully slow in the first-hour. I was throughly bored in this hour, almost in disbelief if this one is actually a marvel movie.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's Screenplay is a downer. He made a terrific film previously, but this time around, he has faltered. The Writing Material surrenders to graphics & makes very less use of its own strength. Whedon's Direction, on the other-hand, is fair. Cinematography is alright. Editing is loose, the film runs for a long 142-minutes! <br/><br/>The Avengers, however, do well. Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark / Iron Man, donning the part for the fifth time, hasn't lost his charm. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, is excellent here, while Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, looks tired. Chris Evans as Steve Rogers / Captain America, has his moments. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow, is passable. Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton / Hawkeye, is a pleasant surprise here. He actually gets scope to perform this time & he does. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver & Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, add freshness in the proceedings. James Spader as Ultron, is the biggest letdown. He gives the villain a hammy turn, which by no means, works. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is very high on hype, but low on substance."
"rannynm","10","41","82","29 April 2015"," Another Monumental Marvel Movie!
","The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes. <br/><br/>There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions. <br/><br/>I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe. <br/><br/>Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters. <br/><br/>For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past. <br/><br/>The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful. <br/><br/>There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on. <br/><br/>The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man. <br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits.<br/><br/>Reviewed by Keefer B., KIDS FIRST! Film Critic.

"cherubster122","10","47","97","21 April 2015"," A marvelous addition to the MCU
","Hopefully there are no spoilers in this review. Avengers: Age of Ultron is the marvel film we've all been waiting for. It's the marvel film we've needed for so long. Joss Whedon masterfully directed a work of art with this film. There are scenes that tug at the emotions, some making you feel exceptionally excited, some rather sad, and at times somewhat creeped out. He brings together a combination of comedy, drama, plenty of action, and even a little love. Bringing in new characters to the universe, shedding light on some who needed it, and even bringing some old ones back. <br/><br/>All the actors give amazing performances, as to be expected. James Spader, as Ultron, being one of the highlights of the film. Clever, comical, sinister and oh so intimidating. Spader furthering upon the comical and serious sides the film portrays with the way he employs his unique voice. Ultron has some moments where if Spader had not been voicing him, they wouldn't have had the same effect. With some incredible dialogue scenes, and some awesome one-liners, Spader made you fall in love with Ultron in a way you wouldn't expect. Paul Bettany, also made an even greater splash into the MCU, after being Jarvis, by bringing Vision to the big screen. Playing the part exceptionally well, he brings the character to life, and makes you trust him with some rather comical scenes. Later on in the film he starts showing off some awesome fighting skills, which leave you wanting more. With some great confrontational scenes with Ultron, he shows his good-neutral character alignment, stating he is ""For life"". Hopefully we see more of Vision in the future MCU, because he was an awe inspiring character whom I felt should have had a little more screen time and action. But hey... At least we got him. The Maximoff twins were played brilliantly by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Playing Pietro 'Quicksilver' Maximoff, and Elizabeth Olsen, as the Scarlett Witch or Wanda Maximoff. Both having scenes where you can't help but connect to them, and love them. Aaron bringing out the comical side of the films once again, with some incredibly well written scenes. Segwaying into how he and Jeremy Renner's character, Hawkeye coincided, having some brilliantly banter between the two of them which left everyone laughing. And more segwaying with Hawkeye and Wanda connecting in some great ways, with some rather comical yet serious interactions between the two. Elizabeth played Wanda exceptionally well, showing her connection to her brother in a phenomenal way. Both also have great scenes with Ultron.<br/><br/>Though mostly consistent, there were a few plot holes, or scenes that could have been expanded upon, though not enough to mark the film down. I would expand on this topic further, but I'm trying to avoid dropping spoilers. <br/><br/>All in all, the most recent addition to the MCU was a truly amazing film, I was completely enveloped into the world, connecting with all the characters, either again or for the first time. Joss Whedon wrote and directed what may be the highlight of his career so far. It is easily among my top five films now, and currently standing at the top of this years film charts for me. It is most certainly going to be a hard one to knock down! And just a heads up; there is only one credits scene."

","This review contains spoilers, you should read it anyway because it's not worth seeing. My mate fell asleep next to me, I found myself battering my head into the head rest, and a geeky guy to my left kept cackling at the in-references that most there didn't understand. They kept coming and I knew they were there because I would hear 3 or 4 nasal geeks cackle at them. In a full theatre. Everyone looked bored.<br/><br/>In comparison to worthy action films like the first Captain America (masterpiece), the first and even, second Thor film (beautifully shot and amazing set pieces) This was... Horrendous and made no sense immediately from the beginning. It was like I came into the cinema half way through the film. This is not a film built for people who haven't seen the other films, hell, this isn't even a film made for people who *have* seen all the other films but not the TV series and the special limited edition comic book. It's a obsessive geeks film, made for other obsessive geeks and (apologies for any antagonism caused, I'm just annoyed at how this film has damaged the cinematic universe of marvel by being so weak) nobody else will get it. I watch a lot of shield on TV and it still didn't make sense.<br/><br/>We join the avengers with no explanation in the middle of a fight in the forest, we don't know who they are fighting for ten minutes (we don't find out for 30 minutes and even then it relies on you having seen the last 4 movies to understand) and I immediately find myself struggling to care, as jokes are made and they effortlessly dispatch the enemy with their super powers I find myself thinking ""any army could have dealt with this, why the avengers?"" And that's the problem, the first enemy is weak, so you find yourself being confused and bored. Stark picks up Loki's sceptre and the next confusing moment comes - why was it missing in the first place, why did they know to go there for it??? This isn't explained.<br/><br/>We join Stark in his lab and he is experimenting on the sceptre, discovering it is a computer, not a power source, or maybe even both. He discovers this in about ten minutes, it feels like half the movie should be dedicated to such a complex piece of reverse engineering and it makes no sense that it takes 5 minutes. Stark took a whole movie to create his own power source for Iron Man, yet we're led to believe he can reverse engineer more advanced alien technology in 6 minutes. <br/><br/>Speaking of Stark, no characters are given backgrounds here, if you haven't seen previous films expect to understand nothing and be baffled. In comparison to other Marvel films where things make sense without background knowledge.<br/><br/>From here the sceptre is used to integrate an AI with the Internet or some such nonsense. Apparently before Stark couldn't do it, lacking a powerful enough computer. Yet Stark already had an AI he created so it's like wut??? A blue blob of light attacks a brown blob of light in Stark's lab and none of it makes any coherent sense in even a vagueeee way. I'm not talking it being based on actual science (although the best Marvel films suspend your disbelief and don't feel completely ridiculous), it's just literally confusing, special fx blue lights sending out lines of blue against brown blobs and apparently the Internet is invaded and I'm like wut is going onnn... The AI gets a body and blah blah blah. By now it's been 40 minutes (btw this film is soooo overlong) and nothing makes sense or is interesting or has happened of note.<br/><br/>From there is a series of fights, none of which are interesting as the Avenger characters are so powerful and the opposition so weak you don't even question their ability to win, making them pointless. <br/><br/>A character is introduced who is apparently a witch, at first she just influences minds, but by the end of the film she's suddenly developed into some sort of Keanu Reeves Matrix type person with red mist around her hands and she uses her powers to hit people with red mist and can stop bullets and it's like, um where has this come from, earlier she had to hide in a cupboard? Her character is so poorly developed that when she joins the Avengers I don't care whether she lives or dies.<br/><br/>I won't waste time on the new red android with the stone is his head, I don't even remember what his name is - although I note I think towards the end they started to mention his name without even explaining where it came from. He literally randomly appears in scenes and it's like ""who cares?"". Then there's the machine used to create him, it's not explained at all it's just like ""oh noes Ultron will use the machine to create a new body!!!1"". Where did the machine come from? Who knows, that could be a film in itself. It's just another deus ex machina. One that is probably better than this nonsense.<br/><br/>Speaking of deus ex machina, there's the bit where Samuel L Jackson pops back from death with a massive ship to save everyone in the city. Like the worst attempt to sort a bad plot ever.<br/><br/>Literally worse than batman and robin, that at least was meant to be a joke. How ironic that Whedon, famous for being a geek, did a worse Marvel film then Kenneth Branagh. I mean you don't think of the Shakespeare guy and think ""I bet he'd do a good film about Norse aliens"" but he does. He makes this look like a nightmarish nonsensical joke. Which it is."

","The main issue with this film is certainly the pacing, its condensed story structure leaves very little time to really absorb each character, there are too many subplots running throughout the film.<br/><br/>Iron Man's self destructive trend, Scarlett Witch's and Quicksilver's character arcs, Ultron's justification for the end of the world, Vision's choice to be for humanity, Hulk and Black Widow's romance and their own feelings about their place in the world, Hawkeye's background, minor characters making cameo arcs and with that comes at least an hour of fight sequences (ala Man of Steel influence). Excess would be the sin of this film and lack of moments of self reflection effects the film in a non positive manner.<br/><br/>Problems begin with starting with a big fight sequence that takes you completely out of the characterisation and puts them in an objectified position, it should have really slowly reintroduced to you to the world instead of heading in.<br/><br/>The problems continues with Aaron Taylor-Johanson's Russian accent which was just off putting for some reason and his limited time for characterisation did not leave you weeping for like Coulson.<br/><br/>Ultron's flawed design and Metallic lip movements seemed unnecessary for a robot and expensive and also he wasn't as interesting a Loki. The amount of robots brought back unwanted nostalgia for the climaxes of Iron Man 2 and 3. This after all not a Transformers franchise!! Vision in my opinion was fine, he looked good to me, and his connection to Scarlett Witch was watchable.<br/><br/>However Thor was completely underused and just knowing where to put the infinity stone at that specific moment in time is a moment that cannot suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>The jokes mainly felt, due to pacing issues and tonal difference, kinda like bad throwaway one liners though some of the landed appropriately however what I did need fleshed out was Black Widow's hide the zucchini talent, that would have been very entertaining.<br/><br/>The choreography for the fight scenes were ambitious and watched by themselves is an excellent example of superhero team fight, but in this film often messy in relation to its story structure. Captain America's fight sequences being fundamentally my favourite.<br/><br/>What this film can't compare to it's predecessor, organic moments of characterisation and visual comedy. The first team-up, the battle for New York, ""Always being Angry"", the big ""Owie"", ""Hulk vs Thor"", ""Hulk saving Iron Man"""", ""having red in your ledger"" and ""mewling quim"". The lack of memorability for me at least is what causes the root of my disappointment in this film.<br/><br/>That's why I cannot give it a 7.0, Whedon can do better he's an organic writer who got caught up in an overly ambitious plan to tell an entire season of Buffy in 2.20 hrs. Stripping it down, even building up the flash backs from the very beginning to the last one where Scarlett Witch attached to Tony would have worked better, even at a sense of mystery why the flashbacks occurred to create that tension and maybe push it more toward they Arne't fears actual vision of what can occur would be thematically more interesting.<br/><br/>Final verdict 6.8/10"

","After watching this movie I visited IMDb to check for some photos and well - I was shocked to see a current rating of 8,2. I do not know how this could be true, I mean the same rating as masterpieces hold like ""Heat"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"" or ""Die Hard"". Either this world is about to face the apocalypse of morons or ""taste"" became something to chose in the McDonald's menu...<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this movie is not crap, you might watch it if you prefer a story full of plot holes big enough to hide at least a group of a hundred Hulks in them and characters as pale and static as the Terracotta Army in the famous Chinese grave. Besides, this film has SFX. And it is a hell of a thunderstorm of SFX... I stopped counting after the 10th SFX company listed in the credits. So if your age starts with a 1 and has no more than another digit to follow, you might be entertained and amused about all these effects, virtually in every single scene. But if you expect a little more from a movie, like well developed characters, a good story with a consistent plot and something to entertain your intellect, this would not become the best choice.<br/><br/>It's probably nice for watching it once, beer and popcorn at hand and forgetting about it the very next day again.

","I tend to enjoy the Marvel movies and animated movies / TV series when I can catch them. Unfortunately I caught Next Avengers: Heroes of Tomorrow on TV once, and that, coupled with the name Age of Ultron, led me to expect something like that animated movie or Days of Future Past: that Ultron takes over and there's a desperate struggle to overthrow him. One early trailer I saw also seemed to enforce such an impression.<br/><br/>Unfortunately Ultron turned out to be a rather impotent villain. He's full of potential danger, but doesn't manage to realise any of that potential. The trailers made the movie look like the threat is a lot bigger than it was. Pretty much every danger in this movie is short term and thwarted without too much problem. I kept waiting for something truly dramatic to happen, but it never did. There's no Age of Ultron in this movie, not even a glimpse of it, and for me that was disappointing enough that I didn't enjoy the movie much.<br/><br/>There's decent action, drama and humour, it's not a badly made movie, but the villain is weak, and even the ultimate danger, the death of the human race, is less dramatic than potential subjugation, which is what most villains go for."

","Well, I watched it last night and I am still amazed and thinking about it! Truly one of the greatest marvel movies. I read some of the negative reviews from other users and I have to say that I don't understand them. Sometimes it feels like they paid a ticket to see a marvel movie, and then they expected some kind of Oscar winning performance and some deep and meaningful life-inspiring story. No. That's not it. If you expect that, look for another movie. <br/><br/>For me, this kind of movies is like having single-flavor smoothies, like lemon or orange or strawberry, and then, one day a guy comes and says, ""do you want them all in one?"". That's actually it. Iron man, Thor, Hulk and Captain America, some very successful characters, all-in-one! What more can you ask for? <br/><br/>I really liked the depiction of the different characters and how they all blended and interact with one another. It's really nice how each character keeps its own uniqueness and how they also blend together, creating some amazing moments. I really appreciated the humor of the movie which was really useful to break the tension in many points during the story. <br/><br/>The Ultron was AMAZING as a villain as well as the Vision. The movie was packed with action and had an amazing flow that made you think you were already 1h30m into the movie, when it was actually only 45 minutes. Scenes that were too much even for such a movie were significantly less than the first movie. I really liked the way some parallel stories evolve and I was really happy to see in the end how the movie leaves room for another one."

","Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the squeal to the avengers(2012). Age Of Ultron is about when Tony Stark tries to make a robot called Ultron. It's meant to save the world but things go wrong and now they have to get every avenger and more people to stop Ultron. First off, Age Of Ultron was amazing and blew the first avengers out of the water. Everything was more fun, and raised the stakes to a whole another level. Now, there are some parts of the movie that felt not needed for this movie but you know that it will become a bigger piece in the MCU. What makes age of Ultron great as the first one is seeing all the avengers together. The old cast is great as before and with the addition of the new characters, it's just better. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great additions to the MCU. The one person who stole the whole movie was Hawkeye. He had a lot more screen time and much more character development. Overall Avengers: Age Of Ultron was an amazing movie, much smarter and fun than any other marvel movie yet. A must watch In the theaters. Great start to the summer movies of 2015."

","This movie takes a long time to gain any steam, with a lot of all talk and no action in the first half of the movie. There is also little suspense and intrigue - just the superheroes pondering and conjuring their next mission, with Tony Stark and Bruce Banner creating a project called Ultron to act as a peacekeeping program serving as the movie's backdrop.<br/><br/>The Ultron project goes horribly wrong and the machine takes a mind of its own, threatening to rid the world of humans in attempts to ""save the world"" - something we've heard before.<br/><br/>We get to see action slowly trickle in during the second half of the movie slowly - lots of crazy CGI action during the rumbling climax. This film's plot sets the story for the next film, Captain America: Civil War, in motion.

","We find the team dealing with a threat of their own making..... a sentient robot called Ultron, who was originally designed as a peacekeeping program. Since Loki was captured, the team have been working to take down various cells of a secret society of villains known as HYDRA. <br/><br/>Their aim to make the world a better, safer place inspires Tony Stark to create Ultron, in order to respond to additional threats that the Avengers aren't able to handle. <br/><br/>Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously and believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. <br/><br/>The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered twin Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the homicidal android........<br/><br/>It was always going to be a tough call to match the first Avengers movie, which, in all fairness, was a monumental cinematic experience, but here, it appears that Whedon knew he couldn't match it, realise the film would make bucketloads anyway, and just hasn't bothered with many of the characters.<br/><br/>Oh yes, they have all the same screen time, but it appears that the heroes with their own separate franchises, have been sidelined in order for the humanistic side of the film to work, and in turn, it achieves it somewhat, but there is too much exposition that bloats the movie, and makes it, at times, an almost unbearable ordeal, which takes some doing, considering the wealth of characters in the film.<br/><br/>But the real problem with the film is its lack of urgency, and here Whedon isn't to blame, it's Disney/Marvel being greedy and boasting about the next phase of Marvel movies,so we know who is safe, so Ultrons mission seems a little too futile.<br/><br/>Where the humour in the first film was refreshing and went with the characters psyche, here it suffers the same as Thor: The Dark World Did, just too forced and unbelievable. Gone is Starks Sarcasm, Cap's future fear, and the general banter.<br/><br/>But it's still spectacular in places, the Hulkbuster Vs. Hulk battle is the highlight, bonkers and very funny, Spader channels Downey Jr. As Ultron, Frankensteins Monster to Starks Victor, and he is a perfect choice.<br/><br/>But the highlight of the film is Remmer, he really outshines the rest of the cast, the. It's human character in the film, and it's genuinely touching when he's with his family,showing a very vulnerable side to the Avengers.<br/><br/>Olsen is the best out of the newcomers, Johnson is okay, but his 'I bet you didn't see that coming' grates toward the end.<br/><br/>So all in all, it's a crushing disappointment for such an impressive franchise, major characters are sidelined, Jackson shows up like Schwarzennegar in the avengers, and friends pop up for no good reason from other Marvel movies.<br/><br/>It feels like one long build up for Civil War, which does sound impressive.<br/><br/>But then again this sounded wonderful.<br/><br/>Meh-vengers, if you would....."

","Me and my family watched a last full show of this film. We were in high spirits though it was already late. I have high expectations for this film since I really enjoyed the first Avengers film A LOT ( it never failed to entertain even after several viewing thru DVD). Oh gosh, I really have to force myself to enjoy this 2nd installment. I was looking for the same charm, the same heart, the same fluidity, that the first film had offered. I got bored of cheesy lines meant to be funny and somewhat ""forced"" attraction between Natasha and Bruce. The special effects are good which kept me awake though. Unlike the first one, I am not buying a DVD version of this one."

There are indeed very nice special effects, you can't tell the difference from the real stuff. However, this film has absolutely nothing else to give.<br/><br/>When will Marvel learn to make a good movie? This is even worse than Iron Man 3, can you believe it?

","First of all, this movie is the wost so far. Of course it's completely accurate to the ""great Marvel system of humor"", but it sucks. Lets's dig into it all.<br/><br/>1). Epic slow-motion. Seriously. Enough of it. Please. Being as boring as it is, this movie actually could have included some ""quick- time events"". Really, game pads could have saved it.<br/><br/>2). Dialogs. Oh, my G-d! I felt almost confused! The lines.. they're not just terribly lame and stupid, the're pointless! The jokes are... well, they're awful. The movie is pg 13, and it absolutely does't have any chance to beat any humor score with jokes like ""Watch your language!"". <br/><br/>3). Ruined characters. This movie continues the awful tradition of the Iron Man 3 movie - Tony Stark is in a state of permanent hysterics, but here it has a different angle - building Terminators. No matter the cost. The carefully and perfectly (in a close-to-comic book style) introduced by John Favreau image of Iron Man\Tony Stark is blown to pieces. The other members of the ""team"" are also terrible. Somehow black Widow and Hulk are in a stupid out of nowhere involvement, Hawkeye has a family (which stays on screen for painfully long 15 minutes), Thor has no idea where's Jane, but can find his friend-professor just instantly etc. etc.<br/><br/>4). Terrible lack timing for characters. War machine has about 8 seconds of action and than is ""ordered"" by stark to attend the evacuation - that is compared to, well, like 5 minutes of screen time for Hawkeye's wife, Some people screaming and running, Some woman and her child etc. etc. <br/><br/>5). Thins movie isn't - a. a movie at all; b. they didn't even try to create in a way to please COMIC-BOOK fans. Seriously! This movie is a mixture of awful approaches on the iconic characters. I won't even speak about the putting-him-out-of -story for one of them!<br/><br/>To conclude, I just want to say that the movie isn't worth watching. All the action sequence - you can get via trailers and released character scenes (as for the character of Vision for example). The rest of the movie - is stupid talk and pointless bad acting.

","With a mountain of expectations this movie went to the floors and pulled off something very few movies are able to. In fact, IMHO, none of the movies so far, has done it as brilliantly as Avengers AOU.<br/><br/>One thing which I liked the most about the movie was that it involved a bit of story to every single thing happening and was narrated in beautiful as well as very convincing manner. Nothing was defying logic or didn't make sense. Although Hollywood writers have a very good hand at developing a convincing plot to their story, Avengers AOU took it to another level. <br/><br/>Visually the movie scores more than 10 on 10. Some really great graphics work has been accomplished at Marvel Studios last year and early this year. You can see this in the 141 minute entertainer. The Scarlett Johansson bike scene distinctly reminds you of Carrie-Anne Moss Ducati chase of Matrix Reloaded. <br/><br/>The acting has been beyond expectations and none of the actors disappoint, irrespective of the screen time they get. Like the earlier version, the movie is able to give justice to each and every super hero, be it in terms of importance given in the story or the screen time. As some of the leaked reports would have already told, the epic battle between Iron Man and Hulk is worth waiting for and is spectacular. <br/><br/>At the end, ,just like Fast and Furious 6 left everyone waiting for FF7, Avengers - AOU keeps you waiting for Avengers 3. Just hope it doesn't disappoint like FF7 did, because the standards set by AOU is very very high."
"addy-25182","5","47","98","2 May 2015"," My hopes have been crushed
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>I was so disappointed with Age of Ultron. As a hardcore fan of everything superhero related, I was simply appalled by the movie. Don't get me wrong the action was phenomenal, who doesn't love watching your favourite superheroes team up and beat the bad guy? Unfortunately with a subpar plot and one too many puns, the story becomes increasingly ridiculous as you sit there wondering whats so good about this movie.<br/><br/>The first thing that will stand out is the fact that Black Widow and Bruce Banner are a thing. If you don't recall from the first avengers, Hawkeye and Black Widow had a very strong connection that went past friendship. That seemed to have been forgotten in this movie because randomly Hawkeye has a family with a wife, two kids and another one on the way. What? Black Widow is even willing to run away with Bruce and skip out on the fight with Ultron. Say what? Since when has Widow ever wanted to miss a fight? Clearly something's wrong and it's more than love.<br/><br/>Secondly, what was the point of Nick Fury? He shows up to give some sort of empowering speech to Tony that'll give him the confidence to go destroy Ultron and points out Widows and Banners relationship. Where does he find all the people to run the helicarrier and how does he get it working so fast? Did he know that Ultron was going to lift an entire city off the ground? Where were those mini helicarriers in the first movie? That would've been helpful during the battle of New York.<br/><br/>Thirdly, since when can super villains sneak up on everyone? Scarlett Witch was able to mind control everyone present in the old ship except for Hawkeye of all people? Not even Captian America who can somehow destroy an Ultron bot with one punch without even turning around got mind controlled by her. Even Thor got hit. What was the purpose of seeing everyone's fears and regrets? Speaking of which, how come Thor can suddenly see into the future by swimming in a magic pond and how come the Doctor knows where it is?<br/><br/>One of the things that will bother me to no end is that fact that Iron Man beat Hulk in a one on one battle. There is no way in any possible circumstance that Iron Man can beat Hulk. Why couldn't hulk rip tony out of the suit? If all it takes to subdue the Hulk is to beat him up, why bother calming him down? The angrier Hulk is, the stronger he gets but I guess that doesn't apply in these movies.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to talk about Vision lifting Thor's hammer.<br/><br/>Finally, the one thing that makes this movie worse than the original is the fact that it didn't seem as world threatening as the first movie. Ultrons plan was to lift up a whole city and throw it back down to earth. Loki planned in invading the earth and had a whole army to do it. The only reason why the Avengers won there was because Iron Man threw a nuke at them. Not once was there a point where I felt like the Avengers was going to lose. Ultron wasn't a challenge for them, I doubt they needed all the Avengers to beat him. They never really had a down moment and all their arguments were pointless. I'd feel stupid too if I got beaten by two kids with no fighting experience.<br/><br/>There were barely any awe inspiring, edge of the seat moments where I thought ""wow I can't believe this is happening!"" Not to mention they defeated Ultron way too easily. Why even introduce Quicksilver and portray him as an important character if he's just going to be killed at the end?<br/><br/>Overall, Age of Ultron is a good movie if you're into all the flashy action and CGI but it's story is filled with plot holes and plain nonsense. Hopefully the next Avengers movie will be better but I'm not getting my hopes up."
"orangejgarrett","9","33","66","30 April 2015"," Redefining the word Avenging
","If, and, where The Avengers failed to captivate audiences, The Avengers Age of Ultron succeed, and in may ways excelled. There are numerous ways that this movie could be reviewed. Compared to the first one, or as an individual movie itself. Generally second movies have always fallen prey to the sequel syndrome, where the hopes and expectations of the film are let down; this is not that sequel. The movie itself is so gripping of excitement that one does not need to provide any spoilers to divulge just how breathtaking it will leave you, or more so excited. Each and every scene offers something new. Where the first movie was more about how the Avengers come to be, this movie shows the mentality and development of each character and why they are who they are respectively. The one thing that genuinely makes this film stand apart is the technology. Again, without spoiling, there are so many parts that make this a world that can be, but has yet to happen. Alien technology aside, which is a hard thing when talking about the Avengers, the human tech has been beefed up in a very realistic and futuristic way. Each and every fight scene gets better and better throughout the movie, and the characters themselves make the movie. So many laughs, so many twist, many where the action was less than a second beforehand, and you are still asking how and why, but there is no time to think. That is not an issue though, it all gets explained. The cause for a 9 rating instead of a perfect 10 is that there are some gaps. Questions of how he or she got there so fast, almost making it look like they teleported, but that was not the case. Overall, Avengers Age of Ultron is thus far the best action movie of 2015, and with respects to Marvel, the best franchise movie yet. What the future holds for Marvel has yet to be revealed, but there are clues. When the next movie is released, the battle to save the earth, to save mankind, will need more heroes than the ones that have already captivated the theatrical world."
"engrymfilm","10","48","101","17 April 2015"," And I'm sitting here wishing this liberal masterpiece wasn't over!
","Where to start? First of all, Mrs. Joss Whedon you've done it again! I've been following this sh'man's work since Buffy and I still can't believe how consistently great, elegant, poetic, graceful, romantic, feminine yet hard, brutal, no holds barred, slamming, thrusting, dominating and masculating sh'is material has been. I come from a long line of men and women in my family and growing up around a strong female character such as my mother and a submissive yet nice guy character as my Dad, I came into my own character... I mean identity early in life. I understood immediately how a relationship between a man and a woman works and so began my long, hard, soft and wet foray into the more tasteful and equal parts of the artistic world in such mediums as cinema (or ""Kino"" for all you Krauts!), music, books, paintings, graphic novels, bicycles, cats and ethnic food. <br/><br/>This path eventually led me to the works of Joss Whedon. And this Whoa-Man (as in he's such a good writer it makes you go ""WHOA, MAN!"" but it's also a pun of the word woman because that's his favorite word) has taken the helm of Marvel's ultimate team of Superheroes: The Avengers! So here's the deal: How does Whedon write such strong female characters? You have Black Widow and let's be honest, even though her screen time and salary is a fraction of her male co-stars she still kicks ass as in the woman can really fight! But wait, it doesn't end there because we're introduced to Scarlet Witch and guess what? she kicks ass, too in her collected 10 minutes of screen time! she has strong, telekinetic, female character powers. And let's not forget S.H.I.E.L.D Agent Maria Hill who only has a combined screen time of maybe 5 minutes in a 140 minute movie but you know what? when she shows up, she kicks ass! There's so much girl power in this movie that you instantly forget that the rest of the characters taking up a majority of the film's running time are male. But we have a big bad wolf in the film's main villain: Ultron. This pulsing man-machine symbol of the Patriarchy is on a throbbing rampage to destroy the entire world. Typical male, am I right? *owl face. Ultron tears and rips through so many walls, pounding and destroying whatever is spread out in front of him you almost think no one has a chance.<br/><br/>Then something glorious happens in the character of Vision. Like an angel he gracefully enters an opening in the story with such a delicate touch, slow yet careful and with passion and a most extreme sensual connection he helps the Avengers to defeat Ultron. But of course it wouldn't be Whedon if a woman wasn't there to aid him because Scarlet Witch is also a big factor in the big, exploding climax. She absolutely gushes with such power that the combined force of her and Vision opens up a whole new, unlabeled form of partnership that has yet to buzz up in our own society. These characters are the absolute objects of my affection<br/><br/>If you want a definition of Whedon's artistic vision you would be wrong to think it was lumpy, pasty, receding in quality, or sausagely-fingered in its themes as that would be shaming his entire body of work. His career is to define what it is to be a woman and I haven't seen equality like this since the outcome of Roe v Wade. The Bodhi Dharma once said: ""Nobody can give you freedom. Nobody can give you equality or justice or anything. If you're a man, you take it"". I imagine when he put down his writing chopstick afterwards he never would have thought his words would give a natural birth to the baby mind of one Joss Whedon.

","Nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>Hollywood was out of idead, until Marvel became company with Disney and created a masterplan for a saga containing some of the greatest stories in comicbook-history onto celluloid...a few years ago everyone would have said: ""Impossible to do"".<br/><br/>Now the Infinity-Gauntlet-story gets more and more real, including the Civil-Wars, Ragnarök and more of the most complex comicbook- sagas into ONE big masterplan.<br/><br/>Every other studio tries no to create it's own universe, it revoluted blockbuster-history, and I dare to say it saved cinema for a long time.<br/><br/>AoU is no exception: (I want to exclude spoilers) So many big names, characters and story are meanwhile puzzled to one highly anticipated climax, which becomes reality in a few years.<br/><br/>I'm deeply impressed and say one thing to the Americans, who will see AoU from next week on: The first Avengers was a small French comedy compared to AoU.<br/><br/>It's spectacular, overloaded and FULLY comic-related.<br/><br/>Of course there are plot holes, logical errors etc., that's cinema. But the way HOW the story evolves to a common sense, the way it was planned before, the way fresh characters continue hooking on the Saga-train...there is no comparable example to this.<br/><br/>The MCU and the Infinity-Gauntlet-story has it's place in Cinema- history already.<br/><br/>Of course DC can make it better, there is still improvement-space left.

"Ramascreen","10","32","65","22 April 2015"," The road to hell is paved with good intentions
","AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is simply amazing<br/><br/>When it comes to superhero movies such as this, I always try to look beyond whether or not the adaptation is faithful to the material, because the audiences who'll be watching this movie aren't just comic book nerds, but also some of us who may have been a late bloomer or may have been only fans of just the movies, or still would have to wikipedia things to catch up. And I'm glad that writer/director Joss Whedon has that ability to make his ""Avengers"" movies engaging and inclusive, like an open door inviting everyone to come in instead of saying 'Well, if you don't know what's up, then tough luck.' If you've seen 2012's blockbuster, ""The Avengers"" which showed the rough start of how these individuals tried to work together as a team, well, you'll be glad to know that in the opening sequence of ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" we see them working in harmony as a team, they have a clear plan, everybody's got their job and everybody knows what they're supposed to be doing, Cap is leading, they all have each other's back, the whole sequence is like a well-oiled machine. But because of that, Whedon knows that he has to throw a curve ball, these ""Avengers"" movies are about teamwork, and so as a coach, Whedon has to throw in some kind of challenge that would make or break this team, to see if they could grow through obstacles and at first those obstacles come in the form of the twins: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who had a rough background, a rough upbringing, they're motivated by spite and distrust towards others, which is why when Ultron comes along, they share something in common or so they think.<br/><br/>In the comics, Ultron, as I understand it, was created by Hank Pym, but in Marvel Cinematic Universe, in this movie, Ultron is created by Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) Do you remember the old saying ""The road to hell is paved with good intentions,"" that's the theme that Whedon is going with for this sequel. In the name of peace, Stark and Banner create an artificial intelligence that they hope would help them protect earth from any impending threat. But this A.I. blames humanity for everything, for not being able to reach such targeted peace. Refusing to be Stark's puppet, Ultron manufactures himself, regenerates himself, in other words clones himself into an army of killer robots. In ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron,"" you'll also get to see tension rising between Cap and Stark, at one point it got so bad, you're like ""Whoah, Whedon, save some for the Russos and their 'Civil War' movie, will ya"" but it all boils down to that teamwork again. Taking it upon yourself because you think it's for the greater good VS. talking it out as a team and respecting the collective decision.<br/><br/>The movie is way bigger than the first one, not just in terms of scope or locations, because it's more than just one major city in the United States, it has gone global now, and you can just feel it that the battlegrounds would only go even more colossal from this point on, it expands from one place to a few different places and it's eventually going to be about the whole planet and even outer space, I just can't wait for how much more epic it's going to be in ""Avengers: Infinity War"" movies. But ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" is also bigger in terms of the cast. Whedon had a daunting task of making sure that each of the characters has their moment in the sun. The film's runtime is no longer than 2012's ""The Avengers"" but I think fans will be divided on how they would receive some of the ways Whedon explored the characters in this sequel. The romance between Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Cap vs. Stark, Ultron Vs. Stark, The Vision (Paul Bettany) trying to prove himself worthy of being part of the good guys, the twins and their dilemma, some fans might try to analyze which of those subplots seems forced or balanced and some fans may favor one over the other. But I think fans will be happy to see that Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) gets more story this time around. And I think fans can agree that James Spader as Ultron could not be a more perfect choice. Obviously, this is not the first movie in the history of cinema to introduce a killer robot, but Spader infuses his charisma, his commanding voice, he's so articulate, he can persuade, influence, and convince you, this Ultron makes such a strong case, a strong argument, you can't help but somewhat agree with him to a certain level and I don't think anybody other than Spader could've better delivered that.<br/><br/>Is ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" as equally spectacular as 2012's ""The Avengers?"" Not quite, but it's still an amazing feat nonetheless. It's got outstanding VFX, really cool cinematic set pieces and awesome cinematography that make this team look and move seamlessly like a work of art. It's a great blend of visual and story. It's action-packed and it's fun. The tone is way darker than the first movie but it's still got tons of that Whedon's sense of humor. If you're invested in the comic books, or if you're invested in only the previous Marvel movies leading up to this, you will all get catered to. ""Avengers: Age Of Ultron"" is one of this summer's most anticipated movies and it lives up to it.<br/><br/>Please read more at Ramascreen.Com"
"pensacolacomputer","7","92","209","2 May 2015"," How is this movie an 8.0, when most reviews are bad?? How is that even possible??
","For those of us who were disappointed with this movie, and judging by most of the reviewers here (who are not fake), a lot of us were disappointed I was semi entertained but to me being marginally entertained is NOT good enough for a movie of this caliber that costs 1/4 of a billion dollars to make!<br/><br/>I guess I expected more from this movie. The trailer made it seem like it was going to be a home run but this barely got to first base. This was more like the last transformers movie, mindless, stupid action that catered to 15 year olds. The script was bad, WAY TOO MANY one liners(most were not funny at all), way too many characters and not enough explanation, and that's just the start of it, I could go on and on. This was just an overall disappointment that certainly should not be a 8.0, not even close. Even most of the reviewers here that gave it a 8, 9, or 10 complained in their review about a lot of things. And they still gave it a very high score? Doesn't make sense, so I am doing the only thing I can which to to tell all my friends how horrible this movie was and never purchase the DVD.<br/><br/>Sorry Marvel and Disney but you better start doing a whole lot better or you will not be getting any more money from me! The people have spoken, we expect better next time!!"
"erkucz00","10","40","84","4 May 2015"," Great Movie. Why the Hate?
","Like an idiot, I took what I read on the internet about this movie to be true. I went to the theater with rather low expectations, only to have my mind blown by the cinematic masterpiece that was Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>For starters, the acting was great. The Avengers were great as usual, and Jeremy Renner showed a different side of Clint Barton. And then there's Ultron, played by James Spader. I knew he'd be good, but my word! Someone give that man an Oscar! Even with the CGI motion capture, Ultron's character was at the same time incredibly robotic, and amazingly human. As a side note, Andy Serkis also did very well as klaw, despite the fact he only had a few scenes. <br/><br/>There's also the thing that most people went to the theater to see. The action scenes. All of the avengers powers were well showcased. Especially Quicksilver's in the slo-mo parts. The battles were filled with numerous ""Holy Crap!"" moments. If you stumble upon the message board post calling the fighting predictable, ignore it.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this was a fun movie. Don't get me wrong, I love a good Nolan film, and the daredevil show is one of my faveorites, but thismovie was just fun to watch. It's 2.5 hour run time wasn't exhausting, and the playful humor never got old. <br/><br/>If you are looking for a gritty, pulpy film full of mystery and political intruigue, this isn't for you. However, if you want a well made film that captures the spirit of the avengers comics, and leaves you feeling satisfied, this is for you."
"apstylianou","7","40","84","30 April 2015"," The best film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far (spoiler free)
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is exactly what I wanted it to be, a fine sequel with solid pacing, directing, acting, eye gouging special effects and awesome action sequences. Before going to see this film, I looked back to the greatest movie sequels ever to make a comparison, Terminator 2, The Empire Strikes Back, The Dark Knight, (I haven't seen The Godfather Part II yet), and Avengers: Age of Ultron is definitely on the same level as all of those films. My favourite film in the MCU was undeniably Guardians of the Galaxy, but I gotta say that AOU is the best Marvel movie ever since GOTG.<br/><br/>The cast did a fantastic job, and I literally mean each and every one of them. Robert Downey, Jr. threw it down, Chris Evans is there shining in his well-acted portrayal as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth is at his very best, Scarlett Johanson is also at her very badass best (and quite flirtatious as well I might add), Mark Ruffalo was amazing as Bruce Banner/Hulk, but Jeremy Renner stood out to me on top of all of the team. He's not my favourite Avenger, but Hawkeye was at first to me the least important guy on the team, and I thought that because he had a lack of character development in the first Avengers, but now they've done a terrific improvement on his character and they have developed him much better this time with quite an emotional core and some very good one-liners.<br/><br/>The newcomers, I can say, without hesitation, the same for as well. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron-Taylor Johnson did a brilliant job as the two mutant twins. I do think that Evan Peters was a better version of Quicksilver when he played him in X-Men: Days of Future Past. Paul Bettany as the Vision was a show-stealer as well and he offered us his best in a well directed superhero movie. However, the newcomers all pale in comparison to James Spader's Ultron. I can see now why the cast and crew applauded him for his performance. Ultron was the real show stealer of the film and probably the best villain in the MCU and he is definitely up there with the greatest movie villains of all time, even reaching the same level as The Joker and Darth Vader. Whenever he's on screen, the movie sets the dark mood.<br/><br/>So all in all, this is one of my favourite superhero movies ever and better than the first Avengers film in my opinion. It has a well placed focus on the title characters, the Avengers and Ultron, and after that, it has an awesome set up to Phase 3.<br/><br/>My one problem with it is that the film wasn't as dark as the trailers suggested it would be. I just think that there should've been a little more to set the mood. It definitely does set the mood as dark as it was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, I will say that.<br/><br/>Still, I strongly recommend you see this one. Do not miss it."
"moviexclusive","7","31","63","22 April 2015"," In character and theme much darker and more complex a sequel than its predecessor, Joss Whedon creates yet another immensely satisfying Avengers chapter
","If the first 'Avengers' movie was about building the team, then this one is about tearing them apart.<br/><br/>If you've read the books, you'll know that Ultron's foremost purpose is to put the Avengers in the ground – which in writer-director Joss Whedon's interpretation, becomes a symbol of grand irony. After all, Ultron was Tony's idea of creating an artificial intelligence which could protect mankind and so make the Avengers obsolete, a project which he happened to be working in secret with Bruce and his personal A.I. assistant Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany). Unfortunately for him, Ultron has taken the obsoletion of the Avengers quite literally, and determined for himself that the only way for mankind to survive is for it to be annihilated and thereby given a chance to evolve.<br/><br/>That the Avengers will face Ultron and his army of replicas is a given, but what truly surprises is the twisty character-driven narrative which Whedon weaves to get to that jaw-dropping finale. You would already have heard of the high-profile additions Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), a pair of tightly-knit Eastern European siblings whose powers of speed and mind control respectively lend their reference here as ""enhancements"" – and besides Ultron, the brother-and-sister pair become the most formidable threat to the Avengers, in particular the latter's psychic powers which she uses on Captain America, Black Widow and Thor to trigger memories of their past and face their personal demons. <br/><br/>While their visions leave them distracted and unsettled, the rest of the team are also forced to confront their own fears. Tony's hubris, once the driving force of his pioneering spirit, could very well be the end of the Avengers and the destruction of everything he's tried to build. Bruce loathes his alter-ego, but recognises that his powers are still a valuable addition to the team, especially in protecting Black Widow, with whom he shares a deepening romantic interest hinted at in the last movie. And freed from the shackles of Loki's spell, Hawkeye is reminded of his mortality as one with no special powers or metal suit other than being an excellent archer, beautifully portrayed in a sojourn at the halfway mark that he makes to his 'safe house' to visit his wife and kids along with the rest of his teammates to recuperate and re-group.<br/><br/>It is no small feat juggling so many characters in the same movie, and yet again, Whedon has pulled it off stunningly. Even though each is part of a larger team, no one fades into it; instead, Whedon lets us get to know each and every one of the Avengers intimately, so much so that you won't feel that you know them any less than you would if they each had their own standalone movie. And out of that character emphasis comes some lovely human moments that make this more soulful and poignant than its predecessor – how Black Widow coaxes the Hulk back into human form, that Hawkeye is an All- American family man when not on superhero duty, why Ultron is really Tony's darkest side in the flesh (or metal) gone amok, and fundamentally the burdens that each one of our superheroes carry as a consequence of their powers.<br/><br/>Besides Ultron, Whedon refuses to define any of the characters as ""good"" or ""bad""; rather, he identifies and illustrates their drives and impulses – whether is it Tony's phobia or Captain America's old- fashioned sense of duty or even Ultron's Oedipal grudge – and uses that to propel the story forward. This is ultimately how the team falls apart, going from the joviality of Thor's favourite party trick (otherwise known as ""who is fit to lift the hammer"") at the start to the infighting later on over Tony's plan to create yet another superior A.I. to defeat Ultron – which ends up in the birth of the red-faced android named Vision (Bettany in the flesh). It is also how Whedon plots the reconciliation of the Avengers with their apparent arch-nemeses Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, no doubt laying the foundation for the next phase of the Avengers programme – and the next two-parter instalment due three years later.<br/><br/>Only when it comes to matching the sheer jaw-dropping spectacle of its predecessor does this sequel become a victim of its own success. Despite hopscotching across the globe from Europe to Africa to Asia and back (culminating in the fictional East European country of Sokovia where it started), Whedon never quite achieves the same feeling of 'wow' that we had watching Loki take out S.H.I.E.L.D's airborne headquarters or unleash hell from the sky onto New York City. Whedon manage to replicate that feeling of astoundment in the much- anticipated Hulk-versus-Hulkbuster sequence, but the next to follow set in and around downtown Seoul is a major disappointment for blurry CGI and bad continuity. And though he tries to replicate the exhilaration watching the whole Avengers fighting together as an entire team, Whedon doesn't quite get our hearts leaping during the final standoff against hordes of replica Ultrons. <br/><br/>If the finale lacks the emotional payoff of the first movie, that's also because Whedon had set himself up with a near impossible task in the first place. That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-lous."
"stephendaxter","9","37","77","22 April 2015"," A fun, comedic and action packed film that lived up to all expectations
","Avengers Age of Ultron was one of the biggest and most anticipated movies of the year and it did not disappoint. This movie was everything you want an avengers movie to be, a near perfect blend between Action, Comedy, and character development. I felt that they handled the large cast fairly well with each of the avengers getting a good amount of screen time. But it isn't just the individual characters that makes it so entertaining, it is the chemistry between the characters that works so well. All of the subplots and jokes that they carry throughout the film stay interesting and really elevate the film. The comedy is exactly what you expect from an avengers film, the back and forth jokes work to really lighten the mood and give it that Marvel film feel, even Ultron sneaks a few jokes in a couple of times.Now let's talk about the action, this film had plenty of action sequences from start to finish and they are just so fun and exciting and you are on the edge of your seat at all times. The way the film finds ways to capture all these characters fighting at the same time in a way so that you can see everything that happens is amazing. <br/><br/>Ultron was definitely an awesome villain and maybe the strongest and best villain the Marvel universe has seen so far. He is so evil that when he is on screen you feel his presence and how intimidating he is. He really adds a lot to the plot and makes the film so much more entertaining in both the action scenes and plot driven scenes. Speaking of the plot, the subplots I thought all worked really well and the main plot for the most part was really interesting. I just thought that the first half of the film felt a little messy as it tried to setup Ultron and some other characters while trying to still include the characters we have known so far. The jumping between locations and all that could have been refined a little better, but they did what they had to do within the runtime. But that is the only issue I had with the film and a minor one at that. Everything else gelled together so well and created one of the best (and my favourite) movies of the year so far. If you love Marvel films and action films in general I believe you will love this fun, action packed film. - 9.5"

","Age of Ultron is a tiresome flick. The characters are the same as expected but Iron Man has become more snobbish and self centered. The character has gone over the top with his abilities to the point where the writers of the script give him carte blanche which makes Tony Stark in to an annoying 4 yr old.<br/><br/>The Hulk is better CG, which is a good thing, but now he isn't the same Bruce Banner who has uncontrolled rage and then forgets every thing he did while as The Hulk. The writers have had to change his character because, uncontrolled, he becomes a loose canon. You can't give him any real dialog. Which ruins the character for me because I grew up with him being this blind rage of power going off to smash puny bad guys while saving good people who are scared of him.<br/><br/>Marvel has become this lack luster pile of poop which is pushing out crappy movie after crappy movie to cash in on the popularity of comic book characters. This has caused movies like Age of Ultron to stink.<br/><br/>There are some serious plot holes in the script but I'm not going to dwell on it. With out them the movie is still sub-par. The supporting cast is pushed through the movie like a scrap meat being put through a grinder.<br/><br/>Captain America is flat. Barton is a worthless character. Black Widow is only eye candy. Thor is Thor, I honestly don't think they could screw him up. Nick Fury is... terrible. This Vision is too limited. <br/><br/>The creators of these movies keep trying to cram too much in to the story when it took dozens of issues to build up just one character. Too much is lost on The Vision and his backstory by shoving him in to the final ten minutes of the movie as a escape for the writers.<br/><br/>I watched Age of Ultron on Amazon and it took less than five minutes of the movie to make me want to start fast forwarding. I'm glad I didn't pay top dollar to see this in the theater. It wouldn't have been worth the money."
"dreamworkswb01","3","47","101","25 April 2015"," Why do artists destroy their own great creations. Avengers was a team we admired so much. The sequel is a heart-breaking disappointment
","There are more than a few problems with this new Avengers movie. I don't know where to start. For beginning, there was no need to extend the film so long. There were many useless scenes that could have been avoided for good. After watching such a long movie, you expect to see some big thing happening in the end. I'm sorry I kept on waiting for that big thing but it never came. In the first film, it was Iron Man saving the city from a nuke that was a big thing, which ended the movie. This brings me to the next problem, you just can't say where actually the Avengers finished their job. It seems that the director did not sleep enough when he was finishing the last 10 minutes of the movie. Last then minutes were more devoted to the sequel of this sequel. Some people here say that Avengers 2 is better than Avengers 1, but I don't find any reason behind that. There were dialogs in Avengers one that inspired us and made us love the team. Rather in this movie, Nick Fury's role was diluted. There was creativity in the fighting scenes of the first movie, but fighting scenes of this movie were mostly boring, except for one scene. Avengers 2 had burden of our great expectations but it was not even near to the first one. You will not find amazing dialogs like ""I'm always angry"", ""I didn't argue with the god that did"", ""puny god"". If you are coming to see Hulk play an interesting role, stay home. The movie is overly burdened with emotional dialogs and sermons. It pains to see one of my all-time favorite movies have a sequel like this."

After the battle we get introduced to the one and only Ulton voiced by the amazing James Spader who did an amazing job with the character making him menacing and intimidating. My favorite hero in this movie had to be Scarlet Witch who's powers were amazing to watch especially in 3D. The movie was definitely darker toned than the last Avengers which made it even more enjoyable to see something different in a Marvel movie. Part of me wishes we were able to see the flacon in the final battle. Speaking of the final battle, I loved what they did with the final battle stage. It was definitely different than most final battle stages in a Marvel movie."

","First, I would like to thank the all-star cast for coming together to make ""The Avengers"" movies possible. They do a great job of being comfortable enough around each other to make the comedic banter between characters lively, amusing, and believable.<br/><br/>I have read many reviews complaining about the storyline and Ultron himself. Do not let these discourage you from the film, especially if you like the actors involved. I feel like anyone who is overly-critical or flat out dislikes this movie must have something against the actors chosen to portray the roles of the Avengers. It is too bad some people aren't fond of the actors, but I cannot understand why. These are A-List actors/actresses that America loves for their numerous critically-acclaimed performances beforehand.<br/><br/>This movie may contain my favorite Stan Lee cameo of all the Marvel movies. I love that he does these religiously, and I look forward to seeing him in many more!!! My advice for approaching this film is to do so with a light heart and open mind. You will find yourself laughing along in each and every scene, and quoting the witty humor to your friends later."
"siderite","8","23","45","21 August 2015"," Action followed by action then, surprisingly, some character development. Then some more action.
","So everybody must be asking now: ""Is it worth watching more than two hours of this just to get to the obligatory Thanos end credits scene?"" and the answer is... yes. Besides making fun of War Machine - again - and completely ignoring characters like Pepper Potts and Falcon, there was nothing that bothered me tremendously about this film. Keep in mind that it is a comic book film with superheros that dress funny, though.<br/><br/>The villain is pretty menacing, the interaction between the Avengers goes well beyond killing enemies in each other's blind spot and the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver addition was interesting, though kind of condescending. I mean, if they want to ban Tin-tin cartoons for racist depictions of African people, they should stop at one moment or another inventing countries with Slavic names and filling them with helpless women and children with names just as ridiculous and toy soldier police and army forces. I am just saying.<br/><br/>What I thought was better than I was expecting from an Avengers movie were the underlying character stories. Thanks to Scarlet Witch we see bits of our heros' histories, we get to know Hawkeye a little better and understand his role in a team of superpowered individuals, he see the romantic side of Black Widow and the Hulk... yes, you read that right... and we get to see Captain America and Tony Stark having ideological arguments that divide the team. Of course, they carry them with vibranium shield throws and energy beams, like men do... don't they?<br/><br/>I loved the character of The Vision, a freak hybrid between a servile AI and a full psycho AI, holding the power of an Infinity Stone and having a 3D printed body that is half alive, half vibranium. I share his view of humanity as queer pets that you have to enjoy during their short life.<br/><br/>What I didn't like is that they upped the ante of what the Avengers can do, just because they could. In the end this diminished the level of empathy that one can feel for superhumans like that and removed from the quality of storytelling. Also, another film in which artificial intelligence builds bodies and kills people. Why would it? Ultron's motivation was completely unexplored and his philosophy and references to Pinocchio made no sense at all. OK, it was meant to be insane, but even insanity has purpose and sense. Overall, I think the biggest problem with the film was that it had too much of a budget.<br/><br/>Bottom line: brainless fun, but fun nonetheless. Less humor than expected, with Ultron teasing an interesting character with his jokes, but then devolving to a classic villain in the sea of special effects that filled most of the movie. You get to know the Avengers more, as well, which was nice."

"atlihafsteinsson","6","38","80","20 July 2015"," Very disjointed
","What bothers me most about Age of Ultron is that it can't decide on what kind of tone it wants to set. Some of the old Marvel spirit that balances fun with character arcs and themes is struck here, but a lot of the time, this film is just depressing too. The themes get quite dark, almost DC dark at times, and that worries me, 'cause I think the Marvel movies have done a better job with the whole comic-book movie thing than DC have. Hope this is not a sign of things to come.<br/><br/>Furthermore, all plot and character development seems to have been thrown out the window. The first Avengers worked because it was the perfect melting pot for all of these characters' stories and character development at the time. Captain America was still getting used to life in the 21st century, and of course Loki and Thor's story was in direct continuation to the movie Thor. In Age of Ultron, the same attempt at character and story unity is just messy. I thought Steve Rogers (and Falcon) was going to search for Bucky Barnes, did he just put that on hold? On the whole, the Cap was underused in this movie, as was Thor (my two faves). And the whole romance thing with Natasha and Bruce only works because of the wonderful performances by Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo. These characters have never shown the slightest bit of chemistry together before, now suddenly we're told that they have a crush on each other. After a movie where the Cap and Romanoff had a lot of chemistry together. Sure.<br/><br/>Also, maybe it's just me, but I just didn't care as much about the fictional city, because, well, it's fictional. We've already established that these characters live in a world tangent to our own, and Loki's invasion on Manhattan felt far more visceral to the audience 'cause we could relate to it. Not setting the final battle in an actual Eastern European location really damaged my investment in it. I really, really like Ultron as a character, though, and his personality kept me excited. But how he and Jarvis were connected might've gone over the heads of many in the audience.<br/><br/>You will not walk away from this film all energized like after the first Avengers. Instead, you'll feel like this is the end of an era. Pros to Elizabeth Olsen for a great character, but as a Marvel movie, Age of Ultron is messy to say the least."

","If you want any more proof that illegal downloading has killed the film industry, here it is ladies and gents. This movie was made for the sole purpose of selling seats in cinemas, plain and simple. <br/><br/>The Avengers -Age of Ultron appeals to everyone; loads of CGI, loads of action, loads of recycled one-liners, loads of superheroes. So if that's what you and the family need, then spend your $23.50 a ticket and head on down. But just let it be known, at no point does this movie attempt to go outside the Marvel 'formula' to present its own identity. <br/><br/>To be blunt, this movie insulted me. And it should insult the intelligence of anyone over the age of 18. It's dribble. Flashy lights for the simple-minded. It'll leave you feeling like you've just been sold something you've bought 100 times before. It's the same movie, just a different name. <br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"MrDHWong","9","25","50","15 October 2015"," Action-packed, dramatic and funny in all the right places.
","Avengers: The Age of Ultron is the sequel to the fourth highest grossing movie of all time. At the risk of over-hyping it any more, I can say it's probably the best Marvel movie to date. It manages to be action-packed, dramatic and even very funny in all the right places.<br/><br/>After the Avengers lead a successful raid against a Hydra outpost, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr) revives his secret peacekeeping program Ultron (voiced by James Spader) to help safeguard the planet from evil. However, Ultron interprets the idea of keeping Earth safe as a need to eradicate humankind from existence. Ultron shortly escapes from Stark's laboratory to act out its mission and it's up to the Avengers, along with their new allies, the twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to stop Ultron from carrying out this genocidal act.<br/><br/>Even though it is darker than the first film, Avengers: The Age of Ultron is still able to capture the charm and humour from its main characters that we have grown to love over the years. Tony Stark is still as witty as ever, delivering his trademark hilarious one-liners and Hawkeye's (Jeremy Renner) scenes have some of the most poignant moments in any Marvel film. But perhaps the biggest surprise were the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who played a much more important role than I thought they would. There's rarely a dull moment.<br/><br/>I rate it 9/10, a bit higher than its predecessor, which I rated 8.5/10."
"amandacarleyis","1","36","76","20 July 2015"," I nearly fell asleep
","I loved the first Avengers, I thought it was well-casted, well-paced and overall a very enjoyable film. This movie really disappointed me. It felt rushed, inconsistent and worst of all: way too long!<br/><br/>The first complaint I have is the forced romance between Black Widow and The Hulk. DId anybody else think that felt so unnecessary? Especially after watching the endless flirting between her and Captain America in Winter Solider? Very inconsistent, and frankly added nothing to the movie.<br/><br/>My next complaint is the Scarlet Witch. Talk about nepotism at its finest. This character is so mis-cast any other actress on the planet could have done a better job. Her accent was on and off, and at some point she was channeling the matrix with her forced acting, which is a shame considering Quicksilver was great.<br/><br/>The movie had terrible pacing. The opening scene made no sense, and was barely explained. How did the Hydra outpost have possession of the scepter? It was so rushed it was very easy to get lost. It picks up with over-done CGI sequences, then slows down with the cast chopping wood and trying to life Thor's hammer. The plot pacing made no sense at all, and the result was a dragged-out, almost 3-hour long mess.<br/><br/>My biggest disappointment with the entire film, however: Ultron. The lamest, most boring and terrible super-villain ever created. In my opinion, Ultron is even lamer than Batman and Robin's Victor Fries. Ultron is the type of villain that could easily be defeated in one 20- minute cartoon episode. Here we have a villain with endless connections and apparently the greatest AI in the world, and all he does is try to blow stuff up. Ultron had the ability to really cause an uncontrollable amount of chaos, and did nothing of the sort. Not to mention there was little to no development given to the character. Why did he hate the Avengers so much? There wasn't even enough time to form a relationship with his creator or any of the Avengers for that matter.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope Infinity War makes an effort to be much better than Age of Ultron. This movie is a total CGI-porno and snooze fest. There are so many more reasons why AOU fell short of it's predecessor, but I won't keep going.<br/><br/>I rarely write bad reviews, but this was a complete and total disappointment."
"Ziya90","1","30","62","20 March 2016"," The director couldn't catch the achievement of the first
","The Avengers Age of Ultron starts out with a soulless and pointless action sequence and the rest of the movie is not much different than this part. Since we don't know our heroes fight for who and why, we don't get excited for the adventure that our heroes have. Then, somehow, the cinematography is lifeless, the technical craftsmanship accomplishment is boring. Everything is too mechanic here. The villain of the movie is an artificial intelligence, again ""mechanic"". Everything about this villain is so cliché from his words to his evil plans to destroy the world, humanity, whatever. In the first movie, almost everything was perfect. This second installment is lack of heart and soul and an exciting adventure. The movie was like an empty roller coaster ride. The action and the fight scenes are uninspiring, lifeless. Everything happens just so quickly and it is overblown. Another thing the movie was lack of is the tension or clash between the allies. What makes the first movie spectacular was the sweet conflicts among the heroes. Returning to Ultron, it was not intimidating, not hilarious like Loki, honestly, it is just a machine! (Terminator fans, please don't be offended, this is a different case) In contrast with the promises by the director, this is not a darker movie. This is a boring action film. For example, adding romance into a movie doesn't make it deeper or sophisticated. Action is soulless and completely forgettable here except for two scenes. The first and the best is Hulk vs. Hulbuster scene which was fairly done. I have seen it dozens of times. The second one is the highway chase with Captain America and Black Widow, but it was like a copy of The Matrix Reloaded and nothing new. From the beginning, I don't like the appearance or the manners of this new Hulk (the first is favorite), but Hulk is OK here. The second half of the movie focuses on destruction like Man of Steel in a bad way. Do you want to hear Iron Man's witty comments? Thor's majesty? Captain America's work discipline? Hulk's anger? None of them is here. Loki? I miss him. Unfortunately, Quicksilver loses the game from the first minute, because we had seen a brilliant Quicksilver before. Scarlett Witch bewitched me, but I just couldn't get warm to her. I hope I will start to love her in future installments. Vision was completely unnecessary. Hulk is not like a gorilla or a fun mascot here which is good, but he is used like a pawn in this movie. Finally, Age of Ultron is sometimes dreadful, sometimes cheesy, sometimes dull, sometimes pretentious and mostly soulless sequel. I am very happy that the next adventures are going to be directed by Russo Brothers who gave us terrific ""The Winter Soldier""."
"griffolyon12","9","30","62","30 April 2015"," Movie Review: ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""
","Lightning rarely strikes twice and that is the first thing you've got to understand about Avengers: Age of Ultron. The Avengers was one of those one of a kind movie-going experiences, and while I don't think Age of Ultron ever tops its predecessor, it is a really awesome movie in its own right. Filled with wall-to-wall action and more probing character exploration, Age of Ultron is what Serenity was to Firefly (pardon the Joss Whedon comparisons, but the guy did write and direct all of the aforementioned films and TV series). Age of Ultron is darker and more serious-minded than The Avengers, and yet there are enough one-liners and awesome comic book panel-worthy moments of mayhem that keep the film entertaining and a fitting kick-off to the Summer of 2015.<br/><br/>In Age of Ultron, Tony Stark creates an artificial intelligence known as Ultron in hopes of being able to establish a peacekeeper for Earth that would make the Avengers obsolete. Of course, as with just about everything Tony Stark seems to touch, things go awry and Ultron takes possession of a series of robotic bodies and believes that the only way to true peace is through evolution, which means the demise of all human life on Earth, especially those pesky Avengers. What follows is this ragtag team that we saw come together in the first film falls apart and then has to rebuild themselves all while duking it out with Ultron and a pair of superpowered twins from Eastern Europe, Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have allied themselves with Ultron.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about Age of Ultron is it further cements the idea that these Marvel movies have really become like one really big TV series that you just have to wait every six months or so for each new episode. These things have very much become a machine with each entry being as impressively put together as the last, and when you couple that with the comfort of seeing characters you know and love reunited and bickering with one another, there is no way on Earth that you cannot enjoy the film.<br/><br/>Seriously, if you are reading this, you're not really wanting a full lowdown because you are already going to see the movie regardless, so what do you really need to know? All you need to know is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is worthy of the Marvel brand. It is entertainment of the highest order with a story that manages to further challenge our heroes and force them to really decide where their priorities lie. While majority of the Marvel heroes did not want to become heroes, they did rise to the challenge when called because of a sense of responsibility, and the way Age of Ultron ends effectively answers the internal question that each of our heroes face. So what are you waiting for, get to the theater and see this movie as many times as you know you're going to see it."

You went to watch action movies to relax your head, that's the reason they were called no-brainers. And here, I don't even know who's who, and who's what, and who's with (or against) who ... I mean, there are waaay too many characters. Also way too much action and too much talk. To sum it all - way too much information. Who (or what) is this Ultron thing? Should I ask them to pause movie in cinema so I could google it up? And if I got his plan right, his goal is to save humanity by destroying Earth? Really? Similar questions for a Paul Bettany's character. Wth is he supposed to be? And, yes I know it's adaptation of comic so I'm not gonna whine about logic (for example who's manufacturing all those mean robots, who I assume are all Ultron at the same time) but ffs ... could anyone start filming again those simple, easy understandable action movies?"

It's up to the Avengers to stop them but he's helped by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson).<br/><br/>This sequel is just terrible. The script is kind of vague in specifics about why Ultron hates humans and the Avengers so much. Also the dialogue here is TERRIBLE! No actor could put over the lines these people are given. So, understandably, almost all the acting is bad. Only Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye) give good performances. Worst of all the three new superheroes--Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision--are very badly introduced and poorly used. Also the movie is far too long at almost 150 minutes and is more boring than exciting. Yes the special effects are flawless and there are a few very exciting and long action sequences but they can't save the movie. At the end the movie takes a disastrous turn and turns in a Transformers like movie! Boring and pointless with bad acting and dialogue. I give it a 5 for the effects and action."

","I expected Age of Ultron to be a worthy sequel to the glorious Avengers.When I went to the cinema I expected to see something impressive and innovative.I was completely wrong.The movie is a complete mess, with pointless filler scenes.Right from the beginning of the movie they showed a combat scene out of nowhere and without ANY explanations whatsoever.They showed Tony using his Iron Man suit when in Iron Man 3 he destroyed all of them.How did Lokis scepter fall into bad guys's hands ? In order to understand it you need to watch the series ''Agents of SHIELD'', witch is completely unacceptable as far as i'm concerned.Later on they show Ultron,Vision, and Scarlet witch whose abilities didn't even explain ! How did they come up with that idea ? Not all people read comics neither watch the series.Take me for example, during the movie i felt so empty which was the last feeling i expected from the movie.Even the finale witch was supposed to be ''epic'' was so anti-climatic and strange.Don't get me wrong, i LOVED the first Avengers movie, however. this one is just a waste of time and money.It is by far the worst movie of 2015 and the worst sequel i have ever watched."
"eight88-2","1","73","169","1 May 2015"," Are you a fan of well characters? If so, then DON'T SEE THIS
","*Spoiler Free* <br/><br/>I just watched Age of Ulrton and I'm still in shock. It was complete trash! I have never been so tempted to start yelling in the movie theatre. Even the guy next to me was sighing in exasperation at the trash packed 2 hours and 21 minutes we suffered through.<br/><br/>It was the equivalent of a very OOC (Out of Character), poorly written and unedited fanfic that I wasn't able to backspace out of.<br/><br/>I am so profoundly disappointed and filled with rage.<br/><br/>I think what makes it even worse is that I recently watched Netflix's Daredevil, which had such rich characters, and then I watched Age of Ulrton and there was no mistaking or excusing the poorly written characters. The movie was bad, but against the memory of Daredevil it was even more of a let down. We had 13 hours of a brilliant story and characters with Daredevil and Age of Ultron couldn't even manage 2 hours and 21 minutes without completing screwing it up. There are brilliant Marvel works out there, but Age of Ultron is not one of them, not even close.<br/><br/>Lesson learned, I will not be watching any other movies that Joss Whedon writes alone. The first Avengers was fantastic, but that was also written with Zak Penn, not just Joss Whedon, so that explains it all I suppose. I grew up watching Buffy (and I still adore Firefly) so of course I wanted to love this movie, but the writing was horrible and I couldn't even slightly like this.<br/><br/>Age of Ulron is the ""Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift"" of the Avengers verse. Let's just pretend this movie didn't happen. We can move past this. The next 2 Avengers movies and ""Captain America: Civil War"" will be written by the some wonderful people that wrote ""Captain American: The Winter Soldier"". Skip this one. Please do not waste your time or money, you will be disappointed."
"drawlife","7","32","68","22 April 2015"," Whedon had an impossible task, but he pulls through and exceeds expectations.
","Soon after the first Avengers film was released, I could not wait for a sequel, and finally it's here, and it's all I could have hoped for. They're back with a few new additions, and finally a worthy(my favorite villain in the comics) foe, Ultron an AI bent on destroying humanity, at the same time putting the team in despair. <br/><br/>I'll start with some of the nitpicks. This is very rare, but I think Age of Ultron could have used an extra 10-15 minutes. Whedon in an interview stated he cut out some back story for the twins, which I think was a mistake, I wasn't particularly fond of them in the beginning, but as the film progressed they grew on me a lot. This time around Whedon brings a butt-load of action, and better action I might add, but while in the first film there were moments that lasted too long to take a breather from the action, in Age of Ultron he doesn't allow us a moment to catch our breath too often, very sporadically. <br/><br/>But, he finds away to keep things interesting. Barely shorter than the first film, it's still a long film regardless and it does not feel like it. This time around Whedon allows The Avengers to be The Avengers. They're together a lot more and their dynamic and relationship is a joy to watch. The original six, Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Johansson, and Renner are all fantastic. Johansson's Black Widow and Renner's Hawkeye in particular have quite an impressive arc in this film and an argument can be made that Hawkeye is the main character, there's also a brilliant, fun tongue in cheek moment he has with Scarlet Witch. Also he got the best lines in the film aside from James Spader who by the way is an excellent villain. <br/><br/>Ultron in this film has a personality. He is a scene stealer and commands the screen every time he's in it. He's got some humor, but I would have liked more menace within him. There are two moments where he became very threatening, and the film could have used a bit more. Although his plan for destruction is quite impactful and quite intimidating, he sorta feels lost, as do some of the characters because the film is so saturated and overstuffed to a degree. <br/><br/>I'd also like to mention that Samuel L. Jackson and Cobie Smulders serve their roles well, but in a populated film like this they're roles are obviously reduced a bit, and to my surprise Don Cheadle's War Machine finally gets some action, despite it being small. <br/><br/>The new additions Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Johnson, and Paul Bettany are solid and only bring extra flare into the film's ingredients. Scarlet Witch is quite well realized, a little more than Quicksilver I might I add, and she is fun to watch and causes some inner damage to the team. Speaking of Quicksilver, Whedon wisely tries not to match or outdo the X-Men Quicksilver, and in doing so he's more grounded and a little more developed than Singer's, who just used him for an impressive sequence. Paul Bettany's Vision is also another scene stealer. He was incredible in the film, and as a last minute surprise he does not disappoint. Vision is arguably one of my favorite characters growing up and Whedon works him into the film the way I'd hope it be. Kudos to Whedon. <br/><br/>I mentioned the action before in my nitpicks, but the action here is top notch and Whedon finds a way to keep you focused. A lot of teamwork is involved in almost every action set piece and you feel what's at stake as the team also takes cue to actually save civilians. It's just a fireworks of action displayed on screen and the scale of it is so very impressive. Hulkbuster vs Hulk in particular is a standout sequence, as does everything that has to do with Vision. But aside from the action, Whedon manages to juggle every single character and somehow make them as relevant as they can be, some obviously more than others, but it's just amazing to see it all unfold. He understands these characters as the heavy moments work well and he never forgets the heroes' humanity. There are also hints to films in the future, but they don't saturate the main plot, but enough to keep you aware. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon had an incredible challenge to make a sequel to the first film. I think one can argue that the novelty wore off a bit because in the first film, it was something that was never been seen before and as it was released it was, and I use the term ""done already,"" and going into this sequel, it won't be able to recapture that magic of the first because ""it's been done already."" <br/><br/>I know I sound like I'm fanboying, and that's because I am(no apologizes), but if you overlook all that, the film is as good as it gets. It's almost impossible to make a movie like this and not have it feel repetitive. Not to mention, it's impossible to have so many characters and have a completely satisfying characterization for all of them, and I think in the hands of another filmmaker who not only writes, but also directs would more or less likely fail. <br/><br/>Joss got the job done, but one can notice corporate meddling was taken place, as it is a big crowd drawing film for everyone. I think the Russo's and the writing team of Markus and McFeely are the prefect candidates to take over the glorious Avenger films. I believe they nail the darker tone a lot better than anyone else. The film has no end-credits stinger, but stick around for the mid-credit scene. It's so good. <br/><br/>7.5/10"
"vikingfan89","4","27","56","18 May 2015"," An action film lacking a story
","With Joss Whedon at the helm, and a slew of big box office draws playing virtually every character, this had the making of the movie of the century. But like the Pacquiao-Mayweather fight that took place on the same night this film premiered, it was anything but. The mythology in this film was poorly explained and detracted from enjoying the movie. The characters did not arc and some of them seemed to acquire new powers or develop new back stories when the plot suited. The film demanded you suspend your disbelief but did not even do the audience the service of putting together a plausible plot line. Even the mega-evil villain of the film was really just a misguided automaton that probably could have seen the error of his ways with a long, frank discussion about his intended course of action. Though the fight sequences were fun and unique, there were too many characters to follow. Without a reason to care about the characters, the audience cannot be expected to care for the outcome, in which case, the film will disappoint."
"liamsofficial","7","27","56","24 April 2015"," Great sequel, not at all disappointing
","This movie was fantastic. Great action sequences, great heroes, great villains, great jokes. All around this was a great sequel. Was it as good as the first Avengers film, yes and its probably even better. Each character is given more time to develop, especially Hawkeye and Bruce Banner/The Hulk who are characters who were not very utilised in the previous film. Also I would say Hawkeye was the character this film focused on the most and nicely tied it together. The new characters Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were also great, and the accents were not at all distracting as others had said. The Vision, was probably the coolest addition to this film and he is introduced in a very cool way and its great that he is now a part of the MCU, Paul Bettany did a great job. Ultron, the villain of this film has been getting a lot of hate. But Ultron was great in this film. he was very human, he had so many different characteristics that made him a great character. Many viewers wanted him to be menacing and scary and that's all, but all that will accomplish is another dull MCU villain. Also the jokes in this film were completely fine. None of them pulled me out of the action, I was completely into the movie this whole time. Nothing made me look away and go, why did they do that? So really just go see this movie, ignore all the haters because this is a great addition to the MCU and you wont be disappointed. Just enjoy it and try not to pick it apart."

A bunch of co(s)mic based super heroes and super villains choose to fight about...something. a bucket of possibilities come into my mind, the world, justice, a city, a nation, whatever. Take what you like. The holy grail of shallow cinema. Well, if this would be everything, we would have been happy with Indiana Jones and all about it for the rest of our humble lives. But Indiana Jones isn't this interwoven into our modern world. We are obliged into value based thinking. Everything is of a certain value. Mixed with strong moral based and ethic principles, so we don't freak out. Our way of living is a modern tale, our ego is of value. And tales, as they were used through all times in history, do emphasize on a certain aspect. They offer a different view on real life circumstances, we cant easily describe else. And this is what The Avengers does. They are the perfect image of our principles, of our lives, how we are supposed to be in order to succeed in our lives, in business, in enterprises, in companies, in public places, at the grocery, at home, in our families, even on the toilet. Serve and protect. Love your next like your beloved brother. And you know this isn't easy, to keep the toilet clean with a brush after using it. So are the Avengers, they are always fighting on screen with uttermost force. And they do cause tremendous havoc. But this is just the image of what is unseen in our real life. Unseen because of the conservative and stodgy chair we took place in. And this movie is a tribute to this injustice. I am able to smile at my children when they play supercherios, marvel & crapman. They do honor me! All of them. And I know it. We are the Marvels. They are our inner heroes. Fighting every day for the good in this world, in all of us.

","Joss Whedon's writing is decent, but if something bothers me, it's the cheap jokes. They are used constantly, and they just are so cheesy and almost forced. Most of the audience loved them though, so maybe that works to some kind of audience.<br/><br/>The structure of the plot was very similar to the first Avengers, though that isn't a surprise. I don't think anyone is expecting a complicated, mind-blowing plot. The story is simple, it's decent. The fight scenes seemed much clearer this time, it was a lot easier to see what was happening and where, and who was involved. I don't know if it was just due to cinematography or effects, or the fact that I was watching a 2D version.<br/><br/>I was kind of hoping more from Ultron. I wanted a character who was actually scary, a villain you couldn't defend. Well, you probably can't really defend Ultron, except for the obvious – him being a robot. But he still seemed too likable. He was kind of too humane, almost funny. James Spader was wonderful though, and his voice alone was enough to make Ultron scary when needed.<br/><br/>The movie had its funny moments, exciting moments, pseudo-deep moments, and the weirdly surprising moments. But why did they need to add romance? It seemed sort of forced.<br/><br/>In short, Avengers Age of Ultron is decent, so don't get your expectations high. But it is worth seeing, otherwise it's hard to keep up with the world in these movies."

Their first appearance in the comic books were in the Uncanny X-Men #4 back in 1963.I felt this was a fantastic move in the right direction for the marvel universe. Fans even got to see the high rise building under construction that was used on the cover of the Fantastic Four # 26 when the FF teamed up with the Avengers to fight the Hulk. So, those seemingly small things put in by marvel put in throughout the movie is the reason some critics rated the movie average as opposed to those who rated it great; many people simply did not understand what was going on in the plot or in the background, hence causing confusion and in some cases even disappointment. Why does marvel do this? Because they are confident telling their stories in their own way. And marvel of course, set up the next Avengers movie by showing a villain a few minutes into the final credits. In closing, I recommend seeing this movie at the theater as soon as possible and maybe even watching it again at a later date to absorb it all."

"kingfishfilmco","10","23","47","18 October 2015"," Incredibly well written
","When I first saw this in the theatre, I thought it was too busy and Spader was a little cartoony. But on first viewing you're always comparing it to the original, so you need a time to step back. Now, I see how well written it is and how the humor really fits perfectly, considering Ultron is Stark's alter ego. I also never really thought much of Scarlett as an actor, but her scene at the beginning with the lullaby really showed an incredible range of emotions in just a small scene with great subtly. All of this is a result of great writing, both in story line and dialog, along with everyone of the actors being first rate. I'm glad to finally see comic book movies reaching the intelligence of their source material. I'm not a comic book geek but a movie lover, so I don't have any of the preconceived prejudices. I could go on and on about all the subtle inferences to modern day terrorism and America's role as the world's bully and hated cop, but I just wanted to give it the positive review it deserves."
"natygance","10","28","59","23 April 2015"," Age of Ultron: AWESOME
","So..Let me start off by saying that,being a huge fan of Avengers and its first movie, I was nervous. Nervous because I wasn't sure about the Twins, whether I would like them or not, and because the first movie was so great that it was hard to picture a better one. Well..I was wrong!!so wrong. This movie is one of those you need to see more than once. The characters are,as usual,amazing, but they've evolved since Avengers and are much,much better. In Avengers it felt that some members of the team were more important than others, in this movie they're all equally awesome in their own ways. The action..THE ACTION, from beginning to end is non-stop, the movie begins and ends with action scenes,one better than the previous one. And lastly, the comic reliefs, I remember laughing plenty in Avengers but in this movie it's one joke after the other and they're all awesome! There were some people who complained about all the sneak peaks,saying that it showed too much, let me tell you,you will encounter a lot of things in the movie that you probably weren't expecting, in a good way. One piece of advice: What Whedon said is true, there is no after- credit scene(I stayed till the end just to be sure)but there is one AMAZING mid- credit scene. So,grab your popcorn and enjoy what will most likely be the best movie of the year!I plan to rewatch it many times."
"billy-94115","1","54","124","1 May 2015"," Another stupid comic book cash grab
","I saw this movie and was appalled. By it's awfulness. It had an overly simple, idiotic plot. The character development was bad. James Spader was one of the most annoying villains of all time. His character is generic and follows the same patten as the last Avengers movie villain; acts like a normal person, but is really tough. My brain hates me for watching this movie, which I didn't want to go see, by the way. This is one of the stupidest movies I've seen this year. The visuals were clearly only there for a 3D movie. The dialog wasn't unique or great in any way. And the romantic chemistry between two characters came out of nowhere and was totally rushed. This movie is the definition of overrated. It's the film equivalent of a guy standing at the corner and asking everyone for their money even though he clearly is rich. Hollywood needs to quit making these superhero movies."

(Night and day in comparison)<br/><br/>Ultron.....was formidable.....but after reading the comics.....and even watching the Avengers Assemble cartoon.....he seemed weak in comparison. Ultron....always seemed nearly indestructible.....and destroyed so much in his path.

Why are you still portraying him as some Ape?? WTF?? The Hulk can talk ya know!? The Recent animations such as Avengers Assemble and Earth Mightiest Heroes have the Hulk and Thor portrayed on point...why can't the live action get it?! Evolve him already....and let the Hulk and Thor Spar and talk crap to each other!!<br/><br/>Anyway....bottom line....the Avengers was solid.......but was it worth the wait after three years? No.....not really. I expected so much more. And I gotta add.......if the Hulk is not in the next Avengers movie for what ever reason.....I am done.

Even though I really liked the characters going into the movie, from very early on the chemistry and charm is completely gone. Maybe I missed or had forgotten something from an earlier MCU movie but it seemed like the story line took a huge unexplained jump forward at the beginning of the movie, a poor start which descended further into overwrought, meaningless, drivel.<br/><br/>So many of what should be crucial scenes are entirely unconvincing, clichéd or ridiculous in a way that's too forced to even be funny."

I was a little worried that it would not live up to the first movie but I must say to me it did. I was able to see more of Black Widow, Hawk, exceptionally Hulk the emotions that he had even when he was not Bruce Banner was a very nice touch. Bringing in Rody was cool too.

","Actually I thought the first avengers was a pretty decent movie. I heard AOU was a little more than ""disappointing"" from several reviewers. Why is the movie even called AGE of Ultron? Ultron has about as little affect upon the world or these characters as a common cold, and his influence lasts little more than the total runtime. Also, no character development. Strange leaps of logic. Generic characters with the same snarky, quip-laden, one-liner-prone personalities. Black Widow suddenly hitting on a man who is old enough to be her father. All, and there were many, the lazily written biblical references put in their in a slopshod attempt to lend some sense of pretentious importance and weight to an otherwise amusement park ride (Ultron says ""on this rock, I will build my church"", on vibranium? that's stupid). Another forgettable villain, another megalomaniac, world-destroying less-than-frightening ""bad guy"" without any gravitas or sensible, relatable motivation. Of all the creepy things on the internet, Ultron latches on to Pinnochio to express his diabolical menace... wat? I can't even... oh yeah, Disney. Also, expendable characters (I could tell *SPOILER* Quickie was gonna die half way through the movie, yet ironically his final line was ""bet you didn't see that coming""). Typical Marvel humor-drenched, drama-draining, suffocating presentation (I mean, *SPOILER* Quicksilver saved Hawkeye's life--like anybody cares about ol' beady-eyed Hawkeye--and Hawkeye just leaves him on the floor, doesn't cover him with a jacket or anything and delivers the brisk and incredibly callow line ""it's been a long day"" while he lies down right next to the guy who gave his life to save him without showing any kind of remorse or thankfulness. Sanctity of life? Out the window).<br/><br/>And worst of all, it's a film without any consequences at all: Tony Stark literally caused the whole movie-event with his (seen it) ""we can therefore we should"" science experiment, and thereby is ultimately responsible for the deaths of tens of thousands of people with the Hulk faceoff and the floating city at the end, and yet he just drives off in his sports car. Stark wasn't defending himself. Stark wasn't thinking about retiring. Stark was acting exactly how this movie wanted him to act: a prop moved along by the ""plot"". So he drives off scott free. What?! Yep. That's it. No turning himself in for crimes against humanity? The man literally lost nothing. If that's not prepubescent, irresponsible, unethical, unrealistic, inconsequential, heartless, predictable, thoughtless storytelling than I don't know what is. This kind of movie is a disturbing trend in popular American culture and I shudder to think that little kids idolize these far from heroic morons who run away from their mistakes. And none of that can simply be solved by appealing to comic-knowledge. These are not even the characters from the comics... NOT TO MENTION, for example: Captain America cussing! Are you joking?! He's Captain America, the ultimate good guy, the Christian nation ideal! What a let down, considering Marvel has a lot going for them in terms of characters, and this is the kind of pandering, spectacular mess they churn out of their sheep-operated studios. I mean, sure, great action and it was pretty to look at, but c'mon. So are video games, and some of those were more moving than anything in this quote ""film"". 2 out of 10 stars. And that's far from biased, as I know several human beings who feel exactly the same way. Is it too late to get my money back or do I have to live with this inescapable guilt???"

","We all know that they are cool & Super & Mighty! What made a superhero movie, a great movie is the challenge which the superheros comes across. This movie was so damn predictable, that it is appalling!<br/><br/>Below mentioned are few observations: <br/><br/>1) The Ultron was supposedly in the internet, who just over-powered Jarvis and sent a direct threat to the team Avengers. But what after that? He just went away so that the team can dwell down, what happened to them. TEAR THE PLACE APART, ULTRON! Watch 'Live Free or Die Hard' to know what one can do, once he gets the inside access!<br/><br/>2) Not one avenger broke a sweat! Barring one situation, where Wanda played tricks to Avengers minds, every other plot was too weak for the mighty them. They just went PHEW, PHEW, BAM , BAM and Ultron was reduced to flying a plane, spraying Bullets! So much for the Age / Dawn / Whatever.<br/><br/>3) Let's finish the earth, again! - This time by taking a chunk of earth & crashing it back. The place was falling apart but our heros' were busy saving the cat from the tree, posing for the camera & cracking stupid jokes with pals over Bluetooth! A simple war movie has more intense emotions than this.<br/><br/>4) All of them were posing so much on screen that I felt that I am watching Catwoman, all over again. Widow riding that bike to look cool, the stupid inspirational speech which Client gave to Wanda, Iron man in his Audi.. Yawn!! <br/><br/>5) Too much Convenience! Iron-man got 3 days to study Loki's scepter and after 5 on screen minutes, he threw all to Jarvis and was playing 'who can lift Thor's hammer'. Ultron wiped out every online memory of the team and then the Avengers pulled out some boxes and files to crack where they should go next & they cracked the mystery in next 1 min! A city of people stuck on the airborne chunk and the shield's plane appears just at the right moment. Thor needed to find answers to his dreams & he finds the professor in 1/2 a min. <br/><br/>6) Ultron being careful enough for its opponents powers, while picking up a fight! He used punches vs Captain America, Lasers vs Iron Man, Threw Rocks on Thor and when got hold of Black Widow, he kept her warm & cozy in his prison from where she could send 'old school messages' to base. Basically Ultron had a heart deep within that metal.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the movie, I secretly started routing for Ultron as he was clearly the underdog. <br/><br/>Looks like Marvel is going the Transformers route! Absolute garbage."

","After the release of the Avengers in 2012, I excitedly waited the release of its sequel. It set the bar very high. Age of Ultron did not disappoint me at all. I enjoyed every moment of it. I went to see the Avengers sequel at a 7:00 pm IMAX 3-D showing a day early.<br/><br/>In Age of Ultron, the Avengers finally turned into a team that works well together. They have been tracked down HYDRA facilities after the fall of SHIELD as shown in Captain America-Winter Soldier. In one mission, they run into Baron Von Strucker and the Maximoff twins (Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch). After finding Loki's scepter from the first Avengers movie, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner use it to create the artificial intelligence, Ultron. Like in other movies with AI, Ultron goes rogue.<br/><br/>Ultron's plan causes him to butt heads with the Avengers. It also leads up to the creations of the Vision. It's great how the Vision and Ultron have contrasting views of the world and the human race. The movie does a great job of keeping the audience's attention. It has a pretty good story. Also, Age of Ultron has a lot of funny moments that everyone will like.<br/><br/>The movie, like the first Avengers movie, has an amazing cast that works well with each other. I liked the newcomers in the movie as well. The actors who played Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great in their respective roles. The best part of the movie is James Spader. He steals the show every time he shows up as Ultron. By the end of the movie, everyone was clapping. Age of Ultron is worth seeing and a great sequel to the first Avengers movie."

The execution is fine, but characters lack humanity that made Guardians of the Galaxy enjoyable by comparison despite its atrocious plot.<br/><br/>The obvious culprit is having too many heroes. A large number of characters results in a lack of focus. We are only given glimpses of character development. The truth is that this concept would be best enjoyed as a a series, and not as a film. That's probably what the comic books are for.<br/><br/>Read them, or watch the Firefly series instead.

How do you expect the story to progress if you just want to see the same Avengers one movie in 2nd one as well? The problem here is think that no one wants to see a super hero having an emotional side and a their own life.

Plenty of great and very well-known characters, each with their own traits and charisma, whose forces combine into a lot of action-packed scenes which generate plenty of thrill and of course, awesomeness! It's one of those movies which make every child's dreams come true. It's quite hard to miss when you put such great superheroes into one movie and it surely didn't. The acting is also a very positive aspect as the also very well-known actors play their parts flawlessly but also contributing substantially to the great atmosphere that the movie is able to create.<br/><br/>The story it features is quite good, but as far as I'm concerned, it represents the downside of this movie, or better said, the only part which made it shy of the maximum rating. Don't get me wrong, it's far from bad, but you get the feeling that it could have done a lot more in order to make the movie truly great. Its predictability in some cases and its linearity in others kind of spoil the overall great sensation that the movie brings.<br/><br/>In terms of visuals, you can barely find something to dislike. It looks so good, the stunts and their filming angles make it look great while maintaining a realism factor. The CGI is also top-notch, making almost everything you can imagine a reality.

"ianritchey","Null","2","2","18 November 2018"," Can the Sequel Live Up to the Hype?
","The first Avengers movie was a massive success, becoming the third highest grossing film of all time. So it was no surprise that we would be getting a second Avengers movie. What was a surprise was that the villain would be Ultron, not the teaser villain Thanos from the last film. The film was released to mixed reviews, but it had the same cast and crew of the first film. Why was this?<br/><br/>Joss Whedon came back to write and direct the film. Marvel and Disney wanted Ultron to feature as the villain, as he is a massive bad guy from the comics. On top of that, Whedon also had to introduce Scarlet Witch, Vision, Quicksilver, the concept of Wakanda, and build up Civil War, Ragnarok, and Infinity War. Whedon had a lot to stuff into this movie.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, as to be expected. The Avengers really feel like a team in this movie. Evans nails the leader role as Captain America, you really feel like he knows what he's doing. Downey Junior is funny as hell as Iron Man. Hemsworth doesn't have a lot to do as Thor, but he is still good. Ruffalo and Johansson have a forced relationship, which doesn't really work, but they still give good performances. Jermey Renner shines in this movie as Hawkeye, with his personal life and revealed family really giving him a strong character. Elizabeth Olsen is good as Scarlet Witch, with her killing Ultron in the end being a highlight of the film. Aaron Taylor Johnson is fine as Quicksilver, but he's outshined by Evan Peters interpretation. Paul Bettney is great as Vision here, in what I feel is his best performance as the character. James Spader is great as Ultron, when he's threatening. Ultron joking isn't good. When he's a legitimate threat, it's incredible. I think this cast is great.<br/><br/>The writing is good for what Whedon can do. Disney wanted all of these individual prices introduced in this film. While a lot of them do work, including Andy Serkis as Klaw, some do not. The best example is easily Thor's trip to understand the Infinity Stones and set up Ragnarok. It really kills the flow of the film and has nothing to do with anything. But the quips and action and characters all make sense, so I still think the writing is good, though over stuffed.<br/><br/>The effects are pretty good. Hulk still looks great, and the action all looks good, mostly. Their are a few scenes in the opening action scene where it looks pretty bad. In particular when Thor kicks the guy on the tower, it looks terrible. But Ultron looks great, as does Vision. The fight between the Hulkbuster and the Hulk looks amazing. I think the effects are good, with some bad moments.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I really like Age of Ultron. I think it is a good follow up to the first film, and gave me what I was looking for. I feel like people went in expecting this incredible movie, but I went in looking for a fun action movie, and that's exactly what I got.<br/><br/>8/10"

Just a sarcastic robot who wants to destroy humanity for vague reasons. (Once again, another awful MCU villain, but then again, its no surprise) And is also bastardized in the movie and treated as a joke. <br/><br/>The avengers team could not be more bland and uninspiring in this movie. Not as bland as the first one, but close. Ironically, the most human character out of them all was vision, and that partially is due to a solid performance from Paul Bettany, not the writing. The other characters are extremely dull. Black widow, Thor, Cap, Bruce and all are extremely boring who lack heart and depth. Especially captain America. Which is a shame, considering he is the leader of the group and is supposed to be inspiring. <br/><br/>The film is also poorly choreographed and shot. The film making felt incredibly amateurish for a supposed professional director. The action sequences were laughably atrocious, albeit entertaining. Some scenes were incredibly horrendous, that they felt like a video game sequence. In fact, video game cut scenes make a better movie than this. There were many scenes that felt forced and its only purpose is to just advertise upcoming movies (some that won't even happen).<br/><br/>And just like its predecessor, the movie lacks any kind of heart and emotion. This is because it only wants to focus on dull humor and mindless, poorly constructed action scenes. Instead of having actual good writing that develop the characters as human beings, they are just mindlessly working together and banter with each other. Why even bother with making the cabin scene if they don't eventually evolve? <br/><br/>Now some may think I am taking this way too seriously, since some people say this movie is JUST for fun. But if the comics had so much heart, creativity and soul, why the film can't have that? Oh yeah because the MCU needs safe choices in order to have guaranteed success. No need to have challenging themes or artistic merit, only soulless action garbage to keep you busy for a couple of hours."

"ThomasDrufke","9","26","56","30 April 2015"," The Beginning to the End
","This is why I love going to the movies. For two hours, I can forget everything that sucks about the real world and enjoy watching earth's mightiest, (and gosh darn it funniest) heroes (you're welcome Cap for not using the other word). I've always been more of a DC guy, but Marvel movies are just pure entertainment. Joss Whedon may have given us the funniest Marvel movie yet. Whether it was the Thor hammer gag about getting 'it up' or not, Captain America's bad language issues, or Hawkeye poking fun at himself, Age of Ultron was incredibly fun. To top all that, and the first film, Ultron is loaded with action that feels like it's straight out of the comic books.<br/><br/>We open with the Avengers mid mission taking down Baron Von Strucker and the experimented on Maximoff twins. As the camera seamlessly weaves through the entire team we get Brian Tyler's brilliantly mixed score, which I was thrilled to hear they salvaged some of Silvestri's theme, that goes with each character. It was like the assemble moment from the first film was happening again within the first 5 minutes, you just don't get much better than that. We quickly get introduced to Scarlet Witch's nightmarish powers with Tony seeing his future of the Avengers dying at his own hands. I do feel like that's a quick nod to Civil War and the possibility of the team going separate ways. Iron Man started it all, so it does seem like the beginning to the end. Throughout the film we get to see different nightmare sequences that give us glimpses of Heimdall played by Idris Elba and the Ragnarok storyline. With Cap we briefly saw Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter and a little bit of the dance we never got to see. Finally with Black Widow and her harsh upbringings as an assassin. On a side note it was cool seeing Julie Delpy in the flashbacks.<br/><br/>Onto the possibly the most fun segment of the film, the party scene. Not only did we get several laugh out loud jokes, we had jokes that I missed because everyone was still laughing from before. I'm not even sure Guardians was able to do that. The scene with Thor's hammer was especially entertaining. The look on Thor's face when Cap is able to slightly move it was priceless. Ultron's entrance is terrifying but also sort of funny? I wasn't expecting the humor to Ultron, and I'm not sure I needed it. Don't get me wrong James Spader was fantastic as the voice, but I think at times it didn't fit. The film does indeed go from one action scene too another, and if this isn't your type of movie, I don't blame you if it feels tiresome. But it never bored me as I don't think there will be a more fun movie this year. It's not like action is all we got, we were introduced to a new romance with Hulk and Widow. It's no Gwen and Peter or Pepper and Tony, but I liked the dynamic. Whedon definitely made us care more about each character this time around, as even Hawkeye became a bada**.<br/><br/>As a safe house, we were taken to Hawkeye's real home. It was a nice break from the action to spend time with real people without any powers. Hawkeye was just overall a much better character here. After Vision awakens with the mind gem, we head to the final battle. I was glad that this time they were able to find a way to get people to safety, with help from Nick Fury, what an entrance by the way. With so many characters using everyone else's weapons in the battle, it made for one huge geek fest. But it goes to show you how much credit Whedon deserves for balancing all the screen time. Infinity War will be an even bigger challenge, good luck Russo bros. Speaking of that, Thanos' brief but menacing mid credits scene was cool and is a huge tease. I can't wait to see how everything unfolds now that we also have a New Avengers team, led by Cap. Sure Quiksilver wont be around but Vision was really cool and Scarlet Witch was electric so I'm really looking forward to it. Plus who doesn't love a little more Anthony Mackie as well? <br/><br/>So there are definitely flaws to be talked about. Thor's detour midway through felt off, Ultron's humor is also out of place at times, and I can see where the action can be exhausting to some, and the amount of characters and cameos make it feel a little messy, but I just had so much fun at the movies. There are also times where things happen that feel like they should have a scene before, explaining it. I hope Joss Whedon puts out his extended 3hr long cut on the bluray. The film also feels at times that it sacrifices brains for action. But there's so much geek material here I don't think I can get too mad. I mean come on, who doesn't love that Hulkbuster fight!? I don't know how long superhero films will be around, so let's enjoy them while we can. What's next? Civil War is next, and I think you can already sense the tension between Cap and Tony. Sure, they end on good terms here, but they never really see eye to eye. Knowing how many are coming back (and possibly Spidey) gets me even more excited. It definitely seems like Avengers 2.5. Nevertheless, go experience this film in theaters.<br/><br/>+Hawkeye is cool again <br/><br/>+The main theme is back! <br/><br/>+New characters turned out great <br/><br/>+Hilarious gags <br/><br/>+Ultron can be terrifying <br/><br/>+New Avengers<br/><br/>+Insane action <br/><br/>-Some detours feel off <br/><br/>-Ultron's humor was too out of place at times <br/><br/>Critic score 9.5/10. Nerd score 10/10."

"LiamBlackburn","3","28","61","26 April 2015"," Age of overabundant unfunny one-liners-Tron
","This movie begins with a huge action sequence that involves all of the main hero characters. This sequence sees them blow up tanks and people as they attack an enemy base. Every three seconds, someone cracks something resembling a ---joke?----lest we forget that a real joke involves something done/said that was, in some way, funny. One-liner jokes require a proper timeline and space within a dramatic/satirical context for them to be effectively funny. They require acute direction/writing to generate genuine laughter from the audience. Instead, we get an unfunny ""line"", being recited by an unfunny person, to an audience that forces itself to laugh, because they think they are supposed to. How many silly unfunny one-liners can you jam into an over-played over-indulgent opening action sequence? Watch...Age of Ultron..(lol)....to find out! The downfall of this movie lies specifically on the director/writer. Who, for some reason, tried to cram an entire movies- worth of action and one-liners into the opening 3 minutes of a movie. The most salient problems in this movie are: it's not funny; it's totally over-indulgent; the characters lack cohesion etc. I pity the person who walks into this movie hoping for anything more than surface-level 3d effects."

","Mega budget, multi-mega Star cast, great deal of visual effects but nothing near about great great story or script. director lost every- thing during final edit because it looks like only some scenes are thought and tried to fix them together, like director wants to control Hulk's anger with love angle which lacks chemistry and not previous connection, Origin of ultron is confused with very small interval and no pre-connection. Waste of Nick Fury, Waste of Hawkeye and his Family Came out of nowhere. Only technology and real locations along with character of Vision were 3 things to watch, everything else was ruined because of hurry and decision of making the movie shorter it should be of 3.15 hrs .then their could be some thing to proud. It Was Clear that director only want to reach to last 20 minutes of final epic fight which was great but almost ruined by all the trailers and TV-spots. so only for those 20-25 mins director dragged first half very harshly without giving any thrill except 1st 10 mins which were also spoiled by trailers. Hulk vs Hulkbuster was another thing that director must wanted to show so he did but everyone saw that in trailers..... I am Biggg Fan of Marvel movies but This movie is not upto its name. only blame is to director. His Hurry And Adding some big two or three things to make 2.22 hrs movie Failed. That's why he is no longer On Director's Chair. Captain America The Winter Soldier And Ironman:3 Were Much better Executed On screen...... Movie will be over-rated by great marvel fans thats why I gave it 7/10 But According to screenplay and editing this movie deserves only 5.5/10 But Enjoy The movie."

"biatch0","8","21","44","22 April 2015"," Big shoes to fill...
","Overall, AoU was a good film... but given the last 2 Marvel movies that were released, the problem is that the expectations have grown tremendously. I thought CA:TWS and GOTG were absolutely incredible, and so, came into the cinema with possibly slightly inflated expectations. AoU delivered on most of those expectations... Here's 2 things that I thought let it down:<br/><br/>1) New characters - Not enough in terms of character development. There were far too many existing characters/new ones/returning ones bouncing around and time limitations (and this isn't a short movie either) basically meant that none of the new characters got developed enough... not even Ultron (IMO). It almost felt like they decided to throw in a paragraph for each new character and call it a day. <br/><br/>2) End Battle - Without giving away anything, I thought the final battle didn't feel like one. Something seemed lacking in terms of build up and peak... and as such it ended up feeling more like a large speed bump rather than a roller coaster. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though, as I mentioned earlier, everything else I expected out of an Avengers movie had its box ticked... I still enjoyed the movie. Just not as much as I would have if the 2 issues above were ironed out... It almost felt like Joss tried to do accomplish too much with this single movie; create Avengers movie, add new villain, add new characters (a bunch), add tie-ins, add forward links to next movies, etc. That said, I'm still excited to see what's next for Marvel."
"SeussMeTub","7","21","44","22 April 2015"," A Smorgasbord of Characters and Convoluted Action
","The original line-up of the Avengers are back for one last go: Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Hawkeye and Black Widow and a whole bunch of new unofficial heroes in Joss Whedon's final turn in the director's chair for Marvel's ensemble franchise.<br/><br/>What's the story about? Well it's pretty simple, in the wake of Loki's attempted invasion of New York City, Tony Stark attempts to create an artificial intelligence whose sole task is to protect Earth against future threats. Of course, this backfires and the Avengers end up creating their deadly enemy, Ultron. The rumors are true: one Avenger will die and it might not be who you expect.<br/><br/>Is it worth watching? Well, first the good stuff: the battle between an enraged Hulk and Iron Man in an unnamed African city is the highlight of the movie and it happens around the midpoint. Supporting characters in the first film like Hawkeye, Black Widow and the Hulk finally get center stage though at the expense of old stalwarts like Thor (who becomes an inadvertent comic relief throughout most of the movie) and Captain America (who turns into a one-dimensional boy scout). Iron Man is the Jimmy Neutron of the team- a tortured genius who tries to create a solution to a problem that has yet to exist and ends up creating a Frankenstein monster of sorts- it's not that Tony Stark is the villain but this does tie in nicely with the upcoming Captain America: Civil War movie.<br/><br/>This brings into focus the central weakness of the movie: namely too many characters and not enough screen time for each one to be fleshed out. The movie not only serves as an origin story for Ultron as well as new Avengers Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and the Vision but it ends up making the story a paper thin pastiche of short character building vignettes around huge swirling chaotic battle scenes- many of them too enamored with fast editing to the point that they are almost too quick to follow with the mind's eye. Additional cameos by the Falcon, War Machine and Nick Fury only adds to its ad-hoc nature and myriad narrative.<br/><br/>In the end, Avengers Age of Ultron is ultimately satisfying but if you look closer, it seems to be nothing more than a placeholder for future plot lines in the upcoming Marvel Universe movie franchises."
"Vishal_s_kumar","10","29","64","30 April 2015"," Avengers Assemble...Again!!!
","After a three year break to tend to the specifics of these costumed men and women, the A-Team has reunited for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" a darker, more internalized follow-up that still retains all the expected bang and boom. Writer/director Joss Whedon has pulled off an impressive feat here, sustaining the intensity of a ripping adventure yarn while digging into a few of the characters a little more deeply, finding fresh ground to cover in a more satisfying epic.<br/><br/>After taking care of Loki and the Chitauri invasion, the Avengers, including Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Dr. Bruce Banner/Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), are off to shut down human experimentation efforts from Hydra leader Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), who's found two particularly gifted subjects in Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron-Taylor Johnson) -- powerful twins out to punish Stark for his war profiteering. Claiming success, the Avengers enjoy a rare moment of peace, only to find their confidence shattered by Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a monstrous robot powered by Stark's unwieldy research into artificial intelligence, where he hoped to retire Iron Man by assembling a robot strike force to protect the innocent. As Ultron grows in power, he recruits Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, with plans to slaughter the Avengers and destroy humankind as a way to create the perfect world order.<br/><br/>In keeping with Marvel momentum, ""Age Of Ultron"" opens in mid-battle, returning to the individual powers and technologies of the heroes as they steamroll into the Eastern European town of Sokovia, where the last traces of Hydra remain. It's a thunderous sequence, energetically following the team into enemy territory, with fluid CGI and soaring camera-work creating a roll call for the protagonists, watching Thor beat soldiers with his fist and hammer, and Iron Man control the skies with his arsenal and quips. Whedon is terrific with introductions, reviving the feeling of teamwork and power that made the original feature irresistible at times, stepping back to watch this collection of personalities and power crush evil. The story also kicks in immediately, sharing the details of Hydra's secretive mission and renewed interest in the Infinity Gems, while introducing a unique threat in the Scarlet Witch (a master of telekinesis and hypnosis) and Quicksilver (super-speed). It takes Ultron a good 30 minutes to get up and running, yet the sequel is already stuffed with enough information to keep the narrative humming along, waiting patiently for the towering villain.<br/><br/>Born from an A.I. program similar to Stark's J.A.R.V.I.S. system, Ultron takes form as colossal robot, retaining his childlike observance of the world, demanding a fresh start for the mechanical age. Backed by legion of drones, Ultron is a formidable foe, with developing smarts and a curious case of impatience guiding his initial domination. However, while his strength is significant, he needs Scarlet Witch to truly take down the Avengers, with her powers of mental manipulation digging into the fear and confusion the superheroes have kept hidden. This psychological warfare is a major plot point in ""Age of Ultron,"" pinpointing Avenger vulnerabilities in a way they're unprepared for and, for a brute like Hulk, mind manipulation results in destructive puppetry, forcing Iron Man into caretaker mode, with a mid-movie sequence detailing an uncharacteristic fight between the two, with Stark prepared for such a day, suiting up in Hulkbuster armor. Captain America is hit with visions from his past, Thor is handed a strange, apocalyptic puzzle of guilt, and Black Widow is confronted with her traumatic past, trained at a young age to become a killer. The addition of emotional wounds and the way Scarlet Witch accesses them is a welcome opening into the ongoing inspection of Avenger insecurities, adding some substance to the confection, while strengthening the team dynamic as they grow tighter as a security unit.<br/><br/>Warmth is also new to the franchise. In ""Age of Ultron,"" Banner becomes a romantic fixation for Romanoff, with their beauty and the beast pairing giving the heroes something more profound to explore than the simplicity of a haunted past. Instead of indulging the Iron Man Show, Whedon spreads attention around the group, finding a few sweet, mournful beats to play as Banner retreats from his love interest, fearful of the monster he is, while his heart aches for companionship. The miracle of ""Age of Ultron"" is Hawkeye, watching the oft-maligned character stand upright for change, showing boldness during skirmishes, awareness of his oddity, and domesticity with his secret family. Humanizing this strange addition to the Avengers is Whedon's greatest achievement, giving the character purpose and depth that makes his subplot perhaps to most fulfilling of the bunch. In a picture filled with gargantuan action sequences and world-crushing enemies, the highlight of the sequel is the chance to see Hawkeye hug his wife and children. Whedon is a real superhero for pulling off that trick.<br/><br/>Humor isn't completely scrubbed from ""Age of Ultron,"" which keeps up a rhythm of wisecracks and banter -- even the titular robot overlord is allowed some sarcasm. The scope of the movie is massive, running around the globe to thwart evil, figure out why Ultron is after a shipment of vibranium, and reunite with old friends. Seeds are planted for future chapters in Marvel Cinematic Universe, finding Rogers and Stark developing heated ideological differences as the lure of technology and the demands of safety collide. Whedon doesn't sacrifice the core unit to feed corporate demands, with enough time devoted to heroics and interplay to keep the picture satisfying, giving fans the Avengers dosage they demand. ""Age of Ultron"" manages to improve on its predecessor in numerous ways, smartly building on its foundation of trial and error."
"jpt-154-298566","4","23","49","24 April 2015"," Marvel's first misfire
","When Tony Stark's plan for an artificially intelligent global defence system codenamed ""Ultron"" turns against its puny human masters, murderous robots are soon running rampage and it's up to Earth's mightiest heroes to save the day.<br/><br/>As a big Marvel fanboy preparing to view the 11th movie to date in Marvel's ever-expanding cinematic universe, I had a hundred questions on my mind walking in. How was Age of Ultron going to handle the very significant events of the three movies released since the first Avengers, particularly the destruction of S.H.I.E.L.D and exile of Nick Fury that took place in Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and the escape of Loki in Thor 2? What could bring Iron Man back from his girlfriend mandated semi-retirement in Iron Man 3? How were the team going to be reassembled without Fury pulling the strings? What was going to let the Hulk off his leash this time? <br/><br/>These questions, and many others, were basically bulldozed over. Age of Ultron gambles big with its opening scene. We are thrown straight into a dizzying action sequence with all the team united in an assault on a Hydra stronghold: a foreboding castle in the fictional Eastern European country of ""Sokovia"". I felt that this was a bit of a cheap cop-out, given that the first movie had spent so much time and effort coming up with believable motivations for each of its very different characters to want to risk life and limb. (It also raises questions as to why, if S.H.I.E.L.D and Fury are out of the picture, who organised and coordinated this raid - Pepper Potts?)<br/><br/>From this rather confusing opening, the movie then stumbles through a party scene at Stark Towers. The iffy dialogue and characterization starts to become noticeable at this point. Gone is the wit and panache that made the first Avengers so memorable, particularly the hilarious internal bickering of the team. At this point, serious alarm bells were ringing in my head and we weren't even ten minutes into the movie. I almost wanted to gently tell them to take it back and try it again.<br/><br/>Things really took a turn for the bizarre when the screenwriters decided that Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) should fall for Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo.) This is very unlike Joss Whedon, who is usually renowned for writing good female characters. Black Widow has been established through three movies as detached, manipulative, and professional: it's what allows her to survive as an assassin. It's like they suddenly realized that she is only a girl, and therefore should be in love with someone. The Hulk is an odd choice of crush too, seeing as her and Captain America (Chris Evans) had much better will-they-won't- they chemistry in The Winter Soldier, and didn't the Hulk kind of repeatedly try to stomp her flat in the first Avengers? (PS The subplot with her backstory and the ""Red Room"" is incredibly icky.)<br/><br/>By the time we get to the scenes in the middle with Hawkeye's surprise wife and children, the movie had officially fallen apart, at least by the stratospheric standards of the first movie. There were so many characters standing around doing literally nothing. Thor, in particular, is a very busy individual with affairs to attend to on multiple realms. To see him shuffling around a pokey house in the woods was immersion shattering.<br/><br/>Ultron himself is equal parts inventive and clichéd as the antagonist. Having an evil robot as your main bad guy has to be carefully handled as it can feel too easily that you've picked up a generic supervillain from the Acme Bad Guy vending machine in the lobby. However, I liked the idea that he basically exists in the data cloud, and can easily destroy and recreate himself into new and better bodies. It's not really clear why he turns evil about three seconds after his creation. (Perhaps having James Spader's voice will just naturally do that to you.) It's also never explained why he has a snarky, gloating personality either. I got the strong feeling they were trying to channel Loki from the first movie.<br/><br/>Two new players are introduced: Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), not to be confused with the entirely different incarnation of the Quicksilver character in X-Men: Days of Future Past, released less than a year ago. Like the returning characters, their motivations are paper-thin, and it strains credulity when halfway through Ultron wrecking some city or other they suddenly think about his actions for the first time and realise that he's the bad guy.<br/><br/>In summary: every single aspect of this movie feels slightly off. Everything from the plot to the pacing to the acting to the humor has been fumbled. In particular, Tony Stark / Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) really does not feel like himself at all. I was also surprised at how poorly the action compared to both the first Avengers and also The Winter Soldier, which surprised us all by coming from nowhere with a pair of first-time directors at the helm and pulling off some of the best set pieces of all time.<br/><br/>Before Age of Ultron, I would have said that Iron Man 2 was the weakest in the Marvelverse so far, but even that managed to create some memorable scenes and characters. I can only hope that this will be Marvel's one inexplicable blip, and that the upcoming Ant-Man and / or Captain America 3 can restore the franchise to the heights we know that they are capable of."

","I'm going to be honest in my opinion. For the people who are movie goers and always want the super heroes movies to stay true to the comics, go home buy yourself a gun and kill yourself. Enjoy the movie for what it is. Super heroes movies will never stay true to the comics reason why is because maybe the comic storyline won't work either for the motion picture. <br/><br/>The movie was great, excellent action and fighting. I like how the story is going so far and how well the balance between the characters are with each other. Way better than the first avengers, and the vision is just amazing in every level. Can't wait for Galaxy Wars part 1 and 2"

","I really loved the first Avengers. So much that I watched twice in the theaters. It was exciting and fully of suspense and funny and innovative. Nothing had been done like it before. The action was great and Sam Jackson added an element of bas-ass-ness to the entire thing. Boy was I looking forward to part 2. The fact it was being directed by the same person was a plus plus! So we get to the theatre, sit down full of anticipation, bursting at the seams with excitement just to experience a snooze fest.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the Avengers fighting villains in a wintery forest. Thor using his hammer and iron man using his suit and captain America using his shield etc. nothing new here peoplekeep it moving. Then the red head is able to sooth the hulk and turn him into Bruce banner by whispering some words to him. Wait a sec I thought the hulk was inconsolable.<br/><br/>The Scarlett witch and quicksilver added absolutely nothing to the movie. The Olsen girl has no personality and is wooden on screen and the only thing the Johnson guy has going for him is his body which was covered up by his horrible costume.<br/><br/>So they tried to introduce something new to the movie by creating a love thing between black widow and hulk and all of a sudden hawk eye has a wife and kids? Sorry but I'm not buying it. BORING! By this point the action seemed pointless and boring. Nothing new here so keep it moving. No even the addition of that new character could have pulled me into this drivel.<br/><br/>I won't even comment on the Ultron character. Strutting around like drunk poet. Absolutely no more super hero movies for me."
"mrdmc-94499","1","52","126","17 May 2015"," Terrible
","Where to start? The story is undeveloped. It's full of attempts at developing the characters but turns into a whine-fest. The CGI is so over the top that the action is often hard to follow. The one-liners are so predictable that you can see the punchline coming long before its given. I regret paying to see this - first time I've felt that way since I was 12. There were a few moments of suspense, but even those had predictable outcomes. I enjoyed the Captain America films, and had hoped this would live up to those. However, it seemed like having numerous heroes spread the focus of the movie so far that it just becomes a muddled mess. In turn, too many heroes led to too many villains, with very character development beyond the antagonist and no explanation of other villains abilities or weaknesses."
"Genti22","7","17","35","30 December 2015"," A very well done and interesting movie.
","Avengers:Age of Ultron is one of the final movies in marvel phase 2 and while not as great as the first one,this movie is still very good. The action in this movie is truly spectacular and the visual effects are really good and believable throughout.This movie is filled with fighting sequences from the very beginning until the end.And I love all of them especially the end battle where the stakes are really high and a few emotional moments. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are some of the new additions and they are very awesome and well done.I honestly thought that Quicksilver is not going to be good after what I saw on X-Men DOFP but he is great here too,and so is the actor who portrays him. I love the group talks,seeing them get mad at each other and hating/loving is just so much fun and interesting.Also this movie is filled with laughs and comedic moments everywhere,which I truly appreciate. As about the main villain,Ultron,in my opinion,he was very well done.I really liked him,and his sarcastic jokes.which I found funny every single time.He is mesmerizing and not forgettable at all.His intentions very understandable and the only problem with him was his creation,which felt rushed but besides that he is a very good villain. There are some things that don't quiet work here,and other things that they did which just feel like they are setting up for the next movies to come in the marvel universe,but these are small flaws and passable ones because this movie overall is very well done and interesting until the very end."
"kieranbattams","10","23","50","24 April 2015"," there are no strings to hold this movie down.
","Once in a while a film comes around which raises your expectations so high and excites so much that it seems they cannot be exceeded so simply. Yet we are talking about a Marvel Cinematic Universe movie here, full of the fun, humour and characters that have never failed to disappoint before. I can safely say that my reasoning for Avengers Age of Ultron being my most anticipated film for 3 years is totally justified and it did not disappoint in any way. The emotions it left me feeling were some of the best i have felt for a long time and throughout i was smiling and felt like i was a member of the team Marvel have spent so long building up, and they are very much a team here taking us on a journey much bigger than the first and in many ways better.<br/><br/>The film opens with an incredible action sequence and stays that way until the very end of the post-credits scene which has become a staple at the very core of Marvel. Here Tony Stark has been working on a dormant peace keeping programme that is set to save the world so that the Avengers aren't needed anymore and can take a well deserved break. Enter Ultron, played as perfectly as a fan could wish for with the chilling voice of James Spader who gives real depth to a character who had to be done right to be brought to the screen. The Avengers assemble once again to counter Ultron who sees them as the only threat to the world he is sworn to protect and on the way encounter twins Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are insanely awesome characters. A lot of fans worried that Aaron-Taylor Johnson would be a disappointment compared to the perfect portrayal in last years Xmen film but i can say safely that they are two very different takes on Quicksilver and that they both did absolutely brilliant jobs. Elisabeth Olsen as Scarlett Witch again also provides us with a huge deal of depth and really makes the character her own. I must say though whilst everybody in the film, and i mean everybody, did a phenomenal job the standout is definitely Paul Bettany as the Vision. Without spoilers i can say without a doubt that he is the best character for me and is brought to the screen as perfectly as anyone could have imagined to counter the bad-ass Ultron. Joss Whedon gives it his all and that is definitely no understatement.<br/><br/>Each Avenger has their own demons to battle and we get to know them so much better than we already did. In particular what i loved was firstly the relationship between not only Bruce Banner and Black Widow but also the relationship she had with the Hulk. They played off each other so well. Black Widow really got to shine here. We knew the back stories of the Avengers because we got to see them in standalone films but hers is finally told to us and Scarlett Johansson brings a real feel of emotion to her character that we haven't previously gotten to know. We also get Thor who has demons to battle and we see more of an insight as to what is going on in his head and Captain America who is coming to grips with the life he has been given in modern times which was explored subtlety but very well. Also i know you are all wondering, yes the Iron man Hulkbuster vs Hulk fight was incredible and nothing short of spectacular. I loved Hulk in this film as he was more than the muscle of the team and the fight with Stark was given context instead of being thrown in for the fun of it (but that doesn't mean it isn't fun). Plus i was very happy to see Hawkeye was given a huge deal of screen time, he was bad-ass and shone a new light on him as a character which was awesome.<br/><br/>A couple minor flaws, but they are minor are that Ultron did have less screen time than i hoped. He was awesome but you almost want to see more by the conclusion. Also the post-credits scene was pretty cool but so short and i just wish i could have seen a little more in terms of set-up. Other than that you will not find a better time at the cinema and i doubt that will change for the rest of the year.<br/><br/>Avengers Age of Ultron is without a doubt my number one MCU film and featured all the action, humour and characters that we are promised and more. War Machine even shows up for the fun as well as Falcon even if only for a small time. Plus Nick Fury was as great as ever. All balanced with a slight dose of dark elements and we are given the perfect summer movie to enjoy again and again. Will be seeing it again on Sunday for sure. I am in love with everything about this film at the minute including the incredible soundtrack. ""Didn't see that coming?"" Neither did i. ""There are no strings on me""."
"kyleweis","10","19","40","22 October 2015"," Another Monumental Marvel Movie!
","The Avengers assemble once again go up against a new corrupt, A.I. Ultron (James Spader). As the troupe pursue their mission, we're given a deeper understanding of our favorite super heroes.<br/><br/>There are not enough words in the world to express how happy I am. As a Marvel fan, this film showcases some of my favorite comic book characters together in one plot line in a bigger and better way. When you are dealing with a sequel, as a filmmaker, you're pretty much trying to top yourself. Thankfully, the filmmakers have out done themselves here. We're given a superior conflict, more characters and action beyond epic proportions.<br/><br/>I love this movie not only because it's a phenomenal Marvel film, but also an outstanding film in general. A movie is supposed to grab the audience and transport them to a universe with characters that not only we look up to but also identify with. Marvel has successfully created this reality. Every time I see a Marvel logo on a movie poster I'm excited to be sent back, once again, into their universe.<br/><br/>Marvel is a genius entertainment company because they establish their characters in previous films. The Avengers are the protagonist. Every character is given their moment in the lime light but, they are not the main focus. They all share the screen and have their own personal conflict, yet they respond as team. That is not to say that there is no character development, there is. Former story lines help save time so that the writers can focus on perfecting the current story. This also leads to much stronger relationships between the characters.<br/><br/>For people who have no history with Marvel films, I suggest that you see some of the previous films that feature the Avengers. The reason is that you may miss a connection with the characters that can be resolved by watching previous films. Although you will enjoy the action and story even without seeing the previous films, the inside jokes and interactions between characters become funnier when you understand the past.<br/><br/>The action in this film is awesome! The word awesome is a very primitive word, but it explains everything. While I love to go to the movies and appreciate storytelling and 3 dimensional characters, there are times when I just want to see things go boom! Every Avenger, with his or her different abilities, works together and kicks butt. An example of this is when Thor hits Captain America's shield and causes a devastating explosion. You have to see it to believe it.<br/><br/>My favorite character is, Vision (Paul Bettany) an android created by Ultron. Bettany is originally the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Tony Stark's (Robert Downey, Jr.) A.I. companion. Bettany uses his fantastic voice to create Vision. I was excited when I heard he was going to be a new addition to the Avengers team. Not only is the acting and personality spot on, but the costume design is beautiful.<br/><br/>There are so many scenes that I adore, but my favorite is when the Avengers, ""get acquainted"" with Vision for the first time. This is the second A.I. the group has encountered and they're unsure if they can trust him. Vision is uncertain himself and gives a speech on why it doesn't matter because they all want to stop Ultron. At the end of his speech there is a comedic pay-off that shows which side Vision is truly on.<br/><br/>The moral of the film is, ""The way to peace is not destruction."" Ultron is built for one reason - to create peace in our time. Ultron is confused on how to fulfill that mission and believes the only way to achieve his goal is to wipe out the human race and start over. However, Ultron underestimates the soul of man.<br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and recommend it to 11- to 18 year- olds. There is language and intense action that younger kids might not be able to handle. Check out this film in theaters May 1 and remember, a true Marvel fan stays to the end of the credits."

I hope this movie will become a wake up call for those who made it.<br/><br/>If this movie will be treated as a ""standard of perfection"" to other movies as according to many comments here, then it will be very sad."

","I've gone to all the Marvel movies since Thor at the midnight showing, normally they grab my attention and keep it the entire time through so the decision to stay up until 3 am was not in vein.<br/><br/>The movie was okay, we all knew the movie was going to be darker, the characters were going to be in a different place because of the movies since the last Avengers. But what's fun about these movies is that they have a lot of heart. It's the little guy going after Goliath... Even if the little guy is a Greek god... Anyways the movie, because of everything the Avengers experience previously was missing that ""Go Team Go"" person, that Heart that it has always had. Captain America normally brought that but the character had gone through so much by the time the movie started, it was just lackluster. The guy that put Tony in his place last movie died, is now alive, and has his own TV show, a lot of the stuff I just went ""Coulson would have tazed him and would be watching super nanny while he's drooling on the floor right now.."".. A new character brought back the balance by the end of the movie but the imbalance was very apparent<br/><br/>I was just so pumped after watching Agents of Shield, catching up all last week, finished the last episode right before going to the movie, that it was just a kind of let down. Definitely worth the extra money in 3d. Only mid credits scene (Even though there was a great opportunity for an end scene that Joss didn't take and I was kind of disappointed over. I didn't give any spoilers, was very careful about it... But catch it in the movie theater because I don't think I'm going to own this one on Blu-Ray"

Let the Dc fan boys keep complaining. The cast felt so perfect for this movie, and the amount of some laugh scenes matched perfectly for every moment it took to made its purpose. Ultron was a better enemy than Loki in many ways, and no matter how much u have seen in trailers it doesn't compare with the amount of action and destruction you will finally see in the movie. Every scene and every second of it was fun and well designed, not only cgi but for the acting of the cast , special mention to Scarllet Johanson , she took over the Black Widow character so perfectly and her accent was nice."
"goldwriting","9","21","45","5 May 2015"," Age of Ultron Keeps the Pressure On
","The steamrolling new cinematic world of Marvel movies continues with round two of the Avengers storyline, Avengers: Age of Ultron. With Joss Whedon once again behind the camera and behind the pen, the bar was set pretty high, but he met expectations in more ways than one. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron deals with the central fear of Tony Stark, who has seen through the looking glass into the universe beyond and knows what's out there. No known power on Earth can stop what's coming, even his new team of superheroes, so Stark decides to build an artificial weapon strong enough to defend the planet for them. Not the most unique of ideas, but anytime someone builds artificial intelligence, it inevitably turns against them. <br/><br/>The Avengers must come together quickly to fix Stark's mistake, while dealing with the introduction of two new mutants, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who have a deep seated hatred for Stark and his history of weapons manufacturing. <br/><br/>Going into this film, it is impossible to truly measure the cultural and economic weight it was under. The first film grossed over $1.5 billion dollars, which because of other massive tentpole successes, $1 billion dollars is slowly becoming the threshold to pass in order to be called a ""huge win"" for the studio. <br/><br/>On top of that, The Avengers created the new algorithm for bringing a number of unique comic book hero movies together into one grand franchise. This is already being repeated by other studios (especially Warner Brothers and DC Comics) and it will continue to be the pattern for the foreseeable future. Marvel figured out the key and it unlocked the movie universe for decades to come. <br/><br/>The performances in Age of Ultron were mostly up to my expectations. Robert Downey Jr. continues to bring depth and failings to Iron Man, while Mark Ruffalo rages forward as the best actor to ever play the Hulk (sorry, Bill Bixby.) Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans hold up their end of the bargain as Thor and Captain America, respectively. No one falls behind, even with the cameos of Don Cheadle as War Machine, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, and Anthony Mackie as The Falcon. <br/><br/>Yet, to me the standouts in relation to the returning cast have to go to Scarlett Johansson (as Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (as Hawkeye.) Johansson continues to peel back the layers of Black Widow's early childhood trauma and the effects of her brutal training as one of the world's best assassins. Renner stands alone in this movie as the emotional glue, the magnet that holds together the theme in this chapter, which is family. <br/><br/>Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen move far beyond their brief cameo in Captain America: Winter Soldier as the dangerous Russian twins, Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch. Taylor-Johnson gets to play both the smoldering anger of a child who's seen too much horror and the protective older brother who would do anything to protect surviving member of his family. Olsen also has similar traits, but her power burns much stronger and with it also comes her frailty in how to use and control it. She's not yet a soldier when the film begins, but the events that unfold force her to make that choice. <br/><br/>James Spader provides the sinister voice and machine madness of Ultron. Once again a massively popular household name, Spader brings much of the same arrogance of his lead character in the hit TV show, The Blacklist, but here it's as if that character loses his cool. Insanely brilliant, insanely powerful, and just plain insane.<br/><br/>Balancing him out is the final character premier in the film, Vision, played beautifully by Paul Bettany. I was worried because Vision is a hard character to make emotionally compelling since he is almost purely logical and they could have easily fallen into the same trap as The Watchmen and the character of Dr. Manhattan. Yet, Bettany showed once again why he is one of the best in his generation and why Marvel does not skimp on effort or money to get the most talented people for the part. He overlays his logic with love, his power with purpose, and his intensity with intelligence. This is a character I am going to really enjoy watching grow in the coming films. <br/><br/>Another impressively well written, structured and acted film from the Marvel universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron will not disappoint new fans, old fans, or go down in film history as ""the weak part of the franchise."""
"q-25660","10","21","45","4 May 2015"," Not worth near all the hate. LOVED IT
","After watching this film I was so pumped for all of the sequels to come. I heard people complaining about problems with plot and I honestly found it just as interesting as any other movie made by this studio which is not bad by any means. In the long run this is a super hero movie, we come for the action (which this is packed with). These movies aren't Oscar winners, they are MARVEL this is exactly what marvel has been giving us and its been doing it so well for so long I think we are judging it more heavily. The main reason people are so hard on this movie is because the first movie was so well done it set a high bar. If you want character development watch the characters in their individual movies. This is the movie that brings them together not focuses on their individual life, and even so I feel we got some great growth on the part of hawkeye and black widow. By the end of this movie I had fallen in love with the twins and hated watching quicksilver die. Vision was a wonderful addition and brings a lot to the team. All in all this movie definitely lives up to the original and keeps me wanting more, with the cameos from the smaller characters from the smaller characters like falcon, war machine, and nick fury this movie really felt complete without being over stuffed. Joss whedon perfectly balances the original team and the newer characters and gives you a sense that this is all one universe, I can't wait to move forward and this movie is in my top ten. I definitely don't feel that it deserves any hate and its a definite must see."
"quincytheodore","9","21","45","22 April 2015"," With myriad of stars and visual spectacle, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a pinnacle of excellence
","Pick a single name from the cast list, and chances are that name is worthy of leading a movie on their own. Having so many talented actors reprising their roles and few a new additions to the assemble, the movie has no shortage of star power. Action is exhilarating, all forms of heroes and foes blasting colorful beams, throwing acrobatic punches and aerial acrobat. This film is as big as one would hope, and more.<br/><br/>After a series of burdening battles, Tony Stark would try to use the power Avengers find to do some good, but his good intention doesn't produce equally good result. The premise is accessible, it doesn't try to overcomplicated thing, though what the film does best is how every character seems fitting in grand scheme of things. These strong individuals all have their own flaws and doubts, John Sheldon as director displays their struggles very aptly.<br/><br/>Regardless of the superhuman attributes they possess, their problems and fears are identifiable to audiences. Script is well written, just as the dramatic plot moves smoothly, the humor is spot-on too. They all exchange banters and quips in expense of each other, even the bad puns manage to pry some smiles. Balancing between the gradually bleak premise and the rich characters' ordeals are done gracefully. There is no weak spot here, as everyone performs amazingly and everyone in audience would likely find something, someone they can relate with.<br/><br/>Action is a hybrid between CG and choreography. Visual is astoundingly impressive. Fast and relentless, the mayhem is still delicately constrained for audience's viewing pleasure, so you'd know who is involved at the mauling on a particular scene. There are even a few snappy continuous shots for good measures. It is as grand as advertised, and better yet the dashing action sequences are shared harmoniously between the fancy characters.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is an explosion made from collision of stars and spectacular graphic, and with such a blast it is poised to be the biggest explosion of the year."
"deep_hz","2","37","87","11 May 2015"," Age of Ultron- forget about Ultron
","When I was coming out of the theatre after watching the movie, it didn't seem to have the effect like those of the earlier marvel movies. I mean the feeling like you just had a great experience. I realised later this was because of the character Ultron itself. Unlike in the trailers, he wasn't at all sinister throughout the movie and had very little influence in the shaping of the plot. In fact the twins (Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch) had much more influence in the movie than Ultron. <br/><br/>First of all, it was Scarlet Witch who manipulates Tony Stark's mind into creating Ultron. Then the only fight (in the middle of the movie) Ultron won against the Avengers was with the help of the twins. What is even more pathetic was that when the twins simply decided to leave him after Scarlet Witch finds out about his intentions, he couldn't even think about stopping them. Without the twins it seems Ultron wouldn't have been able to get hold of the vibranium- which he used to create the ""city-meteorite"" for the climax –and so there wouldn't have been the climax. Even in the fight at the end, the twins themselves seemed to be overpowering Ultron quite easily - forget about the Avengers team. The only thing Ultron was able to accomplish on his own was capturing Natasha. In fact towards the end of the movie I actually felt pity for Ultron. Also since Ultron is an AI, I was imagining he would hack & control JARVIS (rather than corrupting the program as in the movie) and probably control most of iron man's staff (from the trailer, I seriously thought that in the hulk vs ""Hulkbuster"" fight, Hulkbuster suit would be controlled by Ultron's program). His being AI, I thought the need for his physically dominating the Averngers team wouldn't arise- since there would be no physical limitation to Ultron. He could essentially devise multiple strategies (parallelly) to beat each member of Avengers in their own game. Most of all he didn't seem to have a backup plan for his survival. (the ending seemed to imply that by vision destroying the last of Ultron drones, Ultron was destroyed. I fail to understand why- in spite of Ultron spreading through the internet at the starting –he couldn't think of saving a 'copy' of himself somewhere.)<br/><br/>But still I don't think the portrayal of Ultron in the movie was wrong. He was like a child (since he was created quite recently in the plot) and much to learn yet. So essentially he didn't get enough time to evolve. Compare this to Loki in Avengers 1 (spoiler alert for Avengers-1). Loki had basically shaped the entire story. He made his presence from the very beginning of the movie thereby influencing every single event in the movie, directly- by getting himself involved in the breaking up the team, indirectly- by masterminding the earth invasion by the Chitauri army. Most of all he seemed sinister from the beginning to the end. Even in his defeat when he was subdued he seemed very graceful when he said, ""If it's all the same to you, I'll have that drink now"". The fact is that he was able to bring the Avengers to their knees. I think this was possible because Loki got the time to evolve (since Thor-1). I personally think Ultron should have had more chance to evolve like Loki, probably in any of the following ways: <br/><br/>1. Like Loki, if Ultron was introduced in an earlier movie- either a separate movie or in an iron man movie. <br/><br/>2. If ""age of Ultron"" was made into a 2 part back to back movie (may be with 1 year gap), like they are planning with infinity wars. This way Ultron would get time to evolve.<br/><br/>3. In this movie itself, if they had shown a back story about Ultron (how, why, when etc he was created) and linked with the Avengers somewhat differently. This would make Ultron a mature villain instead of the childlike character he was in this movie."
"Brownsbros3","10","24","53","5 May 2015"," This is why I like I movies
","If you don't like this movie, there is something wrong with you! The advertisement says, ""The most fun you'll have at the theaters this summer."" They are right on the money. I had a blast! I don't go to movies to over-analyze and critique every little detail. I go to the movies to have fun. I love how they set this up on Marvel's Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and then the movie picks up right where the episode leaves off. I like that they had Robert Downey Jr. go back to being the charismatic, wisecracking Tony Stark that made the first Iron Man film so cool. The running gag with Captain America objecting to the rest of the crew using bad language was hilarious. The visual effects were amazing in 3-D. My favorite was the return of the S.H.I.E.L.D. Heli-carrier. Hawkeye having a wife and kids was a nice surprise. As far as the whining goes about Black Widow taking a back seat to the rest of the guys, I really didn't see it that way. The Avengers are a team. They fight together. I didn't really see any one Avenger in the movie outshining the rest of the group. While all the focus was on Widow, they completely forget about Wanda a.k.a. the Scarlet Witch. After Hawkeye's pep talk, she comes out blasting everything in sight, and earns herself a spot on the team. The swerve of Quicksilver sacrificing himself to save Hawkeye and the little boy was really well done. All movie long it kept looking like Hawkeye was the one that was going to die. James Spader was a great villain as the voice of Ultron. I would have toned down the comedy a little bit though. Some of his lines seemed out of place for an evil robot wanting to kill all mankind. I also liked that they started setting up the pieces for the next series of movies; Captain America:Civil War, Black Panther, Thor:Ragnarok, and Avengers:Infinity War."
"thefilmexpert","2","24","53","30 April 2015"," Are movies so formulaic now that audiences can't hope to expect anything more than this in a blockbuster?
","To give credit where it's due, Whedon again does a great job making believable the interactions of a very disparate group of characters. Just the idea that a thawed-out WW2-Uber-patriot, a Norse god, and strangely likable arrogant-genius who wears a metallic-supersuit could occupy the same film universe seems ridiculous on paper (Let's hope Snyder can do as well with Amazons and Mermen in Justice League.) The actors do a good job inhabiting their characters, and Whedon succeeds in creating character arcs with the amount of time available. The long arc that takes the Scarlet Witch from an ally of Ultron to a foe feels natural. Secondary characters typically fail to connect with audiences, but her scene with Hawkeye and her brother's sacrifice makes her contribution to Ultron's downfall more than filler. The film also does not feel overstuffed with characters, though it's pushing the limit. <br/><br/>Whedon attempts to bring more depth to AoU, but AoU's attempt to walk that line undermines its ability to repeat the original's feel- good ending. At the same time, AoU doesn't successfully bring added gravitas to the franchise, like The Empire Strikes Back did after the original Star Wars. Some of the action is exciting, but the film doesn't feel as light and fresh, partly because it's too similar to its predecessor. Again, the Avengers fight a hoard of generic enemies, this time on multiple occasions, and so, it starts to feel like it's repeating the first film's battle of Manhattan again and again.<br/><br/>In the end, AoU is held back by a number of flaws--those deriving from its plot's formulaic nature, its villain's motives, and the level of the film's stakes. AoU lacks strong tension because it never feels that heroes' lives are threatened. Once again, the most exciting fight occurs between two Avenger team members. (At least this time, Whedon doesn't intercut this fight with scenes of other heroes fixing an engine.) However, when it comes to their main adversary, it's mostly the Avengers engaging a hoard of generic robots they outmatch. Some might argue a death or serious injury might undermine the fun. Well, in Star Wars, Luke's entire squad is wiped out, and that film is the embodiment of escapist fun. Furthermore, these are comic-book characters. Superheroes never really die. How about this--Tony is grievously wounded and needs cybernetics just to move, right at the very time he wants to leave his technology behind. An injury like that would raise the stakes plus lead to inner conflict later, right? Without any sense of threat, some of AoU's action scenes start to feel like video-games.<br/><br/>Ultron is an interesting villain, and as a character, he works. However, as a being of advanced-AI, he's also pretty stupid, and that brings us to the deeper problems with AoU--its plot. What does Ultron do just after being created? This brilliant tactician attacks the Avengers without ever assessing their weaknesses. After gaining consciousness, an intelligent Ultron would've remained out of notice as long as possible as he secretly built himself and his robot buddies into an indestructible army. Why didn't he do this? Probably because Disney cynically felt audiences have the attention span of gnats, and since there had been dialogue for 10 minutes, we needed another fight. What's next in Ultron's plan? He wants to steal some really strong metal. Is this really the best move? Uh, no, or lobsters would be the apex predator in the ocean, and armadillos on land, but of course, Ultron really doesn't go to Wakanda for this purpose. He does so to set up the soon-to-be-released Black Panther movie. Then there's Ultron's world destruction plan, which is preposterous and unrealistic. If Ultron could make a device that can turn a city into a gigantic meteor, then he could presumably upgrade himself without having to steal tech from all over the world. <br/><br/>Most significantly, Ultron's motives make little sense. He wants to rid the world of people to achieve peace, right? Well, peace means groups of individuals getting along without conflict. Exterminating life on earth won't bring peace because there won't be any individuals left. Later, he apparently concedes some people might survive--and they'll start anew--but why would these people be any more peace-loving? Food-shortages and a-total-economic-collapse don't typically bring out the best in people. Then what if Ultron's plan works too well, and it wipes out everything on the planet including himself and his robo-friends? Will we have achieved peace because the lifeless rocks that remain won't fight each other? Spader's delivery gives Ultron's nonsense dialogue some menace, but Ultron's plan and how he attempts to achieve it make no sense. Even without deep analysis, these problems with the plot are pretty apparent. It just feels off.<br/><br/>The deepest failings of AoU do not lie with its villain, however. In part, that's because Ultron isn't the film's villain. That honor instead belongs to Tony Stark. From Frankenstein to Jurassic-Park, the arrogant guy who unleashes a ""monster"" onto humanity is the REAL villain, and that individual pays for his hubris. Besides some momentarily disgruntled Avengers, the film does little to recognize Tony for what he is. In fact, after creating a threat that nearly destroys the planet, he later repeats the act with no knowledge that it will turn out any better. Some will say, ""Wait for Captain- America- 3."" No, we shouldn't wait because our heroes shouldn't. They're not idiots; they can see what's going on and should recognize that Tony should never be allowed near any device more complicated than a toaster. His actions are that much of a threat. Furthermore, an arrogant Tony struggling with the issue that he's the real problem and serious conflicts with the other Avengers about his decisions would be ways to bring the film some much needed dramatic heft. <br/><br/>Ultimately, AoU is a missed opportunity to further the franchise."
"cerca-sonia","10","24","53","23 April 2015"," A dream come true!
","I used to think making a better film than the Avengers was quite impossible, but Joss Whedon did it! Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dream come true, the sequel all the fans were waiting for, and inarguably the best Marvel film to date - maybe even better than Guardians of the Galaxy. <br/><br/>The film still has all the elements of the first film, but it makes a huge step forward in the action - the 3D vision is totally worthy - dialogue and character. However, the main difference is the villain: James Spader's Ultron is marvelous. <br/><br/>The talk about artificial intelligence is very fascinating, both conceptually and cinematically.The storyline is far from the cliché superhero story. The script is great and amusing. The direction of Joss Whedon is flawless. There is a great balance within the Avengers, where the superiority of Iron Man, Captain America, Thor and Hulk is perfectly balanced with the more active roles of Black Widow and Hawkeye - I would have loved to see more Falcon though. I loved what they did with The Vision, The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. <br/><br/>All the actors gave a fantastic performance. Robert Downey Jr. keeps on playing the genius, billionaire, playboy, philanthropist in a way nobody else could. Chris Evans always brings a sense of honor to his character. Scarlett Johansson really surprised me. Great performances also from Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders and Paul Bettany. Elizabeth Olsen gives one of the best new character portrayals in recent year - I really want to see more of her Scarlet Witch. However, James Spader totally steals the scene: he is perfect.<br/><br/>More at afilmadaybysonia.blogspot.com"

","I had to get this out of my system, so why not in form of review.<br/><br/>First here goes rant.Screw you Hollywood and yours peace of garbage,streamlined movies for brats.<br/><br/>Now to more constructive review (although, bare in mind if you read mini-series Age of Ultron,I am talking about comics by the way, you are going to be utterly and I repeat utterly disappointed , so don't bother reading further).<br/><br/>First of off when will this going to end ? Serious scenes that should make you sad,mad,scared are turned into comedy.This is fashion that is carrying over from infamous movie for kids (Hobbit 3 I am looking at you).Marvel universe is much more than listening to ""smart cracked jokes"" (to be frank only joke they got right is with Thor's hammer).<br/><br/>Movie has huge problem with pacing, villain is lame (the lamest there it is), I mean how exactly is what you presented in this movie Ultron ?Actually why it's called Age of Ultron ? Was this some agenda to attract more audience like comic fans for example or what ?People who read comics know what I am talking about, it is one of the best mini-series ever created (some people will beg to differ but like I care ..) .<br/><br/>It get's worse when they present Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver.They had introduced two characters that play major role in Marvel Universe and spit at them by giving them like 10 min worth footage ? Action scenes are what you would expect,it's only thing done right.I want write anymore, because with each line I am getting more mad, so I will wrap it with one paragraph.However, before that let me just say, that while first movie didn't live up to my acceptation, I liked it, even with all things they got wrong,as for this one,If I could I would ask manager of cinema to refund my ticket because I would be better of If I had wasted money on something else.<br/><br/>If you are casual, new generation, unaware of MU until first movie and you simply don't give a damn about whole Universe setting,pale attempt, joke of the Avengers movie, go for it, it's made for people just like you.If you fall under category under unaware but willing to dig deeper than I suggest you skip this movie and go for comics.And I don't need to mention rest of us furious , viewers who felt betrayed ,now do I ?"

"sonofodin25","10","18","38","29 April 2015"," Great Movie ! A WORTHY adaptation of Earth's Mightiest Heroes
","Wow. Just Wow. Marvel actually did, they made a movie that may have topped all of their other movies. (Cap 2 is the only real competition). <br/><br/>So, Avengers: Age Of Ultron begins with a bang, literally, the first ten minutes are this massive Avengers Vs. Hyrda action sequence that is out of this world. Here we see Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow, and Hawkeye re-assemble for one of the most exiting, squeal worthy movie scenes ever. This scene also introduces us to two new characters, Quicksilver (who Movie Buffs already know from ""X-Men: Days Of Future Past"") and his twin sister, The Scarlet Witch. At first I was sceptical about these two, however as the movie progressed they slowly became some of my favourite ""Avengers"" characters. Another thing that I found cool about these two is that their powers are quite different and something that separates them and this movie from the Original Avengers. Making for some awesome visual effects.<br/><br/>As usual with these movies, the actors completely nail their roles. Even after all these years Robert Downey Jr. just IS Tony Stark, he once again owns the role and completely redeems the character after the horror that was ""Iron Man 3"". Chris Evans once again completely owns the role of Captain America, perfectly portraying both his old-fashion ideals and his completely bad-ass side perfectly. The other stand-out of the movie, one whom I did not expect, was Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. That's right, Hawkeye, who was formerly Marvel's worst adaptation of a comic character after the Mandarin, is now awesome. He finally gets a back-story and motivation for his character and just kills it. Also, Hawkeye, much like his comic book-counter part, gets the funniest lines in the movie. (""I could do it, No one would know""). I could right about how every actor is perfect forever, but it would take me too long, these 3 (and another who I will get to later) are the stand-outs of the film, however the others all portray their characters to perfection as well (especially Chirs Hemsworth, Elizabeth Olsen, and Aaron Taylor-Johnson).<br/><br/>Now the biggest change from the comics is for sure the personality of Ultron, it is to be expected seeing as in the movie Ultron's personality was based off of Tony Stark instead of Hank Pym. I however came to accept this version of Ultron. James Spader was just born to play (voice) this role. I felt for Ultron and understood his motivations and why he wanted to do what he did. I even felt sympathy for his character in certain parts of this movie. He see's humanity through a fresh, un-biased set of eyes and doesn't agree with modern-civilization. I will say that Ultron may have had one to many joke-lines, but I can cope with it. Now Thor, Ultron, Hawkeye and The Scarlet Witch are all great but my favourite character in the movie was by far The Vision, played by Paul Bettany. I don't want to give to much away about this character, but he is just brilliant and I can't wait to see more of him.<br/><br/>The only reason I gave the movie 9 instead of 10 (It would be like a 9.5 if I had that option) was because it did feel a little rushed. I feel sorry for the non-Marvel fans going into the theatre as they may have trouble understanding what's going on. I've heard that the original cut was about 3 and half hours and you really can tell that they cut things out, that being said I've also heard that an extended edition will be released, and I think that version of the movie may become my favourite movie of all time.<br/><br/>Overall, Avengers: Age Of Ultron is just about as good as a superhero movie can get it makes you laugh, cry, squeal in nerd-glee, and then at the end leaves you dying for more. Oh and since the line got cut in the movie.....AVENGERS ASSEMBLE !"
"Anurag-Shetty","10","18","38","24 April 2015"," Exceeded my expectations in every way. The best superhero movie of all time!
","Avengers: Age of Ultron continues with the story of the Avengers, who are Earth's mightiest heroes. The team consists of Tony Stark/Iron Man(Robert Downey Jr.), Thor(Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk(Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America(Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow(Scarlett Johansson) & Clint Barton/Hawkeye(Jeremy Renner). After the events of The Avengers(2012), Iron Man 3(2013), Thor: The Dark World(2013) & Captain America: The Winter Soldier(2014), the Avengers are hot on the trail of Loki's scepter which is in the hands of HYDRA. Due to all the attacks on Earth in recent times, Tony Stark believes that the world needs additional protection, other than the Avengers. He convinces Dr. Bruce Banner to help him build Ultron(James Spader), a sentient robot that can protect the Earth & help the Avengers to stop any global threat. However, things don't quite go as planned. Ultron has a warped perception of the world & the Avengers. He wants all the Avengers extinct & has diabolical plans for the Earth. Now, it is up to the Avengers to stop Ultron before it's too late. However, it won't be easy as Ultron has the help of twins with incredible powers. They are Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who has the power of super speed & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olsen) who has the power of telekinesis & mind control. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is an incredibly epic film! It surpasses its predecessor in every way possible! My expectations for this movie were through the roof. I kept thinking to myself, there's no way that it can surpass the highest grossing superhero movie of all time. I was wrong. Joss Whedon has outdone himself. He has truly made a bigger & better film. Sure, the formula is the same as the first movie but, everything is ten times better. Besides, only the basic idea remains the same. The climax of the movie is significantly different. The camaraderie among the Avengers has increased. There are plenty of memorable scenes with all of them together. Though this film is darker, the humor that all the Marvel movies are known for, is intact. There are plenty of witty one-liners that will make you guffaw from time to time. Plus, if you enjoyed the squabbling among the various Avengers in the first film, don't fret. There's plenty of that, this time around too. I loved the fact that our heroes travel the globe & are not just stuck in New York where almost all superhero movies take place. The special effects are otherworldly. Each action set-piece is more fantastic & thrilling than the last. Two of my most favorite sequences are the Hulk vs. the Hulkbuster showdown & the climax of the movie. The 3D is eye-popping & has been put to good use throughout the film. This movie wouldn't be half as incredible without the superb performances from the stellar cast. Robert Downey Jr. is spectacular as Tony Stark/Iron Man. After so many portrayals of this character, Downey Jr.'s performance seems effortless. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor. Hemsworth balances the God of Thunder's wit & seriousness with ease. Mark Ruffalo is brilliant as Bruce Banner/The Hulk. Ruffalo's killing it as both the mild mannered scientist & the 'other guy'. The motion capture for the Hulk is extremely realistic. Chris Evans is outstanding as Steve Rogers/Captain America. Evans keeps getting better & better with each portrayal of America's first superhero. Scarlett Johansson is amazing as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow. Johansson portrays a more vulnerable Nat, this time around. Jeremy Renner is great as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. I loved that Renner's character is given more importance in this sequel. Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen are super as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver & Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch. The Maximoff twins are a welcome addition to the Avengers universe. Paul Bettany is excellent & unrecognizable as Jarvis/Vision. James Spader is the perfect combination of intimidating, powerful, terrifying & funny as Ultron. All the ingredients that make the ideal villain. Spader's deep baritone & trademark drawl are perfect for the voice of Ultron. Cobie Smulders is impressive as Maria Hill. Samuel L. Jackson is perfect as Nick Fury. Many key players in the Marvel Cinematic Universe have cameos. They are good too. Joss Whedon & the entire cast & crew of Avengers: Age of Ultron, take a bow. Avengers: Age of Ultron is a masterpiece. Go for it now!"

"autobot_fan96","9","19","41","3 May 2015"," Extremely entertaining! A worthy sequel to an already great film.
","(Mini spoilers ~ proceed with caution)<br/><br/>'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is quite possibly the best movie I have ever seen (in my opinion). Being a huge fan of action films, I was anticipating and looking very much forward to the release of AoU, and may I say, it did not disappoint! Already having high expectations going into the cinema, I walked out with a big smile and had my expectations met & exceeded (I went with my friend and he too was impressed). The CGI computer graphics were stunning (as predicted), the acting was some of the highest quality that I've seen (with some very 'witty' parts), and the new additions/characters added a new dynamic to the story and direction for the franchise. Ultron was an awesome villain! He provided some fantastic lines (funny or not) [""There are no strings on me...""], and actually posed as being a threat, unlike some other movies where the bad guy is pretty useless and weak. All the fan favourite Avengers return, as well as a few new additions - Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, and Vision. These three characters posses very cool superpowers and do 'kick ass!' I won't give away any major plot/story details, but they do indeed add to the film's overall awesomeness, and you'll see that when you watch it (along with a few surprises).<br/><br/>Overall, I was ultimately blown away by Age of Ultron and I am sure it is/will be the definitive motion picture of the year. It does do justice for the previous one and the Avengers universe, plus I will definitely be seeing it again at the cinema - 10 out of 10! Can't wait for the next one!<br/><br/>Thanks for reading. :)<br/><br/>(This is my first review on IMDb, so forgive me if it isn't the best, I just wanted to put forward my view/opinion on a truly fantastic film)"
"dreamworkswb02","3","19","41","1 May 2015"," Filmaking 101: You don't change the very so-inspiring theme soundtrack of the movie that makes people love it
","There are several problems with this sequel that other people have already talked about. But I want to mention this particular problem that perhaps nobody pointed out. You changed the so-inspiring soundtrack from the first movie. If you compare the theme soundtracks of both the movies, you'll find them very different. I accept that you can't stay with one soundtrack forever. But, man, you don't change it so quickly either. The main soundtrack from the first Avengers movie is in the hearts of many people, including me, and I felt very disappointed when I waited for it in the entire movie but it never came. This may not seem to be a very rational reason but after all these movies succeed because they inspire and music plays an important role in creating inspiration. Please bring back the original soundtrack in the third movie!"
"gibb-duncan","3","19","41","28 April 2015"," absolutely awful.
","This movie, sadly, falls victim of its own hype. i was soooooo wanting this movie to be a great sequel to the original Avengers, and it falls flat on its face.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis, plays a character, who says about 3 lines, and is in the movie for the best part of 90 seconds, his part should have been enlarged, or written out. The story felt cobbled together, as did the story telling, and for its part made no sense, ie. the finale is seriously flat, and how Ultron came about is explained in about 5 lines in a short scene, that again, could have built up more tension. There is a plethora of gags, ala ""buddy cop"" style, and i had to check i wasn't watching Lethal Weapon with Riggs and Murtagh instead! Luckily, the movie has some great eye candy, but its all sum, and no substance, the movie lasts for 2.5 hours, but in all that time the story was hurried along, with no depth. There isn't much character development with the new guys, and as to why Red Witch and Qicksilver are even there, makes no sense, and is explained poorly. <br/><br/>This movie is no better than say, Iron Man II, and that is feint praise indeed, the flick flatters to deceive the viewer from the off, and its true that the action is non stop, and hits the ground running, but the price paid for the constant tempo, is a lack of quality, that is sadly obvious, that the first movie had it in bucket loads.<br/><br/>If you're a youngster you will love this movie, if you a more mature, discerning fan of the genre, then you will be left wanting. Joss Wheddon was quoted as saying this was the hardest thing in his life to get over the line, believe me it shows.<br/><br/>Wait for the bluray, this is a big flop, from start to finish.<br/><br/>gutted."

","So we went and saw the movie tonight. We all had high expectations. And boy were we in for a surprise! This sequel was better in all the right ways you WANT a film to be better, for example all the jokes was REALLY funny, not the ones you see in certain movies where they try so hard but often fail, no in this one there was several times when most of the audience laughed out loud and they really nailed the fun stuff!!<br/><br/>There was not the ""30-40minutes"" non-stop meaningless action/fighting scenes that just steals away precious minutes of the film that some movies also have these days, this movie have in my opinion instead succeeded with having balanced the exact right amount of story/action. It never gets boring due to the lack of action or other way around to much story without action.. <br/><br/>This is also the first movie that is +2h long that i didn't feel when the ending was near that ""oh no, has it already been 2h 20minutes"" i wanted it to be ""more"" and longer.. All the hobbit movies gave me that feeling although they all have more running time, so when you leave the theater after watching this im pretty sure you will feel like this one was not to long or to short.. A brilliant film in all ways.. <br/><br/>Deserves a 10 in my opinion and i can promise that it will not disappoint you in any way. A movie you easy can take your gf with you to watch since there is a intense and good story behind it and its funny. But you do want to see the first avengers movie before this one since there is many things in this one that has to do with the first film.<br/><br/>My first review so just putting down my thoughts that came first to mind, and a big ""I'm sorry for my bad English"" :) Now go see the EASIEST best action movie of the year!!"

"MovieMelee","10","17","36","30 April 2015"," Another Perfect Marvel Movie
","Just got back from seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, and if I could have seen it again immediately, I would have. From start to finish, this was a truly amazing movie. I was hesitant going into it because of the reviews I've seen and people on other sites rating it badly, but I after watching this movie, I realized that the people who rated it badly just don't understand what a comic book superhero movie is. <br/><br/>Most critics watch crap that win Oscars. Most Oscar winning movies don't have explosions and action. They have deep, emotional elements that would put most comic book readers to sleep. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not an Oscar movie, and thank God for that. <br/><br/>I have a grading system that I use for movies, and I will lay out my argument for AoU based on that. I hope there are no spoilers, but read at your own risk.<br/><br/>Story: 10 Joss Whedon has given us the perfect follow up to The Avengers. This movie is more impressive than Avengers in every way--not saying that Avengers was bad. It was a great movie. AoU is just better. After seven years, we get to see the Avengers as a team. We get to see them fight together to take down the bad guys in their path. We also get to see how their hubris can come back to bite them on the behind because of Tony Stark. From start to finish, this movie's story was rock solid, and Whedon has written the team as they should always be written--flawed but able to get past that.<br/><br/>Script: 10 No line of dialog in this movie didn't have merit. Was it humorous? Yes. Did that humor take away from the movie as some people claim? Not in the least. There were times I was literally gripping my chair's arms wondering what was going to happen, how the Avengers were going to get out of this, but always knowing they would because they're the heroes. The movie was actually not over-packed as I was expecting it to be, and everything in the script just worked. Whedon truly outdid himself with this one.<br/><br/>Directing: 10 How Joss Whedon managed to pack so much into one two and a half hour movie is beyond me. There was not a single wasted minute, and every minute was important to the overall movie. There were fun moments in the movie, of course, but nothing was wasted. There was nothing in the movie that didn't need to be there for one reason or another. Joss Whedon kept the movie light yet dark and gave comic book fans exactly what they wanted in a comic book movie. Anyone who says differently is fooling themselves.<br/><br/>Casting: 10 You know a perfectly cast movie when you see it. If there is every a doubt about why an actor or actress is in the movie, it's not perfectly cast. Even Oscar winning movies can have casting problems. AoU was perfectly cast and no one was out of place. Everyone worked well together, and you could tell by their interactions that they all wanted to be there. It was beautiful to see.<br/><br/>Acting: 10 Was this Shakespeare? No, but for AoU, the acting was perfect. You believed all of the characters and you believed in all of the characters. From Robert Downey, Jr. to James Spader, everyone did their job perfectly and brought all of their characters to vivid and complete life. <br/><br/>Cinematography: 10 The cinematography in AoU was beautiful. The colors were seen in their full glory as is Joss Whedon's trademark. The cameras were steady enough that you could see what was going on at all points and you never had to question if you saw something right or not. What the cameras caught was nothing but pure magic.<br/><br/>Music: 10 Danny Elfman's score for AoU was truly beautiful--some of his best work, IMO. He's never been one of my favorite scorers, but I will give him props for this one. Made the movie exciting! Great job!<br/><br/>Pacing: 10 For a two and a half plus hour movie, this one went by quick. When the movie was over, I was looking around going, ""That could not have been over two hours! It went by so fast!"" I've never been in a movie this long that moved as quickly as this one did. The pacing was perfect. I'm honestly thinking about giving it above a ten because it was just that excellent.<br/><br/>Costumes and Sets: 10 Beautiful work as always by the costume and set designers. They truly knew what they were doing. Everyone looked awesome, especially Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. The locations were beautiful. <br/><br/>Re-Watchability: 10 Re-Watchability is something I discovered was very important in a movie. A movie can be great, but if you don't want to watch it over and over, it really does hurt the movie. I cannot wait to see Age of Ultron again, and I plan to go see it tomorrow if I can. I'll probably see it as many times as I can possibly afford. I really don't think I'll get tired of it.<br/><br/>That's my review. Watching AoU, the only thing I could think was that I pray Batman v Superman gives us half of what Age of Ultron did. It was exciting, it was fun, it was joyous, and I really cannot wait to see what comes next."

","Got back from a midnight release this morning , and i didn't want to review the film straight away as i wanted it to sink in to brain. Having said that my opinion hasn't really changed as much as i would of liked it to.<br/><br/>Joss whedon , in a lot of ways has pretty much lied to the audience about his own film , its not overall shocking someone trying to promote the film by setting up a few custom truths , but i think the fans deserved better from him , so lets start with a few bullet points.<br/><br/>1: Ultron in the terms of evil robots go , is up there with a more heavily depressed WALL-E , hes way way to slapstick for a super villain in this , this was supposed to be dark and tonight i saw the Disney side to things.<br/><br/>2: Romanov is a nice character but who ever agreed with Wheadon to make her a main character or the center of attention for this blockbuster was out of their depth , giving romanov a more visual back story is fine , but the romantic element with banner and herself was again Disney's BEAUTY AND THE BEAST. Romanov would never let feelings get in the way of THE JOB.<br/><br/>3: Hulk little to no screen time , really frustrating this having just brought my hand hulk cup ready to cheer the green bastard on to smash! I think i timed it at 20 minutes probably less! Banner spends to much time moaning about hulks destruction and not about going bananas and helping , you would think now he has some control over being the hulk and being Bruce banner he would be happy to get angry! He knew scarlet witch was messing with his brain and i know bruce is a gentle soul , but hes also smart enough o know when it wasn't his fault!<br/><br/>4: This film wasn't set up for civil war , Thor grabbed Tony by the throat , END OF WAR... that was the only act of punishment Tony got for making , LOLtron. And he didn't have a darker side in this film , he was just a lot more impatient to get the ball rolling with protecting the earth. So that was just a big big big let down! In fact the screen time in the first movie with loki's scepter manipulating them all on the boat was more intense than this entire films disagreement with stark and loltron.<br/><br/>5: Just another Thanos scene :/ 3 movies , 3 hints. Still no lengthily scene with Thanos in it. I was hoping for a end credit sequence with Phil or spiderman , was that was a bit of let down to.<br/><br/>But to sum up , the film does have its good side. It wasn't a complete let down it had parts where i was laughing out loud and also had parts where the action sequences where pretty epic , it deserves no less than a 7 because a lot of work has gone into the movie to make it work and it does work , but it could of worked a lot better :/."
"chocohotz","7","17","36","23 April 2015"," Better story line, lots of laughter, far more better CGI
","Well lucky of me just finish watching Avengers day 2 of premiere here.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie. lots of laughter along the movie, tense down a bit from all the action.<br/><br/>About the story line. Like the moments when all the superheroes was given false image by Scarlet Witch, I can see superheroes that are weak and more human (forget all the super power they have). <br/><br/>For a second I though that Ultron wants to be 'human' when he tries to make human body with Dr. Cho; but when he says something about human extinction and the start of machine era, just pop in my mind is this Avengers or Terminator? <br/><br/>Good part about Black Widow, we can know a bit about her past. a lovely surprise with the appearance of Vision. in the end when Captain America calls out the Avengers, it shows War Machine, Vision, Scarlet Witch, Falcon, could it be the next Avengers will focus on these new superheroes? <br/><br/>Nice story about Hawkeye and his family, it shows us about a superhero that are considered 'weak' among the rest, but he didn't back off, rather than he fight beside the rest. The part when he protecting a child risking his own life and when Quicksilver loses his life to protect. here I see superheroes not always on the winning side.<br/><br/>The CGI was amazing, almost can see the difference between the real life & animation.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this movie. lots of lesson we can learn from the movie."

","I came into this movie not expecting the same feeling I left with after the first Avengers movie due to a lot of reviews I had read before hand. One thing that really concerned me was the 'lack of depth' I had seen mentioned.<br/><br/>This sequel is infinitely better than the first, all the characters are emotionally tied to the story and it makes every member of the team feel equal. As a fan of the comics I was amazed it did so much justice despite obvious set backs due to licensing the movies have been facing. <br/><br/>Minor characters quickly seemed more like main roles and the new characters instantly added to the story as well as leaving a huge neon sign of hope for the rest of Marvel's films.<br/><br/>GO WATCH IT!"

Mass entertainer with action and fun stuffs also,visuals,EFX,music done their best for the movie. iron man,hulk steals the show with black widow. Scarlett robs our heart with stunning beauty and smashing action blocks,especially the bike ride and romance with hulk. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be.<br/><br/>What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch. overall ,its always being the mass entertainer movie with great stuffs."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>The Avengers are now a fully functioning team stopping other groups who have nefarious agendas. On one of their missions, Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) comes across a dormant peacekeeping program. When activated the program named Ultron (James Spader) sees only one solution to achieve peace, human extinction. One of the most highly anticipated movies of the year, Avengers: Age of Ultron has a lot to live up to, and it achieves it in spades. This is not a shallow action film, it is a direct sequel to the first Avengers continuing the story of the team and their relationships. Ultron posed a formidable threat to our heroes, and he did it with confidence and attitude. Avengers AOU is an action-packed, funny, geek out inducing, and most importantly an all-out fun movie that you will want to see multiple times.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>I've been looking forward to this movie not for days, weeks, or months. No, I've been waiting for years. So much so that I went for the midnight premiere on a working day. My expectations were sky- high and wow I left the cinema ecstatic and with a giant smile on my face.<br/><br/>Right from the start we kick off with an amazing action scene showing the whole Avengers team taking on the bad guys. I was covered in nerd goosebumps. It shouldn't be a surprise that all the action sequences were top notch. In fact, they are better than the first Avengers because you get to see more of their teamwork. It is exciting to see how they communicate and improvise off of each other's tools and skills. As amazing as these scenes were, the strange thing is they weren't even the best parts of the movie. What I enjoyed the most was the banter between all the characters. The witty dialog had me laughing countless times. I think I can safely say, this was the funniest Marvel movie so far. Yes Avengers AOU is also the darkest film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe but director Joss Whedon always found a way to not let that compromise the fun. A large part of that had to do with the way the characters were handled.<br/><br/>These are not the same heroes we knew from Avengers, they have changed, there are new relationships and priorities. All of that brought a new dynamic within the team we hadn't seen before. Everyone, including the new additions such as Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) get their fair share of screen time to shine. Even, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was finally shown as a badass. He was integral to keeping the team together when things were at their worst. Now let's talk about the guy who was making Avengers' day worse, Ultron. In the trailers he is shown as a menacing villain with an imposing presence, and that is true physically but his personality was more than that. In many ways he had more base human traits than you might expect: fear, jealousy, anger, and most surprisingly a great sense of humor. He had a great cocky attitude about everything he did, which was a dimension to the character that I didn't anticipate but fit really into the tone of the movie.<br/><br/>There is so much more I want to talk about but I want you to experience it all yourself. The vastly overwhelming positives drown out any ""complaints"" I have. Seriously there were moments I couldn't contain myself from cheering and I was not alone in that. So many times the cinema burst into joyous laughter and thunderous applause. Avengers AOU is everything I wanted it to be, more fun, more action, more epicness that make even the most casual viewer's inner nerd come out of the cinema drooling for more.<br/><br/>P.S. There is only one mid-credits scene. Once you see that scene you can leave the cinema knowing you are not missing anything.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"
"cemupesnici","1","47","118","26 April 2015"," Bad villains, flat sidekicks, no emotional depth
","Let's compare this movie with X-men DOFP. We have Quicksilver in both, we have giant robots as enemies, we have fight within superhero group. All of this was done good in DOFO, and all was miss in AOU. Aside from that that in DOFP Quicksilver has much more better scenes, and that the way he moves is shown much better. In DOFP Quicksilver is a character. He likes some kind of music, he dresses in as he likes, he uses his powers in childish way (kleptomaniac), he plays with himself. What can you tell about Quicksilver in AOU? He has nice body, and hot sister. The reason why we do not feel anything when he dies is because we don't care for him. He's nobody. When agent Coulson dies in the Avengers, we feel something. Not because we like that guy. He's a menace. We hate him. But not in the way we want him to die. We care for him because he was so long with us. Because we remember who who is. We don't know who Quicksilver is. The other problem with Pietro and Wanda is that they are bad guys in the beginning of the movie. So why they couldn't stay bad for little longer, to make a real threat to our heroes? Because Marvel doesn't know what to do with bad guys. Baron von Strucker dies in the beginning of the movie without real reason. It reminds me of death of Count Dooku in Revenge of the Sith. And what about our main villain? He is not real threat to Avengers. Compare him to sentinels in DOFP and you will see how naive is he as a villain. By the way, why is the name of the movie Age of Ultron? Shouldn't it be Week of Ultron or something. In DOFP we watch our heroes die, some of them two times. And that deaths were horrible. In AOU we didn't even see Quicksilver dies. And now about fights within the team. Can you compare what is happening between Iron Man and Cap with the same thing between Magneto and Professor X? Hopefully we will see some blood in next year in Civil War. And that blood must be Caps. And he should stay dead. That is the only way for me to believe in these stories. That much is necessary to make believable these characters after so long avoiding tragedy. In addition, it is necessary because we will soon have Black Panther, Spiderman, Ant Man, Dr Strange etc. It is not possible just put more and more superheroes in movies. Marvel should think more about villains than about heroes. X-men have great villains – Magneto, William Sryker, Mystique, Sabetooth (the only good thing in that movie), sentinels etc. DC shared universe has already made one decent villain (better than all Marvels except Loki) and now with rebooted Lex and Joker, with big screen debut of Harely Queen, Deadshot and a bunch of lesser known villains DC will take back the throne of best superhero franchise from Marvel. Marvel is preparing for duel with Batman v Superman. That's the reason for Civil War. But Marvel is constantly forgetting that DC beats them with villains, and I don't see any villain in that movie, while DC is still hiding their true intentions with that movie. At the end of AOU we see new Avengers – the bunch of sidekicks and minor heroes we don't care for. Probably they are here only to be ready for Civil War. So make them count this time.<br/><br/>The best moments of the movie are: 1.Iron Man vs. Hulk – with exception Thor and Loki, the only two characters with real chemistry in MCU: ""You are stronger than her, you are smarter than her, you are Bruce Banner."" 2. Vision vealing Thores hammer . 3. First fight scene."
"akhiljayabal","6","16","34","13 January 2016"," Disappointed
","One of the most disappointing movie i have seen last year, cartoon-ish villain and lackluster humor. I was more interested to see a villain like Thanos than Ultron but gave it a try anyway. Special effects seems to fail especially during the use of digital doubles.The heroes cracking jokes in the middle of a battlefield, and then there is Quicksilver why kill off a character who had such a potential.<br/><br/>I hope they will bring better villains to the forefront and not take viewer for granted in the future installments.<br/><br/>I am giving it the lowest possible rating just so Marvel would get the message and improve next time and make a film like ""The Avengers""."
"wpedmonson","8","16","34","1 May 2015"," Marvel fails to disappoint a second time, but how long can they keep it up?
","After seeing Avengers 2: Age of Ultron, I discovered a trick of the Marvel franchise: make as many fights happen in the sky as possible in order to increase the stakes of that fight. It's the looming fall that makes every fight on a floating city more dramatic, and it's in many ways similar to the looming fall that superhero movies as a whole are facing for the near future as they find their peak and descend as a passing trend. <br/><br/>I have to admit that going into this movie I was 80% expecting it to disappoint, probably due to a personal burnout that is likely a foreshadowing of a collective burnout for the genre in the years to come (if it hasn't started to peter out already). I predict the late 2010s to be the waning years of superhero movies, and the solidified polarization in big budget blockbusters and small art-house/indie films made for those willing to seek them out. <br/><br/>Avengers 2: Age of Ultron falls on the farthest opposite end from anything art-house, however, and it's likely one of the best of that ilk. <br/><br/>The movie delivers on surprises, tense moments, loss, and laughs. In many ways, it's an almost identical experience to the last one, which begs the question of where we go from here. Do the movies keep creating new characters and digging deeper into plot lines with obscure references from the early days of the franchise? Do we eventually lose our senior class and get a whole new set of characters (and the actors that play them) that probably want to move on and diversify their careers? <br/><br/>I get that feeling watching this movie, though I have to tip my hat to Marvel Studios for keeping the spirit alive and doing about the best the could with these comic book characters. Really, a cultural mythology like this couldn't ask for a better revival than what the Marvel universe has given it. <br/><br/>For those who loved the first one, you'll like this one just as much or slightly less. They spent less time on explaining some of the events of the movie, possibly to its detriment. If you love explanations of the magic stones and the technology of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, then you'll be disappointed because they do a lot that isn't explained well in the movie.<br/><br/>Characters we love return, and it was tastefully done, avoiding the temptation to cater to the super fans and start name-dropping more obscure heroes to get cheap wows from the audience. <br/><br/>For Catholics and religious folks in general, there's a presence of spirituality in the movie that falls in line with the growing suspicion toward religion in general we're finding in movies of this size. This is seen in Ultron using the most explicitly religious language, ""On this rock I will build my church"" and ""Have you come to confess your sins?"" Yes, the villain utters those lines in the movie, showing himself to be a false Christ figure, with other allusions to the End Times and the tragic ending of the human race peppered throughout the movie. There's a borrowing from (conscious or not) religion in these movies because the language is both potent and familiar though it seems films have turned more suspicious toward religious figures, opting for a broader (and often far more bland) expression of a nebulous goodness and spirituality. <br/><br/>I admire the Thor character and his story most for his nod to the mystery of another world that has influence on our own. Thor's addition to the Avengers story acknowledges a spiritual dimension in the world, even if it doesn't fall directly in line with Judeo- Christian traditions. He holds sway over the rest of the Avengers as a god and the only god on the team, and stands out as an entity that emanates the divine though in a more pagan sense. This is best seen in a comical part of the movie where the entire team tries to lift his hammer, and the bickering that ensues when they can't they argue over how the mechanism works. Thor seems most comfortable leaving it as a test of worthiness, saying it's something beyond us to manipulate or understand (though I'm sure it's explained in his comic book storyline). <br/><br/>Also notable is how the movie conveys a global feel, adding to my thesis that movies will either become big big blockbusters made for global audiences (with sometimes heavy handed pandering to that global audience), or become culturally esoteric art-house films. Knowing that Chinese audiences are the biggest source of money for these movies outside of the US, the film puts a few Chinese characters into the movie speaking the language and having a prominent role. Later, we're taken to Africa where another fight breaks out, and finally to somewhere in Eastern Europe, and by the end we're not sure exactly where we are in the world. <br/><br/>In the handful of reviews I skimmed for Avengers 2, I saw one insight from a review that aptly pointed out the future for the movie industry. It was summed up in two similar though very different recent releases. ""Ex Machina"" came out a few weeks ago and features a set of four actors on a single location making a story about an artificially intelligent machine made by a genius. In many ways, it's another take on Age of Ultron though it couldn't be any more different. The movie is powerful, thoughtful and moving though in ways Avengers 2 isn't nor would ever attempt to be (and wisely so). Basically one is a movie and the other is a film, assuming the tone that goes with each of those labels. <br/><br/>That difference is the near future of film, and I don't find it as grim as many portend it to be."
"shilow3","10","16","34","30 April 2015"," Much better than I was expecting
","I feel that great deal of the criticism of the movie is undeserved. Sure it's not perfect, but what movie is. I just saw the movie and because of reading the forum posts on this site I expected it to be a disaster. It wasn't even close to that, I enjoyed it very much. Anyone who loved the other marvel universe films should have loved this one as they were no different in there style, it puzzles me why that seems not to be the case. Also the people who said that it didn't have a darker edge to it were not quite right, it was about as dark as you get in an action movie that has a lighter theme to it. Some said that the humour was out of place and there was to much of it. I was expected s cringe worthy, but the humour of the movie was neither overused or out of place nearly as much as it was claimed to be. So that was proved false for the most part as well.<br/><br/>This movie show the up and down of the characters very well and the character development was very good for an action movie, even for the new character that we were just introduced. It is very hard to balance the action, have a good story to tell and develop the characters at the same time. In the end it was a great action film that was on par with the other marvel films that were very big successes. I really hope that the overly critical response to the movie does not harm it's success at the box office."
"James_De_Bello","7","16","34","22 April 2015"," 8.5/10
","So many things to get out there, but before starting let me just give a disclaimer. I do not remember a time in my life where I wasn't reading Marvel Comics, that is totally true. I am a Marvel Comics geek and The Avengers have been, alongside the Cosmic comics, my favorite series to read and have brought some of the best stories I have ever had the pleasure to enjoy. So when judging a Marvel film there are always two sides of me that are adding up to the final judgment: one side is the film nerd that just wants to get a great movie, the other is the comic nerd that wants his favorite characters to have the best portrayal on screen. That whole introduction might have gone on for two pages, but it was to say I might go into some nerdy territory that general film goers don't care about, but I just can't help it.<br/><br/>As you guessed from my score I liked the movie and upon second viewing I will go as far as actually loving it. One thing that I want to get out first is that for the first time, since 2008's ""Iron Man"", I finally saw the MCU coming into it's own. Every movie before was always trying to find it's place in with the other movies, but finally I saw the MCU as I had dreamed of it. It was just like in the comics and I truly loved that, it takes all the mythology and gives it for granted and throws you right into it. There is no need to set-up things, it nailed the feeling of a comic book even more than the first one.<br/><br/>""Age of Ultron"" excels on so many levels it is very difficult to start with one because you are immediately thrown into talking about another. I'll start with what I thought was the best part: the characters. Joss Wheodn proves again he understands these characters more than anybody else and makes the very best out of them. There are many, many character moments that are gold and the best are the intimate ones. My favorite parts really were watching the characters interact and argue, the writing value of some scenes was really remarkable. Moreover it is great to see them having grown and knowing each other, it offered a new dynamic that made things all the more enjoyable and again so close to the comic books. Obviously the action sequences are absolutely stunning. My favorite being the very opening one: the film opens with a long shot that had my mouth dropped to the floor and fortunately these breathtaking shots continue throughout the film. Scene after scene I was glued to my seat because of the relentlessness of the visually fantastic action that was always in service of story. It was so brilliantly put together: the vision of the director is so clearly brought to the screen; the complexity of the scenes is so deep, I truly admire the talent of the filmmakers in bringing them to life. The comedy moments obviously work and are juxtaposed to some even better dramatic moments. Plus, as a comic nerd, I lost count of moments where I just geeked out in joy. Overall, this was simply a fabulous ride that never left me time to catch my breath and actually improved on second viewing.<br/><br/>All of the negatives are minor things, there isn't one gaping flaw, but when added up they simply don't match the flawlessness of the first one, which is one of my favourite movies of all time. Firstly, Ultron was underwhelming. It pains my fingers to type it, but it is true. Ultron is one of the best villains in history probably, forget Skynet, Ultron is the incarnation of AI gone wrong and is one of the most compelling villains to read about especially the relation with his creator (which by the way I am really bummed isn't Hank Pym because of what it means to that character), but these aspects were never explored and his motivations were really underdeveloped. He wasn't simply given the portrayal he deserves. He was a kind of cool villain, but he wasn't Ultron to me. The storytelling overall wasn't as flawless as in its predecessor, it was very good, but it left bits and pieces behind. The CGI some very rare times popped out. The action was sometimes sloppy and too fast cutting, for the majority it really stands tall, but there were moments here and there were it wasn't as good as it could have been. Moreover, the film just doesn't take risks, there are no major surprises and so it simply doesn't up the stake as much as I wanted to. Now this is really bragging but here are two pet peeves of mine: firstly, I just missed the Seamus McGarvey cinematography, Ben Davis was great don't get me wrong just look above to find my praises of the visuals in this film, but I just missed the what McGarvey is able to do, that being making every single frame immaculate, with Davis there was that shot once in a while that just fell flat. The second pet peeve is something that really bothered me, they tease and tease the Avengers theme throughout, but it never plays! And even worst it plays during the credits! That was really something that missed for me, it gave a great push at the very end, but it was simply too late.<br/><br/>Enough nitpicking, I really, really recommend this film to anybody, nerd or not, I genuinely had a riveting experience for the whole duration and that isn't something that many movies do to me. Yes there are many negatives that can be pointed out, but there is just so much to be enjoyed and loved that as much as you can think back to the negatives the better parts will stick out much more."
"CinemaClown","Null","12","24","24 May 2015"," An Overblown, Overcrowded & Convoluted Mess!
","What actually made The Avengers click so amazingly well with audience around the globe wasn't its simple accumulation of many superheroes in one feature but the flawless manner in which director Joss Whedon blended the elements of action, humour & drama into one perfectly balanced extravaganza that offered plenty of laughs, spectacle, emotions, entertainment & satisfaction throughout its runtime.<br/><br/>Riding on the wonderful platform provided to it by earlier instalments, the second phase of Marvel Cinematic Universe has had a smooth run in both critical & commercial departments until it all came down to the chapter everyone had been waiting for since the past 3 years. And even although at first Avengers: Age of Ultron may seem like another success story for Marvel, it is unfortunately way too messed up in actuality.<br/><br/>Sequel to The Avengers, penultimate chapter of Marvel's Phase Two plan & eleventh film in Marvel Cinematic Universe, Avengers: Age of Ultron brings back the team of Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hulk, Black Widow & Haweye under one roof once again for this time they face an adversary they never saw coming as Tony Stark's dormant peacekeeping program goes horribly wrong, resulting in the birth of Ultron who's hellbent on human extinction.<br/><br/>Written & directed by Joss Whedon, almost all the things that one suspected to go wrong in The Avengers goes wrong in this sequel as Age of Ultron is an overblown, overcrowded & extremely convoluted mess of an action-adventure that neither succeeds in finding the perfect balance between its different elements nor provides a smooth flow to its narrative like the way it did in its predecessor. And even his direction looked tiresome as if he simply wanted to finish the film anyhow & go home.<br/><br/>While the story does head into a darker territory this time, adds greater depth to the arcs of subordinate members of the Avengers & brims with cleverly executed moments of wit, it's the complete lack of coherence that hurts this film most. The heaviness of the opening act, the nonsensical incarnation of Ultron, the over-reliance on CGI action, the uneven switching between different plot points & several wrong turns that ultimately lead to an uninspiring finale are a few things that negatively affect the whole experience.<br/><br/>The writing is another culprit for the new characters are poorly handled, the plot line is quite banal, the action is soulless and although the screenplay boasts a few interesting ideas on paper, its execution on the film canvas is an absolute disappointment. Camera-work is pretty chaotic but the visual look is commendable, Editing is bothersome for the story isn't supposed to be this long n tiresome, and even the background score is simply a rehash of the original that brings nothing new to the table.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, there isn't really much to add about the reprising cast except for the characters of Scarlett Johansson & Jeremy Renner, as we find out more about their backgrounds. Among the new additions, James Spader plays Ultron & even if his voice brings a compelling quality to his character, its poor conception in the script prevents him from becoming a formidable villain while Aaron Taylor-Johnson & Elizabeth Olsen do a fine job in the role of Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch, respectively.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a disappointing follow-up to The Avengers that collapses under the burden of its own ambitions in a spectacular fashion. Even though it never advertised itself as anything more than a popcorn entertainer but it is only sensible to expect a sequel that's on the same radar as its predecessor. I don't know if it's the after- effects of Mad Max: Fury Road that had me totally numb to the CGI-heavy sequences this film had in store or if those moments really are lifeless but purely from storytelling aspect, Avengers: Age of Ultron certainly isn't one of Marvel's finest offerings."
"richlewin","7","21","47","28 April 2015"," Good but not excelsior
","After 2 viewings of this film I found it to overall be a good movie but as a fan of the MCU found it didn't quite hit the mark as did GOTG & CA:TWS. The film delivered on cast and action but what let me down was the overall story. Unfortunately Ultron is just a cliché AI who believes humanity must die. James Spader played him brilliantly as a mirror to Tony Stark but was not as calculative or as sinister i thought he might of been. One of the strongest moments for me throughout the film was the Hulk/Widow relationship that worked well with the characters inner struggles to define and accept themselves. This chapter was a stepping stone towards broadening the MCU in terms of BP, A:IW 1&2 and TR. The dynamics of the core Avenger team worked well along side the humour, which Joss nails but his focus should have been more on the conflict between Tony and Ultron. I'd of liked more of an Empire Strikes Back approach to the film which is what i expected, but instead the film was on equal par with Avengers Assemble."

","This is by far one of my favorite movies from the MCU. The introduction of new Characters both good and bad also makes the movie more exciting. giving the characters more of a back story can also help audiences relate more to different characters better, and it connects a bond between the audience and actors or characters. Having seen the movie three times does not bother me here as it is as thrilling and exciting every time I am watching it. In other words, the movie is by far better than previous movies (and I do love everything Marvel), the plotting is splendid (they really do out do themselves in each film, there are no problems watching it more than once."

We see Avengers in action. There's Iron man flying as usual. Wait, what about the ending of Iron man 3? Blowing up all of his suits? Not addressed! But hey, its MARVEL they can do whatever they want and can get away with it. How about a supposedly menacing villain who cracks jokes every now and then. Again, its MARVEL, no problem.

To not only craft a sequel that was as great as 'The Avengers', but one which beats the competition without question. Needless to say, Whedon succeeds marvellously. You know you are in for a film of magnificence, when the opening prologue bests its predecessor in every conceivable way.<br/><br/>The Avengers are a powerful team. Yet they will inevitably meet their doom, one day or another. Tony Stark knows this better than anyone. He confides in Bruce Banner (AKA the Hulk), that the Avengers need an end game, a way out from their super heroic deeds. Together they create the thing that they dread ""Ultronin the flesh"". Ultron is an artificial intelligence system, who is created with the sole intention of making the world safe; this is because the Avengers cannot protect the world forever. Once Ultron questions his creator and rebels against him, he believes that a better world is one which The Avengers do not inhabit. Ultron teams up with brother and sister duo; Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to destroy the team, once and for all.<br/><br/>The cast for 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is impeccable, with old friends and new foes alike. The heroes are Iron Man (a witty Robert Downey Jr.), the Hulk (the subtle Mark Ruffalo), Thor (a god-like Chris Hemsworth) and Captain America (a righteous Chris Evans.) Joining them are assassins Hawkeye (a keen Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (an emotional Scarlett Johansson.) On the opposing side are Scarlet Witch (an illuminating Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (a supersonic Aaron Taylor-Johnson.) The big baddie with global domination on his mind every waking minute is Ultron. He is voiced by James Spader, who oozes determination, power and intimidation. The key thing of note about Ultron is that he is intelligent and resourceful, not a lumbering henchman with dumb schemes. Ultron has a plan, one which he does not entirely divulge to The Avengers. It's so good to not be bombarded by exposition, which is far too present in the X-Men franchise. Avengers could teach it a thing or two.<br/><br/>The action set pieces have been thoroughly thought out; this gave me the impression that the production and animation team left nothing up to chance. The first fifteen minutes feature enough excitement on their own to put Bond out of business for good. We are introduced in this sequence to all the major players and briefly glimpse Ultron's final form. Furthermore, the fight that sees Iron Man don the Hulk Buster Armour in an attempt to stop an out of control Hulk from causing higher levels of chaos is breath taking. I literally lost my mind and I am certain that any other audience member will as well.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon excels not just at action, but with the dialogue and characters. Each and every person on screen feels fully formed and defined. This time there is no weak link glaringly present. Hawkeye was underutilised in 'The Avengers', however in 'Age of Ultron' we care more about him. This is because we discover many secrets to his and other character's pasts. The most intriguing of which is the character of Natasha Romanoff (Black Widow) whom sees a glimpse of how she became an assassin and her vulnerability; this gives her feeling, thus in the process making her seem less two dimensional than she arguably was before. <br/><br/>The lines are witty and still retain emotion. 'Age of Ultron' has a heart that the majority of comic book films can only aspire to. Tony Stark is extremely funny, able to provide laughs amid the ongoing destruction. Bruce Banner is thoughtful, wondering if the Hulk is the darker side of his personality. Thor says the wrong thing frequently that provokes the enemy and Captain America is the soul of the film, bringing the heroes to fight together against Ultron in the climactic, unbelievable battle, which left me lost for words. I have rarely experienced such a feeling and 'Age of Ultron' had me regularly gasping, cheering and crying. Bless Joss Whedon who brings heart, humour and soul to The Avengers. I am left utterly speechless and cannot imagine regaining this feeling until 'Avengers: Infinity War Part I' which will be released in 2018.<br/><br/>As cinematographer Ben Davis can do no wrong. Having previously photographed 'Guardians of the Galaxy', it is clear that with 'Age of Ultron' he is relaxed and in his element. No praise I could give him would be sufficient. <br/><br/>The score composed by Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler is what fan boys like me; hear in their heads, when imagining their favourite heroes being brought to life. I'm still humming the theme tune and will be buying the soundtrack upon its release. What pleased me the most about the score was the inclusion of Alan Silvestri's Avengers theme, what a tremendous homage indeed.<br/><br/>Mightier than Thor's hammer, funnier than Stark's trademark wit and smarter than Banner's brain; 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a comic book film that rules above all others."
"tjgoalie13","9","17","37","6 May 2015"," Not as good as The Avengers, but still great.
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is fast paced, funny, and is filled with awesome action sequences. Most people will enjoy watching this epic comic book collaboration. Ultron, the film's antagonist, serves as a great villain with an interesting god complex, and the movie is surprisingly deep. However the film suffers from some spotty special effects (which is surprising considering that Marvel had one of the best visual effects companies in the world working on it), some uneven tone, and rushed pacing (especially in terms of Ultron's creation). That being said, while it's not as good as The Avengers, Age of Ultron makes up for it's shortcomings with great dialogue and a gigantic climax, and is a great time at the theaters."
"mordan9","4","17","37","2 May 2015"," Mostly Boring
","Mostly boring. First hour is OK. Then it just becomes boring.<br/><br/>Mindless entertainment for brainwashed and overworked ants.<br/><br/>1) I guess people like to be reassured by invincible super heroes.<br/><br/>2) I watched Guardians of the Galaxy and knew this movie will be the same boring stunt. Shame on me. But this is a little better than Guardians.<br/><br/>3) Ultron started well. The villain seemed decent. But as soon as Ultron started to make stupid decisions, i felt asleep and wanted to leave. Ultron is supposed to be super intelligent. Ultron fight Cap working as a decoy while his most beloved asset is left unattented. HOW STUPID IS THAT?????? He is supposed to SEE WITH ALL HIS ROBOTS. And WHAT? Only 2 robots for defense in the truck????????? OMG OMG OMG OMG. This is an insult to computer's intelligence. This movie is definitely for brainless humans that just want.... the kind of drug they give to people in ""Brave New World"".<br/><br/>4) You see blue on screen... and then the movie tells you... not actually it was red. Bad guy die. Heros win. So boring. So nonsensical.<br/><br/>They got my money and wasted 2 hours of my time. I lost. BTW I don't trust IMDb ratings anymore. Im starting to think they are selling good ratings."
"jono2000","8","17","37","24 April 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron could be the greatest superhero movie of all time.
","I went into Avengers: Age of Ultron knowing that I was about to watch an excellent movie. I wasn't wrong. From the first action sequence to the last, Age of Ultron was visually spectacular. The characters and their motives were as always, very interesting. Ultron for example, he is the evil version of Tony Stark; they can't tell the difference between saving people and destruction. That is conveyed very well in the movie kept we intrigued as to what will happen next.<br/><br/>NEW CHARACTERS: Quicksilver was visually a pleasure to see and I loved how protective he is over his sister. The Scarlet Witch is possibly my second favorite Avenger next to Captain America. Like Quicksilver's, her powers are a visual spectacle. Her powers are also far more intriguing than anyone else's. She has a very interesting personality, but her personality seems to be guided by her powers. The Vision is only introduced about three quarters of the way into the movie, and he is a complex character. He isn't J.A.R.V.I.S., nor is he Ultron. He has his own individual personality and it is complex. <br/><br/>10/10 Avengers: Age of Ultron could be the greatest superhero movie of all time. It's definitely the best one I have ever seen."
"m-h-stevenson","2","20","45","2 June 2015"," The Legal battle starts
","Iv been told I have a high standard in movies, perhaps I do. But I guess when we are all treated to the cinematic prowess of Matrix 2 and 3, transformers 4 (but lets face it they all weren't that good going from ""ok sure' downward), pirates of the Caribbean 4, and even Jupiter ascending, that bar is set rather high. Hopefully that made my point.<br/><br/>The opening scene goes into an elaborate, over the top CGI'ed battle, that 4 or 5 minutes in works out where it went wrong and tones it down. Only to have that whole story line completely disregarded aside from a small one line for the rest of the film<br/><br/>I have never seen a good vs evil movie like this that I found myself rooting for the bad guy so much, as bad as the script writing for ultron was, James Spaders charisma still shone through and made me reminisce of better James Sader movies and TV series. Even the typical monologue stance of Alan Shaw was represented. However that is where the charisma halted. Also after an hour not sure who wouldn't be rooting for him to put us all out of our misery.<br/><br/>A love story thrown in the middle of it makes us raise our eyebrows for a second before realising it was just piled on top and no thought put into it. The battle scenes seemed more like something out of transformers where metal smashing into metal we are expected to know what is going on and which chunk of metal is the good and bad. The one liners.. oh the one liners<br/><br/>Everyone who loved the speedy kid in xmen days of future past got to see his twin European brother. The next avengers movie may work better as it might be the combination of the avengers and guardians of the galaxy, who I rate highly cause its like the creators know its not a serious movie, there is actual humour and characters you end up caring about cause its just good wholesome fun.<br/><br/>The 2 reasons this didn't get a 1/10 is James Spader; and I have seen 15 minutes of another movie that easily outdoes this movie as worst movie ever made. <br/><br/>All in all I want to explore my legal options in getting compensation back for losing 2 and a half hours of my life that I'll never get back."

"alexcousinsf1","6","15","32","2 May 2015"," Disappointing (Warning Spoilers)
","Right, when marvel first started this, back in 2008 with Iron man they built a good base on what to follow, Captain America then Thor, the incredible Hulk and then the First Avengers film. Which being a massive Spider-man Fan at the time i was annoyed about how good the film was and he wasn't in it!<br/><br/>It really set the stone, as the Iron man films were consistently good in my opinion, and Thor 2 was much better than the first, then also Cap 2 and brilliantly Guardians of the Galaxy but then after waiting 3 years here comes, Avengers Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The trailer, well looked brilliant, seeing the hulk buster, Ultron looking bad-ass, new hero's in scarlet witch and quicksilver and fiction between cap and iron man for next years cap 3 film.<br/><br/>So sorry about not getting to the point but here we go first the:<br/><br/>Action: Good fight scenes, (Hulk buster fight) also maybe too much action? this that fair to say? maybe because having a lot of character's in the film didn't help this as you didn't know who to look at, also some fights appear too unrealistic at times and the cgi appears poor. 6/10<br/><br/>Comedy: Films strongest point, it has consistent humor throughout the film and keeps this good quality like the first, it has very funny moments, like taking turns to lift Thor's hammer. 9/10 <br/><br/>New Characters: Firstly the twins, scarlet witch and quicksilver (not the x-men ones though) was OK, their stores were OK, they too me just seemed a little lost on what to do here, they didn't feel ready yet and vision, well he was very good, what you imagine him to be like in the comics. 7/10<br/><br/>Plot: This is were the film lacks, you feel lost sometimes, i mean they rushed into the film with action and your like wow slow down a little here, you want it too build up in a film don't you? Also when creating Ultron, they seem to rush him when stark is creating him and then how Ultron develops himself as well, it didn't just have the same depth of quality as the first Avengers Film. Some parts feel forced, so the plot feels a little bit messy in places which is frustrating as they had a good base for the film. 5/10<br/><br/>Villain: Well this has to be the most disappointing part of the film, as well when we looked at Ultron in the trailer, honestly what did you expect? really poor, as he's rushed, then easily defeated at the end, i mean you want him to be throwing the avengers around, like Loki did, but he did it in a different way, using his brain and slyness and going back to Ultron, he's a 8-10 ft robot, genius as well, but no they make him look weak and thats disappointing as he comes back in the comics a lot but no sign of him still being alive, well in AL form. 4/10<br/><br/>End Credits: your probably thinking I'm mad thinking i should rate the end credits part, but because marvel have done this brilliantly and its age of Ultron, you would think its going to be amazing but no way, we already know whats happening in avengers 3, so we don't need to be shown something we already know, we wanted something new, like Black Panther, Spider-man, Ant-man, doctor strange or even a civil war hint. 3/10<br/><br/>Building towards future films: this mainly for me is Civil war, as this is going to be a big film, it could of been an Avengers Film even as its that big as it introduces a lot of new characters, but its ending up being Captain America's 3rd film and there is not enough friction between these too in the film, there is a little but not enough, at the end (SPOILER) they smile, (cap and stark) acting like best friends and part their ways i mean, what? That is all in my view and that all their needed to be 5/10 <br/><br/>So overall this gets a 6/10, not bad but not great in my opinion, but do go and see the film and see if you agree.<br/><br/>Thank you for Reading <br/><br/>Alexander Cousins"

","One of the biggest challenge this movie has to overcome is hype! where the only acceptable review for fans is ""This is the Best Superhero Movie ever made""<br/><br/>So after reading so many threads trying to convince everyone this is the worst Marvel movie ever made i was little bit skeptical walking into the theater but i ended up walking out pretty Happy.<br/><br/>Not to say the movie doesn't have any problems but then again no movie is without!<br/><br/>this is my NO SPOILER list of Pros & Cons of the movie.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/><br/>Exposition, strangely enough most Sci-Fi movies have a little too much exposition but AoU really needed some exposition in many scenes.<br/><br/>Without spoiling Ultron & Vision needed a little more explaining although i get the feeling this may be by design.<br/><br/>Humour I really love Whedon's humour this movie genuinely had me laughing at most jokes, but a couple of times i felt like they could have been tones down.<br/><br/>Nick Fury Deus ex machina again after seeing the latest AoS feel like this might be explained as well.<br/><br/>Pacing: Some argued the pacing of the first movie felt slow in the middle this one is way too fast throughout, they could have slowed down a couple time & extend the runtime by a few more minutes.<br/><br/>Super Nerdy not really a con, i personally love that but i can see how average moviegoers might not get it and this being the 12th movie it relies on you to know some of the backstory.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/><br/>Avengers! everything that worked in the first movie team dynamic, one lines & character moments are awesome and still feel fresh<br/><br/>Ultron, Yes he is a good villain!!!! he could have been fleshed out a little more but he has the cunningness of Loki & Raw physical power of Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Vision, the less said about Vision the better but i get the feeling he will go on to be one of the more memorable Avenger.<br/><br/>MCU: Happy to see this is not an isolated incident on earth like Iron Man 3 this has deep & far reaching ties into the MCU<br/><br/>ACTION: watch in 2D this movie has some of the best action choreography in a superhero movie,most notably Opening,Hulkbuster & climax <br/><br/>So these are the short list of PROS & CONS off the top of my head i really enjoyed the movie, its a lot better the second time another stellar addition to MCU."
"prabhatrayal","6","15","32","28 April 2015"," Even Scarlett and Quicksilver cant save this movie
","I had high hopes for this movie as Avengers was pretty good. I enjoyed the first Avengers even though I had some problems with that film. That movie had some great lines like ""I am always angry"" and some nice humorous lines thrown here and there. That, unfortunately, is not the case with Avengers: Age of Ultron. Most of the dialogues in this film are one-liners and the humor is wasted. Let's talk about the positives of Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>1-The CGI is really great. 2-Action scenes are brilliant even though some of them are over the top. 3-It's still a good sequel to the Avengers. 4-the movie gives us some hints about the next Avengers. 5-It's a great buildup for Avengers: Infinity Wars 6-Now let's talk about the problems with this film.<br/><br/>Bad Things About Avengers: Age of Ultron<br/><br/>1-The first problem I had with this film is that there are too many subplots which aren't relevant to the plot at all. 2-Then the clichéd story about a man building an AI for the betterment of people which turns out to be bad, and in this case REALLY BAD. 3-Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are thrown into the movie out of nowhere without any character development. 4-However, the biggest problem I had with this film was HULK- Natasha romance. There was no chemistry between them and when did it happen? 5-Then suddenly we come to know that Hawkeye has a family. 6-Ultron looked bad-ass in the beginning but after the interval he didn't seem like a big deal. Even fighting hulk looked more perilous than fighting Ultron. 7-Quicksilver dies and we are supposed to feel emotional, but we don't because his character is not given enough depth. 8-Now, Scarlett Witch is given the single task to protect the machine. But No, she will not use her brain. She has to face Ultron so that someone can turn on the machine and kill humanity + How else will she be able to recreate the Lord of The Rings scene where Eowyn Kills the Witch King of Angmar? 9-The climax brings back the memories of Iron-man 3 with so many robots flying in the sky. And sometimes you get a feeling that (I hate to say this) you are watching Transformers. <br/><br/>There are no memorable dialogues, nor the great moments which the Avengers had. All you get is 2:30 hours of mindless action with cool CGI. Most of the dialogues are one-liners. There is this one fight scene between Hulkbuster and Hulk which is GREAT (and perhaps the only scene where the humor works). So if you want to see some cool effects then go for it. It seems that its just a buildup for ""Avengers: Infinity War"" because in a scene Thor takes a dip into a pool to know more about Infinity stones which is really funny. 6/10 from my side."
"cjennings-79827","7","15","32","22 April 2015"," Solid movie. Not the same charm as the first
","I came out of this movie talking about the parts I loved and the parts I didn't, and I think that's what makes it differ from the first. After Avengers Assemble I was actually pretty quiet, because I thought that I was starting see an equivalent of Star Wars or Indianna Jones coming to theatres in my time. Age of Ultron left more to be desired, and didn't leave quite the impact I had hoped, and experienced with the first.<br/><br/>The movie suffered with an over saturation of characters. I didn't really care for Quicksilver or Scarlet Witch until close to the end. Captain America wasn't nearly as much a big deal this time. Having all these big players meant that only Iron Man was able to really step into the spotlight (as usual). Although it was nice to see Hawkeye in more than a trance state this time.<br/><br/>****SPOILERS**** My biggest problem with this film was creating a romance between Black Widow and The Hulk. It wasn't so much that it was done badly, or wasn't believable, it just felt unnecessary. Black Widow was such a badass in her past movies, and she continues to be but they tag on this Banner's girlfriend/""Save Me Hulk"" thing which overshadows it a bit this time around. They could have easily shown her more human/relaxed side and develop a close connection with Banner if they kept it platonic, but they took the most badass girl in the MCU and attached her to a boyfriend. Don't we have enough of that with Pepper and Jane?<br/><br/>Quick points -Ultron is a great villain (James Spader nailed it) - Loved seeing more Hawkeye, as he was one of the funnier characters - Captain America didn't seem to be the leader he was in the first -Vision was only really characterised in his first scene, then he just punched things until the end -Hulkbuster fight was fantastic<br/><br/>I may be focusing on more negative than I should. This movie really is worth seeing, but for fans of the first and the individual movies, this may fall a bit flat. The best way I could describe it, would be saying it was a ""Paint by numbers"" Avengers, which lacks the charm of the likes of Guardians of the Galaxy or Avengers: Assemble."
"RemusGrey","7","18","40","3 May 2015"," It's bigger, darker, and it's not the best Marvel movie. But it's still fun!
","The much anticipated movie of 2015 is The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. It's a different kind of sequel. This kind of sequel differs from it predecessor. It's bigger and darker. But it has one thing that is still the same. Both the predecessor and sequel is still fun.<br/><br/>The movie is about Tony Stark and Bruce Banner who created a peacekeeping program called ""The Ultron Program"". But when something goes terribly wrong, the Avengers must reassemble to stop Ultron from destroying the world.<br/><br/>Seems like the theme is much darker. The first Avengers movie felt like a culmination of something. The sequel is trying to build bigger things. It feels like a transition, just a necessary step towards the bigger finale that the brain trust behind these films has planned for the years ahead. It does feel like it's straining under the weight of competing concerns. <br/><br/>Ultron was a perfect choice as the antagonist from the director Joss Whedon. He is a really threatening villain, making the movie a dark toned one. But even though Ultron is a very likable villain, the film never really allows him to be the threat that he could be. But the film limits itself mainly to physical encounters, its superintelligent villain apparently lacking the imagination to do anything beyond sending wave after wave of drones after the heroes. <br/><br/>Surprisingly, Ultron's voice is really a scary and extraordinary role from James Spader who voiced him. But it never quite brings the menace that the big villain should. And thus, the villain and the entire film end up feeling like placeholders for bigger developments to come. The movie still has its joys. There were many fun moments in the movie. And one that feels like they really are in a party. Plus the action scenes were awesome!<br/><br/>Acting was very good. Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans and Hemsworth still fit in their roles as Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor. Scarlett Johanson and Mark Ruffalo are very good in their roles, though their romance was very useless in the movie (except the lullaby for the Hulk). Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye always has the best lines in the movie. Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch did have a mistake in some of their European accents, but roles were still good. Too bad Aaron Taylor-Johnson won't be in Civil War because his character died in the movie (and what his sacrifice for a child and Hawkeye was very emotional). <br/><br/>The Avengers 2 is bigger and darker. Darker story and bigger movie. But it still has one thing in common with the predecessor. The fun things in the movie. 9/10.<br/><br/>P.S. stay for the 2 minute credits for an extra scene. After that, leave. No scene after all the credits at all."
"thatsnotsanta","10","18","40","24 April 2015"," This was worth the wait
","From the opening scene you are swept in the action that exceeds all it's MCU predecessors. The old cast is introduced and the last of the Hydra is taken down in a truly exploding fashion and the story starts to unfold.The Hulk casually running through a bunker or throwing a freaking tank are just few things that take place in the first scene.<br/><br/>After being created by mistake, Ultron starts to get menacing very fast. His intentions are clear from the get go. The Avengers and humanity must be annihilated. James Spader voicing the notorious villain is absolutely perfect. The depth of his voice and gestures will give you goosebumps. Besides being a sociopath and a murderous AI robot, he is actually very funny.<br/><br/>There is a lot that goes into creating the Vision. I would have loved to see more of his powers and abilities but maybe in the later movies. A great add the the MCU anyways as well as are ""the twins"" Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Black Widows and Hawkeyes back stories are widened and we get to know a little more about them. The character development is consistent with everybody. Hawkeyes especially. That is only a good thing.<br/><br/>The humor that is present in almost every scene may not be as appealing to people who are not familiar with the characters and history of The Avengers. For us fanboys it is like the best candy you've ever tasted. Kept smiling for a long time after a good one-liner. The funniest moment wasn't actually what someone said. The Vision simply lifting Thors hammer and handing it to him made the whole theater burst in laughs. Wau! Unreal.<br/><br/>To sum things up. The action is thrilling. CGI is spotless. The Hulk is angry. The jokes are funny. You cannot ask for more. Very enjoyable movie through and through."

Keep it up MARVEL Universe!!! Quite ingenious I must say. I was beginning to think that the whole superhero movie franchise were becoming rather redundant with a lot of clichéd story lines and just senseless action without really connecting to the audience but Joss Whedon definitely gave me a run for my money and a movie I can ruminate on at least for the rest of the year. The movie was a brilliant masterpiece with a perfect blend of romance, comedy, action, and thrill. Its a shame though that Joss wouldn't be directing the next set of Avengers forthcoming because I really think the guy's a hybrid of Talent and Genius."

I also liked the the use of characters they put Into this movie, and for viewers that read this review I recommend watching this movie you would really really enjoy this action packed film. It compacted with the first one and that is one way to create a good sequel to a movie because you can remember the things that happened in the 1st movie and then you can link it up with this film ""Avengers Age Of Ultron"" I would like them to try and make another film of the Avengers.

"thatxandish","10","16","35","24 April 2015"," Marvel's Best Film Yet
","I've recently returned from the cinema after seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, which was released in UK cinemas yesterday, and I have to say; Marvel have really outdone themselves.<br/><br/>Upon first hearing about the premise of the film, and especially after seeing the first teaser, I was very sceptical. The CGI looked mediocre and the villain, story, and minions seemed like a complete rehash of the first film. However I was pleasantly surprised to find that in cinemas the CGI is terrific, easily some of the best I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The villain was original, and actually a very likable and extremely interesting character. I was worried the use of a robot army would seem to much like the Chitauri, however they were very different in the way they attacked, the way they were defeated, and they each had a personality and some real depth and character to them. One even plays a crucial part in the climax of the final battle.<br/><br/>Another thing I was worried about was the possibility of there being too many characters, but it worked perfectly. The twins didn't seem underdeveloped, and Ultron and the Vision especially had a lot of personality. The transition of the twins from villains to Avengers worked extremely well, and all of the Avengers continued to be developed and given further depth.<br/><br/>This brings me on to the acting. Apart from the twins' accents - which actually didn't annoy me as much as I thought they would, but were still a tad unnecessary - the acting was stupendous. James Spader was perfect as Ultron, from the deep and menacing snarls all the way to the character's lighter, more sarcastic tones. All of the original cast retained their excellent performances from the first, if not giving better ones, and the newly added cast, specifically Elizabeth Olsen and whoever played Clint's associate (trying not to spoil a big moment) were all beautifully realistic, passionate, and strong, and all of the performances and splendid writing lead to a perfect mixture of action, tragedy, and comedy.<br/><br/>In conclusion; the film is a masterpiece, easily the film of the year, and easily the best film Marvel Studios has ever produced. I recommend it to anyone and everyone, and I rate it 1000,000,000,000,000,000 out of 10"
"conwaypaul10","9","16","35","22 April 2015"," Avengers Age of Ultron - The bar has been set sky high once again!!! 9.8/10
","(Only Avengers Assemble spoilers below)<br/><br/>So I had the night to digest the premiere of Avengers: Age of Ultron and in a nutshell it's safe to say this truly is an epic sequel of massive proportions. (Before I go any further go see this in IMAX or the biggest screen available to you, but seriously spend the extra few euro for IMAX it WILL BE WORTH EVERY CENT)<br/><br/>The big question isdid it top the 1st Avengers??? Personally I don't think so, but it really didn't fall short by much at all.<br/><br/>This sequel does excel from its predecessor in terms of the Special Effects, Action, Character screen time and decent back stories for some characters anyway, yet the feeling of that overall suspenseful drama was slightly less apparent this time around rather than their 1st outing, for example they never give us that {Hold your breath moment} like in the 1st Avengers when Iron Man free falls back to earth after chucking the Nuke into the space worm hole and he was left looking like he is not coming back from this in one piece and BOOM the Hulk saves him or when Bruce Banner quotes ""I'm ALWAYS angry"" and went on to destroy absolutely everything in his path to help save the day. That just didn't happen to the same emotional scale as the 1st but don't worry that won't take away from the overall experience.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon done an amazing job giving all the Avengers their deserved screen time to show case their own skills and action sequences, Night Hawk shines in this one with some great one liners, Black Widow has a lot more screen time and the Twins make a great new addition to the franchise, Thor and Capt America are also show cased very well. All characters have upped the ante TEN FOLD!<br/><br/>The Hulk vs The Hulk Buster-(Iron Man) what can I saythis action sequence is truly something very special that can only be properly portrayed and appreciated in an IMAX theatre, it 100% lives up to the snippet in the trailers, the word epic simply doesn't cover it, IMAX BASS is positively tested here.<br/><br/>Ultron was brilliant as the Villain, a little rushed but still very well handled. I can't really go into anything here without giving spoilers away; James Spader was definitely the right choice for the role, his evil tone and general malice towards humans as Ultron is exceptional!<br/><br/>The Overall Verdict: The Avengers: Age of Ultron is yet another amazing Marvel feat that will satisfy all Marvel fans to the core, its only real competition is the 1st Avengers. You will be left mind blown and buzzed just like the 1st Avengers and believe me you DO NOT have to worry about rumours that the best bits of the movie have already been shown in the trailers that couldn't be any further from the truth. The classic Iron Man/Avengers humour has been ramped up in this one and is executed perfectly so prepare for Great Laughs and a Kick Ass, Cool, Action Filled, Blockbuster matched only by its predecessor.<br/><br/>The Avengers: Age of Ultron 9.8/10<br/><br/>The Avengers Assemble 10/10<br/><br/>The Avengers will return."
"MovieNinjaGuy","4","14","30","26 May 2015"," Totally forgettable
","I saw this film in 4DX and whilst the 4DX effects were great and got you involved in the action in places the film itself eventually is totally forgettable. I even started to doze off in the middle of the film because everything became so tedious and you just could not feel involved in the story. <br/><br/>A huge story isn't necessary I think to make a great film. For example Terminator 2 and Mad Max Fury Road in essence have very simple basic stories (mostly a chase in both these films), but yet these two films are very watchable and you feel involved with what is going on and there is a sense of development within the characters' motivation . Nothing like that happens here in this mundane sequel to Avengers Assemble. What you know at the end is exactly the same as at the beginning, What is the point? Our heroes are amazing and no matter how much chaos Tony Stark indirectly inflicts, he's awesome, cool, drives an amazing car and has a great lifestyle. His beautiful girlfriend is absent from this film but he's too cool to care probably. Iron Man 3 got equally stupid and pointless.<br/><br/>Ultron is created by Tony Stark and straight away turns on the super heroes. This is quite stupid and makes a mockery of Tony Stark and Ultron. James Spader is only here in voice and that is a real shame. Perhaps a more cheesy story of a crazy nut-case professor turning himself into a powerful robot would have worked better. It certainly would have made more sense as Tony Stark is totally not held accountable for his insane and quite criminal actions it seems.<br/><br/>Two new characters are introduced and quickly switch from helping out Ultron to joining the Avengers club. We don't have enough good guys already it seems.<br/><br/>To defeat Ultron eventually Tony Stark creates another being from Loki's Sceptre. Tony doesn't learn does he, as obviously this one will really help out right? Now another character is introduced; Vision, yes another good guy. Awful humor and awful dialogue follow (""I was born yesterday"" and Vision can pick up Thor's hammer no problem etc).<br/><br/>Ultron is defeated by destroying his robot army. It seems Ultron existing outside the physical form, in the internet is forgotten about. Why? Will he come back?<br/><br/>Also why is this film called Age of Ultron when everything plays out in a few days?<br/><br/>The heroes never faced any real danger it seems, just some weird dream states which was not really explored or used by Ultron effectively (the trailer really made you believe Iron Man turned on the Hulk because of Ultron's supposedly Puppets on Sting ability or ""destroying them from the inside out"" and not because of some silly argument or over reacting from Hulk). The need to save the humans in the city that was lifted up by Ultron was simply not executed well. I really could not have cared less about any individual in the film. It reminded me so much of Man of Steel which has similar problems. There just comes a time when you start to think ""everyone can just die and then I can leave the cinema. What does it matter?""<br/><br/>Great effects, weak story (or at least weak motivation and no character development), no urge or justification to anything that happened and nothing to warrant this sequel in the first place all equate to a totally forgettable film. The actors all seem to deliver their lines very statically. It was more like a play than a real movie in places (i.e. you had to imagine more danger than there was perhaps). Compare this to the insane action in Mad Max Fury Road where it really seems Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy are getting hurt and are close to death. <br/><br/>Age of Ultron is just not good enough to justify a re-watch or let alone owning the film on any media form. It would have been much better to have watched the first outing of the Avengers again in the cinema with the 4DX effects. A complete Marvel U-turn from Guardians of the Galaxy greatness I think."
"buny101","6","14","30","2 May 2015"," umm...too much...much too much
","Fans will hate me. Heck, I kind of hate myself...but very disappointed in this film. Oh, even my children will hate me. My seven year old said, ""Just awesome...awesome..."" when asked about this movie. And, to a seven year old, it is awesome. And truthfully, the movie doesn't fail on any particular point...but there is just too much. The movie is about Tony Stark making the world a safer place by making an automated defense system, which gains sentient life, and decides that the world would be better off without mankind or the avengers to muck with it. Boiled down, it is the monster from Frankenstein that turns on it's creator. Not a bad story. The problem I have is that there are 15 characters. Hulk, Banner (so different that they have to be listed separately), Iron Man, Cap, Thor, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Nick Fury, Prof. Jane, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, etc. The characters from the other movies that don't show up get mentioned. I heard about Pepper and Loki and etc etc. Look, we've been getting 2 hour movies based on each character. A two hour movie about Captain America, a two hour movie about Iron Man, a two hour movie about Thor....if you think you can shoehorn all these characters, and 5 times as many, into one movie and try to tell a decent story, you're wrong. With all those characters, we are reduced to watching fight scene after fight scene with quick cuts to each character, and in the end, you just felt lost. You can't watch a video about DDAY and watch every soldier...so you pick up with Tom Hanks and follow his crew up the beach. You can't see everything, so you have to focus on one small element in that frame, and you go with that. They had so much to throw at the screen, it was hard to keep it going, and hard to care. <br/><br/>So...I don't care. I found myself more interested in the popcorn. Oh, I think it's going to be a huge success, and I will look forward to seeing it on DVD where I can pause, rewind, and laugh (and lot's of good humor, though a couple of jokes are kind of adult in nature which is odd in a kids movie), and I will enjoy the heck out of the cd. But, honestly, I got lost in the movie, and exhausted trying to keep up with all the characters, and in the end, it just wasn't fun. <br/><br/>It would have been awesome if it had one solo hero going after ultron, and then just getting help from the rest of the avengers....wouldn't it?"
"ArchonCinemaReviews","6","14","30","2 May 2015"," Weakest Marvel film of the series
","There was bound to be a time when the masters at Marvel would make a misstep and Avengers: Age of Ultron is that disappointing moment.<br/><br/>We at Archon Reviews like to keep our reviews as ""clean"" as possible. Avengers: Age of Ultron leads us to be forced to utilize a term that breaks that rule. Joss Whedon's Age of Ultron is a clusterf#$k of massive proportions.<br/><br/>It was inevitable, and Age of Ultron is proof that even the minds at Marvel Entertainment are not perfect. And Joss Whedon most of all, bites off significantly more than he can handle.<br/><br/>As a story, Age of Ultron feels light years ahead of where the previous Marvel films left off, like a horror movie on its eighth installment. Age of Ultron's plot is convoluted and the entire film lacks the structure of a story with intent that propels itself into being made into a film.<br/><br/>We propel forward to a time when Tony Stark has jump started a peacekeeping programming using androids and state of the art computer programming. Then we jump forward again as the group known as the Avengers realize an entity in the form of Stark's unintentionally created Artificial Intelligence seeks to malevolently target Earth. Of course, our superheros will fight with everything they have to save the world.<br/><br/>Everything about Age of Ultron is forced. From the unnecessarily complicated, multi-layered story, the side characters and the newly manufactured characters that nonchalantly get introduced. Age of Ultron feels dull and lifeless, a blockbuster to cash in on the Marvel name. This fate is completely unlike the caliber of material we Marvel fans are accustomed to and typically resigned to Michael Bay concoctions. Marvel: you are better than this.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is tired and even the actors appear to have difficulty uttering the dialogue. Those familiar faces from the previous films still do an adequate job but newcomers like Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are laughably inferior. Both the acting, diction and casting director should be fired from the next Avengers film, if there even is one. There are comedic moments in the film, but unlike the initial Avengers film, feel gimmicky and are painfully overused.<br/><br/>I understand that at this point in the Marvel franchise, the filmmakers had a huge task in front of them. Unfortunately, they fail and the film produced for Marvel lovers is a disappointment. And this is not coming from the vapid whining of a superfan.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."
"nwood1976","7","14","30","23 April 2015"," Age of Underwhelmed
","OK so its not a bad Movie, lets set that straight its far from being a bad Movie. Its easy to criticise and for a stand alone action sequences there was some real blood and thunder. The Storyline was a little clunky in progression and didn't flow as well as you'd like well at times but for near 2 and a half hours you're caught up with the adrenalin of the movie and dragged along for a roller-coaster ride and you're not given time to think hang on what just happened let alone did it make sense.<br/><br/>Ultimately though I walked away feeling slightly underwhelmed. Perhaps I expected more. Perhaps I expected too much.<br/><br/>Point is that the Marvel Cinematic Universe didn't give us much different. Hulk vs. Hulbuster was a spectacle but given the amount of pre release coverage this slug fest was given you didn't get too see much more than already alluded to or indeed shown. Other than that most of the action scenes had been seen elsewhere if in a slightly different guise.<br/><br/>The addition of Quicksilver and the Scarlett Witch to the team provided some difference (given there abilities - don't call them mutants though).Story lines of all the new and existing characters felt in the main rushed and superficial - always a danger with such a large ensemble cast.<br/><br/>Even the supposedly hell bent on all humanities destruction that was supposed to be manifest in Ultron only showed glimpses of his genuine menace that could have been elaborated on so much better. I mean come on he's captured one of Earths mightiest heroes and he leaves them in a James Bond style easily escapable cell. He never felt like a threat let alone an evil one and once again the Marvel Cinematic Universe fails to deliver a genuinely believable enemy. This film could have been so much darker and better for it.<br/><br/>Some other glaring plot holes/anomalies: How'd Iron Man get back on board following where we left him at the end of IM3? Where'd Nick Fury been post CA: The Winter Soldier? How'd Ultron get into his 2nd incarnation? What was Thor messing about at in a rock pool? Was The Vision given enough of an introduction or explanation? How were the Avengers even re-assembled? Could Portman and Paltrow not have been coaxed out for the briefest of cameos? <br/><br/>Plenty of the 3rd phase of films was teed up but the anticipated Stark and Rogers pre Civil War Tension was lacking.<br/><br/>The action, acting, one liners, were excellent are as has come to be expected and could not be faulted. Perhaps the present characters have come as far as they can without becoming stale and detracting from the franchise.<br/><br/>Even the Credits scene was a little unnecessary what was his involvement with any of the 141 minutes that had preceded him.........although how did he get that Glove? Mr Loki would you like to offer an explanation? <br/><br/>With the Team ending in a different collective and several new faces to come between now and Infinity War Part 1 perhaps an unofficial reboot wont prove to be a such a bad thing."

"LogicIsEverything","Null","43","111","19 May 2015"," So messy, so stupid and so hollow
","When the messy ""Transformer"" franchise spin out of control with uncontrollable, over-the-top computerized CGI crap, I thought that this kinda comic books adapted crap would be bad enough to alert the viewers not to watch such similar genre crap again and again, they would have thought ""enough is enough"" and would not be lured and fooled into the theaters to see another similar crap with different titles. but take a look at this film's budget and its gross collected in America only. It only proved that our viewers' I.Q.s have become even lower than when the ""Transformer"" series were released.<br/><br/>What we got here is an ambitious and greedy endeavor trying to include all the comic books heroes to create a video game like hollow movie, by endless crappy fight after fight, situation after situation nothingness again and again. The computer generated special effects have ruined the creativity of decent screenplay writing, the absolutely necessity of decent acting of actors. Acting and directing only replaced by stunts, acting turned into nothing but hanging cables, shifting all over the places and directions just in front of a green screen. Dialog all turned into robotic language. Endless action and fighting scenes replaced all the logic storyline, scenarios and plots. Special effects dominated everything on the screen, forcing viewers to look at the screen with nothing but computer generated dizzy, fuzzy, messy destruction, explosions, flash...., movies have changed into video game like hollow and superfluous patchworks. All these craps have just paved the way for immediate future releases of similar titled video games. kids and those who refused to grow up timely and appropriately only know to use their fingers and reflexes to replace logic thinking and reasoning. They don't want anything realistic in life but fantasies, they don't want peacefulness but endless and senseless target killings to add their playing scores. Did you ever really use one bit of your brain to realize that computer games fool you to kill bad guys, aliens, vampires and zombies, claiming that you are doing good to mankind, maintaining and keep the civilization from destruction....such and such are nothing but commercial gimmicks. Microsoft, Sony, Disney and all those cunning Hollywood grease balls are only trying to grab all the hard earned money by you or your parents to enrich their bank accounts? Why don't you just take one minute or just one moment to compare all these movies and video games with each other, seeing the repeated similarity of them. Why you never got tired of these craps? This particular film is trying to fool and mess up your I.Q., your logic and your normal process of maturity. Hollywood knows that only keep you at the level of elementary school level and manipulates you by keep watching these kinda films would forever fixed you as morons, because only morons would pay willingly to glorify the gross of the box office records."

"nancyldraper","9","3","4","19 March 2019"," A multilayered saga
","This Avengers is more layered which makes it feel longer and may cause the restless to loose interest but the transitions are well placed, paced and contain some poignant moments, deepening the story. The cast just gets more star studded, all bringing great performances. Joss Whedon is just the best at crafting his stories and because he is such a fanboy of his subject we get lots nice little touches, like the machine (Ultron) that needs an audience (first the Twins and later the Black Widow) and the twist on who is worthy to weld Mjolnir (Thor's Hammer). The stop action montages are beautifully crafted (I wanted to say they are 'rad', but I didn't want to be accused of age appropriation). There is a wonderful balance of big grand moments and nice little personal moments and still the trademark wit that sets the tone. Although my least favourite of the Avengers combo packs, upon rewatching it still comes close to the bar. I give this film a 9 (superb) out of 10 {Superheroes Action Adventure}"

","This is another underrated Marvel movie, among the likes of Iron Man 3 and Thor. I think that this is one of the most enjoyable movies in the MCU. The acting is, like always, extremely great. Ultron was an okay villain for a film that focuses a lot more on the heroes and the way they have evolved through these movies. This has some of my favorite moments in the MCU, such as the Hulk Vs Hulkbuster scene. The comedy was also great, such as the 'language' jokes throughout.

"rolfesam","5","3","4","8 October 2017"," You Can't Think About This Movie
","OK, I'm going to preface this review by saying that overall I am a fan of the MCU and I think they've given the world a fair few really good movies and the remaining ones are almost always OK. That feat is something that is commendable and something that I doubt will ever be recaptured over a series that has this many movies in it. <br/><br/>Now that that is out of the way let's get our hands dirty. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is a dumb movie. That in of itself isn't a damning thing really, a lot of great movies are dumb and rely more on emotions to connect the audience to the plot but in this movie the emotional connection is very scarce which is pretty unforgivable for a movie nearly 2.5 hours in length. There are two emotional parts to the movie which are both short parts to the film that I found to be much more engaging and relatable than the rest of the movie as a whole and I would be much more interested in an MCU movie that simply expanded on them. These two parts being the party where the Avengers are all hanging about and interacting in a way that reminded me that these actors are actually all really talented. like seriously, who here forgot that this cast has been nominated for a combined 9 Oscars? Anyway the other scene is where the group spends a few days isolated on one of their members property. Once again I'd love to see an entire movie focused solely on these characters and how they get along but we will never get that film so oh well. <br/><br/>The action in the movie is good if not a little too clean for a movie in which there is a explosive highway chase, a flying city and a derailed train but this is technically a Disney flick so I'll let it slide. <br/><br/>The thing that I do not intend to let slide is the emotional manipulation that the movie tries to pass of to its audience. I find it pretty absurd that the same people who have accomplished so much with Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even Dr. Strange are willing to turn in such canned and phony plot beats and call it an Avengers movie. I mean the first movie even has a scene that perfectly explains exactly what this movie tries to un-ironically accomplish (the scene with the bloody trading cards if you were wondering). It is really something that stops me every time I think about re watching this movie because it irks me too much. Every single new character is treated with the same level of tragic backstory as a middle-schooler's OC in a fanfiction, its pathetic.<br/><br/>But at the end of the day if you are willing to simply go into a movie and be satisfied with people punching things to solve their problems then you will be fine with this movie. Just try not to think about it too much, you may accidentally put more thought into it than the writers."
"judywalker2","5","12","25","4 May 2015"," Too much of the same
","I will have to admit before starting this review I am one of the ones who wished that DC had bet Marvel out of the gate. That being said I enjoyed the first two Iron man movies, the first Thor, the first and second Captain America but The last Iron man, Thor and now this its just too much of the same thing. I wasn't going to go see this movie because I knew that after you destroy one city you've destroyed them all but I was interested in hearing James Spader do Ultron and to see what they were going to do with Jarvis. The more the movie went on the less I cared about even those two things and I really didn't like the whole Black Widow/Banner/Hulk thing. And the Hawkeye story was just unnecessary and pointless. I really hope that this is the end of the Avengers for a while but if the ending is any kind of hint I guess they'll be back."

","I knew when it was the ""action"" sequence and I was getting bored that I was in trouble.<br/><br/>To sum it up, each of the Avengers destroys dozens of the enemy. You're basically watching a duck hunt instead of something suspenseful. They try to hype up how dangerous it is, then each of the Avengers, no matter how powerful, suddenly becomes super powerful when it comes to destroying the enemy. The writers seemed to think that just having an action sequence was enough. That the people watching would just coo over seeing things destroyed. I wanted more.<br/><br/>*** Spoiler Ahead ***<br/><br/>Okay, then you have the one ""unexpected"" death. Which frankly was dumb. He was easily fast enough to move the targets out of the way and instead chooses to shield them with his body. I can only assume he was tired of living and wanted to commit suicide. It just made no sense.<br/><br/>Then you have the dramatic reactions to the death ... during the battle ... while civilians are still dying and you're still fighting ... for someone you basically just met. I realize this is common in movies. I just don't like it.<br/><br/>I don't want to make it sound like this is a 2 rating or something like that. The movie is still has the marvel heroes and it still creates a pretty good setting. It's just pretty pale when compared to the original, hence a 6."

","In order to accomplish this, six character must be portrayed as heroic. Six characters must have their characters and mythologies deepened. Six characters must have their inter-relationships advanced in some way. Naturally, all of this must be delicately structured into a screenplay that delivers a cohesive, compelling story interrupted by jaw- dropping action set-pieces.<br/><br/>On top of that, without being jokey or self-referential, ""Ultron"" delivers ten times the laughs of most Hollywood comedies. Whedon's dialog has always shined. ""Ultron"" is a creative peak. The quiet moments between the characters, especially a celebration that ends badly, are every bit as enjoyable as the action scenes. And that's saying a lot. Not for the dialog — but for the action scenes, that are almost always soul-deadening in today's cartoons, CGI spectaculars.<br/><br/>The worst thing that can happen in a sequel is a ""bigger is better"" mentality. Let's face it, the first ""Avengers"" was already big and already a sequel. Most of the films in the Marvel Universe also have a problem with the stakes. The stakes are always huge — the world or the galaxy or the universe or the whatever is always on the line. The problem with this approach is that you never buy into the idea the villain will succeed."

The robot wasn't menacing and the extraneous B story dragged on too long and wasn't necessary. I really didn't need to know about the wife and kids. And with the hype surrounding the robot, it wasn't menacing in the clashing with the Avengers.

Avengers 2 meets its expectations in every way possible way which it has to left from the impressions made by the first one.<br/><br/>The plot is that the Avengers unite again to retrieve the scepter of Loki from Hydra and when they do, they unleashes Ultron unknowingly who now obsess with destroying mankind to save the earth in his way. How they stops him is to be watched. <br/><br/>Whedon proves again that he is one of the best film maker. From the start till the end the race and the actions never end and makes us watch it at the end of the seat. Davis tries every possible way to make all the crew appear in a way to make them look fantastic. BGM also was great in terms of the critical scenes and made the movie a fast one. <br/><br/>The cast was the pivot point of the whole movie. Robert Downey Jr never ceases to me amaze me and this movie also proves his awesomeness. From his intellect & expertise to his timing humor, he perfected the role of Tony Stark. Then to the Head, Chris Evans aka Captain America does all the job by the rules and follows his duty of soldier in this film too. He tries to make the team one till the end and gives precision orders to everyone on the team. Chris Hemsworth proves again that he is the guy with the ability to hold the Hammer. He powers and strikes well to Ultron but he really comes with a touch of humor in most part of the film. Mark Ruffalo played his role as Bruce Banner,mostly Hulk in the film led his acting a great and supporting one to the film. As for Jeremy Renner, his character was given a good & detailed one from his past to his well kept secret. Scarlett Johansson kept her assassin part a nightmare to her enemy. She fights well and keeps her romance also a high and convincing one. As for the twins in the movie, Aaron and Olsen never gives up for each and then the support of their acting to the movie was surprising and refreshing. Other guys played their part subsequently without a hint of boredom and pleases everyone. And then to James Spader, the acting of him in The Blacklist was fantastic and brilliant and it continues to here also. The speech given by him and the voice of him made him, the perfect Antagonist for a such a crew against the heroes. After Loki, ultron proves that he is the villain for the avengers to thrash them and not to go down easily. <br/><br/>Overall the film lives to its expectations and provides action sequences like none other. The fight between the Hulk and the Hulkbuster is a very crazy and freaking one with a lot of CG done in a perfect way. The climax was also of its action packed kind and end the film well. Thanos gives us a glimpse of the future of avengers and its fate which is to be waited for another 3 years."

","This movie is what's wrong with Hollywood, It's overlong, pretentious, terribly paced, has one of the cheesiest openings that I've ever seen in a blockbuster with every hero mugging for the camera while they charge into battle, and is probably the most over hyped blockbuster ever made. This is coming from someone who loved the first movie. This movie seemed like it was cut from a cookie mold and sold to the masses as if it were some sort of ""hip new age drug"" when all it manages to do is make me feel embarrassed for everyone involved. <br/><br/>This is probably my least favorite blockbuster of all time, I wish I could go back in time and warn my previous self to never watch this pile of garbage. I regret paying for this movie on opening night more so than paying to watch Wild Wild West, and I even got a public apology from the main actor of THAT movie for going to see it!<br/><br/>This movie is a complete mess and a waste of time. You can argue all you want and troll all you want, but deep down inside you truly know this movie is utter drivel and nonsense. This movie doesn't even seem like it was made by the people involved with the first. The jokes are terrible and there are so many, which the first didn't suffer from, the main villain was a joke, Every hero tries to get the same amount of screen time almost like they're fighting over who gets to mug the camera more, and to top it all off we have the egos of Chris Hemsworth and other actors to cope with. <br/><br/>I get that Winter Soldier and Thor: The Dark World were big hits in theaters, but to me they reeked of what this movie has to offer. In fact those movies remind me of this movie so much that I had to look back at the main door to make sure I wasn't in the wrong movie a couple of times. If this is what passes for entertainment nowadays, then I fear for what's going to be passed off to us in the next couple years to come. Hopefully the DCU movies will stray away from this type of formula and come up with something original, but I don't see that happening.<br/><br/>This is what happens when a children's company buys your IP and decides to run it into the ground Marvel! Do you not remember the amazing mess of The Weekenders meets Spiderman from your Ultimate Spiderman cartoon. In fact with the jokes happening and cutting to other heroes who was to mug the camera, this movie reminds me a lot of The Weekenders. So basically you did it to two of your IP now....<br/><br/>All in all, if you want to turn your brain off and come out of the theater like you just pounded back a 40 of liquor.. Then this movie I suppose is for you? But if you want something more out of the movies you watch, then don't waste your time with this nonsense. I'm ashamed to have seen this movie and I feel bad for Joss Whedon because I know he's capable of so much more. Just had to sell out to Hollywood didn't you Joss?"
"andrewallspaw","10","15","33","1 May 2015"," A Look into the Future, with a breath of fresh air.
","Yes this was a phase 2 movie, but believe me, this is the beginning of a new ""Age"" of the greatest Marvel movies ever to come. First off, that opening scene is a great way to bring the audience back into this vulnerable world that the MCU lives in. Next up we get to see the new characters, and a familiar staff. At the beginning Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are on the wrong side, working against earths mightiest heroes, but eventually they realize that there side leads to total human annihilation and decide, ""Hey maybe we should save the world with these people."" And when they do, there is nothing in this world that I would rather have seen then the rest of this masterpiece of a movie. Ultron himself may have been the greatest super villain in an super hero film to this date, well probably not Dark Knight Joker level, but yea, pretty damn close. His intention from the beginning is to destroy all things in his way, including the human race. But he never calls it genocide, he calls it, evolution. This brings a certain level of insanity to the plate, which only adds to his menacing appearance, evil robo army, and his sexy robot voice. Yeah, sexy. The story is great, always moving, always intense, with some love on the side, and some jokes every now and then, our heroes find themselves in a weird situation throughout the entirety of this film. But with all the good of our heroes, we have to talk about the 3 new ones. First off, the twins stole my heart. Quicksilver and Scarlet wish had a legitimate intention, but were kids manipulated by an evil AI, set off to doom the world, and when they realize this, they know they have to grow up, and help the Avengers instead of hurting them. The Vision was spectacular. Paul Bettany really outdone himself on this one, and I really enjoyed the fact that this film is basically Ultron V.S Jarvis: The Battle of the AI's. So yeah, this movie is good, don't listen to all the negatives, because even though there are some, the positives are way more important, and in my mind, they don't exist. Yeah I am a biased nerd, but I am pretty sure there is no one on this planet, who can legitimately say they did NOT like this movie, because those people do not exist. Overall, it was a GREAT movie, but there is definitely better to come."

"jmorris-44326","1","24","58","18 July 2015"," A redundant litany of comic book clichés.
","Seriously, the story progression is cut from the same mold as the first Avengers. Avengers assemble! Avengers fight! Avengers brood over their issues...bad guy sows dissension...Hulk goes berserk...Avengers fight each other...Avengers get back together and save the day. And Tony Stark flies into a hole in the sky. The same personal issues get rehashed, the supposedly super-intelligent villain is laughably inept, the whole story is absurdly contrived and the characters lack any clear sense of purpose. Once again, we have a comic book movie that suffers from writers trying to cram years' worth of back story into a 2 hour film, the result being a mind-numbing series of fights and explosions punctuated by lame quips and tedious attempts at introspection. Maybe Ultron had it right - the Avengers, and indeed the whole superhero genre, need to be destroyed in order to be saved."
"gangstah_vino","8","13","28","25 April 2015"," Let's talk some avenging avengers!
","How are you doing guys? Did you have a nice day? Well I did considering the fact that I saw the freaking sequel of the avengers; The one where their the age of Ultron is happening. <br/><br/>Im not going to spoil anything for you guys... My spoiler-free review.. here we go:<br/><br/>Acting: 10/10 the acting was great as expected. Downey Jr. kills it as iron man, though he's less in the spotlights than I thought it would be. It actually a more.. hawkeye/hulk movie this time around. There is also a lot of character development going on, which I thought was really cool.. I missed that connection the first time around in the first avengers. Especially Hawkeye, the hulk en Black widow get a bit more characteristic, which I thought was great.. and the voice- acting of the guys playing SPOILER(KIND OF) Vision and Ultron are also perfect for the role. <br/><br/>Camera work: 10/10. This doesn't apply to all movies, but in movies like this.. The camera work is really essential.. use too much shaky-cam and you're done as a director. Josh Wedon is just a CHAMP in filming everything with the right angle and A still camera.. I hate shaky-cam.. draws away from the fight or whatever is happening.. Great JOB MR. WHEDON<br/><br/>Action: 11/10 Now the ACTION; it... was... AWESOME... Immediately going into this movie.. the title has not even been shown yet.. and the first action sequence kicks in..and OMG.. it was shot.. so perfectly.. you're actually following each and everyone doing their thing for a bit.. looked a bit like a tag-team fight.. so awesome.. the hulk vs. hulk-buster scene was perfect.. the fight in Korea.. awesome.. and the last fight of course was incredible as well..<br/><br/>Villain: 10/10 The villain this time around is amazing. You know what the best villains are? The ones who don't consider themselves as villains.. They just want to do good.. help people.. so they have a goal that they don't have out of hatred, or misplaced anger, but because of a certain dedication to it.. and with the right motivation you can do anything.. That's what Ultron is in this movie.. He's so menacing.. but also surprisingly funny.. and no.. not in the annoying way! In the way you want a villain to be funny.. Stark: "".. What's the Vibranium for? "" Ultron ""Im glad you asked that, because you wanted to take this time to explain my evil plan"". Hilarious! It's so.. Stark to say that from Ultron! Hahaha!Ultron is so different from loki(because I never took him seriously as a unstoppable force)<br/><br/>The only flaw that I have with this movie: 1. There is a romance between 2 characters which I did not like.. It seemed forced.. unnecessary and for me took the character of one of the two down.. considering I thought she/he was the most emotionally stable of the group<br/><br/>So overall.. Such a good movie.. it will never be as awesome as the first time these heroes came together in the first movie.. but the fact these heroes actually became friends was perfect..I bought.. I'm gonna go see it again on Tuesday.. maybe even again if money agrees with me..<br/><br/>10 out of 10 for this amazingly fun, great, awesome movie."

","Joss Wheadon has perfectly managed to create yet another fantastic, amazing superhero movie. All the characters have depth unlike the previous Avengers movie and Ultron seriously kicks ass. There were moments when I was shocked, when I laughed till my cheeks hurt and there were also moments when I was in awe. The entire movie kept me hooked to my seat and you will easily immerse yourself in the movie. Avengers Age of Ultron has some of the best action scenes ever in the entire Marvel history. Those who are new to the superhero genre will also enjoy this movie with the same zeal as a Marvel fan-boy.

","Now let me just say, this is a very good movie, much darker from the first but still very good. Here we see Ultron against the Avengers with a back story very different from the comics, but possibly a necessary addition for his introduction. The threat level doesn't seem as high in this one as previous movies but overall it is still very good. Ultron is perfectly voiced by James Spader to bring the menacing character to life and truly move you to fear what his intentions may be. Once again as it was in the first movie, the pacing is very good, the characters are well fleshed out, the story is well presented and all in all the piece is thoroughly executed. The fights between Ultron and the Avengers are very exciting to watch and once again the slow panning of the heroes around the battlefields is well utilized from scene to scene. Included in this is also a very strong ending to a fairly well created piece of cinema. I give this a 10 out of 10 and am happy I was able to experience this. ""I was designed to save the world. People would look to the sky, and see hope I'll take that from them first!"" –Ultron."
"r_massey","5","15","34","3 May 2015"," Forgettable
","The cast from Marvel Studios' previous films have naturally returned to their respective roles but one of the major downfalls of ""Age of Ultron"" is that there is little to no development to these characters at all.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of the film, however, is Jeremy Renner's portrayal as Hawkeye, whose character is greatly developed and, in comparison to the rest of our beloved Avengers, feels 'genuine'; his particular situation in ""Age of Ultron"" has evoked him to finally open up to the rest of his team and to us, the audience, to subsequently obtain a better understanding of the character.<br/><br/>While Hawkeye's character has been pushed a little more to the forefront, Black Widow seems to have taken a step back from the result of a very forced and poor romance 'blossoming' between her and Bruce Banner. Scarlett Johansson's character has always seemed quite strong in previous Marvel films and the insight to her character via flashback sequences in ""Age of Ultron"" would have only reinforced that impression if it weren't for Romanoff being so desperate to get into the Hulk's pants, despite their lack of chemistry.<br/><br/>Although it is nice to see the cast come together again since their ensemble debut, the characters simply engage in very generic and repetitive conversation and are constantly turning on each other, which soon becomes very tiring. We already witnessed enough of that in the first Avengers movie. If you are aware of Marvel's current movie plans and their 'Phases', it is easy to piece together that this forced conflict within the group is all necessary buildup for the events of ""Captain America: Civil War"" and though this conflict will be accentuated in the 2016 movie, the teasing towards this event was just not subtle.<br/><br/>On a related note, Marvel is dabbling excessively in what I dislike the most about their attempt at creating a very 'cohesive' cinematic universe; their need to set up events that play out in the future. In itself, ""Age of Ultron"" is quite a solid movie with a definitive beginning, middle and ending. However, most of the bits in the 'middle' can be cut out, i.e. the need to introduce characters and locations (and ""Age of Ultron"" features MANY of these) that will have greater significance in future films. With this in mind, the film feels overstuffed with characters, hence why characters, overall, feel so underused and underdeveloped.<br/><br/>Introduced into the movie's new roster of heroes are Wanda Maximoff, her twin brother Pietro Maximoff and the Vision, their presence definitely welcomed. The transition from antagonists to heroes feels natural on behalf of the Twins. While Olsen's and Johnson's performances as the Twins are sufficient, it is worth noting that their Eastern-European accents are notably off at times. Paul Bettany as the Vision is definitely one of the film's highlights but unfortunately just feels like another character that Marvel have attempted to shoehorn into their movie universe, making his presence and role feel underused.<br/><br/>Ultron, who is responsible for these three new heroes, is one of the biggest problems of this film. Don't let the trailers fool you that he is menacing because he simply isn't.<br/><br/>Again, because of the abundant amount of characters, it is so difficult to focus on a single character and that unfortunately includes the villain; we never get a full insight into what Ultron is truly capable of. The villain is also made to be too human in some aspects with his dialect and (facial) expressions and is composed as acting much too casual considering his 'motives'; Ultron is simply is just all talk and no action.<br/><br/>""Man of Steel"" quickly made viewers tired of seeing building after building being demolished and flying pieces of rubble and debris everywhere in its action sequences and so, to see this happen so often in the Avengers sequel is to experience something so tedious, exhausting, cliché and repetitive. I had no reaction at all to the action sequences. Characters may don slightly upgraded weapons and suits and may be pulling off some sweet combo moves together but the choreography just isn't striking enough as it was with ""The Winter Soldier"".<br/><br/>Due to the bland action sequences, it never feels like the heroes are in any danger at all. There's no tension to be anticipated at all and the stakes throughout ""Age of Ultron"" just never feel high enough. Sure, some villain galvanises the team of heroes to navigate through several different locations and stop him from destroying the planet before it's too late but, I don't know, I may or may not be experiencing some déjà vu <br/><br/>Marvel don't seem to know how to amp up the stakes and tension; all they really seem to know is how to amp up the number of characters they can squeeze into a two hour movie. As mentioned above, the action sequences are all so generic (and all contain so much destruction) that it's difficult to tell when we've reached some kind of pinnacle or climax where we can expect the film to really blow out, hence why the third act of ""Age of Ultron"" is just so underwhelming.<br/><br/>""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is no improvement on Marvel Studios' former works and, sadly, just not even on the same standards. The film is simply overstuffed with mediocre gags, characters, repetitive dialogue and dull action. As a result, there's hardly a reaction to have towards ""Age of Ultron"" other than the feeling of being underwhelmed by how much a potentially good story and exciting villain have been sacrificed at the expense of Marvel pleasing the average moviegoer with comedy and 'big' action. Unless you're taking your kids with you, save your money on cinema tickets and rent the film later this year instead. There's nothing to miss here. ""Age of Ultron"" is one of Marvel's most forgettable movies to date."

","Spoiler Alert! ----------------------------- I went into this film with low expectations, as I knew they did not have enough meaningful content to support 2.5 hours of film. Usually, low expectations lead to pleasant and unexpected outcomes, but I was actually surprised that the film was worse that I projected.<br/><br/>There are several reasons for this (in list form for quick consumption): The script is dialed in, basically relying on the viewer using so much motivated energy to build up these characters that the underwhelming exchanges between the heroes still seems important and witty. But non of this is witty or important. The actors did not even seem very compelled to try hard, which is understandable given the lack of writing effort.<br/><br/>The persistent product placement, whether Beats by Dre or Adidas, often to montages, provided a few fleeting moments of laughter when all the one liners failed. But that is laughing at the film's failings, not successes.<br/><br/>Much of the dialogue is whispered, even in settings where a normal tone is very much expected.<br/><br/>The assumed love affair between Black Widow and Bruce Banner is really obnoxious. No previous Marvel film indicated they had something going on, so to pick up that story in the middle of their courtship is extremely peculiar. And then it goes nowhere anyway, so thanks.<br/><br/>Vision and Ultron are introduced, but Wonder Man still remains absent when he is the core character the others gain their consciousness from. In the comics, they are even considered brothers at times, so why the missing character? Wonder Man is a crappy character (Hollywood celebrity with big ego and muscles who can fly), but still, come on Joss! They do kill off a super hero! Or do they? Quicksilver's death scene was wholly expected, even though his last words to Hawkeye were something to the effect of ""didn't expect that"" (dies).<br/><br/>There are a ton of canonical plot wholes in the film. Vision is based on Jarvis' consciousness (instead of Wonder Man). They does this story about the twins' parents dying... so are they just abandoning that Scarlet Witch and Quickie are the children of Magneto? And is Scarlet Witch going to marry Vision like the comics and form the West Coast Avengers? Probably not. The comics actually have a made fro screen storyline or the characters they introduce, but instead they opt for a boring Stark killed my parents story.<br/><br/>And Thanos ends another movie!? He ended the first one!! Why do they keep showing him at the end of films if they never follow up!!?!? Last, I am a big fan of Joss Whedon's work, but this has to be the worst Whedon production I have ever seen. I cannot help but feel Joss is no longer capable of making vibrant ensemble-based shows/movies."
"SforSmile","7","12","26","1 May 2015"," Not as much Fun as the First One.
","Spectacular action scenes and sophisticated, interesting super heroes cannot quite make up for the fact that the story entangles itself in too many plot lines so that ""Age of Ultron"" is a less exciting adventure than its prequel has been.<br/><br/>The balancing act between seriousness and humor doesn't seem to work as smoothly as before and the big love story quickly develops some soap-opera like feeling to it which makes it an additional side line that rather distracts from the main plot than giving more depth to it.<br/><br/>More of a disappointment is unfortunately the main villain too. ""Ultron"" is supposed to be one of the most dangerous and merciless enemies in the Marvel universe and instead he is too charming too be really frightening, he is still cool but his potential has been wasted.<br/><br/>A positive surprise is ""Hawkeye"" whose story gets more attention and meaning this time and I really like it that the big final battle takes place in a South-European country for a change.<br/><br/>""Age of Ultron"" has all the necessary ingredients for a fantastic blockbuster, however, the fine-tuning is flawed and considering the high expectations it leaves an aftertaste of mediocrity."

I am still waiting for them to pull a ""The Dark Knight"" and make a movie that is unpredictable and completely flips the script. They crammed & rushed so much in this movie. Ultron is Evil right away. They don't even touch on why Tony is back as Iron Man despite retiring in ""Iron Man 3"", making the end of that movie redundant. They try to give Hawkeye some depth which just feels like 4 movies too late. There's a forced romance between Black Widow & the Hulk which comes out of nowhere. Despite Black Widow being a female Christian Grey all this time with her mysterious and secretive personality. Now all of sudden she's jonesing and wanting to take a shower with The Hulk. Also Jesus Christ there's so much repetitive Power Rangers/ Transformers level action. Say what you will about ""Fast & Furious 7"". But at least all the action scenes were memorable, intense and entertaining. The action scenes aren't engaging because there's no tension. We all know no one is going to Die because there's so many bloody sequels coming out over the next 5 years. The action scenes quickly become White Noise. Hell even ""Cinderella"" a Disney family movie was more visually stunning and engaging. The only pro's is the Banter between The Avengers, some funny one liner's, Scarjo's cute nose and Elizabeth Olsen finally getting some recognition. The movie just feels like it was made in a factory. No heart just a business transaction. Skip this ""Cultural genocide"" and wait for the Blu Ray. ""Fast and Furious 7"" and ""Cinderella"" put this movie to shame. 6/10"

Marvel will worry about alienating people who can't keep up, as they first started to in the '70's; but ultimately no one can keep up, including their scriptwriters.

It's pointless describing anything in more detail even if I understood it: the plot's deliberately barmy but engrossing, with cgi cartoonery used as it was always meant to be used - with many variations we've seen it all before and with many more variations being presently dreamed up expect to again and again. As with the first film there are many iconic comic booky scenes for posterising. Ultron cynically sings I've Got No Strings from Pinocchio occasionally, but the original Thunderbirds were just as realistic to me. Worthy of note is the almost Shakespearean scene on the train between baddie Ultron and Scarlet Witch after her brother's surprising demise.<br/><br/>Highly enjoyable and recommended non-essential viewing by this non-expert non-purist, the running time whizzes by every time I see it. At this rate I may understand it all in about a year's time too. Do Marvel include Howard The Duck in their Cinematic Universe?"

","It's amazing how far Marvel has come and just how great Joss Whedon makes these films. Robert Downey Jr. is just a joy to watch as always and the rest of the team have almost surpassed his interest level. Now let's get something out of the way; this movie gets convoluted with the plot especially the Thor stuff, but it's all just set up for Thor: Ragnarok. Ultron is exceptionally played by James Spader, but for some reason I wish he was in the film just a little more. The Hulk and Black Widow romance was fine I guess, but I'm looking forward to Vision and Scarlet Witch. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were actually valuable to the film and I enjoyed them even though Quicksilver sadly dies. I loved the Civil War foreshadowing with Captain America and Tony Stark. Hawkeye was freaking amazing and can't wait to see him more because I love Jeremy Renner. Vision was brilliant and Paul Bettany was solid, I mean he picked up Thor's hammer(Cap almost does too, loved that comic reference). Andy Serkis was hilarious and awesome, can't wait for Black Panther. Ultron didn't have a big fight at the end with the Avengers, but he did his part and the film was still superb. Vision killing Ultron was so good because of the dialogue, ""You are incredibly naïve"", ""Well, I was born yesterday."" Excellent dialogue. Possible Planet Hulk set up, not sure. Same beats as the first, but it was amazing and is just as good as the first honestly. No Spider-Man end credits scene, but we get Thanos preparing to raise some hell in Infinity Wars."

","I absolutely love Age of Ultron for many reasons.<br/><br/>1) I have always loved the witty comedy side of marvel and it his film is full of it. The scene where they are trying to lift Thor's hammer is golden! 2) I loved the new characters quicksilver and scarlet witch. Although a bit more background knowledge to quicksilver before just killing him off. Hopefully we will find out more about his dad (magneto). 3) i liked how hawkeye was more in this film and how it showed the softer side of him with his kids and wife.<br/><br/>However I feel the Hulk and Black Widow's romance came out of nowhere.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was awesome and I highly recommend going to watch it! A great performance from all the cast! I was impressed with James Spader with his take on Ultron. Although Ultron could have been a bit more menacing and have a more powerful presence Isn't he meant to be stronger than hulk..? <br/><br/>Anyway I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and you should definitely watch it."

","The First Movie was way better, it had a soul and a thrill that made the entire package exiting, this second movie is all flash and no bang, Thrills are constantly interrupted by forced humor and it all feels pretty fake, no chance for immersion as the movie is too busy to finish and then start a third movie. Plus the Subtitles cover 1/3rd of the Screen which spoils the point of watching the movie in the Theatre(this is only an issue in India). Wait for DVD or Blu Ray, this is not as spectacular as the First one was, this is just made because they had earned the money to spare and wanted earn more money to spare, doesn't really take forward the Avengers anywhere or make you feel like you're part of the Movie, the so called dark theme and good reviews are just for the Hype, Don't fall for the Hype"

"StevePulaski","6","11","24","2 May 2015"," Fizzles when it should pop
","The ""Avengers"" films, and the films of Marvel in general, play less like films and more like large-scale business investments that need to churn an unfathomable amount of money (think north of $1.5 billion) to even be considered a success. When film becomes that expensive and driven by finances, to me, it's no longer an act of entertainment but an act of business and a potentially crippling investment. The Marvel brand, in general, while showing no signs of letting up at the box office, has made me weary over the last two years, as I've been straining to find a great deal of satisfaction in most of the two to three superhero films released every year. To call this genre much of a muchness is still shortchanging in how its repetition hurts the individual impact of each of these films for me.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" I thought, would be the exception; after disillusionment with ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier,"" ""The Amazing Spider-Man 2,"" and ""Iron Man 3,"" I was hoping I'd emerge from the sequel gleaming with joy as I did with the first film. However, ""Age of Ultron"" doesn't escape the same kind of issues the former films had; familiarity continues to breed contempt, repetitive quips and attempt at humor distract from core character relations, and candy-colored action that undermines the talent at hand.<br/><br/>The film concerns the same Avengers team as last time: Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) all assemble once more to make up the beloved superhero team. However, this time, the team needs to find a way to assemble and be strong enough to take down Ultron (James Spader), an artificially intelligent villain who is created through technology to try and erase human extinction. Even with six of them, however, the Avengers find themselves still underpowered in the face of Ultron's immense technological presence. The film concerns their efforts to take down the villain, whilst coming to realize just what their lives and existence means for the face of humanity.<br/><br/>The original ""Avengers"" packed in some terrific character relations; it was fascinating to see how all these superheros would interact with one another, constantly trying to one up their peers and stand tall in the face of everything. ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" worked to expand this feature in a sillier way, but still worked on the level of helping us relate to these larger than life figures. One scene in this film, I recall, has these characters interacting at leisure, and it takes place in a lavish penthouse after a party with all of the Avengers attempting to lift Thor's hammer. Whedon goes for the kill with this film, infusing a great deal of action sequences rather than focusing on the graceful character presence that made the first ""Avengers"" so fun. In both that film and ""Guardians,"" we felt like we were hanging out with these heroes; now, we're back to passively observing them at work.<br/><br/>With that, it's amazing to see Whedon, who kept the humor in the first ""Avengers"" to a minimum, only pulling it out on certain occasions, usually to great effect, rely so heavily on quips here. It seems nearly every scene has to end with some kind of forced jab or one-liner, especially a desperately unfunny recurring joke made by Captain America in the opening scene about the use of bad language. These kinds of things only distract from what Whedon does well, particularly here, where those things are masked by other, lesser features.<br/><br/>For one, Whedon continues to prove, from both a screen writing and directorial standpoint, that he can juggle chaos. Whedon can habdle about five or six things going on in terms of tying them together when the time comes and capturing such chaos as it's unfolding before us. Sometimes, one needs to just sit back in pure awe at the camaraderie occurring before us and marvel at its visual coherency thanks to Whedon's careful hand. In addition, ""The Avengers"" addresses the weaknesses of the team, despite having six superheros working together. The invincibility element of Marvel superheros has continuously been a distracting element for me, with each passing Marvel film, in that I rarely feel a sense of danger for these characters because it seems as if nothing can stop them.<br/><br/>In ""Age of Ultron,"" we actually see the Avengers struggle to adequately assemble to take down Ultron, even going as far as to vacationing to a resort in order to further strengthen and develop. This element of questioning just how strong these six heroes are is something that this extended universe needed.<br/><br/>""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" especially for possibly setting forth new standards for blockbusters in terms of budget, gross, and scope, is still an underwhelming experience. For a film so grand in its vision and limitless with its roster, it feels so grounded in routine, Marvel formula, so much so that the end battle treads dangerously close to not only being boring but riddled with the same kind of ""Transformers""-esque excess that, again, could set a dangerous precedent. Whedon must be admired here, mainly for his craft at handling a great deal of things going on in unison along with his efforts to question the Avengers' invincibility, but considering this is time when the series should take off in the way of ""The Empire Strikes Back,"" the fact that it wobbles and fizzles in impact is a tad frightening."
"bob-the-movie-man","6","11","24","2 May 2015"," McGuffins assembled
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is nonsense. But it is glossy, well-packaged and star-studded nonsense.<br/><br/>Following on from the defeat of Thor's brother in the last film, the story revolves around Loki's staff, an object of unspeakable power, which in a blitzkrieg of special effects is repatriated by the Avengers from a mountain fortress in a fictitious Sokovia. Instead of doing the sensible thing and crating it up in a warehouse with the Ark of the Covenant, the boffin duo of Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jnr) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) try to harness its power through their super-computer Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany) to create a peace-keeping AI machine called Skynet, no sorry - wrong film - Ultron. This will allow them to all retire and lie on a beach somewhere, so in a way the whole plot is really about pension planning. <br/><br/>Everything naturally turns pear-shaped when Ultron (like V'gur in Star Trek 1) decides that eradication of human life seems the most sensible course of action. It's now down to The Avengers to put right the damage they've done.<br/><br/>I'm not a 'fan-boy' or even a 'fan-man', so a lot of the back stories of ""SHIELD' and the villainous Baron von Strucker went completely over my head. But these details really don't matter: it's not bloody Shakespeare. More perplexing are some of the diversions the film takes and the questions these raise:<br/><br/><ul><li>What was going on with that South African tanker full of whatever it was (let's call it McGuffinium)? - How did they even get hold of the McGuffium if it has anti-gravitational powers? - Why can't Banner and Romanoff 'get it on' (although I can understand that if he got angry during sex that things could get - erm - messy)? - What exactly are Black Widow's super-powers anyway (my wife suggested ""a safe shag?"")? </li></ul><br/><br/>So many questions with no answers in the convoluted screenplay by Joss Whedon (who also directed).<br/><br/>What kept the film entertaining, to a point, was the incessant banter between the characters, some of which worked and some of which didn't. So much banter in fact I expected Chandler Bing to be credited as a co-screenwriter. An Excaliber-style segment with Thor's hammer is particularly entertaining.<br/><br/>Special effects are of the frantic 'what the hell is going on on the screen' variety. Where these work best is in the impressive slow-mo segments, notably a 'money-shot' in the opening of the film with all Avengers on the screen and a later fight scene in a Sokovian tower.<br/><br/>All the acting is of the quality you would expect from the star-names on show, although many in the cast (e.g. Samuel L Jackson, Don Cheadle, Andy Serkis, Stellan Skarsgård and Idris Elba) have little more than cameo parts. In particular I wanted to see more of Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), the latter being mesmerising (in every sense of the word) in every scene she is in.<br/><br/>Overlong, at 141 minutes, this is a film squarely aimed at a teenage audience (who will no doubt love it) and old folks who are looking for a quieter and more sedate movie should flee far from this madding crowd. I had low expectations of this film, but as an early summer popcorn blockbuster it is not as bad as I expected it to be. Whatever I comment, however, is completely irrelevant as it is going to make a shed-load of money at the box office. With a budget of $250 million, it needs to, but as the first film grossed $1,500 million - the third highest in movie history - it's probably a safe enough bet for the producers.<br/><br/>(If you enjoyed this review please see the archive at bob-the-movie-man.com and enter your email to receive future reviews)."

It did, but it is an inferior sequel.<br/><br/>I will try to keep this review Spoiler Free also since I don't want to ruin any of the hype to people who haven't seen it.<br/><br/>The Villain Ultron (James Spader) is a dang great villain. He is more of a gentleman of a villain than Loki was, but dang, Ultron looks cool, sounds cool, acts cool, it's a good villain.<br/><br/>Other characters appear as well as Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and some others return like The Falcon (But only for two appearances) which is great to see. The Stan Lee Cameo was also funny as always.<br/><br/>The Main Characters were great also. Bruce and Natasha get more development and we find out something great about Hawkeye Also. The performances by Evans, Downey, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Spader, Taylor Johnson are all good and it's nice to see a bit more variety in characters.<br/><br/>The visuals are what you expect. Standard level CGI big effects that sometimes can look outstanding but most of the time are nothing new. The climax is pretty good with the visuals but overall the visuals ain't nothing to howl for.<br/><br/>The Story, Meh. It could have used a bit more originality. We have seen the whole villain motivation before but the film does a good job with how it's done.<br/><br/>If you are expecting another post credits scene, don't expect it here, there is a mid credits scene which I will not reveal but prepare to be disappointed when there is nothing after the credits.<br/><br/>Sorry If the review was not useful but I feel like I don't need to explain much of what has already been said. The audience I was with gasped at this one particular part of the film, but you will have to see what it is.

"aaronjbong","9","12","27","22 April 2015"," An Exhilarating Super-powered ride that barely manages to hold its strings together
","*There are no strings on me*<br/><br/>First of all, huge kudos to Joss Whedon for wanting to take the job as the director of this mammoth movie. The sheer scale of this film is both huge and yet smaller at the same time as compared to the last outing. And yet, Whedon manages to pull it all together, despite a few loose strings, and deliver an exuberant two-and-a-half hour thrill ride with the mighty Avengers as they try to stop the technological enemy who is bent on human extinction, Ultron. <br/><br/>Despite the Avengers' fight for peace, not all the people in the world adore them. Realizing that the Avengers need a hiatus, Tony Stark attempts to jump-start a peace-keeping program Ultron so that they can take a break from saving the world. However, things quickly go wrong as Ultron immediately decides that peace can only be achieved through the obliteration of human life. <br/><br/>The film is simultaneously bigger yet also smaller in scale. On one hand, all of the conflict is based on Earth and therefore, there are no aliens involved (at least until the end of this film), and yet despite the smaller canvas, it becomes much denser as more characters are involved, not to forget the main villain himself. Handling a film this big is not easy and Whedon tries his best to develop his characters and while he doesn't accomplish this perfectly, he does it well enough that we get to roughly know what troubles each of these characters. And it's also welcoming that he spends more time with characters that don't have their own standalone movies such as Hawkeye, Hulk, and Black Widow. <br/><br/>Ultron is an interesting villain because he's different from other artificial intelligence villains. While it is true that his motives are based on logic, it's that he has a personality that sets him apart. He was jump-started by Stark, so therefore he inherits some of Stark's attributes such as his sarcasm and dry wit. But he's technological, he doesn't need the Chitauri army, he can make his own, he can reproduce at incredible rates, he can upgrade himself. He also has another perspective on the definition of peace. As long as he has access to the Internet, he's virtually unstoppable. Unlike Loki who's deceptive and mischievous, Ultron's straightforward. But the true standout was James Spader's voice. His voice was menacing, powerful and gave Ultron his signature feature. <br/><br/>Ultron's not the only newcomer. There's also the Maximoff twins, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. The twins are not ""mutants"" but rather, a result of an experimentation conducted by Hydra member Baron von Strucker. They've suffered a harsh past and therefore, they have a very strong bond as they protect each other. Quicksilver can run incredibly fast psychic powers. These two characters provide something fresh to the film as their powers are visual delights (although that one scene from ""X- Men: Days of Future Past"" remains superior) but they're among the crowded canvas of super-powered characters in this film. Therefore, their characterizations are not that extensive but enough for us to relate to them and to keep the action engaging. (There's also the Vision, but it's much better that he remains as mysterious as he is now.)<br/><br/>Talking about the action, the action sequences are absolutely outstanding. We get an adequate dose of each character kicking ass and showcasing their powers and abilities. One thing I enjoyed was that the action took place in different locations all around the world and this was very nice to see that the conflict was global and just kept it fresh. Most of the time, I just gasped in awe and just was astonished by just how awesome the action was. Some of the shots were so jaw-dropping I wished I could immortalize them into posters. It brought my inner geek out. Apart from being exhilarating, it was also humorous and that's also another primary reason I loved about this film. Some movies work well with a dark and brooding atmosphere, but I loved that this one was not so gritty but instead, more fun and just more about the adrenaline- filled ride. But all this wouldn't be a fully baked cake without a brilliant script. The script, although unable to delve deep into each character's mind (wished Scarlet Witch explored more), ultimately reminds us that despite their incredible powers, the Avengers are still humans and have faults, and this makes them feel real and to be rooted for.<br/><br/>Rating: 9/10<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It can't help but feel very crowded but Whedon ultimately manages to keep all of the gargantuan content together, despite a few slipped strings, and deliver a hugely sensational and satisfying sequel to 2012's ""The Avengers"".<br/><br/>Tip: The mid-credits scene is one to watch out for! Don't miss it!"

"mgruebel","5","9","19","13 June 2015"," Failed attempt at character development
","Age of Ultron is an odd mix of action episodes interspersed by attempts to take cardboard characters and give them a human element. The latter fails pretty miserably. The characters just get slightly more boring with each installment, and their love interests and background stories are insipid. This all works much better in the graphic novels than with live action.<br/><br/>The physics is bad, as always in these films. Here the problem is energy conservation. Cracking an asteroid-size chunk into smaller pieces to avoid disaster won't work too well: A single smaller impactor is less powerful because it is smaller, but if I cut a larger impactor into several smaller pieces a few 100 meters before impact and let all the pieces still hit simultaneously next to one another, the kinetic energy turned into heat remains the same. Woe to the Earth. Fortunately, it looked like the vibranium engines had not accelerated the impactor to the several km/s speed necessary for a disastrous impact anyway. The chunk had barely flown up a few km (humans were still breathing) and took way more than 1 second to fly back down. Soft landing. Stupid Ultron. Luck to the Earth, even without Avengers intervention.<br/><br/>Ultron was about the only interesting character in this movie, and not developed enough. He put a sarcastic face on the old Terminator ""Rise of the Machines"" idea that an AI will conclude that humans are superfluous. However, Ultron seemed to have nothing against plants and animals, hence his destructive plan seems a bit over the top. Surely an AI so smart could have figured out some bacteriological warfare method to get rid just of the humans.<br/><br/>Basically, the film shuffles along OK from one action set piece to another, providing somewhat mediocre summer fare entertainment. I think this series has lost its touch. Sad because I really enjoyed the first ""Ironman,"" when Downey, Jr. had to put together a suit from scrap metal. Fewer resources, better result. This seems to be the problem with many action movies these days."

","After the entire list of user reviews, all has been said. What more can be added to the many reviews? Not much. So basically the movie is enjoyable. There is no character development, not much of a story and there are many non-threatening robot type figures to smash and kill again. They have added romance, without it being romantic, and they have added more product placement and vague hints of potential story lines for upcoming Thor and Captain America movies. The Avengers is becoming a social gathering of heroes in between their own profitable movies. I very much enjoyed reading the Avengers comics books; much more than seeing the Avengers movies. This is disappointing considering I was looking forward to the movies after reading and collecting the Marvel Universe in the 70s and 80s. <br/><br/>What's next? If they can develop characters, cut down on the many Avengers they have on screen and develop more inter-team battling (much like in the comics), create better villains, then, we may have something here. In the comics, many times, there were some Avengers away on assignment; therefore it made for better reading and story development. Try it next time guys! 6 of 10."

There were simply too many characters, no character development, too many random plot-jumps with no explanation. It gets 5 points for the initial concept of Ultron, which seems like a reasonable start for a movie. But it gets no more points for the subsequent mess that ensues. My only guess is that there is a whole mythology contained in the graphic novels, which I haven't read; but you are expected to know it all in order to understand the movie.

Hulk vs Iron Man was a highlight scene.<br/><br/>The only down points are Ultron was not as cool as I was hoping and Quicksilver's accent felt off (probably because I have heard him in his British accent and fake American accent too many times) however, Elizabeth Olsen's was good. The Black Widow and Hulk together stuff felt a bit off.<br/><br/>Just in case you were wondering I have seen probably all of the trailers and TV spots etc and it does not ruin the movie at all because there is still loads of unseen stuff etc.<br/><br/>I am looking forward to the extended edition hopefully it is 3 hours or more because I love this movie. I am looking forward to re-watching it, hopefully soon.<br/><br/>SORT OF SPOILERS (but I won't give names): 2 of the characters deaths were kind of bad choices to be honest but still.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: I love who have been chosen to be the new Avengers at the end.<br/><br/>BRING ON ANT-MAN and CAPTAIN America:CIVIL WAR."

","This movie was flat out boring and kinda stupid. It was just bad, so bad in fact, I felt embarrassed to be in the theater. The fighting in these movies has worn very thin. It's terrible stylistically. There's no artfulness to what is going on, it's just half second cuts of different characters punching the same bad guy (ultron clones) over and over again. As to the story, there was no story. There is a bad robot, it wants to make itself super powerful, but in the end, the good guys win. I don't know what the point of it all was. Are they trying to say something through a psychobabbling evil robot? Is there some reason in the overarching universe of comics for all of this to be happening? Not that I could tell. Again, a bad robot came, it fought the avengers, the avengers won, hooray. <br/><br/>Seriously, save your money, unless you were born yesterday..."

The movie wasn't satisfied enough like the previous one.<br/><br/>The concept of ultron was good but development was too poor. Most of the time i don't understand if ultron is a robot or alien. Seems like they just want to make sequel for making money thats why they released the movie in India first.<br/><br/>Because i am sure they face greater loss if movie release on USA.<br/><br/>Overall movie is watchable but only watchable because it doesn't have something new .<br/><br/>And movie deserve the rating 6 out of 10."
"sunny-jindl2","3","16","39","26 April 2015"," No different than the ones before it
","A very loose story bound together only for the love of special effects action. The fight between Hulk and Iron man is the highlight of the movie. The climax fight goes for a good 20 minutes or so, it begins to feel like when will it end. Everybody is given lines that are meant to be very philosophical, but end up turning meaningless. The key villain is finally killed by the power of three Vision, Iron man and Thor, but wait no he is alive again in next scene, just to be killed again by a new avenger. There is a point in the movie when one of the character says ""I am out of words"" after blabbering for a minute, that sums up my feelings for the movie. If you just want action watch your favorite action movie, don't waste time on this soulless flick."
"Merlin-Knight","4","10","22","30 May 2015"," My 2 Cents
","I wanted this movie to be better then it was there were many things that so many others have already said were wrong. I think the truth is that the some where along the line someone messed up as the characters seemed to have lost some of the chemistry .. I cant put the blame on the cast though as they are all top notch actors and actress's after all they were all in the first one and it turned out amazingly so they can clearly work together well. The truth is though that as crucial is in a movie a good cast can only take a movie so far. I cant complain about the special effects as like with the first one I found most of the special effects to be well done. I think what pulls this movie down was poor writing to be honest. I mean the characters seemed some how weaker. As to Ulron I think it was a good start for the character. I am hoping that should they do a following movie that all those involved will be on their A game so to speak as this time I kinda feel that this was well more of a near miss they had good intent.. and some good ideas I just am not so sure they did it justice."
"Phylum22","Null","10","22","20 May 2015"," Disappointed
","The worst by far. Too much time wasted hanging around, could have been much shorter and snappier.<br/><br/>The storyline was a little boring and somewhat confusing and there was not enough enough original action.<br/><br/>Thor looked plain skinny though it was nice to see him in plain clothing. It was nice too to see something of the personal lives of one of the characters. <br/><br/>Too much emphasise, as always, on Tony Stark. <br/><br/>All in all, a big let down.<br/><br/>Maybe I would have enjoyed it better if I had not had someone kicking the back of my cinema seat all the way through?"
"adamscastlevania2","6","10","22","18 May 2015"," Almost completely soulless flash, bang, wallop
","(53%) Could the original live up to all that build up in all those many, many films? Well it got close, but not quite as it was near impossible. So how does its sequel fair? Well instead of Thor having something to do with the world nearly ending this time it's old iron balls, but apart from that this is more or less a sliver of super simple plot stretched out for well over two hours. Because the story is so narrow and the length is so long this feels the need to stuff as much comic book based claptrap as possible meaning much will go over most people's head with things just sort of happing without any real logic. Oddly though this doesn't feel like a comic book of the screen, much more a video game with tons and tons of CG based action interrupted only by character interactions that feel more like cut scenes than actual parts of an actual movie. Much of what happens takes place in many different locations throughout the world, but there's so little sense of the vast distances between them that they may as well be in the very next room (or studio). Though with that said the good cast do attempt to bring something out, but there's so little substance that it's a losing battle (both Thor and captain America in particular do very little indeed besides fight robots). In terms of very basic entertainment this does the job, but in terms of anything deep, interesting, or memorable there's next to nothing to see here meaning the inevitable next entry really needs to get its act together otherwise the series has no future."
"alexgarcia732805","5","10","22","3 May 2015"," Impromptu Humor, Too Much Thick & Heavy Action, and Unsatisfying Characters New and Old
","Being the sequel to the biggest superhero movie of all time is not an easy thing to be. Meeting the expectations and demands of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, of dedicated fans, and the general movie- going public is no easy task. <br/><br/>In an ambitious effort to top the previous Avengers movie, Joss Whedon packed around 5 different big-budget action sequences in Age of Ultron. The blockbuster action felt epic in the trailers and promos, but somehow lackluster in the actual movie (probably because we are bombarded with too much of it). Watching this superhero extravaganza, I felt that the filming style was gimmicky (camera turning around 360 to show way too many things going on at once). <br/><br/>Even with its 2 and a half hour run time, AoU has a rushed pace, and not enough time is given to the characters and audience to dwell on what is going on. There's so much ground to cover in this sequel that the movie struggles to find room. The movie glosses over the Scarlet Witch-induced hallucinations that the Avengers suffer, the ""Infinity Well"" (where Thor learns of setup for Phase 3 and the Infinity War), and the fact that SHIElD is back, but with no mention of the rival factions within it (shown on Agents Of SHIELD). <br/><br/>Everything and nothing is at stake in AoU. After all, it's obvious going into the theater that only one or two of our heroes will die-- because most of the Avengers have more movies that they're contracted to star in. Plus, Disney benefits far too much because of the MCU to kill off a money-making character. Knowing this, what is the point of making movies where the entire planet is in danger, yet not a single civilian gets killed on-screen and almost none of the Avengers are ever in real jeopardy? The comedic timing of the film is also off, as too many jokes and quips are made at inappropriate times, and this contributes to a lack of tension in the movie. <br/><br/>None of the acting is noteworthy or remarkable, but the conflict of ideologies between Tony and Cap was interesting to me and a natural progression of their characters (also setting up the two for Captain America 3: Civil War). I appreciated the camaraderie that the Avengers had in the Avengers Tower party scene, as it humanizes Earth's Mightiest Heroes. I personally didn't like the romantic relationship between Bruce and Natasha--none of the previous films, including this one, set them up as a couple--and yet they're talking about abandoning the team and running away together after defeating Ultron? <br/><br/>Bruce's inner demons are starting to feel tedious to watch, especially in the way it was handled. ***SPOILER ALERT*** He very unceremoniously leaves the team in a quinjet. And Natasha has now flirted (or at least had moments of romantic playfulness) with Tony, Cap, Hawkeye, and the Hulk. That seems kind of insulting to her character. (However, I do like that AoU delved into Black Widow's dark past.) Hawkeye gets some love, but I still don't think it was enough. (I don't even see why Black Widow and Hawkeye are main characters in the MCU, they're better off as major supporting characters. After all, they're fighting an army of robots and Hawkeye himself says that all he has is a bow and arrow!)<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT*** Of all the characters to kill off, the end of a recently introduced and supporting character is somewhat disappointing--especially how it was handled. We barely got time to be introduced to Quicksilver, but he is killed anyway. His final words are ""Bet you didn't see that coming"", but many had already predicted his death. (Was Quicksilver killed simply for shock effect, or because his character was too weak to compete against the one from X: Men DOFP?) The Vision, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch are all undeveloped (Scarlet Witch feels way too much like Carrie; from the horror movie).<br/><br/>Ultron is ""not as scary as the Winter Soldier, or as interesting and entertaining as Loki, or as ominous as hyper-intelligent Ava from Ex Machina."" He doesn't do anything actually useful with all of the power he supposedly has (no hacking, no using nukes?). AoU's Ultron is a far cry from the comics, where he's apparently a ""hyper- intelligent and adaptable being"". The father son relationship between Stark and Ultron that could have been, isn't. ""We aren't given any time for him and Stark to form a relationship that could later turn to hatred. There is never that process that allows us to accept Ultron first as Stark's 'child' and then as his antagonist."" Considering the love-hate relationship between Hank Pym and Ultron is a key part of his character in the comics (which I haven't read but know enough about), AoU is a letdown in that regard. (And the way he is defeated is pretty lame.)<br/><br/>Age of Ultron could've have definitely been a much better movie. Instead of leaving people wanting more, Joss Whedon has left most wanting less. The action gets too thick and makes the movie feel bloated; too many one-liners are said at impromptu times. Cap and Iron Man are the most interesting characters, but the rest fall flat. Whedon ""simply has too many balls to keep in the air for one movie—even a two-and-a-half-hour one."" In interviews, Whedon has said that he feels burned out by his responsibilities in the MCU. Therefore, him leaving the franchise is probably the best for all of us.<br/><br/>I have reviewed 40 movies (some on Metacritic and/or IMDb) including the 2014 and 2015 films: Fast & Furious 7, The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3 and more. I also review other TV shows, such as: Marvel's Daredevil, Agent Carter, Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), and more."

"jackowayne","10","11","25","8 May 2015"," 3 Reasons that make it the perfect Superhero Movie!!
","Being an avid comic-book & movie fan I had high expectations for this movie. Having read the reviews, I was not sure if this sequel was worth watching as I had already booked my ticket a day before. The movie started and then-BOOM!! Every moment in the movie was worth the money. I don't regret a second of the movie. <br/><br/>Some people don't realize that you don't get the same type of theme twice. Those who gave bad reviews were obviously hoping for the same theme and scenario as The Avengers. Joss Whedon stated that this movie would be much different from the prequel. The movie just creates the atmosphere that I wish to see in a superhero movie. 1. THE HEROES KICK SOME REAL ASS<br/><br/>Unlike it's prequel, Age of Ultron brings action sequences that are just awesome. True to the character's power,it allows him to upgrade as per the situation demands, which was seen in case of Hawkeye. That Bot-ass kicking action bestows pleasure to the eyes while gulping soda and grinding the popcorn.The extreme raving, outrageous,epic gripping of protection confined to the cause of serving humanity leaves you spellbound.<br/><br/>2. THE PERFECT ANTAGONIST<br/><br/>Ultron makes Loki look like a bunny. Everything starting from his intelligence to his voice makes a bad ass villain. I mean come on, he gave the Avengers a pretty hard time. He served under his will, made an entire army of Ultron-bots, stayed true to his wish of destroying humanity & was nearly indestructible. What more see can you ask?<br/><br/>3.THE STORY-TELLING<br/><br/>Right from the beginning till the end, there was a charismatic flow in the story. Whedon brings his magic to the big screen again with this sequel. None of the characters were ignored & they got a perfect screen-timing. I remained glued to my seat even in the interval. The sense of the story just doesn't let you quit, just like an awesome comic book. Respect.<br/><br/>THE AVENGERS:AGE OF ULTRON = Totally re-watchable (Upto a Million Times) + BEST Superhero Movie till date (Yes,better than THE DARK KNIGHT)."
"Everything_PopCulture","8","11","25","1 May 2015"," Age of Ultron doesn't live up to the hype, but still provides a solid installment in the Marvel Saga.
","It's impossible not to compare Age of Ultron to the Avengers first outing in 2012. Many critics and fans will be divided. Some claiming it's better than the first film and others saying it doesn't live up to it. I for one am one of those people who still enjoyed the first Avengers film more than Age of Ultron. This doesn't mean I didn't like Age of Ultron. As a matter of fact it's in my top 5 films of the MCU. A few weeks ago I would have said Age of Ultron was going to be the best of the MCU. I found myself a little bit disappointed in the overall project and here is why.<br/><br/>1. Ultron.... Ultron in the trailers looked to be a promising villain. I myself have found the typical MCU formula to be filled with underused and unmotivated villains. The only villains I really care about in the Marvel saga is Loki, Thanos and The Winter Soldier. Rarely will you ever hear someone talk about their love for Obadiah Stane, Maleketh the Accursed and.....Whiplash.... The trailers for Age of Ultron promised a very interesting, powerful, menacing and overall threatening villain. Walking out of the movie, I found Ultron to be forgettable, not much of a menace and overall not the Ultron I was looking forward to. Ultron's ultimate quest was to destroy humanity while also, for some strange reason, trying to make himself more human, aside from the fact that he wants to destroy humanity. Now destroying humanity is a typical plot device initiated by villains however Ultron promised to be more than the typical 'monster to destroy the world.' But in the end that's all he ends up being. SPOILERS ALERT; his creation was rushed, actually he was created by Tony sometime between Iron Man 3 and Age of Ultron but couldn't be activated because the technology wasn't working until they got Loki's staff from Hydra. SPOILERS END. Aside from his origins being rushed, from the trailers it seemed Ultron would be protecting the Earth for a little bit in Act 1, setting up his development as a character and ultimately making his turn to destruction far scarier. SPOILER ALERT This doesn't happen, as soon as Ultron is born he scans the internet and decides to destroy humanity. SPOILERS END. James Spader's voice is perfect for Ultron, but his goals and motivations were, in the end, underdeveloped and unconvincing. Not to mention, although he's supposed to be the biggest threat so far in the MCU, he just seems like a typical villain like Whiplash and Ronan the Accuser. His threat against Earth isn't convincing and isn't large enough on scale to provide fear for the audience. Tony seems to be so scared of Ultron yet Ultron does nothing the entire movie that gives evidence to why an audience should fear him. The Invasion of New York mastered fear for the audience. Ultron just didn't. <br/><br/>2. A VERY slow first act I myself am a film fanatic and greatly appreciate character development. You can have a slow first act in a film and it can be great if it's solid character development. Age of Ultron's first act seems to be shoving unnecessary character development in the audience's face for no reason at all. We had the first film for that, not to mention all of Phase One set before The Avengers. We know these characters. We love these characters. We know their back stories, even if we haven't seen it before, like Black Widow's back story, we have heard about it and don't need to see it. It just felt like Whedon was trying to show you who these characters are even though we already know. It was a bit annoying. The first act could have been so much more. We did see how Ultron was born, but this SHOULD have been act one instead of being rushed. Instead of giving us character development, develop Ultron more, show his journey to evil. The first act was overall slow. All talking and boring. <br/><br/>3. Humour....too much humour The Marvel films are known for their use of light hearted humour. I love it and it works. However Age of Ultron uses SO much humour that to me it took away from the darkness and threat of Ultron and, with all of humanity at stake, you would think the team would be too scared to make jokes. I love comedy, but Age of Ultron was filled to the brim with it and it just took away from the overall seriousness of the film.<br/><br/>4. Have I seen this before? The final act of the film felt a lot like the final act of the first Avengers. While still immensely entertaining, the final act was pretty much the same as the first film. SPOILERS ALERT; not to mention, the scene where Hulk is possessed and goes on a rampage and fights Iron Man, while awesome, we have seen this before, when Hulk went crazy in the Helicarrier in the first Avengers. Don't get rid of the scene just play it out differently.<br/><br/>Now for some things I did like.<br/><br/>1. Hawkeye has great development.<br/><br/>2. Sweet as fight scenes<br/><br/>3. Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and the Vision are awesome!<br/><br/>4. The final scene<br/><br/>Seeing SPOILERS ALERT; the new avengers team was cool. My only nitpick is it was a perfect moment to bring in Spider-man, Dr Strange, Black Panther, heck any Avenger we haven't seen yet. Wasted opportunity.<br/><br/>6. The Cinematography Honestly, along with Guardians of the Galaxy, Age of Ultron has the best camera work in the MCU<br/><br/>Overall Age of Ultron, while a bit disappointing due to overhype, a slow first act and underdeveloped villain, is still a great film and a fine addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"deepak-zeest","6","11","25","28 April 2015"," A good one-time watch but expect less. 3/5
","THE AVENGERS – AGE OF ULTRON<br/><br/>Apologies for the late review. I guess by now a lot of people must already have watched this mundane instalment from Marvel and must really have become confused as to what to make of the movie. So, let's roll.<br/><br/>I suppose the Marvel studio has really become filthy rich with its cinematic universe collections and since that ball is out of the park, they are busy weaving stories with no coherence whatsoever, to prepare for a grand finale.<br/><br/>No seriously! Someone has to say this. Because in my opinion, this movie was anything but close to its first instalment (notwithstanding the fact that Avengers universe is all about heroics and stunts and fantastic logics). Even judging by those standards, one feels alienated from the movie as it progresses. Well of course! Things are happening in the movie and no one knows why! <br/><br/>The first (known) absurdity was that despite the presence of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, they were not called by their names. And that was because of Marvel's rights issue with 20th Century Fox when they sold the rights of the characters of the mutants to the X-Men franchise. What's more absurd was that they were not even called 'Mutants'. They were 'Enhanced'.<br/><br/>Well even if you ignore that part, this character of Quicksilver doesn't even compare to the one we witnessed in X-Men -Days of Future Past. The humour of the character was just not apparent.<br/><br/>This brings me to the trailer of the movie. All we understood from the trailer was that a very dark portrayal of the story and the characters of Avengers is under-due; that we are going to witness a development which would do some soul searching, and show the grey shade the heroes would have to overcome. But alas! It all came down to nothing but just a little stint of manipulation by a future ally, and the dark visions of the heroes just seemed to be forced upon the viewers.<br/><br/>Not that one should complain about it, as the Avengers was always supposed to be a jolly franchise with great comic timings and humour. And that this movie does not disappoint in. The comic timings and funny punch-lines in the movie have still been retained the same as the first instalment. And that was the best part of the movie. Sure, we were not expecting it as we judged from the allegedly 'dark' trailer of the movie, but well this was the grease which kept the machine running. Extremely hilarious moments with a somewhat apathetic stance (obviously they are heroes!), tickles your senses and leaves you wanting more from that aspect of the movie. Full points to Avengers for that.<br/><br/>So it all comes down to the story. Remember the part where we learn about the 'infinity stones' in 'Guardians of the Galaxy' ? Well the story is basically trying to link that part to the Avengers, and apparently to converge the story lines of all the other movies into some Grand-finale episode (which would obviously feature 'Thanos'). Not to give away the story too much, I should only confess that all the hoolaboola in this movie was basically concentrated upon the ""things to come"" , and not ""things which are present"".<br/><br/>So what was all that hoolaboola ? ULTRON and its VISION! The only importance of Ultron in this movie (though it was portrayed to be very important as it was the brain-child of Tony Stark and the code in Loki's sceptre. Ah, just believe it!), was to be a mad program which tries to destroy the earth (once again), and it creates a ""Vision"" (another character) which is supposedly the saner part of ""Ultron"" and ultimately sides with the Avengers.<br/><br/>All of this is happening while the Avengers are just fighting amongst themselves. Not that it was not enjoyable, but please, concentrate on the villain already! Anyway, the largest part of the cake goes to the Iron Man Vs Hulk fight. That fight was nasty! If you are not sure whether to go watch this movie or not, just buy the tickets for this specific sequence!<br/><br/>All in all, the story is just straying around with too much speeches and unneeded philosophies (especially from Ultron) and there are literally too many people (from all other movies). The love-angle of Black Widow and #### was appreciable, along with a somewhat tragic end to one of the characters. But the climax was a bit anti- climactic as we expect a lot when it comes to a movie like Avengers, where the stakes are so high.<br/><br/>So all in all,<br/><br/>Humour – 5/5 Action – 3/5 Story – 1/5 Anticipation – 0/5<br/><br/>Verdict – A good one-time watch but expect less. 3/5<br/><br/>Read at : http://ufictionary.com/2015/04/28/the-avengers-age-of- ultron/"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","11","25","24 April 2015"," S.H.I.E.L.D. parade – behold and marvel!
","(ADDITIONAL SPOILER WARNING!) <br/><br/>The first ""Avengers"" concluded with the six of them dispersing after the crisis has been resolved, and Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) reassuring Agent Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders) that they will return if and when needed.<br/><br/>This sequel (hopefully the beginning of many more to come) wastes no time in throwing the six of them in full action, in a mission to wipe out the remains of Hydra and secure the powerful Scepter. This is only appetizer, obviously.<br/><br/>Just to get it out of the way, the set pieces are superbly spectacular and spectacularly superb, as expected. Of this I need say no more.<br/><br/>The plot is as old as Isaac Asimov's various ingenious themes, prominently featuring two key ones: artificial intelligence serving mankind and the idea of developing a mechanism with which Earth can defend itself against potential alien invaders. Both are benignly conceived, but unfortunately get out of control. What else is new? <br/><br/>What ""Ultron"" has to offer is an unprecedented parade of Marvel characters under the S.H.I.E.L.D. umbrella, starting with the aforementioned Nick Fury and Maria Hill. The six originals undergo character developments in various degrees. The romance between Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), hinted with tantalizing subtlety even when she first recruited him, now goes in full bloom. In the romance department, what went on before between her and Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) was red herring. There's was friendship and comradeship in a professional context, as Barton is now reviewed to have a model family comprising lovely wife Laura (Linda Cardeellini) and two kids. At the end of ""Ultron"" there is every indication that he will be retiring from action in circumstances very similar to Brian O'Conner's – call of domesticity. While on that, I'll always feel a pang of sadness when I think of Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Banner, who has a duel role of scientist and monster/hero here, winds up disappearing again at the end but will undoubtedly re-emerge in the next sequel. Ditto for Thor (Chris Hemsworth). Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and Steve Rogers (Chris Evans) together become the core of the team, to which new players are added. But let's back up a little to see how artificial intelligent is featured in this movie. We have two key ""characters"" here. Titular Ultron, the prime villain, played via motion-capture and voice by James Spader, is represented by a not-too-hideous looking robot in physical form. The other we know already from the ""Iron Man"" franchise, a HAL-like computer Jarvis, with the voice of Paul Bettany. In ""Ultron"" the bodiless Jarvis, initially outclassed and ""killed"" by Ultron, eventually coming back with in the physical form of Bettany in a phoenix-arising-from-fire resurrection, and becomes a key addition to the team.<br/><br/>Another key addition is Wanda Maximoff, otherwise known as Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who initially is in the lineup of the enemies together with 12-minute-older twin brother Pietro, or Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). ""He is fast and she is weird"", as someone quipped, is a cryptic description of their superpower. Pietro who is really another version of ""The Flash"" (if you have been watching that TV series) dies at the end while Wanda, with her mind-influencing power and fire-generating skill, joins the Avengers.<br/><br/>Two other new recruits give the Avenger a better ethnic balance, as Nick Fury has all but retired and has never really been a full player in the field. Don Cheadle who replaced Terrence Howard in the ""Iron Man"" series brings his character of James Rhodes, or War Machines, to this movie in a minor role, essentially supporting Iron Man in action. Anthony Mackie similarly brings his role of Sam Wilson, or The Falcon, over from ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", not even seeing any action here but merely a cameo appearance at the end as a new member to the team."

Chosen angles and film-techniques which remind of Transformers - which bloat scenes and give them more gravity while there is no content or added value...<br/><br/>This episode, however, strikes a perfect balance: the scene's are beautiful with much tense action and sublime graphics.

But they are not what carries the movie: the graphics and action scenes are complimentary to the main story line and an expression of the motivations and personalities of the characters.<br/><br/>Each individual character gets enough airtime to feel sympathy or understand how s/he is thinking, feeling or operating in the moment. Which creates debt and traction, without being boring or being bland.<br/><br/>Additionaly, Tony Stark seems to have been matured. Which opens a window for his character to evolve further in a more paternal or protective role aside of the (nearly annoying) juvenile spectrum we've known him for.<br/><br/>In short: this is an Avenger movie where there has been attention for the details other action movies of the genre often fall too short. Well worth your time."

","The assembled Avengers cinematic universe, as well as each character's standalone film(s) is intended as an homage to a long standing property, fore fronting entertainment and nostalgia above substance and development. That is not detrimental by any means, some of the best products of entertainment have followed the same formula and found incredible and justified success. What Whedon has done with both of the assembled outings though did not qualify in this category at all. I am aware that he has achieved that untouchable-nerdy godlike status that allows him the ""creative"" liberties to now assemble juggernaut films like Avengers Assemble and Age of Ultron, where the eye-candy mind-numbing loud-chaos inter-cut with snide comments, punchlines and one-liners aiming at posterity are force fed on audiences. Considering then that we're not expected to be watching a film with the narrative complexity that Nolan has granted Batman trilogy, we wouldn't have expected such thin, lazy and pedestrian treatment. The characters that previously were given little to no room to develop are now treated to clichéd and forced subplots, the setup and motivations are as tired and laughable as it goes and the required comedic relief is so forced and bland that it is widely cringing. Even so, Whedon somehow manages to go through the motions requiring an almost impossible sense of suspension of disbelief, even for comic book standards and plot holes you could walk an elephant through.<br/><br/>All his might seem a contradictory coming from a self-proclaimed summer blockbuster superhero film fan. It might even seem more contradictory review coming from a huge X-Men, a fan that manages to somehow find redeeming qualities and saving graces in the weakest entries (and there are nine of them). The case with The Avengers franchise though is that an already overcrowded ensemble unites for sequels upon sequels, not to mention their own parallel trilogies that also include mini reunions of sorts, with absolutely no originality or saving grace other than the massive wide spectacle of worldwide destruction. Call it cynicism, call it incoherence. I call it overgrowing exhaustion with this franchise."

I could go on and nit pick the differences I've already listed and bring up even more faults (eg If Ultron had an ""otherworldly"" origin, why was his persona so hip?), but, in short, I was easily bored with this movie.<br/><br/>IMO, the very best comic book movie to date is Watchmen which had everything most current comic book movies - short fight scenes, built tension towards the end, accurate costumes, seeming ""real"" characters, etc...<br/><br/>I'm sure the young crowd will love this.

Should dedicate to make musicals Buffy the Vampire Slayer. I did not like how all the characters interact. What annoyed me most was Hulk looks like a fat cranky. Hulk does not walk like a monkey. The best was the 2008 movie. Ultron, rather than cause fear and respect, causes me laugh. The film has too many jokes for my taste. And many are bad jokes.

","8.5/10 – Reviewed by Matthew French<br/><br/>Making a sequel to a movie that was, not only the third highest grossing of all time, but an ensemble of other movies successful in their own right, is a challenge akin to piggy backing your Nepalese sherpa up Everest the week after conquering Kilimanjaro.<br/><br/>Thankfully director, and Galactic lord of geeks, Joss Whedon has delivered in a big way. No, it's not a perfect movie, and yes, you can absolutely pick fault with it. But, if you are looking for more of the same that you got from The Avengers: epic, sweeping action scenes and snappy, witty dialogue you will walk out of the theatre more than satisfied. <br/><br/>The same things that worked for Whedon's original big screen triumph are back again with some significant improvements. The action sequences are incredible. From the opening scene where our mighty heroes are storming a Hydra base to reclaim Loki's sceptre (and one of the all important infinity stones) the big bangs and bright colours are enough to trigger a thousand epileptic fits.<br/><br/>The dialogue is even better than what we've become used to in Marvel films. This movie is significantly funnier than most comedies I have seen in recent years. It is worth the price of admission for the party scene in Stark Tower alone. Seriously, that scene is five minutes of chuckle, after laugh, after giggle, after titter. <br/><br/>The good guys are great with the cast all in scintillating form. Robert Downey Jris, as usual, at his snappy charming best as Iron Man. His highlight reel is significantly more than just the much anticipated 'Hulk Buster suit' fight scene, although that is exquisite enough to ensure this movie becomes an instant classic on its own.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth is in just about career best form. Which is great if you're a hard core Thor fan boy, like me. In an unexpected turn of events the golden locked Asgardian is responsible for possibly more LOL's than any of his comedically astute team mates.<br/><br/>Hulk and Captain America are as entertaining as always, Hawkeye is leagues from the 'boring Avenger' he was previously known as, and the Maximoff twins (better known as Quiksilver and Scarlett Witch) are an excellent addition. Without doubt, though, the award for best newcomer goes to 'The Vision' played by the always amazing Paul Bettany. I won't go into detail regarding Vision's awesomeness but rest assured he almost steals the show.<br/><br/>The only let down is the under developed villain. The menacing, yet witty creation of Tony Stark comes into being so fast and with so little explanation that it's hard to comprehend his motives or purpose. The movie would perhaps be more aptly named 'Avengers: weekend of Ultron'.<br/><br/>Still, this is of little consequence. We all know that an Avengers movie is like an all-star Football team. We don't care who the opposition is, we care only that our team kicks some serious butt.<br/><br/>The Marvel cinematic universe has kicked another goal here. Odin knows how the hell I'm going to be able to wait for Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>See all our reviews at: www.facebook.com/shenaniganmoviereviews"

","I loved what they did with The Vision and how they did it. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver — aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be. What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch.<br/><br/>There are good, fun moments spread all through the movie, don't get me wrong I liked plenty of stuff in it. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow was interesting, this universe has been weirdly sexless so it was nice to see some tension between the characters. But good moments don't make a good movie. What annoyed me in Age of Ultron was how it just glossed over so many things. The story is extremely thin, even for a superhero movie."

","When the Walt Disney Company purchase Marvel Studios in 2009; there was lots of doubts that story of the Avengers comics book, could ever be put on screen, and make sense to non-comic book readers. Marvel Studios, somehow pull it off, with the Phase One film campaign. From 2008 to 2012, the first set of movies introduces the core main characters of the Avengers superhero group, such as Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Captain America (Chris Evans), one by one. All this work in creating a Marvel Cinematic Universe, leaded to 2012's megahit, The Avengers, which compare all these characters into one film. Once again, Marvel Studios is trying to recapture the magic, by launching Phrase 2, which focuses on even more new characters, while exploiting the establish characters in solo missions type films. Most of those films, kinda work, as they help push the Infinity Stones storyline even more, while showing the breakdown of establish agency groups, such as S.H.I.E.L.D. When Marvel Studios once again, wanted to bring back Avengers, back together, it brought all types of sub-plot storyline back into one film. Sadly, in my opinion, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron doesn't really connect that well, with the other previous solo films. The film left a lot of the previous films plot-holes, unexplained and continue to make it, wider, with even more confusing, rush subplots. It kinda felt, like the movie was repeating itself, more than often. While, the movie does bring new light into the main characters dark gritty back stories, the main plot is pretty generic. Instead, of aliens trying to destroy the world, it is robots leaded by Ultron (Voiced by James Spader). The whole idea of the Avengers bringing Vision (Paul Bettany) to life, to protect the world, comes out of nowhere and seem kinda forced. Also, I didn't like how the Vision look. He look kinda stupid due to the costume changes. He looks a robot made out of Starbursts. Other than that, visually, this movie directed by Joss Weldon is amazing to watch. It had tons of great action pack scenes, but the writing would need, some work. The ""story telling"" in this movie is practically non-existent. The movie is nothing more than a giant action sequence sprinkled with what passes as dialogue in between. The humor was alright for the most part. The acting, throughout the film is pretty good. It was a bit weird, seeing Tony Stark in the Iron Man suit, because he destroy most of his technology in the end of 2013's Iron Man 3. Robert Downey Jr is indeed Iron Man. It would be, hard to replace him. I really hope, they will be able to keep, Downey aboard, until 2019's Avengers Infinity Wars are over. Chris Evans is everybody favorite Boy Scout, and he continues to make Captain America, seemed new. I love, how, the movie is settling up, the events between him and Stark, leading to 2016's Captain America: Civil War. It looks great. Chris Hemsworth as Thor, honed this part. I just didn't like his little sub mission. It didn't bring anything new to the table. I like, that Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) is given, more depth. The whole romantic subplot, of Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) & Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) seem odd. It was a mixed bag for me. I like, the whole Red Room exposition scene, but I really didn't buy, into Natasha having a thing for Banner, after having flings with both Captain America & Hawkeye in the previous films. Still, both of their acting is pretty well-done. The villains are pretty good. James Spader is amazing as Ultron. He has the right amount of wit and smarts, to play a convincing robotic megalomaniac. I really didn't like the changes, they did to the character origins, but I was willing to go with it. New characters like Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch was really needed. She pretty own it. I really didn't mind, Aaron- Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, but it was kinda a disappointment. Evan Peters did a better job in 20th Century Fox's version of Quicksilver in 2014's X-Men: Day of Future Past. I really thought, that having Quicksilver in this Marvel Studios film, was very pointless, and I was somewhat right. I really had, no strong emotion ties with Aaron's version of character. Both Baron Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann) & Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis) seem like a waste. I hate to see them as half-baked, side villains. Still, it's nice to see Andy Serkis, not in a motion-capture type role. Also, look forward to the Stan Lee's cameo. The ending action scene to the film was kinda disappointing due to how outlandish, it was. It was simply impossible for the sequel to recapture the magic of seeing Earth's Mightiest Heroes assembled on screen for the first time, especially when they've popped up in each others' movies in the ensuing years and the overuse of trailers spoiling way too much of the film. Still, as far as second installments go- it was alright. It was good popcorn fun. It's a solid and entertaining follow-up. The post-credits scene wasn't anything, worthy to wait for. The music was kinda underwhelming. Wish, the music had the same tone of the first film. Overall: The film was OK. It easily fulfilled and the exceeded most of my expectations. It's time to assemble again and go see this movie. You wouldn't regret it! I do recommended, seeing this sequel."

","Where to start with this over-hyped and underwhelming spectacle...<br/><br/>EVERYTHING IS HUGE. THE THEATER, THE SCREEN, THE AUDIENCE, THE POPCORN. THE ANTICIPATION.<br/><br/>And so it begins, deep in a totally unexplained, but perfectly enjoyable action sequence. Excessive explosions, stunts, and character teamwork accelerate the pace to a blistering speed within the first few minutes of the film and begin to satisfy the building excitement. Keep in mind, I haven't been counting the days or anything, but, I'm ready for a new great superhero/action film! (with Guardians and The Winter Soldier fresh in mind) Okay, everyone's pumped up, now. Time to hit them with them A-listers involved in disinterested dialogue exchanges, supplemented by futuristic gadgets and intricate wardrobes. This is starting to feel familiar... Oh no, self-deprecating superhero humor... and... look everyone a villain! Okay, the potential for redemption is still strong. Not letting go of hope yet here. If this villain is awesome, I'm so in.<br/><br/>Bam! ULTRON. Picture the scene from the Exorcist where Regan interrupts the cocktail party by peeing on the floor, but instead of a young Linda Blair, it's a robot leaking motor oil. Oh, and instead of a jolly crowd of churchgoers, it's Stark's crew of tipsy superheroes.<br/><br/>I'm not going to get into any more specifics regarding the story, as, well, that's enough.<br/><br/>This film suffers from being weak in a department in which it should be so strong - visual effects. The various renderings of Ultron feel incomplete and unloved. His face moves like its made of skin, but, its metal - as far as visual fidelity talking robots go, Transformers kicks this out of the park and I involuntarily cringe saying that. Which reminds me of the most overused comment in recent memory, ""I just threw up in my mouth a little bit."" A home run line when used to refer to Ben Stiller's character in Dodgeball, but here, coming out of the 'mouth' of a robotic super-villain it is absolutely heinous. It was so poorly placed that, I ALMOST THREW UP IN MOUTH A LITTLE BIT. HAHA.<br/><br/>The opportunity to present more amazing advanced S.H.I.E.L.D engineering accomplishments, such as the flying aircraft carrier, are of course superseded by a common device in this film: Do it again! The flying aircraft carrier makes a triumphant return in all of its unwelcome glory. That's fine if you want to bring it back, it even makes total sense. However, to build it up as some sort of major, exciting event seemed like a cop-out. It's like we were supposed to be enthusiastic about eating leftovers... I mean, some people like leftovers, but, not going out to dinner and paying for them... or looking at them again, but, this time, in 3D! After a certain point in the course of this film, I completely lost interest. I just didn't care anymore. When they think they're hitting you hard with the loss of a character, you realize that you don't care either. This was one of the most emotionless killings of a character that I have ever seen. All I can think at this point is, please kill off more characters, its the only thing that will make this movie significant enough to justify the high price of admission, unrelenting hype, and self-induced buttered popcorn nausea.<br/><br/>Once the film was over, I squeezed out of my aisle and couldn't have gotten out of the theater any faster. I don't care if there is another Howard the Duck teaser or Spiderman vs Sony or Fantastic Fox-Farts or Stan Lee cameo or ahhh, I think I'm officially cashed out on the superhero stuff.<br/><br/>Thank you Age of Ultron for helping me realize that the Age of Underwhelming is upon us."
"kaustubh241997","6","9","20","6 May 2015"," A bowl of overcooked,convoluted,entertaining mess
","Right off the bat I can say one thing without any hesitation. I enjoyed watching this movie. It was supposed to be linear summer blockbuster flick meant to cash in on the now highly maximized marvel fan base. Joss Whedon to be honest was at his best while making this movie. I have watched this movie twice. My first viewing as a normal 3d movie and my second in IMAX, thus my review is pretty much an in depth analysis about the movie and a lot of it's aspects that grew on me, in the bad way. Throughout this review, my statements might sound a bit nit picky but these aspects really pushed me out of the overall experience of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>1) Casting and Characterisation: - I have absolutely no problem with the returning avenger crew. They were fantastic back in 2012; they are equally fantastic and dynamic now. The first party scene in the movie shows the relationship and chemistry amongst the old returning crew and highlighting the brilliant work done by the casting crew previously. Talking about new comers, James Spader was spectacular. Ever since the first time I viewed him in the Office and Blackhat, I knew he was perfect for the role o this menacing baddie . With what was given to him by script and what he executed, he was generally flawless. But the incoherent plot script and rushed narrative didn't flush out his character to the fullest throwing down the brilliant opportunity to make him a very memorable villain, which I will be explaining later in depth in this review. Also Quicksikver is not as good as the days of future past iteration. <br/><br/>2) Story, Screenplay and Plot: - This is the basic reason why my rating for this movie is as low as 6/10. Everything wrong and bitter about this movie lies with the unnecessarily over convoluted, incoherent and unexplained plot that drove me crazy on the first viewing. <br/><br/>i) How and why did tony start making his suits again after the end of iron man 3? ii) What was the compelling reason why Ultron became that menacing? iii) Why and how did the relationship between Natasha and Bruce crop up?<br/><br/>It just feels as if the whole movie was just rushed to the audience as if Disney is sitting back in their office and saying, "" They will pay us and watch it anyways "". Seriously! The love story between Bruce and Natasha for that matter is so underdeveloped and cooked. I didn't see any chemistry between them in previous movies, at least not something that could bring up this love story into light. The biggest point of the movie, the reason why this movie was made, Ultron was just scrapped completely and misused by Joss. Ultron quite literally comes in the beginning of the movie, gives a vague reason, turns ultra menacing, builds more of his kind and plans a world destruction scheme all with absolutely no character development. It's shameful to see this happen especially with someone as good as James Spader in the shoes. Hulk and Thor were also left back, especially Hulk put into the stupid mess of a love story I didn't give two damns about. It is really frustrating to see such missed opportunities here. The whole movie is one bowl of ambitious but overcooked plot that Joss Whedon thought it would be okay to put some more darkness and gritty plot actions to make this movie something really dark and aggressive. Thus on a whole not as good as the first one. <br/><br/>3) Direction: - I need to give a shout out to Whedon though for putting his best efforts to bring in the crew again into the screen to make this a compelling movie. The charm of seeing these heroes assemble was gone with the first one, and Joss Whedon has done a brilliant job fulfilling a tough task to make these characters feel relevant again as a crew. The action is superb. I loved every moment of action in the movie; in fact Joss was clever to add in an explosive scene every time you say "" WHAT THE HELL WAS THAT? "" about the plot to keep to attracted to the movie. The first battle with Ultron was a bit over the top I felt, but nonetheless kept me at the edge of the seat. I still don't understand how many of the heroes don't exactly get hurt or injured towards the end. Kudos again to Joss who even under Disney's pressure didn't back away from showing causalities and death in this movie unlike the first one where every citizen was conveniently alive. And the hulk buster fight, if that was the only thing in the movie I would give this a 10. On a whole, yes great director, no for a screenwriter or script writer for that matter. <br/><br/>On an overall, the movie is a mess. I don't go into a theater to see explosions every 2 or 3 minutes and feel satisfied with that. I am disappointed about the fact that though this movie could not live up to the first one, the crew did an awful job at including the thrilling charm and vibe of the first movie's villain and his motives into this iteration. The first avengers showed Loki at every step doing his job, explaining his motives giving him enough screen time and making him the lovable dirt bag we wanted but this movie has less than half of what the movie needs to offer. , Or at least half of what it's previous movie offered. It is a fun movie, and must be watched in theater, but let me warn you, if you are a big avengers fan, like I am, this movie will grow on you, in a bad sense."

","Second acts are tough and sequels are tougher; usually we get way too much of what made the first movie cool, so Joss Whedon had his work cut out for him when set out to make AVENGERS:AGE OF ULTRON, the followup to the his first outing with Marvel's premier super group.<br/><br/>What is good about ULTRON:<br/><br/>The characters and the interaction among them; Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, The Hulk, Hawkeye, and The Black Widow are back and doing what they do best: trade one liners and bicker while they throw down with the bad guys. Whedon uses dialog well to delineate the superheroes and the sharp differences between them, especially the conflict between men of science Tony Stark and Bruce Banner and men of action Steve Rogers and Thor. It's a real kick to see Robert Downey, Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, and Scarlett Johansson in these iconic roles that fit them like gloves. This time Hawkeye and Natasha Romanoff get a little more screen time and a some new insight into their characters, which is very welcome. Samuel L. Jackson is back as Nick Fury, a part he was born to play. Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba, Hayley Atwell, Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Cobie Smoulders all make appearances in roles they played in other Marvel superhero movies. A new addition is Andy Serkis as arms dealer Klaue, a familiar villain to Marvel readers. Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Oleson are Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch, mutants with very special powers who start out on the wrong side, but like so many of the misguided in the Marvel Universe, eventually see the light. Paul Bettany is not only the voice of Jarvis, but he shows up in the flesh (sort of) as the Vision.<br/><br/>The action scenes, which if they don't break in new ground, certainly kick it up a notch with the showdown between a Hulk who has had his mind messed with by The Scarlet Witch and Tony Stark in his Hulkbuster armor. The finale where the Avengers assembled square off with Ultron's mechanical minions is a real high point, as is the attack on Baron Struker's liar in the opening, proving that Whedon has learned the lesson the Bond film makers learned long ago: give them a big opening sequence and then top it in the finale. There's no Kirsten Dunst singing here.<br/><br/>James Spader as Ultron. His voice work is the whole show as the villain, a malignant AI, the result of Tony Stark's obsession with making the world safe from cosmic big bads. It helps that the various robot versions of Ultron do resemble Spader ever so much, specially capturing Spader's patented smirk. At times listening to Spader, I thought it was The Avengers vs Red Reddington from THE BLACKLIST. <br/><br/>What's not so great about AGE OF ULTRON: To start with, a killer robot or out of control AI is really nothing new, no matter how great the special effects. I know Marvel did this trope back when it was shiny and new, but it has gotten pretty tarnished by now; in fact it was starting to get stale back when ALIEN did it. <br/><br/>The plot which, consists of nothing much more than stopping Ultron, wears thin by the end, although it is covered up by the witty interaction between the heroes very well. Comic books are known for their wonderfully twisty plots and arcs, and they don't always translate well to the screen, but Ultron could have used a few more subplots. Maybe they should have gone with the Korvac sage instead. <br/><br/>Now that the rights to Spider-Man has been bought by Disney/Marvel, let's hope he shows up for the third Avengers movie; and when will we see Josh Brolin's Thanos take center stage after he and the Infinity Gauntlet show up in the post credit sequence?"
"blitzkrieg007","7","9","20","1 May 2015"," Sorry Ultron you won't be in hall of fame of the villains
","The movie starts with the Avengers assaulting a remote HYDRA base in the fictional Eastern European republic of Sokovia where they encounter enhanced twins: the quick-footed Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the mystical Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) but the real villains though is Ultron an Artificial Intelligence that Scarlet witch leads Stark to create.<br/><br/>When it comes to Ultron, It doesn't look much scarier or world threatening in any place, like in the previous movie Loki played the role of villain. Ultron doesn't live upto the expectation of a bad ass villain that you might expect.On the other hand twins were quite good to play villain and hero both.<br/><br/>The Avengers, bad guys and the new character are simply to much too tackle even for a director like Whedon. The Movie's sturdy machinery, the action sequence and extraneous story(Hawkeye's home) suck up most of the movies life. Otherwise it could have been way more better.<br/><br/>Being said all that its an overall entertaining movie with good action and some laughs in between. You will definitely enjoy it with your family more."
"YJLcool","8","9","20","23 April 2015"," A good worthy sequel, but without exceeding expectations
","After the first Avengers film 3 years ago, we finally get to see the gang back together again! Being one of the most highly anticipated films of 2015, can Marvel deliver its magic once again with a slightly darker, serious and slightly complex plot line? (don't worry, not as dark and serious as the Dark Knight Trilogy or Man of Steel) Well, safely to say, it's still undeniably another massively entertaining and enjoyable feast for Marvel fans. There are more awesome and cooler action sequences, wonderful character moments with funny witty dialogues, spectacular visuals with more new Avenger characters filling in this time around. With writer/director Joss Whedon at helm again with all the same actors reprising their roles, the film still feels lively with the occasional team banters.<br/><br/>There's a lot to deliver in Avengers: Age of Ultron...aside from the main plot line, world-building, bigger and better action scenes that needs to be in the sequel, it needs to set up the beginnings of Marvel's Phase 3 plans as well. As a result, there are lots of subplots and references going around in the film for fans to take note of: Tony and Steve clashing ideologies for Captain America: Civil War, mentioning of Wakanda and the introduction of Ulysses Klaw, enemy of Black Panther and Thor's vision of Asgard for Thor: Ragnarok and Infinity War. So it's definitely not an easy task for Joss Whedon to juggle with so many characters in the same film. Thankfully, every hero does get their chance to shine. Surprisingly, Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Clint Barton/Hawkeye have bigger roles this time around and are more involved than before with their character arcs. The film is very clear with its theme, by showing how misguided intentions, no matter how noble they may be, could potentially lead to more death and destruction.<br/><br/>The action scenes are very well choreographed with superb, top notch CGI effects. Hulk is getting more screen time smashing several Ultron robots with his fists, and even Iron Man, himself too. The massive, destructive battle between the Hulkbuster Mark 44 Iron Man suit against the Hulk is definitely one of the highlights of the film. Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver, Vision, they all have a good balance of action screen time to show their abilities against Ultron and his robotic armies (except for War Machine and Falcon, which have a slightly minor role compared with the rest). The final climactic battle of the film is certainly the most over-the-top, ""comic booky"" thing ever put on screen (not sure it's a good or bad thing).<br/><br/>With that being said, now comes the bad part. The film has too many new characters introduced in this sequel and not enough character development to make them memorable (despite the film's long running time) and this hurts the film a lot. The 'Enchanced' Twins' origins were simply brushed off by a few lines from the main characters and Vision's powers were not clearly explained in the film. Moreover, there's too much going on that there's simply no time for the casual audience (non-Marvel fans) to take a breather and slowly digest the new plot and character developments.<br/><br/>There were lots of sudden plot developments shoehorned into the story: forced romance between Banner/Hulk and Natasha/Black Widow (When did Natasha start having feelings for Banner?), the introduction of two vital team members - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, the birth and introduction of Vision, the increased development of Hawkeye, the introduction and development of the main villain, Ultron. Not to mention, there are other members of the gang needs to be on the spotlight as well.<br/><br/>The main villain, Ultron is rather disappointing. His motivations of destroying humanity aren't clear enough, his grudge against Tony feels rushed and underdeveloped, which makes him less compelling. In comparison, Scarlet Witch is a far more terrifying force compared to Ultron as the film clearly shows that she has the power to tear the whole team (Avengers) apart like they were nothing.<br/><br/>In short, is Avengers: Age of Ultron as good as The Avengers? Well, it's near there and it's good enough, but without exceeding expectations. It seems that the film is quite rushed and fast-paced due to the editing cuts needed to make the film shorter (the first cut is said to be roughly 3 hours). The script does feel slightly weaker than the more well-constructed first film, but the action, witty dialogue is more than enough to make up for it. With the release of The Avengers: Age of Ultron, Marvel's second Phase is coming to an end very soon (after this year's Ant-Man).<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2015/04/movie-review-avengers-age-of- ultron.html"

Vision: <br/><br/>Vision is now one my favorite Marvel Cinematic Characters just cause his character and posture and personality was amazing and I loved it <br/><br/>3. Scarlett Witch's nightmare power: <br/><br/>Some people said they didn't like this part but, I liked seeing all the avengers nightmares it had a cool storyline and plot to the movie <br/><br/>4. The Pinnochio reference:<br/><br/>I swear this is the only good thing Disney has done to marvel since they bought it. It added such a creepy effect to the movie but I loved it. <br/><br/>5. THE HELICARRIER CAME BACK!!!!:<br/><br/>OMG THIS WAS MY GREATEST FANBOY MOMENT DURING THE WHOLE ENTIRE MOVIE AND IT WAS AWESOME AND IT CAME UP AND I WAS LIKE CHJSIXNSBOZLALEFIXJSN <br/><br/>6. The one freaking dog in the freaking city got saved:<br/><br/>I love how there was only one dog in the whole city but they saved it. Props to you marvel <br/><br/>7. Ultron did not look like AI:<br/><br/>I was glad that Ultron actually looked somewhat cool and not like a robot. <br/><br/>Bad: I feel this movie had more bad parts than good parts <br/><br/>1. The comedic references: <br/><br/>There were so many comedic references in this movie and it absolutely ruined it. Some of them were good such as the Thor's hammer bit and the cap's line at the very end but most of it ruined it <br/><br/>2. Ultron was cracking jokes: <br/><br/>DO NOT HAVE THE FRIKIN AI Villain CRACKING JOKES IT RUINED THE CHARACTER AND LIKE JUST Don't DO IT I SWEAR IF THANOS CRACKS ONE FRICKIN JOKE I AM GOING TO WALK RIGHT OUT OF THE THEATER<br/><br/>3. WHERE ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH DID NATASHA ROMANOF AND BRUCE BANNER COME FROM???? <br/><br/>At least in Avengers 1 hawkeye and Natasha had a lit bit of intro to their romance but this just came out of the blue and I did not like it <br/><br/>4. WHERE WAS THOSE MINI HELICARRIERS IN AVENGERS 1??? <br/><br/>The mini helicarriers would've helped when trying to save new york but yeah. <br/><br/>5. The beginning fight scene looked so fake <br/><br/>For a marvel movie, the beginning scene looked like it was made by a 2 year old I mean honestly I know its fake but Marvel step up your game <br/><br/>6. Um, Why do you kill a superhero in the first movie they appear in??? <br/><br/>I don't know why they killed Quicksilver I mean unless they just want to screw over the X- Men but I don't think so, so I probably think he is not dead <br/><br/>7. I felt that the movie had too many plots and moved to quickly <br/><br/>I felt that the movie's speed was like hey here's ultron nope we're not gonna let u think about that, here's hulk and black widow think about that nope here's.... And you get where I'm going <br/><br/>8. I felt that Nick Fury had no use in this movie except for a motivational monologue and bringing in the helicarrier <br/><br/>9. WHY WAS FALCON ONLY IN THE MOVIE FOR 5 SECONDS??? <br/><br/>Falcon is one of my favorite Cinematic heros because he is a total boss but seriously your only gonna put him in for 5 seconds <br/><br/>Confusing <br/><br/>1. A. WHERE ON GOD'S GREEN EARTH DID NICK FURY FIND THE HELLICARRIER???? <br/><br/>B. Where did Nick Fury find the people to operate the helicarrier???<br/><br/>2. Don't get me started on Vision picking up Thor's hammer but I think it was just comic relief and it was kinda funny <br/><br/>Set-ups <br/><br/>1. Please tell me Hulk is going to Planet Hulk <br/><br/>2. AVENGERS 3 NEEDS TO BE INFINITY WAR <br/><br/>I feel that overall the movie was OK but Captain America winter solider was better"
"louis-edward","5","10","23","2 May 2015"," The most anticipated film of 2015 but just a big disappointment
","I have been wanting to see this film since July 2014 when they announced the name, but I was just disappointment when the credits rolled. It had so much potential that was just thrown away by $250 million. The film begins with a full Avengers action scene, but the action falls short of the standard that you would see from other Marvel films like Iron Man or Avengers Assemble, it's just a bit all over the place. The story also follows suit, the story twists and developed characters that you see in DC films are gold dust compared to the development of characters and story in this. But it does have it's up sides, there are quite a few good jokes that'll keep you happy and good CGI for some eye candy."
"rumasuk","8","10","23","30 April 2015"," Im seeing this again
","Yes!, it does not have any major surprises that you haven't seen before. But it has a couple of small surprises that are really cool. First of all, yeah there are LOTS of one liners, but i think the avengers would talk like that between each other even in the face of extinction. Its funny sometimes but it has it good share of bad jokes. Yeah i saw those criticisms in other reviews and i thought i would address them first. NOW, the good stuff, its great to see them working as a team, the opening scene was great, their relationship as a team and buddies is awesome, even with the occasional bad one liner. Each character gets his time in the spotlight and this time i felt every character was great, every one. Ultron is great, he is not as menacing as we thought he would be, but he has a lot of time on screen and that is really great because we get to see him doing his stuff. The twins are good too, their accents are funny but they have a good story as small as it is and their motivations are well presented. Their powers are the thing i felt lacked exploration but its OK. The action is the best freaking thing we've seen on screen, it has the best scenes of any marvel movie and they give you a lot of action sequences. The final brawl was inventive, bad ass and stylish. <br/><br/>Spoilers!!<br/><br/>Vision was a great character, he is just as the movie version of vision should be. Hawkeye small segment was awesome, is one small surprise that might not be that important but it really gave me a reason to care for him. The action was effing amazing, there are 4 or 5 major sequences and every single one is long and awesome. But they were never boring. The team at the end is great, lets see what are they going to do with it. Ultron and Vision last chat was pretty awesome and the best bit of foreshadowing in the whole movie. Ultron's plan was one of the best evil plans for me, very simple yet very new and something i didn't expect. The title is kind of dumb, age of Ultron? he's just there for a week at most, thats not an age."
"brrkrklnd748","10","10","23","25 April 2015"," Amazingly Excellent, and better than the first.
","I walked out of the cinema, happy with the fact the my high expectations of this film were met. The humour was just as brilliant as the first, and the acting was, as expected, amazingly excellent. I saw this movie as more psychological than the first, as it went into the characters backgrounds with more depth, while we're also shown how the characters had to deal with their own struggles . The only thing I thought could have been added to the movie, was the character 'Pepper', as she was mentioned a few times. Overall, I would definitely suggest that everyone sees this movie, as it provides more than what you would expect from such a big franchise."
"philthegreatone-786-63058","9","10","23","23 April 2015"," really enjoyable
","I really enjoyed this film. I think it is superior to the first avengers film. There is a lot of going on and the action is really fast paced. But there are down moments and some backstory of some the characters which is interesting. There is humour as always and there are some dark moments as well. This will be a huge hit at the box office.I really like Robert Downey Jnr as Tony Stark. Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Scarlett Johanson is so sexy as always. There are some surprise guest stars as well. Joss Whedon is a great director and creator of characters for the screen. I really enjoyed this film<br/><br/>4 stars"
"georgewilliamnoble","4","14","35","23 April 2015"," A Marval i paid to watch this boring cartoon all 142 time warp minutes.
","Warning this review may contain spoilers but then again maybe not. The plot was such a mess who knows what was going on. Silly heroes in silly costumes fight a robot and his huge vast army of lesser robots i think. I fell a sleep several times only to find that nothing much had changed since before. The director was there one or is that a robot job too seemed non existent the acting was appalling the dialogue banal but at least on the odd occasion unintentionally hilarious, the CGI remorseless repetitive and exhaustively moronic the music and sound crushing and on and on and on this pointless dramatic abyss went on and on in dull monotone without any dramatic high point or emotional engagement while the 3D was rubbish. Hollywood churns these monsters out like a Detroit assembly line of old is such numbers that the whole bundle of super hero franchises just seems like a blurr of same old same old. Last summer was a poor one at the box office i believe and all these super hero remote control effects epics will do is to drive more and more punters away in droves from cinemas everywhere, Hollywood needs a new idea and quick or multiplexes will become as redundant as the picture palaces of olden times.I cannot end this review before enjoying once again the odd moment i did enjoy laughing at this film, Thor - I've run out of things to say! quote, me to Thor and was it Captain America - No way we will all make it through, alas alas alas they all did, what a shock! 142 painful minutes and the cinema showed trailers for two further Marval miracles coming soon to separate the undemanding from there dollars."
"Zofh","2","11","26","21 May 2015"," Disappointing
","OK<br/><br/>I bought a 3d TV JUST because I wanted to watch The Avengers at home. I watched it so many times - the bluray became blurry! This was after having watched it three times with different people in the cinema!<br/><br/>Fast forward with pee-holding excitement to Avengers 2: Age of Ultron. How can I summarise this without boring you with a shopping list? Basically: Everything right about the first Avengers - was MISSING in this one. As promised - I'll stop complaining there.<br/><br/>LOVED Paul Bettany though. He was superb as always in whatever he appears in! As was - surprisingly - Elizabeth Olsen (and I thought she'd be terrible - but she was actually excellent. All fragile, deadly, heartfelt, deep, angst-ridden, quiet rage and fear).<br/><br/>Overall? Put the soul back into the next one please. Missing the character development and warmth of a Whedon picture. Oh yeah - and please bring back Loki. Thanks X"
"stargatesam","Null","6","12","24 April 2015"," All hail the new KING! The best comic book movie ever made.
","Yes, the title says it all. All hail the new KING! I'm not saying this to anger any fan of other franchises but I'd have to rate Age of Ultron a true 10/10 masterpiece and THE best comic book movie ever made. Much like the first Avengers, it is as close to a perfect movie as you can get regardless of the genre. In fact, I consider this effort superior to that first film and I didn't think that was even possible. As has been noted before, Superman had generally held the title as most fondly remembered or nostalgic superhero film flaws and all. Spider-Man had generally held the title as most beloved superhero film because of the character and the time it hit. (Yet, those two awful reboot movies are definitely something the character needs to shake off at this point) TDK had held the title as the most rabidly defended superhero movie from its fan base. Iron Man had generally held the title as best all-around origin film. Captain America The Winter Soldier added its own unique flavor and vaulted to the head of most people's ""best sequel"" list. However, I can honestly say that Avengers Age of Ultron tops them all in every single category. It is IMO shear perfection on every level. It's smart, intense, well acted, thrilling, fun and superbly done.<br/><br/>I'm confident that when all is said and done this film will be thought of as the best of all-time."
"bob the moo","Null","7","15","26 September 2015"," Has energy to distract, but little substance to engage
","I am as much to blame as anyone for the rash of superhero films doing the rounds, since I do generally enjoy them as very expensive productions, with high energy, humor, and action. Essentially they are easy to watch and generally entertaining. Looking ahead to future years, more of the standalone films will continue to get sequels, while generally also they all start to overlap and involve each other – in particular in the two-part Infinity Wars coming in about 3 years. On the basis of Age of Ultron though, this is perhaps not too much to get excited about, because the film is not a great deal to get excited about.<br/><br/>In terms of action, it looks great and has lots of movement and special effects to distract and entertain; but this is probably not enough for a film running over two hours long. The plot also holds out a lot with its additional characters and relationships, as well as morality questions about Stark and the Avengers themselves. If any of this was meant to play out to be something interesting, it really doesn't have the space or time to do so, and essentially the new characters are fairly one-dimensional, while the established characters generally get by on the fact that most viewers will have had a whole film or two to get to know them already. As it is the plot doesn't really hold out much of interest, and the very busy film and action sequences do not allow much room for the film to really relax. There are some good lines in here, dramatic and comedic, but mostly the film feels too full to be able to handle doing what it wants.<br/><br/>Those who appreciate the bigger picture of the Marvel Universe probably love all the connections and in-jokes, and small mentions/sightings of familiar characters; however for the casual viewer it doesn't work as well. It remains too expensively big to be a 'bad' film, and I found the energy and action and noise to be a distracting way to pass an evening without having to tax my brain too much, but it is to the detriment of the film that all that energy does not have the substance to really match it."
"jettrocks","5","8","18","11 June 2015"," Too Cheesy
","When I was 12 I watched the first avengers movie and loved it. Now watching the 2nd at 15 it seemed to me like the exact same thing, and the cheesy jokes every few minutes frustrated me. Other than that, great CGI just a dodgy storyline.<br/><br/>I think when making a movie you can get away with a mix of Action and Comedy, but the avengers crosses that line with countless bad jokes. Personally I am a DC Comics fan over marvel. Marvel went too far by putting there main superheroes into a team. Made a lot of money but for me it didn't really work.<br/><br/>The effects were advanced, and seeing this on big screen was a privilege. Good fighting scenes, and some fairly amusing moments. The villain was also too cheesy, taking the dark knight series for example: The Joker and Bane were awesome. We need some crazy villains like them in the avengers, not Loki or some computer (Ultron)."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","8","18","8 June 2015"," The ""usual"" last decade's superhero movie with 1/4 of Billion worth of CGI
","A little bit of everything in this blockbuster, with lots of Superheroes to choose and have fun with.<br/><br/>There are some ""great words"", some ""oneliners"", threats and forgiveness, some romance, some laughs, some...well...some of everything.<br/><br/>But the way I see it there are 2 reasons to watch this. 1) the progression of the story (if you care about it) and 2) the rich and literally expensive CGI. You see despite the fact that you see ""lot's of places"" in modern movies, all this was shot in a..studio.<br/><br/>Overall: The ""usual"" last decade's superhero movie with 1/4 of Billion worth of CGI!"
"coledbarnett","5","8","18","2 June 2015"," a surprising disappointment
","I overall extremely disappointed with the quality of this movie. When I heard that Whedon was working harder to make this a better movie then the first Avengers movie, I became intrigued. When I saw the original trailer, I felt a piercing chill creep down my spine. I will say that I am a huge fan of Marvel and read the comics. It would be simple to pick on nearly any movie produced in the MCU simply due to the fact they veer so far off the comics (in relation to how character origins are portrayed). <br/><br/>Character development was lacking. It is unreasonable to expect them to create a movie full of main protagonists and delve into each of their perspectives individually. A background story can provide a solid plot and create a further understanding of the characters they are seeing on screen. Adding new characters can be beneficial, but focusing on their back story subtracts from the main plot too much. The primary focus should have been on Ultron. While Spader did a brilliant job voicing him, he had no depth. To put it simply, he was boring. I wanted his character to evoke some kind of emotion (happiness,anger, or both), yet I felt nothing.<br/><br/>The one part of the movie I truly found enjoyable was the scene where Iron Man faced Hulk. It had the appropriate amount and type of humor inserted into the script and the action was exciting to watch as well. Then again, This review might be a completely useless rant and waste of time considering I have yet to movie with the footage they cut out."
"skradji","5","8","18","2 June 2015"," More of the same
","Well, first I say that neither I nor detractor follower Los ¨ Vengers, but I've seen both films as mere amateur ¨ Some comics and superhero films in order to spend time entertainment and escape.<br/><br/>The first film, so exalted and deified ¨ can be said for most of the globe I found it an acceptable, entertaining film in perspective but quite cold and leaden in many cases, and superheroes, I confess, are not really saints my devotion, Thor, Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk etc .... I have always been other heroes and adults darker Batman, Spawn or Conan among others ..., so see the Avengers in feel much enthusiasm or feeling by its protagonists.<br/><br/>Analyze this film really is not very difficult as its premise, and development situations is almost identical to its predecessor. The same words, same performances caught by the hair, except to Downey Junior Achiever always a fun and refreshing and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, the rest as I said is correct and left in little more, and Samuel L. Jackson wears me I tired a lot.<br/><br/>Whedon address? Mediocre. I said and say again, this saga, because it will become a saga lose much with this useless manager, that manager has very, very little experience and trade. And it Wheddon is unable to provide true intensity and force the stories, the action scenes or performances, all are equally cold and pain in the ass than the previous, which is worth much fx and such, but again the same, not kill, not impressed, nothing, everything is already past the ending as you stay at first. Nothing memorable or do you plan to open the mouth! Wow that last! , Or joke. Epic failure, real emotion. Whedon does not work, and I hope they deviate to one side, but given the commercial success of both films, I see almost impossible.<br/><br/>The villain Ultron, it sucks. I find it pathetic, ridiculous and uninteresting, and the final battle as it was predictable, a succession of leaps, explosions, falls, blows, pithy phrases and graciosillas and little ... little more.<br/><br/>Certainly they give it a slightly darker tone than before, and in regard to rhythm, this is better off, being less lighter in his diálogos, which is appreciated, and after all entertain, entertaining, but that is the end all, not innovate or offer anything new, the script repeats the above schemes, misses a great epic and emotional level, the direction of Whedon still own a television film, taking away many points to the film, and Fx .. sí I repeat myself, I think I already know what he would say no?<br/><br/>As a sequel that's fine, as movie is better than the first, but we must find a director with real talent, give a more dark and violent film pitch, a script with more guts and not go to the topic and easy, and maybe it can be considered truly an awesome movie to the next installment.<br/><br/>Thank you."
"Nibbler007","5","8","18","18 May 2015"," Amazing action, but no script
","It's quite difficult to review negatively one of my favorite franchises since I saw the first Avengers movie and totally loved it. <br/><br/>But this film is not quite impressive as it seems to be. Joss Whedon had to stick to his plan: in Avengers the first, he managed to balance everything in order. Script was nearly perfect and action scenes were quite impressive but not too overwhelming. You felt (in Avengers first deliver) that it was not another Transformer-ish, Michael Bay-ish, film. <br/><br/>Although darkish than the first one, Age of Ultron lacks of originality, but its worst flaw is the lack of well crafted dialog. Everything is mayhem. Chaotic. Script does not stand alone for its merits. This goes right for an action film, or kind of a B-movie. But we were expecting more. There are at least three or four amazing scenes with superb CGI, and again, Whedon gives every hero its right place, but something is missing comparing the two Avengers movies: script of the first one was flawless, this one is not.<br/><br/>I know it's a high standard with a major casting. So we're expecting the best. And on script terms, the movie does not deliver a bit.<br/><br/>Our villain (Ultron) is weaker -conceptually- than Loki. The man (or machine) is blabbering the whole movie through with unintelligible concepts, and some of the cast members looks too tired to carry on (Samuel L. Jackson, Scarlett Johansson, Robert Downey Jr.) . I have an awkward feeling about this flick. The waiting took too long. Joss Whedon decided to present action before drama, nonsense chaos before logic. So then the results are quite obvious. He was too eagering to create a new Avengers generation when the actual one had not the opportunity to fly high. <br/><br/>Man, this is as cheesy as can be. One-dimensional story.<br/><br/>Our expectations, as fans of the first one, were not at all fulfilled. This looks like another Transformer's movie. <br/><br/>Whatever happened to Thanos (end credits in the first one), I cannot guess. Studios and budgets can spoil everything. I felt they ruined a wonderful saga. Let's hope the next one surpass this second part, totally forgettable.<br/><br/>I mean, it's not a bad movie, but on Avengers standards, this is a bluff.<br/><br/>Cheers!"
"alexblume","6","8","18","16 May 2015"," Very hollow and muddy
","When I saw this film's trailer I was super excited. Ultron looked like he would be the best villain Marvel has ever had. I thought this movie had potential to maybe be the best superhero movie ever, or at least that some people would think so. After reading some reviews my expectations lowered a little bit, but I was still excited for the film. <br/><br/>I can honestly say that walking out of this film, I was surprisingly underwhelmed. I thought this film had a multitude of problems and really felt empty inside. I'll go through my take f each part of the film: <br/><br/>1) Plot: I thought the plot wasn't that great. Ultron looked very threatening in the trailers and looked like a huge threat to the Avengers. There was never a moment in this film where I thought Ultron could beat the Avengers. Every time they come face to face, the Avengers can beat him, and for some reason don't. His motivations, which should be one of the most interesting part of the film, felt very rushed and not examined at all. Even though Ultron's drones are him, which he says at one point in the film, none of them are near as powerful as he is, even in his early states. Scarlet Witch and Vision's powers are never explained, and they end up being like God characters. Also there is a moment where the Avengers hide out at Hawkeye's house after Hulk destroys a city. This is where the movie slows way down. This is where they seem most vulnerable. But Ultron didn't beat them, and by hiding out they allow him to get stronger. They say they can't find him and they must hide because people want to arrest Hulk, but that doesn't mean they all have to hide and not even try to find Ultron. Even if you ignore the plot holes, this is a very basic Plot Line. <br/><br/>2) Acting/Characters: RDJ is great as Iron Man again, Chris Evans is great as Cap, and Chris Hemsworth is great as Thor. Samuel L. Jackson is great again in his smaller role as Nick Fury. I've never liked Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow, but not because of her acting, more because I haven't loved the way she's been written. I'm not a huge fan of Ruffalo's Hulk either, but for the same reasons that I'm not a fan of Black Widow. They have a relationship in this film, and it is so rushed that it never makes much sense. Scarlet Witch and Quiksilver have very annoyingly stereotypical Russian accents. They switch sides in the film after seeing that Ultron wants to destroy humanity, but once again this is rushed and doesn't make that much sense. Overall, the acting is not that bad, but the writing of the characters doesn't make much sense and seems very hollow. <br/><br/>3) Action: The action is awesome in this film. Some of it doesn't make sense. The Avengers are pretty much invincible cartoon characters. Ultron's drones are so weak it's hard to understand how they are a threat. Scarlet Witch's powers are whatever the plot needs them to be, same with Vision's. Scarlet Witch has a power that you think is mind-control, but isn't. It makes the characters either see a fear of theirs, or shows us their origin story, if we haven't seen it. This is never explained how this is a power, as it doesn't seem to help them at all. <br/><br/>4) Music: Very forgettable, the original Avengers theme that is played ion the first is heard maybe twice in this film. Not really that important to the film, but also very forgettable.<br/><br/>5) Cinematography: Lots of CGI but very pretty cinematography nonetheless. <br/><br/>6) Dialogue: Marvel is back with their quick one-liner comedic dialogue, but it is less effective in this film than maybe any other Marvel film. The dialogue was surprisingly bland and very dry. None of it was very memorable. Very disappointing. <br/><br/>There doesn't seem to be any theme, message, or moral in this film. There was a lot of potential for this to be a pretty deep film, like The Dark Knight, but it ended up being a very hollow. One hero does die in this film, as was teased leading up to this film. Marvel has yet to actually kill an actual hero in their canon, which is a big pet peeve for me. However, I am shocked about the death, not because it was surprising who they killed, but it was surprising that they actually expected us to care. Joss Whedon is a very talented writer and director. However, I know he had a lot of struggles and disagreements with the studio on this film, and I feel if he was given complete free-reign, we would have had a better film. <br/><br/>This film feels like the Dead-Man's Chest of the Marvel Universe. You will probably enjoy the film, especially if you're going just to enjoy a superhero action film, but if you're looking for something more original and innovative, this is not the film. It's not bad, it's just not good either. The first Avengers was very good, not necessarily completely original, but a very solid film that stretched the boundaries of a superhero film a little bit. This one stays within it's own boundaries and in my book. <br/><br/>6/10"
"hoxjennifer","7","8","18","11 May 2015"," Close to being mediocre
","Marvel needs to be careful... what with many more sequels and spin- offs lined up, Marvel runs the risk of becoming repetitive and dry (which they mask with CGI stunts and gimmicky action scenes). The first half of Age of Ultron felt like a sequel that was trying too hard. Action scenes were atypical and predictable. The one-liners and scenes where the Avengers are trying to have fun felt so forced. What confused me a lot too was the apparent love story between the Hulk and the Black Widow. When did that happen?? <br/><br/>But by the second half of the movie Age of Ultron redeems itself. The plot develops, we see a lot of discord and conflict among the Avengers themselves and some heart-wrenching scenes amidst an epic floating city action scene. <br/><br/>I have hope yet for Marvel, but they are walking a thin line between amazing sequels and repetitive, recycled material glitzed with an over-spray of ""razzle dazzle"" that tries to hide the danger that they might one day run out of ideas."
"clarkmick33","7","8","18","1 May 2015"," Just what I expect from a Marvel Movie
","There seems to be a lot of people who say this movie was bland - I personally think they were expecting too much from the Marvel format. You should go to a Marvel movie knowing that it will contain the following ingredients:<br/><br/>1. Superheros who kick bad guy butt<br/><br/>2. Bad guys who make no strategic sense in their decisions even given their supposed super intelligence. <br/><br/>3. Lots of cheesy dialogue and jokes.<br/><br/>4. Enemy weapons of mass destruction that seem to take a long time to ""power up"" before destruction. <br/><br/>5. Cameos, tie-ins and links to other movies in the Marvel franchise.<br/><br/>I agree this is a tied formula but its great brain dead entertainment which is fun for the whole family. Action, well timed saves and cheesy jokes all round."
"tmalo-09891","6","8","18","30 April 2015"," Not bad, but not great. Underwhelming.
","Thus is the issue with these kinds of movies. How do you top the last one? This movie seemed like a giant ""meh"" for me. The pacing was strange, the plot was strange, the humour was strange.. A lot of strange. There were many moments that lost me as a viewer, I found myself daydreaming. Not all cons, however. This movie isn't all that bad, really. Its a good entertaining flick that the family will love, with amazing visuals, amazing action sequences and still a decent plot. I just found it to be grossly underwhelming. Not one of Marvel's best, and comparable to Iron Man 2 & 3. It will destroy box office records at first, but I think we will see it quickly trail off. But you know, maybe I'm being too cynical. If you would have told me even 10 years ago we'd have a complete Marvel cinematic universe, including an Avengers 2 by 2015, I would have laughed in your face. So enjoy it while it lasts, regardless."
"Cameron-Smith1996","8","8","18","30 April 2015"," Slightly disappointing in some respects but awesome in others.
","Two things you should know about me before we get started. 1st I love the avengers and 2nd Ultron is my favourite villain period. <br/><br/>That is why I am happy that this film is really fun and feels far more like an avengers film than the first as the first film, which I love by the way, did feel more like an iron man film with other superheroes turning up. This however starts off immediately (with one of the coolest scenes that I have seen in a very long time) telling you that this is an avengers film. The dialogue and chemistry between characters is great, the jokes work well and the action if you hadn't guessed was incredibly and some scenes sent my nerdiness into ultra. With that said however I would have liked if this film spent more time on its own story rather than setting up for future films most notably Infinity wars. Also I could quite clearly tell at some points that this film had been edited down from the original 3&1/2 hr cut to the 2&1/2 hr. Some scenes felt forced in and others felt like they could have offered more. And possibly my greatest gripe about the film is Ultron, not how he is portrayed you understand as James Spader does a stellar job, more so the amount of screen time he got and his introduction. It felt rushed and I had a feeling that important scenes relating to that character where cut out completely. Not to mention that they seemed to Nerf Ultron. It would have been awesome if he single handedly nearly defeated all the avengers (which he has done multiple times in the comics). He just felt like another Loki all talk but when he has an army at his back, but by himself he's not much of a threat, which as an Ultron fan myself disappointed me greatly. However I feel that this has to do with what I said earlier about the film being cut down, and personally I would rather see a 3&1/2hr movie with my favourite villain ever done right than a 2&1/2 one where he was done okish. One final minor annoyance is that quicksilver felt useless as a character and really didn't add anything to the film baring a couple of cool scenes and funny jokes. On the other hand the introduction of Scarlette witch was very welcome and she unlike her brother added a fair amount to the story as well as providing some pretty cool abilities. And speaking of cool the addition of Vision was awesome and done so well, Paul Battany portrayed him perfectly and was hands down one of the best parts of the film. Other parts that the film did well was the character moments especially Brice Banner (Hulk) and Clint Barton (Hawkeye). Hawkeye was really flushed out and the film did a great job of having him really hold the team made up of people with near godlike abilities together. And with Banner, they made him feel more present and relatable in this film than the first though I have to say the romance with black widow was a bit weird and forced. The story itself is more serious and the stakes felt much higher than the first. In summary, it felt rushed at points, I could tell it wasn't the final cut and I was very disappointed in the villain. But it was still an awesome time, with cool characters, incredible action scenes and good character moments. 8/10"

","Avengers Age of Ultron is nothing short of a cinematic masterpiece. It has set a new bar for superhero movies to come and gives us a glimpse into Marvel's ever-growing future. Whedon knows his audience and he delivers every time. Action scenes are masterful and every frame a painting. Every actor knows their role in and out, including Spader who's performance is incredible. And not forgetting how well the jokes blend in. They are executed perfectly and really break up the tone every now and again. This is a sequel done right and proves that The Avengers are the superheroes not to be reckoned with at the box office. This proves Marvel's high streak will last. Love them or hate them, this movie shows that they are capable of anything."
"pcernea-1","2","11","27","5 June 2015"," Halt on Ultron
","Despite the expensive special effects and excellent actors, I believe this one will be remembered as a B-movie in the near future. I was wondering why I heard no one commenting on how awesome the new Avengers movie was, but I decided to see it anyway. I think the only Marvel movies that are worse are X-Men 3 (the one with Phoenix) and maybe the Ang-Lee-directed Hulk.<br/><br/>All superhero stories (in fact, most stories) follow the same basic pattern: the good guys need to stop the villain who wants to destroy the city or the world. What sets them apart is the depth and likability of the characters, the consistency of the plot, the quality of the dialogue.<br/><br/>In the Thor (and Iron Man) movies, you have intelligent heroes with a lot of power, but too much pride and hubris. They get set back because of their arrogance, but they are always compelling and inspire sympathy.<br/><br/>In this turkey, all the heroes are one-dimensional with no defining personality. I felt like the actors were tired of playing the same role (understandable) but they wanted to rake in more millions of dollars (who wouldn't). Even so, the movie could've been saved by a good script, but the dialogue was the worst part. Every sentence was a cliché, every joke a forced, unfunny one- liner. You can't explain this away by blaming it on the fact that it's a Disney movie, because this installment actually has more sexual innuendo than any other.<br/><br/>The one saving grace, though, was the cameo of the actress from Freaks and Geeks. She gave a heartfelt performance, but didn't have good dialogue to work with. Still, for her I raise my rating to a 2. The Olsen sister was fine, but why not hire a Russian actress? Is it so critical to have a famous name that they can't get an authentic Russian accent?<br/><br/>Actually, even worse than the dialogue, the worst part was the villain Ultron. If you think about it, the name is pretty stupid, and subconsciously, I think this kept me from seeing the movie for a while. From the title ""Age of Ultron"" I thought he was going to be a supervillain on par with Apocalypse. I thought he was going to take over the world and have some kind of dystopian world government which the Avengers would infiltrate. Instead, he's this goofy robot that sounds like a badguy from a Western. He's not threatening, just cartoonish, and personally I cringed or laughed every time he came on screen. I feel about him, in many ways, the same way I feel about Nuclear Man from Superman IV.<br/><br/>In fact, there is another parallel with Superman IV. (I'm thinking of the space scene in that movie.) Ultron brings up the floating island in order to crash it down. When it's falling, you see the fire of the atmosphere burning it on reentry. But it was never burning when it was going up! So there's that inconsistency, but also, wouldn't the vacuum of space and the heat of the atmosphere have killed the heroes who weren't wearing suits?<br/><br/>Frankly, I feel this movie insults the intelligence of the audience and demeans the actors. I don't think we're the ones that should be blamed for watching these movies, it's the people who write these scripts. Only from a TV movie might one expect such an illiterate, rushed script. I don't want to dissuade anyone from seeing the movie, but you'll thank me if you see it without paying for it as an MST3K-style comedy."

","(Rating: ☆☆ out of 4)<br/><br/>This film is not recommended.<br/><br/>In brief: This film may be critic-proof, but it is also fun-proof.<br/><br/>GRADE: C<br/><br/>Believe it or not, this is actually the 11th Marvel film about superheroes. Yes, they have taken moviegoers into the comic book cosmos, with varying results, and made their films one of the most profitable series in movie history. Reviews seem pointless as the movie is critic-proof in its popularity. Avengers: Age of Ultron is also fun-proof. <br/><br/>￼Now let me begin my review by admitting to a bias: I am not really enamored by superhero movies. While I do usually find them entertaining and mildly diverting, I do enjoy the CGI artistry involved. I don't follow the historical and mythological angles of these comic book heroes and their mystical powers, nor do I much comprehend their hierarchy in the superhero food chain. Just show me the money in your big budget with your CGI! On that matter, the film does not disappoint.<br/><br/>￼Adequately directed by Joss Whedon, Avengers: Age of Ultron gathers this motley crew of crusaders together once more to rescue the world from annihilation, although our heroes do a pretty good job of destroying many metropolises and injuring countless innocent bystanders in order to save them and mankind. (Perhaps they should try a little less harder next go-round.) <br/><br/>Once more we have Ironman (Robert Downey, Jr.), too snarly and uptight this round, The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) with those expandable briefs and those patented stretchy trousers, Captain America (Chris Evans) with no shirtless scene for the gay crowd to Marvel (shame!), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) looking great in head to toe leather, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) with his non-stop supply of arrows, and Thor with hammer and grimace in tow. Plus some secondary avengers are now added to the mix but just take up more screen time from the primary A-team and contribute little to the film: Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver, aptly named for his speed, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff a.k.a. Scarlet Witch, who has the power of mind control but had very little control of her fluctuating Russian accent, and Paul Betthany as Vision, although I had some trouble understanding his whole superpowers and identity. It's all more of the same clang-bang-shoot-em-up from that old gang of ours. <br/><br/>￼The thin story, also written by Whedon, has Tony Stark a.k.a. Ironman center stage as he uses the elusive Loki specter to create an artificial intelligence, namely Ultron (wonderfully voiced by James Spader), to help him and his cronies battle the ongoing forces of evil. Of course, Tony's ideal robot buddy has other ideas and more destruction and mayhem ensues.<br/><br/>￼The battles are plentiful, six rather long combat scenes by my count, enough to please most young fan-boys and gamers in the audience, or anyone under the age of 10. There's more screen time per battle than there is in dialog or character development, although Whedon does try to give some back-story to some characters and romantic involvement between two of the Avengers (strictly boy/girl stuff). Between the ethical debates about war and peace between Stark and Captain America, or his foe Ultron, the film really has no point of view. It just keeps moving on, with its main purpose to show oodles of badly staged combat that either highlights shaky camera-work that obscures the action and movement of the actors or it relies on slo-mo aerial ballet moments for dramatic effects. The pacing is set at either of those two extremes with little in-between.<br/><br/>￼The film takes itself far too seriously. What made previous outings so popular and effective were the humorous asides and ironic conversations between these misfits, a factor totally missing in this film except for an amusing moment involving Thor's heavy hammer and a plummeting action sequence between Ironman and the Hulk that supplies the film's sparse laughs.<br/><br/>Noisy and clunky, Avengers: Age of Ultron is mindlessly numbing pop entertainment that seemed more desperate to please its audience with its state-of-the art imagery that supply any logic or pleasure to any of its human characters or any moviegoer with an average IQ for that matter.<br/><br/>￼Visit my blog at: www.dearmoviegoer.com<br/><br/>ANY COMMENTS: Please contact me at: jadepietro@rcn.com"
"louis-crabb","6","9","21","26 April 2015"," Amazing Movie
","This movie was absolutely amazing, for me it surpasses the first movie by light years, the story ties everything that has happened so far in the MCU together and sets a path for phase 3 of the films. The story is not as good as that of the comics, almost a complete re-imagining of the way the Avengers finally defeat Ultron. The action scenes are amazing, there is so much co-ordination in them it almost looks like a really cool beat Ultron dance. The end credits scene had me cheering when Thanos reveals his gauntlet and says "" Fine, I'll do it myself"" it sets the stage for an epic MCU finale. The one thing I didn't like, hence the 9 stars, is that they gave no time to establish the Vision's character. In the comics he was first created as a minion to Ultron, by Ultron and while that does happen in the film he is never finished by Ultron and he never does anything bad to the Avengers. But the bit where he passes Thor his hammer really shows you how strong and 'worthy' a character he really is."

","The film was an amazing follow-up to not only The Avengers but all the films in-between, and introduces several new characters so well!

My only downside is that there is only one very short mid-credits scene and no after-credits one. Like I said though, very good!<br/><br/>Of course I won't give even the little things away, this should be experienced with as little fore-knowledge as possible, like most films, but believe me, you will regret it if you know some of the twists in here, they're great to experience in the theatre."

","Film revolves around Extermination of humankind by Automatons and how Avengers saves the world. The plot is little bit disappointing otherwise the movie is nicely woven and takes us onto dreamland full of fantasies and off course to the main theme of saving the world from self created bot. Avengers-age of Ultron also showcased twins genetically developing, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are loosed upon the world. ""He's fast and she's weird"". And the Ultron is the brainchild of Stark, who envisions a global peacekeeping force powered by artificial intelligence. In movie the Black Widow and Hulk fall in love. And yet ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is still a movie worth looking. It's smarter and better. But it's also the second of at least four movies and it plays like it. Sure, it's bigger than the first film, and that one wasn't exactly small. But bigger isn't always better. Sometimes it's just good enough. At last its worth watching."

","Yes, I saw the previous movies, so I know who the Avengers are but I frankly didn't understand a moment of this movie from beginning to end. Good guys are bad guys, bad guys become good guys. They kept introducing new characters and magical technologies straight through the movie. Also, I don't think you are a hero when you solve a problem you created through your own stupidity. Fortunately, despite all the shooting, explosions, fire, radiation and killer robots not one innocent person so much as got a nosebleed. I mean they evacuated an entire flying city? Good work, writers, not a single drop of blood on the Avengers' hands."

","Vision's origin (and Ultron's) is completely screwed up (again, no Hank Pym) and he (and Ultron) are nothing extraordinary. This was the problem as predicted since Iron Man (2008) with JARVIS instead of Jarvis and Iron Man 3 (2013) with JARVIS already being a hero and having a body – multiple bodies – via independent control of the various armors. <br/><br/>Vision's looks such as skin and eyes are also a complete departure from the source material and the actor playing him wasn't interested in the role, only the amount of money an utterly misguided director offered for him to take it, someone who was said to be a ""purist"" regarding the source material, at least as far as Iron Man's chest plate. Apparently that's only for armor, not androids. (I'd have been more okay with something like John Byrne's take than this. I saw where the director quit Twitter; maybe he should stay on Twitter, quit Hollywood and comics.) The best to be hoped for from that is that the actor's disinterest comes across as Vizh's normally stolid personality, but even Vision did talk shows to (re)acquaint himself to the public with his ""Second Debut"" (comics.org/issue/46843); this guy wouldn't. <br/><br/>Scarlet Witch's powers are also completely altered and nothing unique – just ""The Avengers' Jean Grey."" <br/><br/>If you're a fan of either of these pillars of Avengers membership, pass on AoU. If you do go, remember, you _can_ walk out and ask for a refund (a credit/pass for another movie means your attendance/receipt is still counted for ""Ugh-vengers"" and you can't use it for a new release), but you can't un-see it."
"jessegehrig","2","10","25","4 June 2015"," Time to take a two hour nap, or Avengers 2
","Its boring. Joss Whedon is a talented writer and director, but he did a bad job on the first Avengers movie, and with this one he managed to do worse. All the characters are flat, nothing happens inside of the characters's heads, zero thoughts or emotions, its obvious that it's just actors giving a performance. The story is inconsequential, plot points appear without meaning or impact, they have to kill a character off just to create drama. Its a formulaic movie that really only works for 8 to 10 year old kids-- On a side note I find it amusing that most of the fans of this and other superhero movies, have not read the comics and probably never will."
"abouhelier-r","9","9","22","30 April 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron
","When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and it is up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.<br/><br/>Marvel's Avengers Assemble hit theaters in 2012 and it was an instant success. Joss Whedon had delivered everything we wanted: charm, action and heart. The film is ranking now in the three highest grossing film of all time after Titanic and Avatar. Kevin Feige and his associates have built a cinematic empire quite unprecedented in Hollywood history, a genuine solar system. In fact, since the first Avengers movie we've seen Iron Man, Captain America, Thor on their own; now we have the chance to see them interact once more and how their have changed, how their world have changed through those films which is something very unique to Marvel in movie business. Age of Ultron is picking up where last year's Captain America: The Winter Soldier left off. The film actually dives right into the action as the team has already been assembled, we get straight to the things that matter and skip the hour long ""assembling"" part of the first movie. It helps that characters wear these roles as comfortably as second skin. The film benefits also from this much more global scale, compared to its predecessor. We needed new location, as the majority of superhero movies are set in New-York, it became a little cliché and repetitive to see another tall skyline with a fight happening on top. Age of Ultron provides just that. Our heroes visit Europe, Asia and Africa as Ultron goes global in attempt to wipe out mankind. The opening sequence is an incredible piece of action filmmaking, staged as a single shot that shows all Whedon's brilliance.<br/><br/>These characters are the most important thing. This film allows us to a deeper understanding of the characters and to emotionally connect with them in ways we never did before. There are material for humour and conflict as they pair up some characters in unexpected ways. Furthermore Humanity is found in each hero in more intimate and building-characters moment that had distinguished the first Iron Man and Captain America. We knew very little about Black Widow's back story, we heard some interesting hints at her past in The Avengers though. This is a character who's back story would translate very well onto the big screen due to her espionage narrative, plus she's a spy and spy have secrets. She also becomes the ""Hulk whisperer"". The intuitive tenderness with which she deals with the troubled and introspective Dr. Bruce Banner, played greatly again by Mark Ruffalo, is turning into a sweet love affair which gives the tender core of the movie and the most moving scenes. Clint Barton/Hawkeye checks in after spending most of the first movie as a mind controlled puppet. This film defines him as a person and as an Avenger as well, he's not only a cool guy with a bow and arrow. Distance from his usual family drama allows Hemsworth's Thor to shine a little more than last time. Steve Rogers/Captain America is once again a solid reminder of wartime values. While Stark's self doubt journey he took in Iron Man 3 is still evident and his obsession to create a perfect piece to protect the earth is still alive. Robert Downey Jr. is pure gold as Tony Stark and his differences with Captain America provides most of the comic relief, as well as the serious differences in their philosophy is where the real depth can be found. <br/><br/>Check out the end here > http://offscreenreviews.blogspot.fr/2015/04/avengers- age-of-ultron.html"

","I think most of us can agree that the first Avengers movie was awesome, so I was expecting Marvel to knock it out of the park again. Right?<br/><br/>Wrong. So wrong.<br/><br/>The storyline makes it appear as if two conflicting scriptwriters tried to piece their work together. Ultron (the robot) comes across as crazy (which I'm sure was the intention) but not entertaining- crazy, more head-shake crazy. We take an entirely random (and lengthy) detour past Hawkeye's home, where it appears he has a secret family. Big whoop. The occasionally funny scenes (such as where everyone has a go at trying to pick up Thor's hammer) are just overwhelmed by the sheer volume of fail which comprises most of the movie.<br/><br/>Come on Marvel, you've proved in the past that you can do so much better than this."
"Tehmeh","5","6","13","11 October 2015"," 1000 reviews? Here's one more then!
","There's plenty of pressure when making a highly anticipated sequel to one of the most profitable movies of our time, and there most certainly will be studio executives involved in the creative process - which can sometimes be good, but often bad. I'm not sure what happened here. You can see plenty of ""playing it safe"", sticking to the first movie's structure and at the same time trying to be bigger and bolder. You can't do both, and as if that weren't enough, this movie is desperately trying to set up 800 another movies. In the end we got just a serviceable action movie.<br/><br/>I had read about too much being cut out of the film, about its messy construct and out of place and/or too frequent humorous quips, and of course about some ridiculous feminist ""controversies"" regarding Black Widow and director Whedon himself. I'm glad to say that even if the film was needlessly complicated, it's still understandable enough and it didn't feel like there was supposed to be that much more to it. The humor mostly works and Black Widow - contrary to what screaming hysterical people who can't handle a movie might claim - had the best character moments along with Bruce Banner/Hulk, and they seemed the most human and relatable of the whole cast.<br/><br/>The movie itself, if you think about the construct, is very much like the first one. The team gets demoralized, only to team up again and fight thousands of faceless enemies in the end while some sort of McGuffin is around to do something. Short tech-babble and exposition tries to make sense to things in between scenes and acts, just like in the last movie. It feels lazy and forced when you think about it - and it is - but the familiarity wasn't the biggest letdown.<br/><br/>The biggest fault in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is that at times it feels more like a product than a movie. Even if I don't count the awkward moments where they're trying to set up other movies, there's still a disconnection between the movie and me. I want to focus on the show, but I feel like the backstage is making too much noise. The story itself is serviceable but never engaging or focused. It's a simple story that is pretending to be something else. Because of that we can see through it and we're noticing many shortcomings we wouldn't care about otherwise. This film doesn't quite overburden itself to a point where everything stops making sense, but the overall tension is lost. Less is more, studio people. Less is more. <br/><br/>There is plenty of action. Things are getting punched, things are getting destroyed and energy beams fly all over the place. There are some inventive things and neat choreography. Generally it all looks very good, but I wasn't invested. Like I said, this movie failed to connect with me. I see all these grand things happening, and I can't feel anything. It all felt so emotionally weightless. It's not as bad as in Man of Steel, but it's there. <br/><br/>It didn't help the experience when the very first scene in the movie has our heroes fighting faceless enemies we know or care nothing about. It didn't help that the enemy hordes are basically stormtroopers, only to be wiped out easily but unlike stormtroopers, they are completely void of any personality, as they're just faceless things that our heroes need to punch, once again. It didn't help that the main villain has a weird, silly design that makes him absolutely non-threatening (why didn't they go with the original design, which they do use in certain shots in the movie?), and that the events around him are needlessly complicated and forced. It didn't help that the ending of Iron Man 3 means nothing anymore, especially when Marvel is all about this ""big picture"" and continuity. It didn't help that two shoe-horned characters with fake Russian-ish accents feel out of place.<br/><br/>While the pretty action is lacking in weight and/or heart, there are some cool little character moments here and there. Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo get the best ones and they handle their parts very well. The dialogue in general is easily above average. The (little too numerous) quips mostly work, allowing us to feel something. Robert Downey Junior and Jeremy Renner were enjoyable too, but mostly because they're Robert Downey Junior and Jeremy Renner, not because of the material they had. James Spader's voice did fit the main villain, and I liked that they tried to give him this weird personality, but like I said, the main villain is somewhat wasted with silly design, needlessly complicated plot elements around him and hordes of faceless henchmen. Anyway, these character moments are easily the best parts of the whole movie. Imagine that: In an Avengers movie the fights and story elements make me want to sleep, but the conversations and little subtleties manage to keep me awake.<br/><br/>In short: a somewhat decent movie, where the most of the (plentiful and pretty) action and several beats of the story feel like filler. Actors do a pretty good job though, there are smart character moments and unexpected nuances that most movies like this don't have. On a surface level it's entertaining, stuff happens all the time, but it's painfully empty on the inside and nothing like its predecessor. Did Whedon fail to bring his A-game or did the studio force the unbearable stench of cynical corporate mediocrity into this movie? I don't know. Last year was far better for superhero movies, because Winter Soldier and Days of Future Past are leagues above this one. <br/><br/>Let's hope that the next big Marvel superhero movie is ""just"" a movie, not a product or a brand vehicle to set up other brand vehicles. Because ""just"" a movie makes for a better movie than anything else."

","Avengers: Age Of Ultron is an exciting sequel to the 2012 movie even though it doesn't quite live up to the original.<br/><br/>The plot is that Tony Stark and Bruce Banner accidentally create an AI called Ultron. He says that he wants to save the world but his idea of saving means destroying the world so the team has to get together and stop him.<br/><br/>Firstly, this is not a bad movie. I liked it a lot. Each character gets their chance to shine and the action scenes are magnificent. The final battle is epic and entertaining. The movie is computer animated but it didn't bother me at all. Also, a particular character's death scene near the end is unexpected and sad.<br/><br/>But I had a huge issue with the movie's comedy. Marvel sometimes puts one-liners and comedy relief in. Sometimes it works but other times it doesn't. The movie has a lot of one-liners and I found most of them not to be funny. Also, some of them felt really out of place. They would be in battle fighting for their lives and some of them would just be making jokes desensitizing the viewer to any impending fear of death in battle. If the characters seem so relaxed then what suspense is needed to be held by the audience. It feels really out of place.<br/><br/>Also, I had an issue with the script. I don't want to say too much because I want to keep this review spoiler free. But I will say that it feels very rushed and unorganized. There are a few completely unnecessary side plots. There are also some useless characters that could've been removed because they really don't impact the story overall. Also, the villain was a massive letdown in Marvel's growing pile of mishandled super villains.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie has positives. If you like cgi action scenes then you'll enjoy this because the movie handles the special effects nicely. But if you were looking for a deep story which the trailer promised then you'll be massively disappointed."
"porterlily","4","8","19","22 May 2015"," Totally Blasphemous
","The movie overall was okay. Good plot and everything, it's just that whenever the guy (Vision, I think was his name) was asked the question of who he was, and he said ""I am I am"", that set me off guard, because that is one of God's many names. In the story of Moses, God states Himself as ""I am that I am"" and I feel that is extremely blasphemous to the Name of God because it was as if that guy was claiming to be God or putting Himself on God's pedestal. I don't think that was a good move on the producer's side. I mean, the movie was great until that part, it was humorous, dramatic, adventurous, but after that, all I could see was blasphemous. It would have been a lot better without comparing Vision to God, that was wrong."
"kieranclare225","9","8","19","26 April 2015"," ""Clearly you've never made an omelet!""
","Upon returning from a London Imax viewing of AOU, I felt a sense of excitement and nerdy bewilderment that I haven't experienced for a long time, to put it simply, Avengers: Age of Ultron exceeded my expectations and has rightly earned its place among my favourite MCU movies.<br/><br/>Where to begin!? The action and story was spot on, it went above the standards for a traditional superhero movie, and created something totally different. The characters have developed since 2012, as in they shared this great dynamic and felt like a team, this is established from the get go, with what can be only explained as a technological masterpiece of an opening sequence. The opening tracking shot of the Avengers assault on a Hydra base in the middle of a dense snowy forest left me with a locked jaw! And that's coming from a budding Cinematographer.<br/><br/>The acting was splendid as usual, something which you rarely find in a majority of summer blockbusters. The character's presence and performances gave off such gravitas throughout, it felt like they were a functional part of the world they inhabit, nothing wooden or melodramatic, it all had an eerie sense of realism. A true uncut gem in this movie is Ultron itself.<br/><br/>Ultron, played by the hypnotic James Spader, steals the show as the enigmatic, sarcastic 8-feet tall robot. His performance brought something really strange and different to the genre, a true complex villain with understandable motives and fleshed out characteristics. When you leave the cinema, and you miss the villain, you know the Director\Writer did something right. His interactions with the Avengers are often hilarious, as Ultron is portrayed as something of a new born child born in a confusing time. His ways of thinking and his behaviour towards his objectives and his opponents are quite infantile, arrogant, and more often then not, laugh out loud hilarious.<br/><br/>Another great addition was the philosophical, theological Vision. Vision, played excellently by Paul Bettany. His character brings a totally new aspect; I expect him to have some great scenes in the following movies.<br/><br/>Speaking of humour, the funnies throughout were really spot on, maybe a bit too much at times but still really funny none the less. At my screening, there were multiple of times when the audience burst into laughter. It wasn't overly corny or cringworthy, it was quite tongue In cheek and topical humour. Also most of the time, the humour isn't at the expense of the action\drama, or at the expense of story progression.<br/><br/>The soundtrack, having replaced Alan Silvestri with Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler, sounds reminiscent of the original movie, but is a bit more ""epic"", fast paced and orchestral. The end credit piece, or ""Heroes"" is a great remake of the original theme.<br/><br/>Overall great movie, perhaps not as great as Cap 2, or Avengers Assemble, but still highly enjoyable in my opinion. If you are wanting to see an epic superhero with a lot of new element and complex fleshed out narratives and memorable characters\villains, then make AOU your spring blockbuster!"
"chizzlemoviepicks","9","8","19","26 April 2015"," Solid film! But not better that the first one.
","I just got back from the theater. I have been waiting for this for so long. But I have to say that I liked the first one better. I watched the first Avengers film more than 10 times and I love it every single time. But Age of Ultron had too much going on.Don't get me wrong, the film is pretty solid still.It's not like Spider Man 3 or amazing Spider Man 2. I still give it 8/10. It was fun to watch, and totally worth the wait, but I just didn't get that ""amazed feeling"" when I left the theater earlier. It was not consistent in maintaining it high and low moments. <br/><br/>I loved the new additions in this film, I enjoyed watching Scarlet Witch, Vision and Quicksilver. I think Iron Man gets the spotlight once again (I am not an Iron Man fan) which for me is kind of annoying. But I have to admit, I enjoyed watching the Hulk and Hulkbuster fight. It was awesome!!! I kinda wanted to see more Thor and Captain America moments and less Black Widow, Hawkeye and Iron Man moments.<br/><br/>Ultron as a villain is pretty scary but I just didn't like how they killed him off. It was just a ""meh"" moment in the film.<br/><br/>Maybe I need to watch it again and again to get the ""high"" from this film. I don't want to say that I'm disappointed with AoU, but it 20% less than what I expected. Nonetheless, I still recommend you to watch this film, it's a good film, maybe it's just my personal taste. <br/><br/>My top 3 Marvel films still are:<br/><br/>1. The Avengers 2. Captain America: The Winter Soldier 3. Guardians of the Galaxy<br/><br/>Age of Ultron might be top 4."
"jackson-regurge","8","8","19","25 April 2015"," Marvel-ous!
","Where to begin... Age of Ultron is a very good film. The movie was interesting and well acted all the way through. Some of the scenes in the film look so good and feel like they have literally crawled off the pages of the comic books the film was created from. Ultron, the evil protagonist, of the film, certainly stole the stage every time he was on. James Spader's distinctive voice also brought Ultron to life. Whilst watching the film, I kept thinking are there too many characters? But, by the end, I felt like everything fitted together so well and worked very nicely. As for my favourite scenes, I must mention the fantastic Hulk buster vs Hulk scene which was something I have wanted on the big screen since the beginning of the Marvel cinematic universe. Another scene that has to be noted is the final scene which is a truly incredible big screen event. Overall, I give this film an 8/10 because it is really a game changing film. I recommend this movie to comic fans and general movie goers alike. If you want to see an all round good film watch Avengers: Age of Ultron!"
"youknowwhoiam28","8","8","19","24 April 2015"," Awesome movie by Joss Whedon as expected, you must watch it, if you don't you are not an avenger! so go step out of the door and hit the theatre!
","* Review contains spoilers Well well well. I need time to digest all of it. That movie was so fast that quicksilver himself couldn't watch it.! It just started in between a battle and ended in the start of something new ! (Spoilers) May I call it ? The new avengers?! Was it a Avengers Retire movie after Avengers Assemble? And then tony stark builds ultron in a matter of time like its some kind of high school science experiment. I thought the only thing that was supposed to be fast was quicksilver, not the whole movie and the characters and their powers and their supergenious minds so then everything is like a doll house play Y wont it ? It should right? Disney Disney Disney! Disney everywhere! Monsters , beauty and the beast , Cinderella ballet and not to forget the Pinocchio song! This movie was like I was watching ' I ,robot ' with ultron as V.I.K.I and avengers fighting against it. And then ultron is like 'my logic is undeniable' and vision is like ' so you've got to die'. Avengers age of ultron! Awesome job by Joss Whedon again! He should be given a Oscar for making a 2hrs 23 mins film out of a 8hours long script. Hell lot of characters together, still managed to give everyone sufficient screen time , also introducing the plot-line of infinity war, finding everyone's fears,introducing a plot- line for black panther,Natasha Bruce romance, creating an ultron army and then creating an android to stop in a very specific time. Tony you've got 3 mins to create vision . Uh okay done. Here we go! Hello everyone! I am the worthy one(spoilers) Oh I forgot hydra's leader is dead. Again. But cut one head off and two others shall take its place .So duh! This time Barton really proves his place in the team! And officially adds members to the team 'If you step out of that door , you're an avenger'. In the movie there are like 20-25 scenes where you either scream or you are like shitfuc* Cap-Language! Sorry! And then a lot of combo attacks from the avengers and in between we really don't see the twins coming. Then there's the exact same shot as in Avengers-I - Nick Fury on his helicarrier and Maria Hill as second in command. And as expected avengers how can u possibly stop me? Uh! Caps says Together! * Fight * music * fight * music * fight * slow motion * fight * music * And we are done. Relocate the avengers base and let's start again. Phew! Ya that's all there in 143 mins. And there's more. Worth watching at least 5 times in the theatre and then you can buy a blue ray. And marvel I always said I'm with you till the end of the credits! And you failed me this time . All I got in the end was ' Avengers will return' Ya they will , because we'll need them to!"

","The expectations were high. There were no doubts about that. It was about how different they were going to make this from the first one. Especially considering the standards that the previous Captain America and Thor movies had set. Joss Whedon has delivered and how. This is probably the most intense movie of the Avengers series. There are lot of characters and subtle subplots that you can relate to the comic book. They have made it in such a way that comic book fans are not disappointed as some of them were when they were trying to compare the first avengers with the comic series. <br/><br/>Without wasting too much time, The Avengers Age of Ultron gets straight to the point when they try to portray where the movie is leading to. Non comic book fans are introduced to new comic characters like Quicksilver and the Witch. However it is the role of Ultron, as a negative character which brings in a lot to the movie. Unlike the first part, this movie has a more intense antagonist in Ultron and James Spader with his immaculate voice makes sure of that. Also it is advisable to watch Captain America The Winter Soldier to relate to this movie more quickly. The action sequences are very intense, in fact more than half of the movie is filled with action and there is some space for wry humour as well. The Avengers was an unconventional superhero movie at that time by bringing in humour and sarcasm elements with the superhero genre. Age of Ultron is more old school with a lot of hero- villain-revenge-anger confrontations. <br/><br/>This time, there is more significance given to the 'science bros' chemistry between RDJ and Mark Ruffalo and it seems cool. Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans quite easily continue to do their part. Scarlett Johansson is more sexy as Natasha Romanoff this time and Jeremy Renner has a meatier role. Elizabeth Olsen excels in some intensive scenes and Aaron Taylor Johnson does a good Russian accent. But Paul Bettany as Jarvis and a cold faced Vision is the standout.<br/><br/>Unlike the first part this movie needs more brains and get ready for an intensive Avenger ride."
"marcusmunkers","9","8","19","23 April 2015"," Very entertaining
","WARNING SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>I had very high expectations for this movie. First of all the action in this movie is the way better than the first one, but i felt like the movie itself wasn't as good as the first. It is hard to explain but i just didn't feel the same. Maybe i need to watch the movie a couple of times. It also tried to set up a lot of future marvel movies which i had expected but they did not focus on the civil war development, and i feel that it will be hard to do all of civil war in one movie so they could have started the tension in Age of Ultron. What also felt shorthanded was how they defeated Ultron. There wasn't a ""boss fight"" it was just a bunch of robots against the avenger, and hulk punched Ultron a couple of times and that was about it. The ending was good, the hulk went away(still have no idea where he went) Thor returned to Asgard and Tony needed some time away from the avengers. Which is why i loved the ending so much, because now the new avengers can get their moment to shine. Overall i was satisfied but also a little bit let down by small things."
"MattyAndAnnika","3","7","16","7 July 2015"," iron man meets the expendables
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is quite possibly the worst edition to the Marvel film releases. Let me point out something before I get started. I love the Iron Man films, and of course most of the Marvel related films; no I'm not a fan-boy or part of the club for this genre. Sad to say I was extremely excited about watching this release but it seems as though the script writers went entirely the wrong way with it.<br/><br/>My first response after starting the film was ""Did Sylvester Stallone have anything to do with this""? Reason for that thought was it reminded me of The Expendables which is Officially the worst movie to hit the screens, yet this film follows it's footsteps. This movie was nothing but one liners out of almost everyone in the movie, way too much and completely overboard in some areas. The acting for the most part was fair but it did seem as though the actors were having difficulties dealing with the short end of the stick of the scripts too. Avengers: Age of Ultron was a complete let down to follow up on the Avenger films, and my expectations for any extension after this one have lost interest.<br/><br/>It seems as they put more money into the marketing and super hype promotion than getting some real script writers to put things in check. If you're a fan of of the Avengers films or the Marvel related films before this one, you're in for a sad let down when you see this."
"Dfilono","4","7","16","21 May 2015"," They Couldn't Do It Twice
","First of all, the first Avengers is great. It is a well written, clever, and well acted movie. It's action scenes are great, it features a god villain, and above all else, it puts many major superheroes into one movie. That was the draw. Seeing all your favorite heroes on screen is what matters. That effect couldn't be replicated. Age of Ultron is not a bad movie by any means, but it also doesn't add anything new. The CGI fight scenes are still good, the heroes still work well together, the comedy is (somewhat) spot on, and the villain is still well written. Ultron simply relies too much on the wow factor that brought its predecessor so much success. The comedy is also up fro debate. It seems unnatural in this movie, almost forced. The characters are sarcastic and witty, but this movie was filled with comedic moments, almost too much so. The jokes fall very flat when the audience is being beaten over the head with them. The finale is also, well, not exciting. If an editor placed the finale of the first Avengers films and this one side by side, there is very little difference. The over the top CGI cluster that is the finale just doesn't seem as exciting after seeing an almost copy paste from the original. Avenger Age of Ultron is a good movie, its a fun movie, but it doesn't bring anything new to the table. Had the film actually brought something new, like a darker plot, or a more interesting plot, or... anything really, the movie would have been great. Unless Marvel stops dumbing down their films, they are going to hit a wall. They need to learn that their most successful films are the ones that are different (ie Guardians of the Galaxy and Captain America: Winter Soldier). If they don't learn this lesson, future films will be just as OK as Age of Ultron, and that is a scary thought."
"amitkurup","5","7","16","21 May 2015"," Not good, Not Bad
","Better to go without any expectations and you might end up liking it.<br/><br/>For me this was a sequel to quite a wonderful movie called AVENGERS. the first part was quite a revelation as this was the first time I was seeing all the super heroes coming together and sharing screen. I am not a big fan of all the super hero movies but it is quite cool to see IRON MAN talking to THOR or HULK talking to Captain America.<br/><br/>But this movie was not great. It has some storyline of something getting stolen and something affecting the world .. blah blah.. as if we have not heard of it before. Although story was expected to be BAD, the acting and the play time disappoints more. How is it that the only entertainer in this movie is IRON MAN. Comon, we need more ... there are so many of them at least someone will have something better to say.<br/><br/>Grossly under utilized mark buffalo just seems to carry the burden of HULK and SULKs all the way till the end. the best thing about the first part was HULK and in this the worst thing is HULK. the black widow ( scarlet ) has been given enough time in this movie to actually suggest that this could have been a chick flick ( no offense ). She is hot but well I dint go to actually look at her and think oh god she is hot. But if I am thinking that then AVENGERs failed for me. the others are all inconsequential and really don't have much to do. There is so much introspection that the super heroes do in this movie that it is hard to imagine that these are actually super heroes who are not supposed to be behaving like commoners.<br/><br/>the only plus is the voice of the villain. the sarcasm in his voice takes the cake.<br/><br/>Sincere advice to the next AVENGERS director, GET HULK BACK."

While the team assembled fires on all cylinders - Downey's snark, Hemsworth's powerhouse Thor, Evans' square to be hip Cap'n America - check check check - the film falters in its being quagmired in sentiment between Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff and Clint Barton's familial wares totally wears down the come-on-already-we-get-now-get-to-the-collective-ass-kicking-already! Filmmaker Joss Whedon returns - reportedly for the final time - and while his smart screenplay runs as best as anticipated for rock 'em-sock'em and slash/burn comedy it runs on its last act with just enough oomph for a possible re-entry for the franchise.

"jctundis","5","7","16","5 May 2015"," The Golden Age of Marvel movies is OVER
","This is a perfect example of how success can ruin a franchise. So much money is changing hands now that the Marvel movies are quickly descending into the pattern of dumbing down - attempting to satisfy the masses, resulting in inferior product.<br/><br/>While still somewhat enjoyable, the movie suffers from MANY flaws, and not all are the fault of Marvel/Disney - some are to be laid at the feet of Joss Whedon, justifying my initial fears of having the tween darling master of the Buffy-verse in charge of these films.<br/><br/>Specifically, the love stories Whedon fought so hard to include are stultifying and sleep-inducing - or just downright Lucas-level stupid. The dream sequences he championed are also all but useless time-killers.<br/><br/>The movie is loaded with SO MANY one-liners, it's impossible to take anything seriously, and the jokes become tiresome. Ultron is less a world threat, and more a sardonic stand up comedian. Everyone seems to want a piece of the popularizing Stark humor (even though a Stark spoken rape joke backfired horribly with feminist audience members).<br/><br/>There are some excellent action sequences, while at the same time there are several overdone CGI scenes that are almost unwatchable, much like a Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>The addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch do absolutely nothing for the movie. Both actors give incredibly boring performances, and the power set of Scarlet Witch is unrecognizable in comparison to her comic book counterpart. Baron Von Strucker is also rendered completely useless after quite a bit of build up in previous films and TV.<br/><br/>The character of Black Widow is basically reduced to a whore (for the Red Room, for Nick Fury, whatever).<br/><br/>The brightest spot in the whole film is The Vision. They achieved something special with the creation and execution of that character.<br/><br/>Again, it wasn't entirely unenjoyable. I love these characters and am amazed to living in a time when I get to see them on the big screen, but with all these glaring flaws, I can only give it a 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>I am now very leery of all Marvel films going forward, and expect nothing more than a ""joke-explosion-joke-explosion-joke-lame love story- joke-explosion"" formula to dominate all future projects."
"theincrediblehong","6","7","16","4 May 2015"," Follows in Man of Steel's footsteps
","Fairly disappointed in this film. So many unanswered questions from previous Avengers films...<br/><br/>1. How is Thor on Earth when Loki is now ruling Asgard?<br/><br/>2. Why would Thanos knowingly give up an Infinity Stone in Avengers 1?<br/><br/>3. Didn't Tony Stark retire as Iron Man?<br/><br/>The first film succeeded, partially, because it didn't take itself too seriously and found the right balance. This second act seemed to go out of its way to insult itself. The scene where Hawkeye describes how ridiculous it is that he fights with a bow and arrow to Scarlett Witch is a good example of this.<br/><br/>What bothered me the most though might've been the decision to give Ultron a sense of humor. Ultron isn't a human psychopath like the Joker. So giving Ulton a personality didn't really make sense to me and really screwed up the tension that should've existed between the Avengers and Ultron. It seemed like the success of Guardians of the Galaxy may have added pressure to infuse more laughs into Age of Ultron than was necessary.<br/><br/>Bottom line: This was just an average action film that fails to distinguish itself. It falls more in line with Man of Steel, complete with excessively long and exhausting action sequences, than the upper tier comic book films such as Avengers 1, Dark Knight, Guardians, etc."
"Justin-r-bates","7","7","16","3 May 2015"," Uniquely Entertaining - Marvel at its Best
","Avengers: Age of Ultron made its domestic debut this week and, without getting into any spoiler territory, I'll give you my first impressions. In short, darker and more serious than the first Avengers but it's still packed with plenty of humor, action and character development. I would call it uniquely entertaining because it is a different kind of film than its predecessor, but is no less entertaining. Synopsis<br/><br/>In Age of Ultron, Tony Stark's effort to 'put a suit of armor around the world' by combining artificial intelligence with his armor technology goes awry. Enter Ultron, a robot with more personality than you'd expect from a robot and a chaotic plan to bring 'peace' to the globe. The film is rated PG-13 for intense sequences of sci-fi action, violence and destruction, and for some suggestive comments. Firing on All Cylinders<br/><br/>This film finds the Avengers finally hitting their stride together, rather than hitting each other, and doesn't have to spend any time 'assembling' the team, as was necessary in the first film. The obvious benefit is this leaves more time for actual Avenging, character development and introduction of new characters. While the first 25-35% of the film was less engaging for me, since the characters' chemistry and jokes were coming off a bit flat, the film started hitting its stride about a third of the way through and then was firing on all cylinders from that point on. <br/><br/>Probably my favorite part of this film was how the characters were handled. There was significant effort put into developing each main characters' personality, motivations and fears such that I felt more invested in both the characters and the outcome of the film. The end of the world sure means a whole lot more when you care about the people in it. <br/><br/>I can honestly say that I think I laughed out loud at this film more than almost any other film that I've ever seen. Joss Whedon, the film's director, did a great job incorporating the actors' natural chemistry together into the characters' relationships. While the Avengers definitely still have their differences, their witty dialogue, quirky mannerisms and humorous facial expressions are incredibly entertaining and serve as welcome breaks during tense situations. This all-star cast seems like a fun group of people to hang out with, in or out of character. What Didn't Quite Work<br/><br/>Since this film was obviously created for 3D viewing and it has extensive CGI (including the main villain, who is entirely computer generated), some of the preliminary action sequences and scenes with Ultron took me out of the film a bit. By this I mean that they probably would have looked awesome in 3D, but because I was seeing the film in 2D, the occasional slow-motion action with something flying toward the screen just felt kind of weird. <br/><br/>It also seemed like there were several moments toward the beginning of the film where I could tell they were acting against a green-screen, as if they hadn't completely finished touching up the composite work. These are only minor complaints though, as you can tell, and the average moviegoer will probably not pick up on them. <br/><br/>Rating: 8/10<br/><br/>While my ratings are subject to change within a star or two pending subsequent viewings, I am giving Age of Ultron an 8 out of 10. Please don't confuse 8/10 with 80% (B-); 8/10 means that, overall, I REALLY LIKED IT!! To put it in context, here are some of my other ratings in recent years: The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers: 10/10 (the only film to ever achieve that recognition) The Avengers: 9/10 Inception: 9/10 Captain America: The Winter Soldier: 8/10 Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl: 8/10 Princess Mononoke: 8/10 Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol: 8/10 I'm not one of those who gives a 10/10 just because I liked something. Really, anything a 5 or higher means that I liked it more than I disliked it, so getting to the 7, 8, or 9 territory means that we are talking about a quality, entertaining film - at least in my book. So go check it out - I know that I'm going back to see it in IMAX next week!! Can't wait! Thanks for reading!"
"Sandra3885","7","7","16","3 May 2015"," Feels like the Star Wars Prequel all over again
","There's a lot of great things in Age of Ultron, James Spader shines in his role as Ultron. He's charismatic, snarky, has that dangerous feeling that you should run for the hills. Elizabeth Olsen has a great range in portraying the Scarlet Witch. The Iron Man vs. the Hulk fight shown in the trailer really delivers. Paul Bettany is great as Vision.<br/><br/>Now the downside:<br/><br/>Ignores several movies in the Marvel cinematic universe entirely ie. Iron Man 3 with Tony destroying the Iron Man suits for Pepper, and Betty Ross for Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>The whole Bruce/Natasha romance was really forced and contrived. This is like the whole Anakin/Padme thing all over again in Star Wars Attack of the Clones. Both of them lacked chemistry. Steve had more chemistry with a log he splits with his bare hands than those two. In the first Avengers movie, the Hulk chases her and she's utterly frightened. In this movie she's all too willing to try to hop in the sack with him. Just dropped in the middle of nowhere. Maybe it was an off-screen thing but it sure didn't show in here. Every time the two have a ""romantic"" scene, I taste vomit. And her back-story missed the mark. Stating her forced sterilization makes her a monster like Bruce. <br/><br/>Clint's hidden family with an uber-understanding wife. It falls really flat in this movie. She's OK with him going off to far away lands for weeks or months on end nearly getting killed on a daily basis and killing many people. My guess is that she's hoping for that fat life insurance check once he kicks the bucket. <br/><br/>Clint's ""peptalk"" to Wanda. If that was a peptalk, I do not want to hear him giving an eulogy.<br/><br/>The whole saving civilians took about oh, 10-15 minutes. Really don't need to see the avengers to save every single person on screen.<br/><br/>If you want action, it has plenty of it. Though you might want to fast-forward the parts where Natasha and Bruce are in the same room together or take a bathroom break."
"phiup","4","7","16","1 May 2015"," underwhelming
","So i think part of what makes a super hero movie great is the dichotomy between your hero(es) and your villain(s).<br/><br/>I felt like the threat of an Ultron being virtually any and everywhere would create an inescapable feeling. Instead Ultron was more like Link from Zelda. Other than his infinite re-spawn capability this villain didn't scare me.<br/><br/>Now Scarlet witch on the other hand singlehandedly kept the avengers at bay. Where is a bigger more exploitative use of her evil side...that may have made for a better bad guy than Ultron.<br/><br/>To summarize, I never felt like our heroes were in mortal danger. The most difficult thing the Avengers had to face is evacuating civilians. Which for the record took about 25% of the movie."

","Let me start off by saying that the sequel was better than the original in terms of acting, the dark vibe and also action but what started to be a great movie didn't on that note. There was no enough build up for the new characters like The Scarlet Witch and The Quicksilver but Vision was done whose character I connected the most with.<br/><br/>Hawkeye had his own spotlight this time but it was little overwhelming and Hulk's was underwhelming. Paul Bettany as The Vision gave the best performance of all the cast though it was a small appearance it was worth watching.<br/><br/>Coming to the story, as I said in the summary, it was a well stitched movie which lost it's thread at the end. At first the story came strong but it becomes very predictable in middle and the third act had a better action sequence compared to the original but at the same time it loses story-wise. The movie keeps on getting darker and jokes being thrown around everywhere which were completely unnecessary and didn't help to keep up the dark vibe of the movie.<br/><br/>Better Special Effects than the original yes, better music no, the music was a complete disappointment and I know i can't expect that from a superhero movie (with the exception of The Dark Knight trilogy) its predecessor had much better music. The director's execution was good he gave some pretty interesting camera angles which added beauty to the movie. If only the story was held together it would have been one hell of a Superhero movie.<br/><br/>Overall it was a fun summer movie with all the action one can ask for and if you are a comic book movie fan then this one movie is for you."
"sindoo-bathala","6","7","16","24 April 2015"," Just saw * AGE OF ULTRON *
","And it's surprisingly bad. Whedon said that his time on this movie was a nightmare, and that by the time he finished he was exhausted to death, and I think it translated to screen. It's just tiring, tedious, well, not mess, because in typical Marvel production fashion - nothing goes really awry and all gears are in place, it's just tiring, tedious SOMETHING.<br/><br/>It's as generic as its soundtrack, the stakes are high, but there is no tension, none. It's strikingly similar to Man of Steel - lots of exhausting action and destruction, but the content, the drama is missing. If anyone dies, you hardly care, because so many died and have returned before in this universe. It's action without consequence.<br/><br/>Too many characters (and arcs of those we know are contrived or repetitive), too many action scenes going on at once, and action itself is hard to follow. Minutely choreographed, yes, but so goddamn fast that it becomes confusing. I've enjoyed many of Daredevil fights more than I've enjoyed this entire movie.<br/><br/>It has no rhythm and you know those wonderful action crescendos when the scene climaxes in something awe-inspiring? Like the ""I'm always angry"" moment from the first one? None of that here. Dull, non-stop, never-ending fighting. Its brownish and gold palette is ugly, and your eye gets tired pretty fast.<br/><br/>Some really (and I mean, really) iconic moments from the comic books are wasted here by slack editing and direction. What bothers me more than anything is that it's supposed to be an event movie - because we see them all team up so rarely, something that will really shake things up, but feels like ""villain of the week"" type of thing. You really could just skip this one and go straight to Civil or Infinity War and still you wouldn't miss much.<br/><br/>It's fitting that the last movie Whedon directed was called ""Much Ado About Nothing"". Should have been a subtitle of this one.<br/><br/>P.S. Also it's weirdly sexist. Does Black Widow really need to show off her cleavage during the fight for the faith of humanity? Why does Black Widow flirt with every member of the Avengers depending on the movie? Doesn't Whedon claim to be a feminist? I guess it's easy to root for Felicia Day and Anita Sarkeesian in Twitter, but when the time comes, you just HAVE to show some Russian side boob. Otherwise, why include Black Widow in the movie at all? P.P.S. Every ""vision""/""flashback"" was unintentionally funny. It was just ludicrous.<br/><br/>(edit) Maybe I painted a picture too grim here. Obviously it's not the worst movie in the world and it has its moments. But I didn't like it and that is just my opinion to which I am entitled. This post was meant as a warning to temper expectations."
"chowders87","7","7","16","23 April 2015"," Good but not GREAT!
","Right, I may get some abuse for this as it seems people loved the film but probably more because they are fans rather than having an impartial head on. <br/><br/>I liked the 1st Avengers film and was expecting a lot from this one. I went to the midnight showing on the opening day hoping for great things... unfortunately, this film was not worth me staying up to watch. Don't get me wrong, I liked it but did it live up to expectations... NO. <br/><br/>I just felt that the storyline was too rushed, especially on how Ultron was created. Also there are instances where there was too much soul searching by the characters. The storyline was such a clichÃ© and is an adaptation of other earlier movies (irobot) to mention one. There were no twists or turns. I felt like they were trying to do too much. <br/><br/>I did, however, like the good humor the characters have and the special effects. I do have to say, as Marvel goes, Guardians of the Galaxy was MUCH better."
"purplehewitt-59518","3","3","5","8 May 2019"," A Major Disappointment
","I'd like to preface this review by saying I am a really big Marvel fan. I have been for a long time, ever since the first Avengers movie came out. So when I say that this movie was a real disappointment, I'm saying that as a fan, not a movie critic.<br/><br/>The concept of this movie is a good one. Tony Stark tries to create an AI to protect the world from alien threats, but the AI goes rogue and tries to destroy humanity. But that's really all I can say is good about this movie. The concepts. The concept for Ultron is a good one. The concept for the Vision is a good one. The concept for the Battle of Sokovia is a good one. But this movie is more than a concept. And I have to judge it that way.<br/><br/>The execution of these concepts is incredibly poor. What are written as serious issues are played off as jokes and gags. The big problem with this movie is that they don't take themselves seriously, yet still expect us to care. Ultron's plan is to destroy all of humanity and create a better world inhabited only by machines. They build him up as this intimidating character that should be feared. His first appearance is actually one of the best scenes in the whole movie. It's intimidating, eerie, and leaves you uncertain on what the Avengers are going to do to stop him. However, all his other appearances are played off for laughs. Ultron acts more like a human than a heartless machine. Bad puns and unfunny one-liners completely undo what they built up this character to be, and as a result he is no longer interesting.<br/><br/>Now I'll admit that I'm not a comic book fan. The only things I know about these characters come from the movies they've appeared in. I don't know if Ultron is the same way in the comics as he is in this movie. Nor do I care. I don't care if he's like this in the comics because this movie isn't a comic. It's a movie. If this movie doesn't give me good reasons to care about this character, then I'm not gonna care what he's like in the comics.<br/><br/>Another thing that this movie does not execute well is the action. Like I said before, I really like the concept for the Battle of Sokovia. I really like Ultron's plan on paper. Unfortunately, it's a mess on the big screen. The special effects and choreography are fine, but the enemies they're fighting mean nothing in the grand scheme of things. As a result the action seems anticlimactic and futile. You don't care about what they're fighting because not only are they all the same, but they're nothing but machines. Pawns. Cannon fodder for the Avengers to beat up, blow up, shoot at, and utterly destroy without any moral consequences. I'm not saying you should be emotionally attached to every goon in these sorts of action movies, but the problem with making them machines is that they don't have souls. When a character kills a living enemy, whether human, alien, or even animal, it has weight because, like us, it was a living creature. They may have had lives, families, futures, you name it. No matter who they are, whether common thieves or terrorists, they are still human, and killing a living thing will always carry more weight than killing waves upon waves of robots. It's just not the same.<br/><br/>On top of that, there are SO MANY OF THEM. They kill one and it gets instantly replaced, and as a result it not only seems never ending, but after a while it gets stale and boring. That's the best way I can describe the action in this move: boring. I don't care about Ultron, I don't care about his robot goons, and I don't care about his plan. I wanted to, but these things are so poorly executed that I can't. I care about these characters, but I don't feel any tension because I know that they're not gonna die in this movie. Yes, I know Quicksilver dies. But not only do I know nothing about him other than he runs fast and has a tragic backstory, but the acting is so bland that I can't even pretend to care about him. When I think of this character I can't help but think of the Quicksilver I know from the X-Men movies and how much more interesting he is. His action scenes are entertaining, especially in Days of Future Past. I care about that character. But this Quicksilver gives me absolutely no reason to care about him. And so I don't.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is one disappointment after the other. Everything about this movie had potential. The story, the characters, everything. It all looked good on paper. But what we were given was a poorly executed, poorly acted, poorly planned movie that didn't know where to go with any of those ideas. I'm not gonna stop you from watching or even enjoying this movie. If you get enjoyment out of it then I'm happy for you. You got what you wanted out of it and I didn't. And that's fine. Maybe it just wasn't for me. But this is my opinion. This is why I didn't like this movie. I wrote this review because I want Marvel to do better. And since this movie came out they have done better. MUCH better. I want them to succeed. Because, as I said, I am a big Marvel fan. And all I want is for Marvel to do these characters and these stories justice.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading."
"thebricks","3","3","5","3 March 2018"," Unnecessarily pretentious for a mindless blockbuster
","The script was a major dog in this movie. Upon rewatching the film, it's clear these are different characters, not the same ones in the first. There's too much babble in this movie about topics only drugged out college kids and professors would discuss, not real people. It gets absolutely ridiculous after a while. Also, Marvel is hurting their movies having the superheroes be worried about every single innocent person. These heroes would be thanked in real life for their service, not chastised and condemned. Civilians condemn the Avengers for the lives of a few people dying in spite of the fact the villains were either trying to take over the entire world and kill a lot more or outright destroy it completely. It's ridiculous. The humans have no ability to control these superheroes either; they are Gods. They would answer to them, not the other way around. Like most babble from college types, it's just not grounded in reality, but more the result of ultra-privileged, sheltered lives and a lack of a willingness to understand how the average person operates.<br/><br/>The CGI model of Ultron was incredibly bad and made it hard to take him seriously. It was cartoonish, a total hack job. There's a reason they largely kept him out of the trailers. Not sure who was responsible for that, corporate hacks or whatever, but it really hurt the film."

","The Avengers are back! Hooray! And naturally with a $316M budget, we could come up with nothing less than this disaster. <br/><br/>So, the plot is this simple: One of the Avengers create something that (of course) they thought would be used for good. But then (shocking) it turns out that the creation is pulling an ""I, Robot"" or ""The Day the Earth Stood Still"" and believes humans pretty much aren't capable of taking care of themselves or Earth. Now the Avengers must stop something that they themselves created (irony!)...with the help of two new friends who at first were helping the creation but then realized ""oh he wants to destroy humans"" so they switched sides mid-movie.<br/><br/>I guess you get to see Robert Downey Jr. play himself so there is that since he does that so well. You also get to see Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson try to fake their way through an Eastern European accent--and fail miserably. The rest just kind of hang out, nothing spectacular acting-wise. <br/><br/>There you have it! Another extremely expensive knock-off of movies past. Completely uninspired and not creative. Don't waste your time (or money, if you can't get it for free). The horrible one-liners are predictable just like the plot.<br/><br/>Go, Hollywood!"

","I remember seeing the first Avengers in theaters three years ago at a midnight screening and I was utterly impressed. That was definitely one of the best films I saw that year. Today, I hit the theaters to see The Avengers: Age of Ultron, and I was pretty ecstatic. While the first one was just a slight bit better, this one was quite entertaining. I enjoyed the characters, I enjoyed the story, and the action scenes were just awesome. Probably one of the best films I have seen this year.....so far<br/><br/>Our favorite superheros: Iron Man, Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Hawkeye, and Black Widow return, along with newcomers, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, in an epic fight to save the world. When Iron Man builds a peacekeeping program that goes terribly wrong, the avengers must fend off against the evil villain it becomes, Ultron. The action sequences were great, especially the intense battle at the end. The story was pretty good as well, thought not quite as good as the story in the first one. I do, however, love how the story takes a darker turn over from the first story. I thought I was pretty interesting. On the other hand, I was a little more entertained by Loki from the first film than Ultron in this one. I found Loki to better villain. Overall, I had a great time watching this, I was not disappointed by this. It was highly entertaining and , at times, very funny. I love how the characters throw out their hilarious one-liners here and there. This is a movie that everyone should go see!!"
"Zeta-One","9","9","23","6 May 2015"," The Avengers Return
","For your information, this review includes spoilers, and may reveal plot points and other scenes.<br/><br/>Now let's get to the point. This movie was pretty good, with amazing action, effects, and acting. There were a few minor flaws(which movie doesn't?), but overall, the movie was great.<br/><br/>Let's start with the minor flaws. First off, Quicksilver and his twin sister, Scarlet Witch, appear on ""Team Ultron"". However, his character wasn't developed well, at least not yet.Therefore, when he died, there wasn't that much emotion, besides a""quick"" sadness and sympathy for him and especially for his sister.<br/><br/>Next, out of the blue, Hawkeye shows up with a wife and kids. There is no explanation whatsoever, and apparently no one knew this. In the previous movie, people (including me) thought Hawkeye and Widow might have something to do with each other, but according to this movie, that was never the case.<br/><br/>Captain America: ""Sorry for barging in on you (Hawkeye's family)."" Iron Man: ""Yeah, we would have called ahead, but we were busy having no idea you existed."" <br/><br/>On a similar note, Black Widow suddenly has a ""thing"" with Bruce. She even considers running away with him, away from the fight, away from Ultron. This is completely out of character. In the first Avengers movie, she even stated this: ""Love is for children"". So why, all of sudden, she is willing to run away for love? <br/><br/>Now to the good things about this movie: <br/><br/>Action- Brilliant. There was amazing fight scenes,from the beginning to the end. The effects were epic, and made the scenes look realistic. From Scarlet Witch's power to the Hulkbuster armor and the fight against the Hulk, the action was amazing.<br/><br/>Character Development- As I said before, the twins and Hawkeye's character wasn't developed that well. Besides that, the characters in this film were pretty well developed, and had new and epic suits. I liked Cap's new suit the most, as it was a nice mix of color.<br/><br/>Voice Acting- All the characters did pretty well. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson did brilliant accents, and James Spader was amazing on his voice acting for Ultron. It was dark, yet humorous.<br/><br/>Acting- All the actors/actresses did pretty well in each of their roles. I especially liked it when Thor/Chris Hemsworth's expression changed when Captain America/Chris Evans managed to make his hammer budge.<br/><br/>Mid-Credits Scene- This was probably one of the best scenes of them all. You get a glimpse at Thanos, inferring that he would appear in the next Avengers movie.<br/><br/>The final scene before the credits was also very intriguing. Cap and Widow apparently have to work with a new Avengers team, which consists of Vision, Falcon, War-Machine, and Scarlet Witch. This could be interesting, and I look forward to seeing them work as a team.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie was amazing. Although it had its own flaws, the movie was definitely worth the money. If you are wondering whether to watch this movie or not, the answer is easy. If you want to see an action-packed movie with the Avengers facing Ultron, go ahead and watch the movie. You wouldn't be disappointed, especially if you are a fan of action movies and MARVEL."

When Tony Stark convinces Bruce a banner to help him kick start an unfinished peace keeping programme called Ultron all kind a of hell is released and it's up to our favourite team of superheroes to restored order to the world. These films are some of the best kind of escapism you can imagine, it's all totally unbelievable but so terribly exciting to watch. Someone once asked me which was my favourite Avenger and I thought about that as I was watching tonight and I've come to the conclusion that's a question that should never be asked. Although the actors are looking somewhat older these days I am convinced there are another couple of Avenger films In all of them, after all Han Solo is about to return in Star Wars. I reckon this film is worth another watch, shame I missed it in 3D."

","'AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Sequel to the 2012 blockbuster superhero flick 'THE AVENGERS'; and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Joss Whedon returned to write and direct this installment (as he did the first) and most of the cast reprises their roles; including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany and Cobie Smulders. Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Idris Elba, Hayley Atwell and others also reprise their parts from other Marvel films; while James Spader, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and Linda Cardellini join the cast. This time around the mighty superhero team must battle an artificial intelligence unit, created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, that's bent on revenge; against all of humanity. I found the film to be entertaining, and it's sure to satisfy most comic book fans, but it's definitely a mixed bag. <br/><br/>The story revolves around an A.I. named Ultron (Spader), who comes to life as part of Tony Stark's (Downey Jr.) defense program. Ultron is bent on destroying humanity, instead of protecting it, and enlists the help of two genetically altered twins (Taylor-Johnson and Olsen). He also builds an army of deadly robots, to serve as his army. It's up to the Avengers to stop Ultron and once again save the world.<br/><br/>The movie is all over the place; there's a lot of characters and most of them are pretty underdeveloped. We do get to learn more about Hawkeye (Renner) and Black Widow (Johansson), the two Avengers who haven't had their own movies yet, but the rest of the principal players don't have engaging story lines. Thor (Hemsworth) serves as great comic relief; but Stark's one-liners are getting very tired and poorly written. There's also some pretty badly done melodrama (throughout the movie) and an oddly placed romance between Hulk (Ruffalo) and Black Widow (What happened to Betty Ross?!). It's also never explained why Tony Stark came out of retirement and has several suits of armor again (after destroying them all in 'IRON MAN 3'). The action scenes go on for way too long (and are pretty reminiscent of 'MAN OF STEEL', or a Michael Bay 'TRANSFORMERS' film). It does have plenty of good moments too, though, and most die-hard fans will still love it; for all the geeky comic crap it does stay true to. It's just not the most well developed, or balanced, movie (as a result). The first film and some other installments, in the Marvel Universe, are better; but this film is definitely still an entertaining and mostly satisfying addition!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://youtu.be/kdQGbNrUAnk"

","Once upon a time the prospect of bringing The Avengers together as a movie seemed like a daunting task. Gathering the leads from four separate movie franchises plus two supporting characters and villain and doing it successfully was a potential challenge. Unfortunately for Director Joss Whedon, he made it look easy – the original Avengers was a massive success – the third highest grossing film ever which raised the expectations for sequels. Age of Ultron (AOU) arrives three years later – not just a follow up to The Avengers but also to 2014's superb Captain America: The Winter Soldier (CATWS), where the concluding events had massive repercussions in the Marvel Universe. Whilst it may not hit the fun heights of the original movie, this darker, grittier sequel raises the bar to a new level. <br/><br/>Following the collapse of SHIELD and criminal organisation Hydra in CATWS, The Avengers are now being funded by Tony Stark. Whilst on a mission to retrieve a Hydra weapon in Eastern Europe, a run-in with a pair of powerful twins, Wanda (Scarlett Witch) and Pietro Maximoff (Quicksilver), Stark has a vision of the world's end and the Avengers dead. Convinced the world needs more protection than the Avengers can give, Stark, along with sceptical but willing Bruce Banner, discover technology that will help re-start a dormant Artificial Intelligence world defence programme called Ultron. Before long, Ultron takes form, becomes self-aware and decides that the best way for world peace is humanity's extinction. <br/><br/>After Ulton's escape, The Avengers aggressively pursue him across several countries in order to thwart his plans. With the Maximoff twins working alongside Ultron, The Avengers are thrown into disarray as their own fears and pasts come back to haunt them and begin to doubt their unity as a team. <br/><br/>The action comes thick and fast and only slows down occasionally to provide a few back stories for both Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) who was criminally underused in the original film, and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson). The initial attack on Hydra's base is brilliantly executed as the camera follows each of the battling Avengers around a forest in one continuous action shot. We finally get to witness the Hulk well and truly off the leash as Iron Man is forced to bring in his ""Hulkbuster"" suit in order to take him down in a fantastic display of destruction. And of course there is the big action climax where director Whedon throws everything at the audience as The Avengers battle Ultron's endless army of clones. <br/><br/>It would be unfair to give away anymore plot details as this would ruin the twists in-store but AOU sets up the next five Marvel movies nicely in both subtle and obvious ways. The most amazing aspect of AOU is how each of the six Avengers get their own chance to shine – none of them are neglected – signs of a great writing team and director. New character Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) is a highlight and is just one of the new characters that will play a key role in the Marvel Universe. All credit has to go to director Whedon for handling such a monumental cast and making a movie on a scale not seen before as well as being laugh out loud funny throughout. A for Avengers. A for Awesome."

","Whole thing overdone. Pretty bad action sequences,bad acting, plot thinner than a slice of ham. I reckon they're all wallowing in their own self-importance,,let's make a Marvel movie and it will be a hit. The whole premise needs a re-boot. This is turning into an X-Men storyline. Not good directing as there seems to be no start,middle and ending structure. You get the idea from the very start that all is gonna be o.k. Not a BAD movie but definitely only for die-hard fans ages 12 and up.Probably do well but the whole franchise needs to stop taking the audience for granted.All the actors seem to be a bit fed up with the whole thing and if they want more mileage from the franchise they should get a grip."
"triggerhappy28","9","8","20","23 April 2015"," Just because it's not perfect doesn't mean it's not great.
","I am not nor do I claim to be a professional writer/critic. However, having just seen this movie I can confirm that I (emphasis on I) enjoyed every minute of it.<br/><br/>After seeing the opening sequence of the first Avengers movie on the big screen, my eyes welled up with nerd tears. 'This is it' I said to myself...'this is what it's all been building toward'. Obviously, since I finished seeing the end of that movie, I have been waiting impatiently for this one. And I was not disappointed. The threat is greater. The characters have developed further since their last 'team-up'. And the overall MCU story arc was developed further within this particular 'episode'. <br/><br/>Before I continue, for anyone doubting how impartial I can be in terms of Marvel or Superhero movies, let me say this: I don't like Iron Man 3 or Thor 2. They were not awful, but they were pretty average films in my opinion. And by average, I mean 5/10...Which brings me to my main point...<br/><br/>Too many times nowadays, I see people view a score of 7 or 8 out of 10 (The general consensus as I am writing this) as a 'terrible score'. As if people are so spoilt that unless it's a perfect masterpiece, it's garbage. This movie achieves exactly what it sets out to do, which is to entertain. There is humour, there is romance, there is action, there is drama, there is tension and suspense. The acting is great. The plot is good. The action set pieces, special effects and cinematography are what one would come to expect from a Hollywood summer blockbuster of today, albeit with maybe a few choppy fight scenes but I'm slowly starting to think that may be my vision and not the directors fault.<br/><br/>So, like I said at the beginning, this is not a professional review. I'm not going to pick everything apart and I believe the only comparisons I have made are between this movie and it's predecessor. I enjoyed both. I hope others enjoy them too. Make up your own mind. But don't apply your hipster logic or unfair expectations when making your decision. Just watch the movie and ask yourself...am I enjoying myself? And if the answer is still no, then fair enough. We're all entitled to our opinions."
"cubsckc","6","7","17","19 May 2015"," Movie Tries to Hard
","Overall an okay flick. I wouldn't mind watching it a couple more times in the future. But already, I feel that this one will be the one everyone dreads to watch when doing a Marvel marathon. <br/><br/>Differences between the Avengers becomes exploited when the Avengers finally destroy Hydra's headquarters and face off these two new characters that have joined the series. I actually thought it was too bad that Hydra got exterminated so quickly, I felt that Hydra always provided a great plot for the marvel heroes. Oh well. As such, Mr. Stark designs his and the world's doom by creating what is in his mind the ultimate defense for the world. Ultron, brings this ""Terminator"" series idea back in where technology fights its own designers. So alright, we have this concept brought back up. Its not terrible, and I guess its an alright attempt to make the Ultron plot. It really should have been assumed way before watching what the plot was going to be, given the main villain was going to be a robot. With the Avengers being manipulated and harassed by these new mutant marvel characters, they must find the courage to hold hands and fight together... should I go on? Kind of lame. It frankly felt like a waste of time to be honest. The actual Ultron character was pretty cool. Perhaps the coolest character in the movie, which is too bad because I'm a Thorn, Captain America fan. But wow! What a wimpy conflict to throw at the characters. They seriously go through an Emo phase for about an hour because Scarlet casts a spell on them. And then of course, they just had to add the Hulk getting mad at something stupid and waste a bunch of other time. The film tries to be emotional and build attachment... but it tries way too hard. <br/><br/>I think what bothered me the most about the movie is that I see a concept within the Marvel/Avenger series to create heroes that are completely perfect. Captain America, you see how he questions the tactics in which SHIELD gets its information and to what extent it goes to securing the people. You see it pushed here a little where literally an entire city is ripped from the earth and dropped back to the planet. Well, the movie makes it positively clear that the Avengers rescued every single civilian before the whole city crumbles into nothingness, while of course at the same time trying to eliminate hundreds of thousands of Ultron copies. It really was kind of stupid. If Marvel is really afraid of showing something like that then don't show it. Don't make it look very cheesy and completely impossible. The Marvel heroes somehow get the SHIELD club back together to help people escape a city being dropped from midair. <br/><br/>You get an interesting ending, like most Marvel movies, including a bit more about the infinity stones. But very vague, boring, and essentially, nothing new. Its the second Avengers film, and I find it the worse second film of the franchise. They really tried to hard in virtually every area. Just watch it and you'll know what I mean. From the beginning they are trying to be really funny with their hohohohehehe attitude where they are slaying Hydra's minions without breaking a sweat. The emotions, character development, and plot was all pretty bad. It was worth it just to see Ultron being evil."
"FairlyAnonymous","6","7","17","1 May 2015"," As a huge fan of the first film: This movie suffers from many issues
","Age of Ultron is a movie that has a lot of good concepts and tries really hard to fit them all in, but in the end it rushes through all of them and doesn't truly end up anywhere. This is NOT the darker movie that was promised.<br/><br/>I would like to say that this was a good movie, but most of its entertainment simply comes from being in the MCU again and being able to see the characters interact. The movie sells itself as if it is darker and more complex, but it isn't. It pretty much follows the same pattern as the first film, which is kind of sad. I liked the first movie, but it is a pattern that can only really work once.<br/><br/>I think the biggest issue with this movie is that none of the actors or characters really seem to be taking the threat seriously. Tony Stark is chill 24/7 and even when he learns that he unleashed evil unto the world, he never really seems guilty and no one really seems mad. The characters will briefly mention ""can we trust you?"" but it is never brought up again. It is odd how quickly big elements are glanced over. For example, Bruce Banner doesn't want to be the Hulk in a populated area, and Tony would rather not fight the Hulk due to him being his friend. However, when they do finally fight in a populated area, there is no sense of either one being emotional. Tony is taking it all rather well, and Bruce doesn't seem too distraught afterwards.<br/><br/>This is a consistent theme throughout the movie. There is a touch of character development, but the character development is never followed through. The only characters that really get any development are Hawkeye and... a little bit of Black Widow. Bruce Banner almost gets character development, but he never fully does. <br/><br/>However, the big issue with the movie is actually the villain. Ultron has everything to be an awesome villain, but he isn't. He is actually one of the weakest villains in awhile. The big issue with Ultron is that his dialogue and character is fairly inconsistent and rather jarring. Ultron is big, metallic, intimidating, powerful, and has a cold and intelligent voice... but his dialogue is stupid. It is okay for villains to crack jokes, but Ultron is quite literally a sassy and sarcastic robot. It is funny how un-intimidating he becomes when you realize he isn't even really a threat. Now, the plot mildly explains why he acts that way, but just because it is explained doesn't mean it makes him a good villain. If the villain lacks interest in his plan and sounds like a lazy guy, there is no reason for the audience to believe that he is a real threat... which he isn't.<br/><br/>The real shame in this movie is that I can imagine and point out everything that would've made it a better movie. Most movies have a lot of issues, but generally the movie as a whole is bad or there is something wrong with it. However, the big issue with Age of Ultron is that it has all of the right ideas, it just does them all in the wrong way. The villain: The concept of a villain who is everywhere and isn't afraid of dying because he can escape anywhere is a great idea. However, the movie never uses that concept fully. Ultron should've been a terror that seems to be everywhere and seems to be unstoppable; however he seems even weaker than the Chitauri from the first film. The other big issue is that the movie plays the ending action sequence like that of the first film... also the villain's master plan doesn't even make sense... when you hear it and when it is revealed what he is doing you will still question it and be slightly confused. Diving into the character's and making their friendships strained by Tony is a good idea... but they are never mad for more then five minutes. It is a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>All in all, Age of Ultron could've been amazing. It could've easily surpassed the first film, but it fails at that by rehashing the basic concept of the first film: The villain is hiding in a secret lair away from the heroes and then unleashes his army on a city where (once again) Iron Man risks his life to stop it... It is truly sad to get such a strong sense of what a film could be, but then you realize it is not the better film that you can tell the director wanted."
"ayushlihala","5","7","17","24 April 2015"," A most awaited disappointment
","Let me start by saying this that I have been one of the biggest fan of Marvel characters since the last 20 years and was really psyched to see the Avenger series on Screen. I loved the First movie and was really looking forward to this movie and caught the first show available. <br/><br/>Firstly visual effects the action sequences were no doubt top of the line but the story line aspect of the movie was so so disappointing that it almost made me feel bored during the movie. <br/><br/>The origins part of the movies were very very choppy and disconnected and at times seemed forced for the sake of having a story line. Some of the story arcs especially the origins section showed promise but were abruptly concluded. <br/><br/>One of my most significant complaints was the origin story of Ultron and complaint about the inadequate focus on showing or building the Ultron character which showed that the writers traded more action or special effects time for character development and storytelling. <br/><br/>I personally feel that the movie was very unoriginal and felt like seeing the avengers 1 and a couple other superhero movies mashed together with very little originality or creativity. It felt like watching Avengers 1 with new characters but lesser substance."

","There are so many things flying around my head, I need to pin them down to try and write a review of Avengers Age of Ultron. My hopes were high. I watched all of the trailers approximately 4 times a day for the last few months. And I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron kicks off nicely as a sequel to Captain America: The Winter Soldier in the continuity. There's a lot that goes unexplained but you just use your imagination. The film is chock full of cameos and this is a big reason for success - they don't have to rewrite the films to explain why so and so isn't there. But keep an eye out for one cringeworthy scene where we have to listen to Stark and Thor explain why their respective girlfriends aren't around.<br/><br/>The film gives us a glorious array of the action and quips we love about the Avengers movies. There's shot after shot of magical stunts that defy belief but we don't even care. The script is actually quite well done, although there are a handful of clichés we forgive them in the broad picture.<br/><br/>But Age of Ultron does what I had hoped - it goes deeper and even a little bit darker into themes of death, artificial intelligence and human interference. The questions posed by Stark, by Banner, by Ultron - they were questions worth thinking about. The Black Widow and Maximoff twins backstories are deep and dark. This might be the most insightful Marvel movie yet. The concept of death was one I was worrying about how the film would touch on. I would have liked a bit more but I cannot complain with the end result. All I will say on this is that I hope the Universe continues down this road.<br/><br/>You don't go to the Marvel Cinematic Universe for quality acting - there's been plenty of misses. But there's plenty to enjoy here. Mark Ruffalo shows that he can act circles around the rest of this cast in his sleep. He's the film's standout, his ability to dial back chemistry is unparalleled. There is also plenty to enjoy from the broad ensemble cast - Don Cheadle, Andy Serkis, Elizabeth Olsen and Paul Bettany shine in their roles (of varying size), and the main cast is always fun to watch. Even Aaron Taylor-Johnson is surprisingly not terrible. James Spader as Ultron will go down as my personal favourite casting choice in history - he doesn't just nail it, he splits the wood and impales the floor. <br/><br/>Yes the film feels a bit overstuffed by setting up sequels, and I think this is endemic of the problem facing Marvel rather than a problem with the film. I felt that the Thor side quest was silly but the information he got was important. The ""new Avengers line up"" was a big let down for me, because its not real - several of the gang are just retired, but we know they'll be back (because their contracts tell us they well). Marvel are too cowardly to treat these characters like normal movies would, because its not the individual products they care about, its the universe. It will get harder and harder for Marvel to create great standalone Marvel films like the original Iron Man, Guardians of the Galaxy and Thor. But this is all a commentary on the universe, not the film. <br/><br/>Age of Ultron itself was a mesmerising popcorn flick with some quality performances and touches of deeper thinking. I will be going back and seeing it as soon as I can."
"yehbefilms","8","4","8","28 April 2015"," An exhilarating experience showing off how far Marvel has come
","NON SPOILER SECTION<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great movie, if you love Marvel already you will have no problems with this one, if you don't like it AoU will not sell you on it. It's a roller-coaster of spectacle with a few short pit stops to develop our heroes, but what is more exceptional in this movie is that we got to the point where a god, a super soldier and a man in a robot suit can fight an artificial intelligence and it is still compelling, Ultron is great as a villain, and has a human side to him which makes him greater than I expected, even better than Loki. All in all the movie is a lot of fun but not much more to it, I'll have to watch it a few more times to be made sure of that.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FROM DOWN HERE<br/><br/>Let's talk in detail about some great stuff and some not so great stuff in this movie. First of all I love that the whole working together arc has been worked out in the first movie and the movie already starts with the avengers working together. Second I love the new characters, The Vision may be my favorite followed by quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. I actually enjoyed this version of Quicksilver a lot more because he's more than just comic fodder like in DOFP, he has more character and in my opinion better scenes. I love how they portrayed Ultron as an arrogant and very human villain, he cracks jokes and gets mad. That's another thing, the banter is awesome as always and on point. People who don't like it about the marvel universe will hate it but people who love it will... Well... Love it. Overall the action set pieces were done well and the characters were great, now to the not so great stuff.<br/><br/>I don't like how they rushed Ultron into it, I wanted more character development on his part, and more of a growing power than that he already is very strong. I also felt like the small moments were too few and too far in between. The movie doesn't take a minute to rest, they just immediately get done what they want done, and it's understandable seeing how the movie has to be filled with a lot of story and it only has 2 hours and 40 minutes to do so while also providing great set pieces.<br/><br/>But overall the movie was great and I'm looking forward to the extended edition."
"justinwfirestone","5","6","14","11 July 2015"," Disappointing
","Curiously enough, Captain Beefcake makes an oblique reference to the 1927 Yankees in the final scene of the movie (I will not call it a ""film""), exactly when I was thinking of the great 1990s Yankees teams that won four World Series titles from 1996 to 2000. And if you even dare try to tell me that the year 2000 was not part of the 1990s, I will Ultron your ass so hard you will wish you were a transplant patient waiting in line for Mickey Mantle's liver. (See what I did there?)<br/><br/>The reason I conjured up those latter damn Yankees is because they didn't really need Joe Torre to manage them, no more than the Avengers needed Joss Whedon to direct them. In fact, I bet Avengers: Age of Ultron would have turned out pretty much the same with absolutely no director at the helm. Consider the great managing decisions Joe Torre made in those late 1990s games, like ""Start Jeter,"" or ""Bring in Mariano Rivera for the 9th."" Pure genius.<br/><br/>Consider the great directorial decisions Joss Whedon made such as: ""Make a couple of homophobic jokes,"" and ""Have Thor do something with the hammer thingy."" Or ""Drag out everything until everyone in their seats has their sciatica act up again.""<br/><br/>I'm upset because I kind of liked the earlier Avengers movies, and I thought Joss Whedon was a marvelous writer of punchy, clever dialogue. No more. He's a hack and he's cashed a nice check. It's fine. Must be nice.<br/><br/>Is it ironic that the movie is about an artificial intelligence gone awry, when the entire global blockbuster industry of movies is run by algorithms designed to commodify the human spirit?<br/><br/>The subtitle ""Age of Ultron"" is certainly misleading. It should be ""An Hour with Ultron."" Actually, that might be a good time. You see, Ultron is funny. He makes dry jokes. He has Tony Stark's personality, which is why he is trying to destroy the world, because, you know, Tony Stark can't tell the difference between destroying or saving the world, either, which is why there have been so many Iron Man movies where Tony Stark is the villain trying to destroy the world.<br/><br/>Stuff blows up real good for about 150 minutes. Stuff blows up, real good. We have a laughable ""romance"" develop between the Hulk and ScarJo, where we so thankfully learn that neither of them can bear fruit in their barren reproductive holes. Captain Beefcake's goody- two-shoedness is played to the hilt. We get the maudlin Hawkeye family scenario. We get two new Avengers (until one of them dies after inexplicably saving a child while the entire planet hangs in the balance). We get a villain in Ultron who is a renaissance Lawnmower Man on K2, but is too stupid to actually do anything realistic with the power of controlling the Internet, and instead keeps trying to discover nuclear launch codes.<br/><br/>But more importantly, we get the cogs to churn forth near the end as we find Vision and the exposition for the next movies about the Infinity Gauntlet and the Infinity Gems. It seems strange that movies like Ant-Man are forthcoming when THE ENTIRE UNIVERSE IS AT STAKE because the Infinity Gauntlet is, well, just click this link because I don't have the energy to explain any of it. And isn't it colossally unfair that it's a gauntlet? What if someone without hands wants to wield its power? Maybe it should be an Infinity Sock. Nah, that's unfair to people without feet. How about an Infinity Tam? Everyone has a head, right? Now we're going to upset the Headless Horseman.<br/><br/>The movie isn't all bad. It gets a +1 for Stan Lee still being alive and making stupid cameos. Another +1 for destroying some lame-ass foreign place instead of New York again. Scratch that. They destroy both New York and some lame-ass foreign place, so -1, and now we're back to zero.<br/><br/>If we must have an Infinity War, just remember: everything is everything and nothing is nothing."

","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the 11th installment to the MCU franchise and a sequel to the 2012 smash hit, Avenger's Assemble. It stars Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr, Chris Hemsworth, Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and James Spader as Ultron. Both written and directed by Joss Whedon.<br/><br/>In this movie we start with the team invading Baron Von Strucker's base of operations in the fictional country of Sokovia, as he is in the possession of Loki's scepter. A weapon that is capable of some pretty powerful stuff. The Avengers need to get it back as it is deadly when in the wrong hands. When they make it back to stark tower Tony Stark (RDJ) realizes he can use it to kick start is 'Ultron' Initiative. A peace keeping program that is supposed to protect the earth from any outside intruders (Aliens etc). Things do not go to plan and instead of creating something to protect them, Tony ends up creating an artificial intelligence hell bent on destroying the Avengers.<br/><br/>Let us start with Ultron. Now I never watched any of the trailers as I wanted to go into this movie with every scene completely new in my mind. After the movie finished I decided to then go and watch all the trailers. I must say, that in my opinion the trailers made Utron to be a lot more menacing and threatening than he actually was on screen. Now he wasn't a terrible villain unlike *cough* Malaketh *cough*. But he wasn't exactly great either. Most of the destruction of the team actually came from the twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, mainly Wanda. He could have been a bad ass who could finally be the one to push the Avengers, he just wasn't.<br/><br/>While Ultron himself was not terrible one thing was, his development. There is little to no development for him, whatsoever. So he thinks that he's trying to save the world when he's in fact doing the opposite. Yes, they gave him personality, which to be fair wasn't that hard to do as he's pretty much just a Tony Stark 2.0. His motives were stupid, he goes from realizing he's an AI to wanting to destroy the world within a 10 second time frame. It is a a shame as he could have been the greatest villain in the MCU, not to be THAT guy, but that still belongs to Loki.<br/><br/>Another thing I didn't really like was the relationship between Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Banner (Mark Ruffalo). While it did kind of serve a purpose and added to the movie I just found the whole thing to be forced. You could bring up a point that it happened long before the time period of this movie, but given the conversation during the party that seems impossible to be the case. The conversation itself was also kind of cringy IMO. i had a ""what the hell"" face throughout the entire scene.<br/><br/>Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was a bad ASS in this movie. Throughout most of the first Avengers Clint was a puppet being controlled by Loki. The rest of the movie all he did was provide cover from on top of a building, and was pretty much completely out of the action. Not in this movie though. Hawkeye was a front runner throughout most of this movie, he took charge and actually kicked most of the ass. I also love how this movie kind of made fun of the fact that Clint is just a guy and all he does is a fire a bow and arrow. They joke about the fact that they don't really need him when in fact, the biggest joke of all is how much they actually do.<br/><br/>The humour was completely hit and miss for me, but more of the latter. The problem I have with MCU movies, is that apart from Winter Soldier, they're just pretty much comedies. The story of this movie is pretty much, a couple of lines about piece, annihilation and fighting together with about 2 hours of jokes and one liners. They advertised that they were going to go darker with this one. They really didn't. Sure it had elements of darkness but it was pretty much just the same forced crap as usual. They don't need every member of the team cracking wise every 5 seconds, have it more serious, have it more brooding and maybe just have one person as the comic relief not EVERYONE. You can still make a dark movie and still have it lighthearted at parts. The Russo brother did that really well with Winter Soldier and i can't wait to see what they bring to the table for Infinity Wars.<br/><br/>On another positive note the action in this movie was pretty awesome. It is a very entertaining movie. If you just want to go and enjoy a movie, maybe lose a couple of brain cells while you're at it then this is the perfect movie for you. I know it kind of relies on it for the most part but in other cases it's just completely not necessary. If you haven't guessed i'm talking about the CGI. I mean, they CGI'd captain America riding a bike. What is the point of that? That's more pointless than CGing Green Lantern's mask in the 2011 movie of the same name.<br/><br/>Is it the best of the MCU? In my opinion no. Not even close to it. Is it one of the more entertaining movies of the MCU? You bet your ass it is. Chances are, if you loved the first one you will most likely love this one, too.<br/><br/>Verdict: This movie could have been so much more than just mindless entertaining popcorn fodder, but it just didn't really do it for me. 6 out of 10"
"commander_zero","6","6","14","11 May 2015"," The End of an Age
","It seems incredible to think that super-hero films might crash and burn the same way that historic/religious epics did half a century ago. After all, they have much more appeal for children than did those earlier movies, and every few years the market for a children's film is renewed. But seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, one can see the end coming. Joss Whedon's writing is clever, but not as strong as what Christopher Markus and Stephen McFeely have done with the Captain America films, although to cut Whedon some slack, the nature of the Avengers forces the writer to work with a huge and unwieldy cast; there aren't many writers who could have made Age of Ultron as good as it is. <br/><br/>Still, the overall feeling is that there's simultaneously too much of everything, and not enough of anything. Watching Avengers: Age of Ultron in a cinema with multi-channel sound turned up just a bit too high is a special kind of sensory overload, like those sixties rock concerts where the audience got stoned because that was the only way they could stand the volume. The multiple digital effects are at once dazzling and numbing; they are like a rich man's funeral where the huge floral arrangements are meant to confirm that the deceased was beloved, but only confirm that he was rich. <br/><br/>The result is that it's the real things that make us stop and say ""hey there"": that the crowds fleeing the Hulk's rampage are predominantly black (it is, after all, Johannesburg, but seems like a brilliant innovation because we are so used to seeing crowds of white people, and Asians, in blockbusters and kaiju films); that after years of hearing Paul Bettany as Jarvis, we actually get to see him, looking and sounding great; and that when all the dust has settled and the crisis is over, Tony Stark summons that most mundane of sci-fi devices (soon to be science fact): a driverless car. Although spectacles come and go, at the core of great films are real things. In Age of Ultron, the real things remain at the periphery, when they should be at the core.<br/><br/>PS: the incredibly skewed gender and racial politics of superhero films are also dating them shamefully. At least in Age of Ultron, a few women occasionally get to do something. But the black characters played by Don Cheadle (a bit of a fifth wheel, even in the Iron Man films), Anthony Mackie (after Captain America: The Winter Soldier, we want to see more of the Falcon and the actor who plays him, not just a glimpse) and Samuel L. Jackson (who doesn't do much in any of these films except once again, the excellent Winter Soldier) are hastily shuffled through the plot, soon dispensed with to make way for the white heroes. Perhaps mass audiences want super-heroes; but how long are they going to put up with this comic book white-guys-only world?"

","Seen it all before except now there are so many ""main"" characters and heroes its hard to keep up. Of course the CGI, sound effects and visuals are amazing but you expect that in a big budget action movie these days. What is lacking is a story line and characters that you actually care about. Killer robot soldiers that can be scared off with a scowling look? Really? And why is every plot to destroy the world (yes, again, and why? Are we blocking someone's view?) taking more energy to set up the impending destruction than if the villain had just used that energy to actually destroy the world - I don't want to put in a spoiler so I'm being obtuse). Wasted scenes at a farmhouse and a dip in a magic pool for Thor that I still don't understand. Seriously, the writers need to actually read some old Marvel comics for some ideas on how to keep the reader/viewer interested. Yawn."
"fabiolpinheiro1993","7","6","14","6 May 2015"," A lazy compilation of half baked ideas put together, but still... lots of fun!
","1- The beginning - i get that they wanted to start the film with a big action sequence and i actually liked very much of the going through each character in battle, but like every action scene in this film i didn't like the camera shots, and while its fine action it looked too much like a video game, and the film should have started with each character being assembled again, following each character follow up to their individual films that had huge things happening, and that is completely ignored here, mainly iron mans 3 ending. 2- Ultron - Well tony's obsession with creating him goes pretty much against everything that happened in iron man 3 and he's so out of character. He had nightmares and panic attacks for creating demons as he said: it all starts with good intentions and then everything falls apart, and he destroyed every single creation of him so i really don't see why would he want to create such a problematic AI. Then he is created like in 2 minutes and suddenly he's bad, and has tony's Witt all of which i still don't know why since nothing his explained. For an AI he's very dumb and he makes no sense, his plan to achieve world peace is completely against all logic, he wants to wipe out every life form on earth so the humans can evolve?! It makes no sense. I don't like the fact that his lips moved when talking, hes a robot! its weird. 3- Hawkeye is a farmer?! Out of nowhere we learn that hes a farmer, and has a wife, 2 kids with 3 soon to be. This could be resolved with a wonderful writing but the way it was executed seems forced. 4- Hulk and Black widow! This was by far the worst thing in the film. She was completely out of character, and their love thing and plans for running away comes out so forced and so out of nowhere that i still don't know what the hell whedon was thinking. She was perfect in captain America 2 and had a wonderful relation with captain America something that gets ignored here much like in the 1st film with iron man. She gets reduced to a chick in a Rom com. 5- The vision - he was so awesome. But he was created in 2 minutes again, with no explanation or something. 6- Thor's side trip - what the hell was this? Well i still don't know since Thor disappeared for a very long time in the middle of the film, this was very weird, and weirder was his return. 7- The siblings - they are two very cool bad ass characters that have powers which make them easy to have very cool things to do. But no! They are completely wasted and useless, and appear like 10 minutes in the film and come out of nowhere like much in this film. Seeing what singer made with quicksilver with just a scene or two in days of future past, establishing him and getting me instantly hooked, here it's very disappointing. He just could do so much and then dies and i'm supposed to cry, he appeared like 5 minutes, so this comes out very flat. Also their development is ridiculous. They have some sort of vendetta against iron man so they join ultron only to find out hes bad! in 2 seconds and joining the avengers, and suddenly they forget about the vendetta with not even a talk with iron man and no one even asks when they appear in the avengers HQ since only captain knew they were good at that point. Also their idea of tearing apart the avengers with mind manipulation goes nowhere and it's so useless. 8 - Iron man vs the hulk - pretty cool but man of steel much? 9- The ending - Well if you've seen the 1st film this one is just the same thing, like the entire film! The avengers assemble, they argue against each other, they fight each other, they assemble again and then they beat an army in a city, This time its robots in a flying city, its a very cool visual, but is poorly executed and Then Ultron gets beaten the exact same way as Loki was, way too easily. Can we get some villain that actually fights as an equal instead of a cgi army that its only there so the avengers destroy them in every way possible?! And this not only is like iron man 2, iron man 3 but of course the avengers. 3 same endings! Thanos! Finally hes doing something! But he seemed so goofy that instead of fear i smiled. 10- Technical aspects - well the film looks cheesy, which is unforgivable for a 250 million plus film. The visual effects are murky and foggy or something, for most of the time i don't get whats happening with the cgi, the cinematography its terrible, and the score its like soup opera quality. This compared to captain America 2 and iron man 3 it's just a huge setback.<br/><br/>In conclusion though. the film still is fun to watch, despite the huge plot holes, the lack of originality or a vision, the terrible writing, the video game like action, the lack of drama, i mean i love the humor but there's no stakes no consequences its just like a video game. And characters make decisions that defy all logic! All seems like a compilation of half baked ideas put together with nothing to unite them. Some people say the film is too long well i think it should be 20 minutes longer so all the problems could be resolved. This should be marvel's next level but its just a lazy film and a ripoff of the 1st one, and its nothing but pure fun. Don't ask me why I'm giving a 7 to this, not even i know, but what the hell..."

It's a movie you don't watch twice unlike Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy or Cameron's Terminator series.<br/><br/>Apart from all that,the movie is quiet a fun roller coaster ride,especially the stunt scenes between Iron Man (Hulk Buster) and Hulk, introduction of new character's such as Vision etc... <br/><br/>Finally, the movie is totally worth the money you pay for the ticket."
"Aaron1375","8","6","14","4 May 2015"," I enjoyed it, but it felt underwhelming this time around
","I enjoyed watching this film, but I have to say the first one was better. That is to be expected I guess, as it was the first time something of that scope had been attempted and all the lead up to the film with the other films. This one, just kind of felt almost episodic rather than being an epic film. Basically, as if it was a television series rather than a full length feature film I paid money to see with some very overpriced snacks from the concession stand. Even the film quality looked sub par at times as it looked kind of drained of color. I knew I was probably not going to enjoy this one as much as the first due to the main villain being Ultron as he is not a favorite of mine. I just do not see him as being that big a threat seeing as how I have a comic where Spider-man takes him down. However, that is not the only reason I feel this film underwhelms, it is just a bit hard to explain. Overall, I did enjoy the film as there was a bit more action than the previous film and there was some cool stuff going on, but like I said, something about it was off.<br/><br/>The story has the Avengers raiding a castle which is a Hydra base right off the bat in the hopes of retrieving the scepter Loki used in the previous Avengers film. At one point a pair of siblings enhanced with strange powers attack and this leads to Iron Man having a bit of an epiphany. This leads him and Dr. Banner trying to create an artificial intelligence to protect the world from threats from space which they plan to dub Ultron. Unfortunately, things do not go as planned and soon Ultron is declaring war on the Avengers and has an extreme way of protecting the world! <br/><br/>I will say my favorite Avenger is the Hulk and in the first film they showed how powerful he is. This film, not so much. Probably one of the things I disliked about it. Not only does he not get to really flex his muscles much, the one time he does he is taken down by Iron Man in a really big suit of armor. Anyone who reads the comics knows that the Hulk gets stronger the madder he gets so this whole fight seemed idiotic to me. No way Iron Man takes down Hulk by himself even with 'Hulk Buster' armor. You simply cannot beat Hulk down like they showed in this film, he would have continued to get more angry and torn Tony Starks' Hulk Busting armor completely apart. I have read comics where the Hulk pretty much dominates the entire Avengers team, Iron Man included by himself! So yeah, they completely undersold the Hulk this time.<br/><br/>The film did have lots of action which was nice and it did have some good humor here and there, but it just was not up to par with the previous Avengers film. There was a strange relationship that seemed to come out of nowhere, the in fighting kept coming and going and one of the new characters is dispatched in their first film! I also think the part of the film that got my blood going the most was the scene after part of the credits as this scene sets up the villain I wanted this time. Still, it was nice to see them bring in War Machine and the battle at the end was pretty cool too, though it needed more Hulk for my taste. Ultron was done pretty good, as they found a way to make him more of a threat than he usually is in the comics, it just would have been nice if he had more lead up in the previous Marvel films as he came out of left field. I know I seem like I am complaining too much as I did like the film, just did not love it like the first one. Worth a look, but hold your expectations down a little is probably the best way to view it and if the Hulk is not your favorite you should be fine too."
"nicolechan916","7","6","14","4 May 2015"," Great acting and cool effects but same old story.
","To be honest, I was a little bit disappointed in the film. Don't get me wrong, I still enjoyed it, but the story was nothing new. You might argue that it's not much of the story that these comics/films are about, but rather the action and powers, but still, even in the comics there is progression and character development.<br/><br/>The visual effects was great as usual, and the action scenes pretty exciting. However, it seemed like the majority of the film either involved fighting or talking and that was pretty repetitive. It got a little tiresome watching fights and explosions, plus this time there was no charismatic, fun Loki to keep the film centred around. The film just basically had the same hurdle the avengers had to get through, which was to work together as a team.<br/><br/>Other than that, I liked how we had more of a glimpse into Hawkeye's life, as well as a more human view of Hulk and Black Widow. I was not expecting them to be inclined towards each other but it was cute.<br/><br/>The script seemed a bit much though. There was quite a few funny moments but in all it seemed like the writers added too many lines for each character just for the sake of laughter. Too many one liners and there wasn't much conversation between the characters as well. This also made it seem like the avengers were not that serious about the end of the world.<br/><br/>So in my opinion, the first avengers film was definitely much better. Though I still like this film, it didn't wow me, and it felt a little tiresome watching the fighting scenes again and again. Though I liked how a few of the other characters from their personal films appeared, and the addition of the Maximoff twins was interesting but could have been further explored.<br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"
"veensepeper","7","6","14","4 May 2015"," Great action, lacked build-up
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' has a disadvantage to the first 'Avengers'-movie; namely that it ISN'T THE FIRST 'AVENGERS'-MOVIE. The first one could do with little plot (a simple MacGuffin chase), leaving a large chunk of the movie open for the characters to interact and explore each other - have a team being born. The sequel needed more than that - but did not quite deliver. All in all, it's a decent middle-episode of a series - but it lacks in rememberability.<br/><br/>Although there is some over-use of shaky-cam (hold the camera still, so we can actually take in what happens, for a change), the action is good to great. The movie tends to drag it a little - probably pandering to the 'Michael Bay'-like audience. The greatest problem of this film is the lack of build-up. Ultron was created to protect the world, but the second he erects he decides he should destroy it. Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch switch sides several times in the movie, without building up their motivation to do so.<br/><br/>The few times the movie does take its time to invest in the characters - it does so at the party and at the farm - it does it greatly. This is why I want to see the Avengers: because I like the characters, I want to explore them and know them better.<br/><br/>Also; there is great humor in this movie. There's a running gag of Captain America feeling uncomfortable with potty-mouth, which plays well into him being from the forties. Then, the running gag over Thor's hammer even gets to serve the plot - and Quicksilver's one-liner goes full-circle in the movie (according to the rule of three). Also, the movie does not only acknowledge its ridiculousness, it even celebrates it. That's something that could have salvaged 'Iron Man Three', where the movie asks us to take things serious that are too dumb for words.<br/><br/>And that brings us to 'Age of Ultron' in relation to the other MCU movies. Some things are glossed over or rushed, just like the evilness of Ultron. For instance: - The opening is a great action-wise (re)introduction to the Avengers... but why are they working together? They split up after the first 'Avengers'-movie, didn't they? And didn't Iron Man retire after IM3? - Apartently, Dr. Selvig went cuckoo after the first 'Avengers'- movie ~ as was depicted in Thor2. Now, when Thor comes to visit him (for a scene that stalled the movie instead of contributing to it), he appeared to be fine. - Didn't Iron Man get rid of his drone-suits when he retired at the end of IM3? Now, they're back.<br/><br/>Either they did the other movies wrong, or they should have taken time to get these things out of the way. Either way, it reeks of missed opportunity.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't feel that 'Age of Ultron' is 'The Empire Strikes Back' to the 'Avengers'' 'Star Wars'. Instead, it's a decent middle- of-the-season episode of a cool TV-series such as 'Buffy the Vampire Slayer'."

","The Following Review WILL NOT Contain Spoilers! <br/><br/>Three years after the highly successful and great Avengers film that Joss Whedon and other masterminds brought us, we get the long awaited sequel. This film doesn't have the charm and originality of the first film. It instead tries to be too much like the first movie, and fails for the most part. The film often drags along uselessly with aspects of the story that are either underdeveloped or taken too far over the top. The film has some great elements though, and I still do not consider this a bad film. The following is my review of Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The film was written by Joss Whedon who also helped write the first Avengers film. The film adds some new characters like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver(characters we have all seen in the commercials and trailers by now). The rest of the team is already well established from the previous film, so knocking the character development on characters like Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America makes no sense. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch both get rushed into the film with a back story that shows little emotion. The characters themselves fit well into the action around them nicely though. The movie is mainly well paced expect around the middle part of the film. Around this time we get left with the same tired moments of characters trying to connect with each other emotionally. I understand wanting this aspect of the story, but it drags on for a good twenty to thirty minutes for sure. Whedon is able to overall craft something somewhat interesting, but it feels too much like the first film. Some of the characters act too stupid as well over of the course of the film. Towards the end of the movie in the final battle this play out big time. Whedon tries something different, but it falls on its face because it misses other key aspects. Whedon can make excellent products, however this time he delivered something generally average.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon is the director as well, and he did direct the first Avengers film. The action scenes are one of the brightest areas of the film. We are introduce to his amazing talent right off the start in this sequel. Though there are lengthy slowdowns in the action later on in the film, and sometimes the action can be incoherent, however the action mostly flows nicely, and is very enjoyable. The ending of the film though feels too much like the first film, and this is another knock on Whedon. With some different characters it would have been nice to expand on the characters overall. That just doesn't happen. The acting is another bright spot for the most part. The only downside of the film in this aspect are the awful accents from Elizabeth Olsen(Scarlet Witch) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Quicksilver). Olsen outside of the awful accent delivers generally a great job of acting. Taylor-Johnson is as stale as ever in this film. Most know he isn't the best actor, and we see why yet again in this film. James Spader(Ultron) delivers a great performance voice acting in this film. Though his character is not exactly written great in the film. The rest of the Avengers are a joy to watch as they finally have a perfect chemistry after doing many of these films over the years. Whedon delivers mostly great action scenes that look nice even though they are CG, but misses the mark in key areas as well.<br/><br/>The film was scored by both Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler. Elfman came onto the production after Tyler has already done work on the film. Both of these composers have past experience in this genre of films. Tyler work on previous MCU films like Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, while Elfman has work on Batman(1989), Batman Returns, and more recently with Spider-Man 1 & 2. Their score here in generally okay, but nothing special. Both composers have amazing talent, but outside of a few pieces here and there, the score is lackluster. I thought for sure this would be one guaranteed great aspect of the film, but in my opinion it was just average.<br/><br/>In closing, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a mixed bag of emotions for me. I didn't hate the film, and liked a few aspects of the film. A few other aspects turned me off on this film though. The film is fun at times and fans of the superhero genre should watch this film right away, but I felt it was about at average, just above average at best. After the big success of the first Avengers film and how great that film was, I shouldn't have expected something on the same level. I really didn't, but in the end it fell even further than I thought it would. In the end I would still tell people to see this film at least once, even though I didn't love it.<br/><br/>5.5/10<br/><br/>I want to take a moment and talk about the IMAX version of this film. The film was not shot using IMAX or 3D cameras. Even though it was converted all the way around the 3D looks amazing as a great deal of the film is CG, and the IMAX adds some great depth that normal screens still don't have. The non CG 3D scenes aren't anything exciting though, and look bland on the screen. This isn't real 3D or real IMAX, but unless the tickets is extremely overpriced, I would say it is worth viewing on the larger scale IMAX screens."

","The summer movie season kicks off with one of the most anticipated movies of the year, Avengers: Age of Ultron. Now, I myself am not a big fan of the Marvel movies, as I've always seen them as basically the same movie: Bag guy wants to destroy/rule the world, good guy stops him, good guy is hailed as a hero. No real deviation.<br/><br/>What made the Nolan Batman movies so great is that they put a new, realistic, and almost deconstructing spin onto the superhero genre. They weren't made just to entertain, but to also make the audience think. But all the Marvel cares to do is have you buy the tickets to watch the movies a dozen times and get excited for the next 30 films that they have planned. And really, that's the major problem with Marvel: They do not see film as art. It's all about money. The Joker said it best in The Dark Knight: It's not about money, it's about sending a message. And personally, that's how I think film should used.<br/><br/>So now that I've explained why the Marvel movies don't work for me, it's time to get into why Avengers 2 followed this formula specifically.<br/><br/>In comparison to the first Avengers, which I actually like, the directing in this film is bizarrely bad. All of the action scenes are shot like it's in a Transformers movies, as in, the camera is too close to the action, so it's hard to figure out who's punching who or doing what. In The Avengers, it pretty easy to tell what was going on, and it made the fight scenes more enjoyable to watch. But in this film, it can be downright incoherent. Hell, I've seen better cinematography out of the Star Wars prequels in terms of action. At least I was able to get an idea as to what was going on in those scenes! Another problem is the action is simply too fast. One blink, and a character will be on the other side of the entire city because we're not allowed take in to what's going on! Overall, the directing is a major step down from from the first Avengers. And I've seen both movies in theaters.<br/><br/>The acting is passable, though I can't say any of the actors shine or really pull through in terms of giving a performance. Like they were all there to give their lines and put in their B-game, not their A-grade material. James Spader as Ultron truly delivers a menacing voice, but the script doesn't allow him to be that terrifying of a villain. Like seriously, after his first scene, he sounds like an old Jewish mother complaining about how things aren't going her way. Ultron made a lot of quips and sarcastic remarks, and quite frankly, it didn't suit him. Which leads me to my next point.<br/><br/>I know that humor and light-heartedness are what distinguishes Marvel movies from DC movies, but I swear, every single character in this movie is a comedian. Everybody's the funny guy! It's good to have one character that's comic relief in an ensemble cast, but not every single character! Like I know that everybody has a humorous side to them, but after the first 30 minutes, the joke's just get old. Like, with each action beat in the story, there HAS to be beat of humor every 5 minutes! Even when a horrible accident happens in the film, not a minute later, somebody else is trying to do a wisecrack! Can we PLEASE tone it down with humor and be serious for a MINUTE!?!<br/><br/>So yeah, Avengers: Age of Ultron is littered with your typical superhero plot, barely comprehensible action, a somewhat disappointing villain, unnecessary humor, and standard CGI fights with a standard climax to the story. It's more of the same from Marvel, but hey, that's what their fans seem to like. <br/><br/>More and more and MORE of the same."

","Today my brother and myself went to see this in the cinemas as we had all done and we decided to watch the new Avengers movie in 3D. The Avengers as you may know consists of the following heroes. Hulk,Iron Man,Scarlet Witch,Captain America and of course Thor. This time around and the gang have to defeat an evil robot that Tony Starks(Robert Downey Jr) created in the beginning of the film as we see our heroes beforehand battling army men in a forest. We are later introduced to Russian twins both played by Aaron Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen(who were both awesome may I add) and their powers were very good,especially Olsen's character who has the ability to manipulative people's minds(as she does this later on to our heroes and they can't seem to control these dreams they are getting and they later have to hide in Hawkeye's home with his wife and two kids. Of course Hulk and Scarlet Witch(Scarlet Johannson and Mark Ruffalo)have feelings for one another and as for the rest of the gang well like I said they have to battle Ultron(voiced by James Spader)who wants to destroy the avengers. So can our team of heroes battle it out to stop Ultron?<br/><br/>Now I had no expectations to see this movie as I didn't bother with the trailers I just went in with a blind eye and left satisfied even though the pacing was all over the place and it was a blink and you miss it scenario. Sadly myself and my brother walked out 25 minutes till the finale due to other reasons but overall I thought it was a pretty good movie.<br/><br/>Also keep an eye out for Hayley Atwell and Stellan Skarsgard who both appeared in this movie and they were last seen in Cinderella with Lily James and Richard Madden. <br/><br/>7/10 for the action sequences.<br/><br/>5.2/10 for everything else.<br/><br/>Also since this is a Marvel film Stan Lee makes a cameo."

","Just saw the movie in the cinema. Next to me there was this teenage boy with his dad. This boy was a die hard comic fan thinking to be as smart as Tony Stark, but when he laughed he did not know whether he had to breath through his mouth or nose or both at the same time. Really annoying.<br/><br/>Now about the movie. I watched the first movie two days ago and compared to the first movie I had the feeling this sequel had a smaller cast. Now I don't have something against a smaller cast, but this cast still had Natasha in it and Clit Hawkeye (the dude with bow and Arrow). Both people are no superheroes. They are just well trained. So what are they doing in the movie? Oké I liked the thing between Natasha and The Hulk, but what is this dude Clit still doing in the movie? This sequel tries to catch a emotional tone. There's this thing going on between Natasha and The Hulk and this brother and sister thing between the twins. And here is why that does not work; The Avengers is an action slash comedy movie. You can't build emotional scenes on a foundation that began with humor. You just can't.<br/><br/>Now for the good stuff. The fight between Iron Man and The Hulk was awesome. Paul Bettany looked very great. Well, that's about it.<br/><br/>What will happen in the third movie? Will there be doubts about the unity of the team again? Will this be the theme of the movie like it has been in the first and second movie, again? Do we have to feel sympathy for the superheroes slash well trained people, knowing that no-one will die? How exciting can that be? Movie was a bit disappointing."

","The Avengers: Age of Ultron is meant to take this Marvel Universe into a whole new level. It introduces a villain that could lead these heroes into dark situations by giving them one of their ultimate tests. The movie lives up to that tone; it's not as humorous as its predecessor, and that is definitely not a bad thing since we want this material to step up into a grittier and much challenging approach, but the real problem is its plotting. There's so much build up to juggle, starting from its own plot to the upcoming installments of this franchise. It's still fun if you can tolerate its stalling foreshadowing, but to those who seek for compelling narrative, it somehow disappoints. Still, there's so much action and large scale worth checking out in this summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>The movie introduces new characters and new locations, telling us that this is definitely bigger than the first movie. When it proceeds to the actual plot, there is some intrigue to what the titular main villain is capable of. And so, there is more mayhem happening on screen, but they essentially exists for the story, of course. Though, after those nearly unending amount of heavy action, the movie suddenly settles to explore what else is going on in this universe. This middle act somehow intrudes its main plot, aside of some few drama, the movie is pretty much preparing to what will happen next. It's feels long, even if it's actually not. At these moments, it doesn't feel like it's supposed to develop enough of the actual storyline. Many of the subplots in those minutes seems to belong to another set of movies that are yet to exist. Sure, we discover more information from its characters, but most of the time, it's a filler of cliffhangers.<br/><br/>What really troubles here is how it aims to be a setup of numerous events, like the phase 3 of Marvel Studios and the climax. The movie would have been nicer if it explores more of Ultron's abilities and not just making plans, controlling drones and preaching monologues (the film kind of only teases and mostly verbalizes that he can hijack through networks worldwide.) Or build up a different theme for the Avengers team instead of them trying to hate each other again like in the first one. But if we're not talking about its story, then the movie works magnificently in its action. To those who are in for some bigger, louder and more destructive than ever set pieces, then this sequel must be a marvelous feast. The Hulk vs. Stark's Hulkbuster Armor scene is such a glorious sequence of just seeing things getting hit and destroyed, more well constructed and thrilling than a mediocre blockbuster would do. The rest of the action is a tremendous blend of pretty spectacles, sudden suspense, sudden comedy and impressive choreography. As popcorn cinema goes, this is perfect for a superhero movie experience.<br/><br/>Aside of the action, nothing spices these movies up more than its actors. The cast does their thing; with Robert Downey Jr. trying to add more depth to Tony Stark than just bringing more memorable punchlines, Chris Evans stays cool as Captain America, Chris Hemsworth sticking with his charisma as Thor. There's an interesting turn between Black Widow and The Hulk, which Scarlett Johansson and Mark Ruffalo buying into their characters' chemistry. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are additions that can be worth rooting for, with their characters' mysterious nature and well, accents. And finally, what everyone is so stoked about is James Spader as the main villain, Ultron. Spader verbally brings more menace to the character, understanding the angst and potential threat behind this robot. There is levity exists in this character as well, and he nicely balanced it with Ultron's darkside.<br/><br/>The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a little too burdened by the future. As an exclusive narrative, the movie seems lacking, sure the action is too awesome to contain, but when it comes to the storytelling, it feels like it isn't going anywhere further until the climax. But even for a film that is reserved enough from showing a much complex or much adventurous plot, it's still a grand experience, thanks to its undeniably exciting action, some interesting character-work, and other clever elements. But then, we want these movies to offer beyond that standards; as in a story that could move forward way far behind the first Avengers movie. Well apparently, it does, but the effort of going through that result just doesn't seem enough. It's more innovation, then save it for later. Then again, there's nothing wrong if you still want to spend two hours seeing our favorite heroes clash together, even in a senseless way. Because blockbusters are supposed to be fun and this movie still lives up to that promise."

","I don't believe many would argue against us being a spoilt generation, a generation that expects a great deal and expects it better and faster each time. It's a mindset that encompasses most of our everyday life, whether we are waiting for our next coffee, our next parcel of goods ordered over the internet, there are countless aspects of our everyday life that we now merely take for granted, a state of being that has stemmed to most facets of our life including our movie watching tastes and expectations. <br/><br/>In the ever increasing world domination of the Marvel universe, comic book lovers and superhero loving cinema patrons have been treated to a plethora of big screen spectacles over the recent years, particularly within the last decade. In that time we've been witness to arguably the greatest ever molding of characters and material with the incredibly popular and rightfully well-loved The Avengers. The Avengers was everything you could want from a movie featuring men in tights, angry green beasts and an archer with a never-ending supply of arrows, and us being the generation we are wanted more, we wanted it faster, better and more blowing so how does Age of Ultron satisfy the needs of its fervent watchers? <br/><br/>It was always going to be an extremely tough task for Marvel and director Joss Whedon to top the first Avengers and many will ask as a first point of call if Age of Ultron is as good or better than the first and to answer that straight up you'd have to say no. A no answer is anything but bad news however as Age of Ultron still possesses the quick-fire wit, the stunning imagery and fantastic camaraderie between the films many stars that made the first such a memorable adventure. Suffice to say much of the film's original novelty value of seeing the crew of heroes assemble for the first time is now largely gone but there growing relationships and angst that comes from time spent with one another is an interesting and well developed aspect of this new tale. There's potential love, pent up anger and some great double teaming of bad guys within the crack team and with Whedon's assured direction and scripting, Age of Ultron continues to be a step above other comic book movies in virtually all aspects. With seemingly all great aspects of the first Avengers intact here again what makes Ultron a lesser affair is sadly in it titular bad guy. <br/><br/>Loki became the perfect foe for our first outing in the Avengers movie, with Tom Hiddleston's great performance and some great lore behind his anger, he made for a thoroughly dastardly villain and one you couldn't take your eyes whenever he was on screen. In James Spader's Ultron we have a ""big bad"" that initially looks to steal the show only to become a character that is less the sum of his parts due to murky motivation and some seriously questionable quick production times on his evil plans. Spader does a great job of both his motion capture and voice work and is what I'd imagine a fantastic incarnation of the comic book favourite but there is something severely lacking in his progression in the film that holds this 2 hour plus story back. In other minor quibbles it feels as though both Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver are underused in what feels like an arc that would've benefited from these new additions more whilst being the spoilt cinema goers we are it does feel as though our grand finale is a little lacking especially when compared to the city leveling joys of the first outings showpiece or even this films incredibly fun Hulk rampage, who by the way is an ardent of Beats by Dr. Dre, who would've thought?. <br/><br/>With expectations high and with pre-hype at all new boisterous levels, Age of Ultron has some mighty goals to meet and while it doesn't feel like the home run of the first it most certainly is a hugely enjoyable big budget blockbuster that's wittier than countless so called comedies and more original than many of marvels recent diminishing adventures. We all know what the cast here can deliver and there all sufficiently on song and it's with great pleasure I can say Iron Man doesn't dominate every scene as his been known to do in the past so the load of quips and funnies is shared mostly evenly between our rag tag group.<br/><br/>Regardless of what one was to say about Age of Ultron its going to make Marvel and its parent companies a huge stash of money and as long as Marvel keeps producing Avenger films to this quality no one will begrudge them their success even though chinks in the previously untouchable armor are starting to show.

","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a great mix of dark and fun at the same time, but does this film deliver after the whole Phase 2 build up? Does it surpass the original and live up to all our expectations? Sadly, we didn't get much of that<br/><br/>Before I start, I'd like to mention how hype does affect how a movie is viewed. AoU is clearly an extremely hyped film and must audiences expect it to even surpass the original. If the film does not deliver as expected then the film would considerably be underwhelming. In my own case I viewed the film to be exactly like that, I realized how my hype and expectations practically ruined most of the film for me as it didn't deliver as much. A second viewing might possibly do justice but it still left a mixed taste.<br/><br/>The Avengers are back and they now live and work together at the Avengers Tower. Right off the bat the opening shots of the Avengers fighting their way into Sokovia was brilliant and had a comic book feel to it. The whole movie had a huge comic book feel and spectacular visuals to accompany it. The movie also has a rather fast pacing and some things felt a little bit too rushed like Ultron suddenly becoming this strange and menacing villain within a few minutes. Speaking of Ultron, James Spader did a wonderful performance and Ultron and he strikes intimidation and personality that sets him different from other Marvel villains. My only issue with him as the villain is how he felt quite underdeveloped and kind of felt like his plot was just another generic villain plan, global destruction, their extinction, etc. The Avengers as individuals were developed really well in this film and characters like Hawkeye was more likable and notable in this film. Newcomers like Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and Vision were excellent as well in their own parts. I particularly liked how the each Avengers were given a moment for themselves and how they all just break loose and see how they eventually team up again. I also liked how the Avengers would focus more on saving people rather than just causing massive destruction and not care about the people who are going to be affected by it (we're looking at you Man of Steel). There were some great back story thrown in the movie that intrigues us more towards some characters, well done cinematography and different music themes that accompany an Avenger individually. It is also notable how we are introduced to many things that will turn out to be crucial in future films, like a glimpse of Civil War or maybe a glimpse of the upcoming Infinity War. <br/><br/>As for the flaws. Some action scenes felt really dense at times especially the action sequence with the Ultron army. Sure I give credit to the rest of the action sequences which were intense and exciting excluding the final battle with the Ultron army. It really felt dense how these other Ultron robots felt really and I mean really vulnerable and you don't feel threatened when they come to our heroes because they easily beat them down much like the Chitauri army in the first film. There were also some holes that should've been covered in this film especially with what happened in previous phase 2 films. Like what happened with Cap and Falcon on their quest to find Bucky? Instead we see them chilling at the Avengers tower and it's not even mentioned. There was also a lot of Deus Ex Machinas in this films and one that particularly irritated me the most near the end. There's also a surprising relationship that sparks between two unlikely Avengers especially previous films at least hadn't suggested it at the most part. As stated, the pace of this film became quite a problem for me, you think the movie has just gotten in to 30 minutes and then you check your watch to see that the film has already gone a full hour and it really feels underwhelming. <br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable popcorn flick movie to watch with your friends, it may feel underwhelming and contains several flaws but don't let the hype ruin the view of this film for you. If you will, a second viewing might simply do justice to it. +Comic Book Feel to it, +Ultron intimidating, +Development for our heroes, +Backstory, +Excellent and well handled newcomers, +Saving people, +Visuals, +Some great action sequences -Some dense action sequences -Fast pacing kind of ruins it, -Ultron feels quite underdeveloped, -Un suggested romance comes out of the blue, -Holes, -Deus Ex Machinas,<br/><br/>Verdict: 8.0/10"

","I could have guessed, that a piece created by joss Whedon would be the reason for me to give my first review. but I would have never ever guessed that it could be to give a bad review. the movie seemed to me like Whedon sold his soul to Michael Bay and Brett Ratner. the story was plain, boring and uninspired. I want a movie that produces tension. but sorry', CGI, explosions and fast pictures are no tension. the worst were the characters. just plain dull exchangeable action figures struggling with very bad dialogs just to lose all kind of individuality and depth that they build up before.<br/><br/>this movie is a great example that Hollywood forgot that a good movie tells a story and is not told be explosions. if someone like Whedon can fall on a Michael-Bay-like level of quality then there is no reason left for me to watch anything ever again in the cinema."

All the actors had awesome performances.<br/><br/>The romance that develops between Black Widow and Bruce Banner is very nice, I thought it was very believable and I'm glad Wheadon decided to do it. Hawkeye having a family was a nice gift to the character and really helped his personality.

I don't know why people say this plot is complicated I followed it pretty easily, Tony stark creates Ultron who goes rouge thinking humanity needs to be whiped out and the Avengers must stop him. It's implied Stark and Banner were working on Ultron for awhile from when they were talking before creating him.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was just as awesome as the last one and people need to stop having such high expectations or we may lose the MCU.

The appearance of many characters is dazzling, but they are still distinct. Jarvis and Vison are amazingly fit, and there are not many twins. The emotional drama of widow and Hulk is the softest moment. The existence of Ultron is slightly lower. Not fierce enough, the captain swears Thor Thor hammer joke throughout."

"terokun","6","2","3","15 June 2019"," Disappointing
","Its not bad by any means. The special effects definitely make a case that the budget was used accordingly, and the actors are all (mostly) good, but the writing kinda just sucks.<br/><br/>For a movie with less main characters than Avengers: Infinity War and Avengers: Endgame, it somehow feels more crowded, and the main villain Ultron is so boring. Ultron is just an evil version of Iron Man, but more one dimensional. He's not a killer robot hellbent on destroying the world with no emotion like the trailers and title suggested, he's just a goofball robot who fights the avengers, hes not interesting at all!<br/><br/>And quicksilver, the biggest disappointment of the movie. Quicksilver seriously cannot be called a character. His defining character traits are that hes a Russian dude and hes fast, and they're not really even character traits! Days of Future Past which came out a year before this movie has a way better Quicksilver by miles and miles. Why is he in this movie? He doesn't actually do anything? If you remove him from the plot, nothing major changes, and he doesn't affect any future movies at all! Quicksilver actually just bloats the already extremely crowded movie.<br/><br/>To clarify: the writing of the plot sucks in this movie. This movie has some good scenes and character interaction like the bar scene, but the general plot of the movie is so predictable and cliche, it took no risks and after a while it becomes just boring, especially towards the end.<br/><br/>This movie overall is ok, its watchable on a first watch, but I would never rewatch this movie. If its your first time watching the Avengers movies, this one isn't terrible, but its far from the best unfortunately."

The screenplay is really good. The casting is incredible and so is the acting. The acting is incredible no one actor really stands out which is really good from a ensemble perspective. It is really cool to add to the ensemble by adding the voice of James Spader. All in all I would give this five out of a possible five stars."
"stephenabell","5","2","3","6 May 2017"," A Wasted Chance To Make An Awesome Film
","Oh, dear! What happened here! This had the possibility to be a great film with depth... so what does Joss Whedon give the audience - a formulaic action film lacking in characterisation and an awful lot of changes to origin stories and ongoing characters, which didn't make sense. It felt so forced into being something big and spectacular that only helped in hindering my enjoyment of the film and story.<br/><br/>Usually, I'd say that a movie is worth watching due to the story or the action but in this case, things don't seem to gel just right and the whole thing is messy and disjointed. This is definitely not the best in the Marvel Movie Universe... This is nearly on par with Iron Man 3 (another film which could have been awesome).<br/><br/>I was having doubts in the opening action sequence as some of the CGI is sloppy, giving the scene an untidiness. You can easily tell which sections are CGI'd. Thank God things get tidier as the film progresses.<br/><br/>Then there's Bruce Banner; a scientist with a clinical and logical mind who only wants to help people and would never hurt anyone... but suddenly is all too happy to let Stark activate an unknown AI though they know the dangers involved. This goes against the core nature of Banner but Whedon doesn't care. What would've been more in character would be Stark being his usual egotistical self and activating the AI on his own accord, only for Banner to find out and come in to keep an eye on things so nothing goes wrong, being too late to stop Stark It's such a little thing, but the devil's in the details<br/><br/>When Ultron finally appears, nicely voiced by James Spader - though a little more creepiness and menace was needed (The ""I have no strings"" vocal is actually more menacing in the trailer than in the movie scene), you think okay here we go, but it's over too quickly and feels more like a damp squid than impending doom and throws the pace of. In fact, there's a lot of stops and starts in the pace of this film, I'm not sure if that was Whedon's intention but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Even the one-liner quips between the team were lacking in humour and feel thrown in to lighten the sequence and entertain. The trouble being if it feels thrown in it loses its power and the feeling of reality the filmmaker is trying to create. Once that happens then the viewer breaks away from the film and it's not as entertaining for them.<br/><br/>Two-thirds of the way through I'd pretty much given up on the film but decided to stay for the ground shaking final fight scene. Which wasn't really too special as it was just loads of Ultron's minions fighting on his behalf (though he had previously stated that they were all him). The thing is if Ultron was such a Bad Ass and believed himself superior to humans and the Avengers then he should have taken them on one on one, as they were helping the stranded people to leave. Then when he does attack he lets his drones do it for him and you have an epic battle with epic music, which doesn't feel so epic, then it only takes four Avengers to dispatch Ultron in... less than a minute! What a baddie!... another damp squid.<br/><br/>Hey, maybe that should have been the title - Avengers: Age Of The Damp Squid!<br/><br/>As I said in the review for Guardians Of The Galaxy, Marvel are in serious danger of stereotyping themselves and following a specific formula, which is even more evident in this film than in that one. This could be the slippery slope to failure if they don't beware.<br/><br/>If you've liked the previous films in the Marvel Movie Universe then you may be able to get through this one, though I wouldn't recommend watching it as a stand alone film since there are better offerings out there. If you're a fanboy of the comics then it's probably best to stay well clear of this film, especially if you don't appreciate new interpretations as this isn't a good one. This movie could be a turning point for fans."

","Tony Stark has only a couple of days access to Loki's staff, newly recovered by the Avengers in a sweep of Hydra lairs, before Thor returns it to Asgard. He is keen to incorporate the advanced technology in the staff's power source into his global protection system, Ultron. But something goes very wrong as it turns out that Ultron is both self-aware and malevolent, and assisted by a pair of twins with unusual talents. It's time for the team to regroup.<br/><br/>As Marvel adds each new film, it becomes increasingly apparent that, just like the comics on which they are based, one long, ongoing story is being told. In Avengers 2, we see payoffs and further developments from things which were seeded in earlier films (by which I mean the entire Marvel cinematic universe), and which look to payoff in the future.<br/><br/>This film doesn't quite have the cocky swagger which its predecessor had, but that is perhaps because we are now very familiar with every member of the team, and how well they function as a team. The film is great fun, nevertheless. It is maybe missing moments like Hulk's rag doll Loki incident, but there are still a number of moments which had me drooling deliriously with delight, and I nearly wet myself during the first 5 minutes.<br/><br/>The new characters are great – Ultron is particularly well realised – and there are more returning characters than a Harry Potter film (well, not quite, but you know what I mean). I'm glad I managed to avoid the rumour mill, although I did catch the suggestion that a certain character might die. What can I say? Wars have casualties.<br/><br/>This is another very successful movie in the Marvel series – roll on Ant-Man!"
"tavm","9","10","28","5 May 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron was another awesome epic from Marvel Studios!
","Joss Whedon and Marvel Studios have done it again! That is, they made an awesome Avengers movie full of great action, good humor, and nice dramatics concerning characterization. Whedon, previously creator of such classic TV shows like Buffy the Vampire Slayer, Angel, and Firefly, is such an expert of mixing genres that it's easy to take him for granted now but he still has some surprises in how he still puts it all together. Like the fate of one of the superhero characters, for instance. It's so awesome seeing Captain America, Iron Man, Thor, Hawkeye, The Hulk, and the Black Widow fighting side-by-side once again saving the world! Oh, and yes, Stan Lee does another of his awesome cameos saying something he's famous for this time! So on that note, I definitely recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron!"
"ZuhayrRoha","7","1","1","28 June 2020"," The worst avengers movie but far from even a bad action film.
","Stark motivated by fear creates Ultron. The last living Hydra (until now) creates Wanda & Pietro using Loki's scepter. Nice follow up to previous storylines of solo films<br/><br/>The after party scene with Mjolnir is one of my favourites. This is the reason why I love MCU, the dialogues between the action sequence, character inactions, whips, callbacks. Watch NandovMovies video on this after party sequence.<br/><br/>The twins are great, Wanda is flawed with bad past (even more now) and Pietro's dead in my opinion was worth it, at last someone died for real. In real life people die without notice, not all people have a chance to fullfil everything. Its was great for Wanda's motivation moving forward.
And Clint naming his son, Natalian Pietro Barton was nice. If you have seen Endgame, Clint's Son name is cursed.<br/><br/>Captain America and Iron Man's fude continues, 'Everytime someone tries to win a war before it starts, innocent people die'. The bitterness was better in Avengers 1 but still Avengers 2 has some great lines, 'A suit of armour everywhere' , 'We would lose -- Then we would do that together too' and seeing this lines pop up again in Endgame was fantastic.<br/><br/>Thor has a side journey which I am not a fan, the slow discovery of infinity stones is great in the long run but it doesn't add anything to this movie in particular. Comparatively Wakanda's setup was better, as Ultron was also in the mix.<br/><br/>Black Widow and Banner has romantic interaction which I liked at first but now it feels forced as they didn't continue with it.<br/><br/>Ultron is just is another one of MCU's bad motivated villains, if they fleshed out the movitations more instead of weak subplots of Thor and Widow then it would have been better. James Spader voice is great, sometimes too comici. And sometimes thinking about how Ultron spends 5 minutes in the internet to decide to kill off humanity completely gets me cracking, it was good motivation but not fleshed out enough.<br/><br/>Nick Fury adds more humor to the mix and Burton's family makes this movies more humanly relatable-- They are litteral Gods, and I have a bow & arrow.<br/><br/>The ending is epic as a Avengers 3rd act should be, but Joss Wedons Avengers 1 was more well crafted. Hulkbuster Sequence was great sequence of entertainment. Movie could have much better, Loki was set up early, Thanos for 6 years but Ultron's set up & pay off was in the same film."

"jaovitu","9","1","1","7 April 2020"," Great critiques, one weak spot
","The second movie of the Avengers presents action with a lot of social/political critique. New heroes are shown and some open spots are left. All of this to create a well-constructed cinematography based on the great acting, special effects, direction and screenplay writing.
Different from the major of Marvel's movies, Avengers: Age of Ultron are constantly forcing the viewer to think about social/political questions centered on technology and union of people. This is a great advanced made by the production, because it compensates the all-action in the first Avengers and starts a new era for Marvel.
You will realize a lot of open spots on the plot, they are not screenplay's failure, they are proposital leaks to new advances in the Marvel's universe that will be resumed in posterior movies.
The only weak point on the work is the new hero. He is used as a key-point to the development and conclusion of the story, but he hasn't a great construction as character and break the rhythm of the plot, besides his adding to the reflections about society and humanity during the movie. Therefore, if he was substituted to explore more one of the heroes and the new piece of Marvel's universe, the movie will be 10/10."
"hooma814","6","1","1","3 April 2020"," The weakest avengers movie, but still good
","This movie is a bit hard to remember what even happened. A lot of it is quite forgettable. They story doesn't really get advanced at all for any of the characters apart from a general distrust for Tony Stark and the birth of Vision. Ultron was average. Just another bad guy who was always going to lose, no one really cares. This was just another chance for the Avengers crew to get together and film some 360 degree fight scene. You always knew that no one significant was going to get hurt. Iron man was always going to get hurt beyond belief and have all the gunshots come his way. But Captain America and Black Widow can go bullet free. The Avengers movies are always a chance to show the weakest links which are blatantly Hawk Eye and Black Widow. Both can be left out and it wouldn't make much difference to the overall fight. But the others really contribute to the overall strength of the Avengers.<br/><br/>This movie is still a good watch, but definitely the weakest out of the four Avengers movies."

The comedy was pretty good, except for a certain something they did with the comedy in this film. The action in this movie was very good, I had a really fun time with it.<br/><br/>Now the cons, I wanted ultron to be good, since the trailers showed us that he could be one of the best villains in film in history, well in my words, however I was wrong, what they did with Ultron is insulting to the character and its fans, Ultron was used as comedic relief, it didn't even look like they even tried to make him an actual villain, he was not menacing, he had no motivation, he was just really a bland and flat out boring character. Personally I am not a fan of the story, to me the story is just forgettable. There were times in this movie where certain parts were just thrown in there.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Age of Ultron is an entertaining movie, but it falls a part when it comes to Ultron, choices in the movie, and the story.

","This film is a perfect example of what happens when you're more focused on cramming in references and lead-ups to future films rather than having a cohesive narrative.<br/><br/>The Avengers return to take on one of Tony Stark's mistakes: a defence technology gone rogue, taking control of his Iron Man suits and becoming sentient. That's essentially the plot. Also shoehorned in is foreshadowing and allusions to future films such as Civil War, Black Panther, Infinity War and Thor: Ragnarok. Our heroes are caricatures of themselves here as very little character development is given for the majority of the film, save for a 'shock reveal' about Hawkeye.<br/><br/>We are also shown the most 'out-of-nowhere' romance between Black Widow and the Hulk, which really only exists for people to make fanfiction.<br/><br/>Ultron is shown less as an intimidating villain and more as a wise-cracking ass. Barely memorable and his evil plot was completely forgettable.<br/><br/>Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson make their debuts as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver respectively, but since Quicksilver was already done by Fox's X-Men, Taylor-Johnson's multi-movie contract was made kinda redundant.<br/><br/>The movie attempts to have character bonding scenes at the halfway point, but ultimately, it's just more foreshadowing. This film may have about as much depth as a kid's swimming pool but the visuals are certainly stunning. I think it was around this point where many people were succumbing to 'superhero fatigue', but it's definitely debatable.<br/><br/>A lackluster sequel to the first Avengers, and the resulting cause of Joss Whedon's departure from involvement in the MCU."
"ryanp-48552","6","1","1","26 June 2017"," Not nearly as good as the first.
","Age of Ultron is the sequel to ""The Avengers"". And I can assure you, that movie was a lot better. Age Of Ultron is not a good movie. Is it a bad movie? NO! Is it a good movie? NO! It is a disappointment, not even close to how good the first was, and a overrated excuse for a film! I will give a list of pros and cons.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/><br/>1. It is a competent enough movie. Almost all the cgi is good, the fight scenes are also usually good, and it doesn't feel rushed or anything. It is competent.<br/><br/>2. Hawkeye is made better. Hawkeye, the weakest character in the first one, is the only strong character in this one. I actually care about him now, he has development now, and his actor is good in this movie as well.<br/><br/>3. The first twenty minutes are good.<br/><br/>Cons:<br/><br/>1. Bad performances. All of the actors suck in this movie, with the exception of Hawkeye. The worst two by far are, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson. Both of their Russian accents are bad. Like really bad. My best German accent sounds more Russian than their Russian ones. <br/><br/>2. Aaron Taylor Johnson. Seriously the guy is a bad actor. He hasn't had a single good performance yet, and he probably never will. The guy is the worst part of every movie he is in. Seriously, I've seen better actors on Barney.<br/><br/>3. Ultron. Ultron is bad. You expect him to be a cold, brutal, intelligent villain. But he is like almost every other character in this movie. CRACKING A JOKE EVERY FEW MINUTES! Its horrible. Ultron was a disappointment.<br/><br/>4. The forced in love story. Black Widow and Hulk are horrible together. They weren't like this in the first movie, and in this one it is cheesy. AND IT FEELS FORCED!<br/><br/>5. The Final Fight: Boring and bland. The only thing they fought were robots. The only thing I was worrying about was Quicksilver and Ultron surviving. And thankfully, neither did.<br/><br/>Final Verdict:<br/><br/>6.3/10 (Above Average)<br/><br/>It is mediocre, and only slightly better than movies like Suicide Squad and Batman v Superman. Major disappointment, it should've been a 8/10 at the minimum. A movie I would recommend instead is, ""The Avengers""."

","The avengers, now running on their own, have to face yet another threat, Ulton, who wants to wipe out the man kind. There is something about the avenger films that makes them boring. There are enough action scenes, and some nice and funny dialogs, but the whole thing is tiring. The individual movies of each character are good enough, but the heroes working together comes through quite ugly. I did like that they present us with some of the past lives of some of the characters, but in the end, I found it a little too complicates, with long monologues, little humour, not to mention the twins, an entirely different story from the ones in x men. Maybe the second part was better than the first part, that was a huge disappointment, but all in all, avenger number two failed in every way. Better have them as individuals."
"ikrani","9","6","15","21 May 2015"," Why All This Hate I'm Seeing? Age of Ultron was GREAT!
","Let's get something straight: the first Avengers movie was not the pinnacle of geek fantasy that everyone seems to remember it was. It has issues with its pacing in the first act, Loki and the Ch'Taari never amount to more than an army for the Avengers to fight, and the entire climax was bloated and overlong with only three changes to the status quo: the portal opening, the nuke, and the portal closing. If anything, THIS movie elevates the Ch'Taari to something bigger than ""the bad guys"".<br/><br/>I think that everyone is starting to see those flaws in Age of Ultron, as the movie has those same flaws. But that doesn't mean Age of Ultron isn't a great film. So this will be less of a review and more a counter-argument to the most common complaints.<br/><br/>""There's a lack of character development"". Wrong. Hawkeye is made more interesting and 3-dimensional, Tony Stark has a revelation about how vulnerable the Earth is which puts his view of it and the cosmos into a whole new perspective, Black Widow's relationship with the Hulk is further developed, Widow's backstory is fleshed out more, and the Twins (who I don't think are ever referred to by their superhero names) go through an arc of their own (which I won't spoil). Besides, let's not forget that Tony's arc in the first movie basically amounted to going from, ""Uh, his first name is 'Agent'"" to ""His name was Phil"" and that Hawkeye didn't even get an arc.<br/><br/>""There are too many jokes."" It's a Marvel movie directed by Joss Whedon, what was everyone expecting? Nolan's schlock? When a scene wanted to be dramatic, it was dramatic. When a scene was supposed to be lighter, the characters made quips. No one made any jokes when they were defending the control rod from Ultron, or when they were debating over the possible nature of The Vision (you know, the red-faced blue-eyed guy from the trailers?).<br/><br/>""It's the same as the last one."" Actually, it's not. The first one was a big, dumb comic book movie that brought four different franchises together for a massive crossover, and the movie itself had little to do with its predecessors outside of one line from Nick Fury.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is also a big crossover, but with a villain who makes a lot of philosophical observations about the nature of existence and what he perceives to be the human race's stagnancy, thereby making him the good guy in his own eyes. The movie even starts where Cap 2: The Winter Soldier left off, with the whole Avengers team assembled to eradicate what's left of HYDRA. And Tony never said he was going anywhere at the end of Iron Man 3. Sheesh, you REALLY thought that Mr. Genius Billionaire Playboy Philanthropist was going to give up being a superhero with HIS ego?<br/><br/>Really, the only complaint I have with the film is James Spader's performance as Ultron. He could've been a lot funnier or a lot more threatening, and for some reason Joss decided to go halfway, leaving us with an Ultron who's definitely interesting and unsympathetic, but not very compelling in his own right. Ultron could've still been funny if his humor had been unintentional, and I could easily see all of his scenes being rewritten to keep the jokes without sacrificing his threat factor. Alas, twas not to be.<br/><br/>Besides, we all know Tom Kane would've OWNED Ultron, am I right?<br/><br/>There is a moment where both times I saw this movie in two different theaters I heard the entire audience collectively gasp, a moment which I dare not spoil because of how mind-blowing it is. Go see Age of Ultron so that you may experience that moment."

","The new Avengers movie is a worthy sequel to the first. It has great action, incredible visuals, compelling characters, and good humor. <br/><br/>The story/plot is one of the slight downfalls of this movie. The plot is there but it isn't strong or developed to it's full potential. It wasn't terrible, but it wasn't great either. One of the upsides though, is the constant humor. It is definitely a relief to have some humor in all the grittiness and darkness. The pacing is generally good but the beginning is just a tad slow. If you've seen previous Marvel movies then character development is just fine in this movie. If you're new to Marvel the character development will not seem so good. The chemistry between the Avengers felt natural and well developed. I also enjoyed seeing characters from other Marvel movies (War Machine, The Falcon) make an appearance in this movie.<br/><br/>This movie has some very talented cast members and they show their skills whether it's at humor, action, or interacting with others. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon did great with directing the first Avengers and he does another great job with the second. Even though he was exhausted by the end of making this movie, he still produced a fun action flick.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is insane. And it's where this movie is at its best. It's just a blast to watch especially the climatic scene at the end. I literally had goosebumps at times during the action. The visual effects are very impressive as well. From explosions and spaceships to flying superheroes and robots, it all looked great.<br/><br/>Some other highlights: Hawkeye being developed more. The Vision. War Machine. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. <br/><br/>In the end, the second Avengers movie is a worthy entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It had awesome action and visuals, cool characters, and good humor. Story and plot weren't the best but it didn't ruin the movie. I seriously doubted that this movie would live up to the first but I think it definitely did."

","Honestly, I loved the movie, it was extremely likable. But when I think about it, keeping my Avengers-biasness aside, the picture the movie ended up portraying was that every second person in a city has either some kind of a power or just by-chance has the skills to become a super-hero! Spoiler: Thus, when a certain character dies on the film, even though he/she was great, you end up feeling kind of glad instead of being depressed. You're glad that at least the percentage of a super-hero being a ""unique"" thing has increased a little again. But then there is a glimpse where a great number of super-heroes flood into the Avengers building, and one feels that all the big/famous super-heroes will retire after the new ones take charge. Yet another thing I didn't like about the movie was its inclination towards ""Love"", it is a science-flick and shouldn't revolve around love between two lovers! Lastly, Avengers is a series of movies that kids love to see as well, thus the women in the movie should have covered their breasts better, pregnant woman and a lot of kisses shouldn't be in a kid- movie either! In a bird's view, the Cinematography, the Action, the humour, tech, tension, etc., etc. make the movie an ultimate success and a Must- Watch, but it had its flaws and did ignore its main story in some places!"

"joeravioli","5","6","15","3 May 2015"," Age of Ultron is exciting, action-packed, and emotionally empty
","Comic book films are often clichéd in their innovativeness. They are all wildly different, but all feel strangely similar, in their clanking, brawny, save-the-world-from-a-terrible-villain cesspools of ideas and characters. The thing that sets a comic book movie apart is usually one scene, be it a scene that depicts beauty, emotion, or simply an unusually awesome use of the all-seeing camera. In Guardians of the Galaxy, we had the scene in which Groot sends a cascade of glowing spores into the air. In The Dark Knight, we had the unforgettable interrogation scene (among many others), where we were exposed to the visceral world of insanity. In Iron Man, we had the ""Tony Stark has a Heart"" motif. Without these moments, these comic book movies would be what they advertise themselves to be: Simple, sexist, and action packed to the point of insanity.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is that not-so-rare comic book movie with an intriguing setup, formidable villain, snarky humour, the optional dose of character drama, and women in tight clothing. It is well made and engaging, the camera-work is mostly seamless, the scene where Ultron is introduced is excellent, and there are a lot of fancy explosions. But Age of Ultron falls short of its better predecessors in a few keystone elements.<br/><br/>Firstly, it lacks a powerful scene. Most of the scenes are visually commanding, that is true, but there is no scene that makes the film memorable for its grasp of the human condition. There is the occasional goodbye, but these scenes did not inspire any sort of feeling whatsoever. I remained completely unmoved for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>Secondly, the final battle scene is not engaged enough. It keeps cutting away from the action to some random talking that no one cares about, not allowing the audience to immerse itself in the action that they paid for. <br/><br/>These elements notwithstanding, Age of Ultron is a good escapist film and James Spader's depiction of the robot Ultron is really darn cool."

","This is the kind of movie I had a lot of expectations. Unfortunately its worse than the first movie. Yes that's the truth. Don't get me wrong. Still a good movie. But honestly, for a fantasy movie, the visual effects in the beginning of the movie were terrible. Specially in the first fight scene, when hulk was touching hands with black widow, but the effects got a lot better during the movie. In the last fight scene where the avengers are all together united and fighting, the visual effects were pretty decent. The story also grew too fast. I will now talk about what I consider to be the strenghts of the movie: The slow motion scenes during the fights, and the humor. I saw myself laughing when Iron Man was beating Hulk's face and saying ""Sleep sleep sleep"", and also laughed when Quicksilver fires a gun to make people get out of the building. Another strenght is the ""story"" of rivalry created between Hawkeye and Quicksilver, with a little twist in the end of the movie that was a nice touch for the end of the movie. Overall, I can't give this movie an 8, because in my opinion doesn't exceed my expectations, and also is worse than the first one, like I said before."

","Another great Avengers film, but with a story that is both lacking in depth and reasoning, and a way it is told.<br/><br/>We have seen some very successful Marvel films, and all of these had a compelling story which is WELL told. Not so, unfortunately, with this title. Without going into too much detail in order not to spill the spoilers, lets mention:<br/><br/>a) AI goes bad for no reason, but ""just for the heck of it"". Argumentation on pair with ""The madness just happens"" ?<br/><br/>b) No causal reasoning (valid explanatory path) as to WHY it wants to destroy Stark, Avengers and/or the World. Kiddie play level.<br/><br/>c) Way too many Avenger and related characters, so that the main chars get lost from time to time and you ask yourself: ""What and where are they doing at this critical moment?"". No char gets therefore to build his/her role.<br/><br/>d) Story goes full broke after ALL Avengers get psychologically affected by PSI visions. Full stop & waste, no bailout or some unifying line. We watch them bail around and wonder, wonder...<br/><br/>============ <br/><br/>One understands the need to have pauses in between dynamic action. But it is a STORY that makes or breaks a film.. In between the Whedon ideas and the way the film is cut, the viewer is left without a meaningful plot."
"aledwilliamsmail","6","6","15","25 April 2015"," A Massive Improvement From The First One
","Going in to see this film I knew it was going to be something special. With Joss Whedon directing again and three new Avengers coming in to fight crime. There was no way this film was going to be a disaster.<br/><br/>Acting - 6/10<br/><br/>This movie has a bunch of extremely famous and well-known actors leading it, which means that the acting should be really good but unfortunately it isn't. I don't want to blame the actors themselves because in their solo movies they act extremely well. When the movie starts off the acting is almost on the same level as The Expendables acting, with cheesy one-liners that make you cringe constantly. Thankfully the acting does improve after the first scene has ended and the real story is about to begin. I think that it was either the directing or writing that caused this poor acting, so it's really hard to blame the actors themselves.<br/><br/>Writing - 6/10<br/><br/>There's nothing special in the writing just you'r usual poorly written Marvel superhero movie.<br/><br/>VFX - 8/10<br/><br/>The visual effects in this are nice to look at and obviously took a lot of work but there isn't anything ground breaking or spectacular in it. It closely resembles the visual effects of the Transformers which is disappointing because it reminded me of how terrible those movies were, but other than that they were great.<br/><br/>Characters - 9/10<br/><br/>The characters are extremely likable which has already been established in all of the other films and they don't really develop in this film at all which is disappointing. The film does however included probably the best villain in a Marvel film so far which is Ultron. Ultron is extremely menacing and if he was written properly he would have sent shivers down everybody's spines. The problem with Ultron is that Joss Whedon though that he should act goofy to add a comedic element which almost ruins his character all together and almost.... just almost stops him being as menacing as he is.<br/><br/>Story - 5/10<br/><br/>The story is extremely disappointing because guess what... the bad guy tries to blow up earth again!. Seriously they need to stop with this formula of blowing earth up, it's just plain boring. They even did exactly the same thing in the first Avengers!. <br/><br/>Overall - 8<br/><br/>A massive improvement from the first film but sadly isn't re- watchable. I recommend everyone to see it as it is a very fun fast- paced film that is enjoyable, but sadly doesn't have anything special added in. Go and watch it to make up you'r own opinion :)"
"andyreynolds-1","5","6","15","23 April 2015"," It's a video game
","My teenager daughters were insistent, we had to go and see the new Avengers film. I like spending time with the girls so off we went with our popcorn and drinks to enjoy a couple of hours away from reality.<br/><br/>Boy, were we a long way from reality. Here's an outline for you:<br/><br/>Opening sequence: Avengers fighting hordes of human soldiers. Break for act 1. Middle Sequence: Avengers fighting each other. Break for act 2. Act 3 and Final Sequence: Avengers fighting hordes of robots.<br/><br/>In summary, it's a video game.<br/><br/>If you enjoy shooting, smashing, bashing and destroying a seemingly never ending supply of bad guys (ie: every video game in history) you'll enjoy the film. I like video games but after a while they can get repetitive and boring..... can you see where I'm going with this?<br/><br/>There are some funny lines and an opportunity for each of the actors to emote for brief periods. Some better (Ruffalo, Johansson, Downey Jr) some not (Renner and Olsen) and some just shouldn't bother because it's embarrassing for him and us (Chris Hemsworth I'm looking at you mate).<br/><br/>The greatest enjoyment I took from the film was the bad guy voiced by James Spader. In fact he was so good as Ultron I found myself cheering for the robot to defeat the mostly wooden Avengers and rule our planet. Alas it was not to be be as the forces of good were too much for his army of warrior robots......set on video game easy level.<br/><br/>Having said all that, the kids (or as the producers would call them: ""The Target Audience"") loved the film and my wife enjoyed herself as well. As for me, I could have stayed home and played Xbox."
"jojodcr","5","6","15","23 April 2015"," Perfect way to start the summer of blockbusters...
","The good: The second installment of the Marvel franchise the Avengers starts off with a well choreographed action sequence. Lots of brilliant tracking shots that follow all the Avengers will setup to an action-packed film. Of course there's the great bits of comedy and one-liners that we have all grown to expect, and the cast is really showing how well they gel together. James Spader is absolutely brilliant as the voice of Ultron with his smooth delivery of lines, but more surprising how Joss Whedon let him have a bit of humanistic personality. Without giving anything away, the film filled my expectations thoroughly. <br/><br/>The bad: Completely disregarding the fact that I read the comics, the film was quite predictable, even for those who know nothing about Ultron. The pacing of the film kind of leads to a foreseeable narrative. I really enjoyed the casting choice for the twins, but I'll be completely honest, Evan Peter's portrayal of Quicksilver in Bryan Singer's X-Men was superior. Even at 141 minutes, I feel at times the story was rushed, and at times dragged on, but that's just being overly critical.<br/><br/>Overall, the film was a blast and met my every expectations. I can't imagine anybody feeling disappointed walking away from this one. Have your popcorn and beverage ready and get ready for the start of a promising summer at the cinema!"

","It's my (not so) first review since i just wrote it and it's just gone before i submit it. Actually, I was late for the first 10 minutes, but thank God i was there before the 'AVENGERS' appears on the screen. I think this film is great from the appearing of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch until Jarvis's oddly new body (and how worthy he is to be able to lifted the Mjölnir). Oh, and Thanos on post credit scene, again. I'm gonna start from how shocking and odd it is for Romanoff to be with Banner instead of Barton (and Barton has a family, it's sweet, BUT WHY). Also it's really exciting and not surprising that Nick Fury is there for the actual S.H.I.E.L.D. . I had this love-hate thing with how noisy Ultron is. Hate his attitude to the twins after they decided to do good and left him. I mean, why is he still kind he is a damn villain. And an A.I. . With feelings. Okay. Oh, and when he said he was about to destroy all of the mankind and the only thing left would be irons. HE LETS MAGNETO LIVE (I'm a big fan of x-men okay). Imagine if it happens and Magneto controls him and the other robots and everything since he's the only human left (ahh, Marvel universe). No. That would be terrible. I just love the connections. Alright. Thanks to Stark's (and Banner's big part on helping him, every time) secret project(s) for all these conflicts. Overall, this film is entertaining, I love the jokes. Especially when Dr. Cho is kind of attracted to Thor. Overall, this is a really entertaining movie to watch with everyone you fancy. 8.7 out of 10."

","One of the strengths of its' predecessor, ""The Avengers"", is how the makers managed to blend characters and action together, giving either excitement and emotional satisfaction. This time around, it is more ambitious than ever. So, does it work? Yes, it does.<br/><br/>Telling the plot would only spoil the experience. When I first watched the trailer, I knew nothing about it. All I know is there is a talking robot and mass destruction. Going in unprepared was totally the right choice that I made.<br/><br/>All I'm going to say is this; A:AOU is going to be one of the best movies in 2015. From the exciting opening to the thrilling finale, this bad boy will leave you breathless. Talking about breathless, the action was spectacular. It is on par with the first one. <br/><br/>The star-studded casts are amazing, as always. What I admire most is the screenplay. It makes the characters more... human. They are relatable than ever. The movie has some psychological depth that was not really fleshed out before. <br/><br/>Conclusion: It was a satisfying experience. Go watch it!"

The script was bad, the ""humor"" was lame comparing to the 1st one, the story was confusing and the villain was a not scary mess. Maybe because I am not comics expert I failed to understand parts of the story..but still I believe the plot was really weak. Endless sequences of long battles that I had no interest about.

"cognitron","6","5","12","1 June 2015"," Welp... It's an Avengers movie
","Avengers 2: Age of Ultron is a two-and-a-half-hour light and sound show with something resembling a plot. A lot of CGI robots get beat up, with no lasting effects on anything. Black Widow and Hulk have been ordered by the screenwriter to have a relationship, and they dutifully comply. Alan Shore from Boston Legal has robot lips and says a bunch of awful one-liners. Actually, everybody says a bunch of awful one-liners. Teamwork is the only way to save the day from whatever, and even though they've all been through this before, they decide to stop working as a team, in order to keep the movie going. Iron Man and the Hulk punch each other forever in a CGI sequence that could have been over in two minutes for all the effect it has on the plot. An establishing shot of the previous shot's location happens about halfway through the movie to allow for commercial breaks, just in case cable still exists by the time this movie leaves theaters.<br/><br/>As a light-and-sound show, Avengers 2: Age of Ultron is acceptable. I did not feel too bored looking at the screen for two and a half hours, and sometimes, I would see something on the screen that will probably make a pretty cool toy for someone who is into that. Me, I'd spend that money watching Fury Road again instead."
"jackbanister16","6","5","12","21 May 2015"," Underwhelming
","This movie could have been really cool. <br/><br/>Ultron is a very cool concept and while he was well animated, he never really gave off that world ending, freaky vibe that you would hope for... <br/><br/>There wasn't much of a back story with Ultron, it was kind of just like... ""Hey, here's Jarvis' competition..."" <br/><br/>The camaraderie, difficulties, and chemistry between the Avengers did not flow as well as the first film. <br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. was as characterless in this film as he was in Iron Man 3 (spoiler alert, that movie stunk). He just does not seem to be into the character at all anymore...Also, what is it? Is he retired or is he not? IDK. RDJ stopped being a good Iron Man after Iron Man 1 IMO.<br/><br/>Thor, who had one of the better standalone movies of the Avengers, was given very minimal dialogue and screen time. <br/><br/>Way too much time was put into a completely RANDOM romance between Bruce Banner and Black Widow... It came somewhat out of nowhere and didn't add much to the story. <br/><br/>Fight scenes were entertaining but TOO frequent and too CGI'd. There comes a point where you just accept that you are watching a video game and you kind of ""tune out."" <br/><br/>Overall the movie is a bland mix of action, humor, and some of our favorite characters. This movie is following the Guardians of the Galaxy trend which is losing steam. Marvel is really losing it."

","First off I need to clarify: I did like the film overall. That being said it is very uneven. Aall of the scenes related to the 'main' plot involving Ultron, Strucker, The Maximoffs etc. were fine, no problem there. The problems arrive in the completely unnecessary and very tacked on sub-plots. A subplot involving a very poorly written romance between Hulk and Black widow that feels like it was written by a completely different author than the rest of the movie, and a bizarre subplot about Hawkeye not being there for his family and constantly alluding to remodeling his house? I'm sorry I just don't understand why either of these subplots were included except maybe to pad out the running time, or because people complained about Black Widow's and Hawkeye's seeming ""unimportance"" in the first film. So overall a good flick, but the uneven nature prevents me from truly recommending it."

I can still maintain it the first quarter of the movie, seeing the heroes dying in the mind of Tony Stark, muscle vs mind, OK. But then the expectation diminished, it becomes The Expendables, only with more power human and god, and better weapon of course. The plot is predictable with plain story, almost fell asleep in the middle! The Ultron idea is brilliant, but then it is a repetition of the first movie, exactly the same way. I was hoping they can dig down this artificial intelligent character, once again, the hope was raised in the beginning when Ultron found his consciousness and question himself, but after that...it's just another comic story, if he got the mind from Stark, why he's really against him, with his complication and intelligence, why choose the way and recreate the world, does it have to be like that all the time? I'm fine with whatever the end result is, just need more reasoning. However, this movie adds some human touches, and I kinda love it, the""normal"" family of Hawkeye, romance between Hulk and Black Widow, the testosterone fight between Thor and Tony comparing their partners, funny yet resemble to us, the not so strong nor intelligent human being :))"
"ferguson-6","7","5","12","17 May 2015"," No Strings on Me
","Greetings again from the darkness. Joss Whedon returns as writer/director for the sequel to his 2012 blockbuster The Avengers, and this time he juggles an exceptionally large and talented group of characters and actors who are not only involved in good versus evil, but also in the battle for screen time.<br/><br/>There is no shortage of write-ups from film critics and fanboys who have analyzed every aspect of the movie from every possible angle, and while I admit to taking that same approach to most movies, there is something about the Marvel movies that cause me to flip off the film critic part of my brain and just sit back and enjoy. And enjoy I do. The characters are fun and interesting and the action is at time breath-taking.<br/><br/>Since there are, by my count, at least 23 actors who deserve mention, it makes little sense for me to list them here. It is worth noting that the key actors all reprise their roles as Avengers, and many of those in supporting roles are back as well. This time there are also many significant newcomers, and those include ""The Twins"" – Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch. Other newbies include Linda Cardellini (""Mad Men"","" Bloodline"") as Hawkeye's wife, Claudia Kim as Dr Helen Cho, Thomas Kretschmann as Strucker, and Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. Though each is a nice addition, it's the stellar voice work of James Spader as Ultron that really makes this movie click. Somehow Mr. Spader manages to convey a powerful presence despite maintaining a (mostly) even keel throughout. It's masterful voice acting.<br/><br/>Missing this time out are Pepper Potts and Loki, though we hardly notice thanks to the first look at Vision (Paul Bettany) and Thanos (Josh Brolin)  plus the unveiling of Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor. If you thought the first Avengers movie made it difficult to keep up with the characters, this one will have your head spinning. It's probably the only quibble I have with it  character overload at the expense of character development. The Hawkeye family farm represents a meager attempt to have this group of superheroes set in a ""normal"" environment, but it just doesn't quite work. The Avengers are at their best while snipping at each other or saving the planet  fortunately the movie offers plenty of the latter."

"davideo-2","7","5","12","12 May 2015"," Somewhat over-whelming, but still a pretty spectacular ride
","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning <br/><br/>Opening in the action, the Avengers have been sent to rescue some people from a mad doctor in the Alps, who wants to experiment on them. Among them are a brother and sister pair, who possess special powers of their own, but who hold a grudge against Tony Stark, as they remember seeing a weapon made by his company lying in the rubble, after their parents were killed in the war torn country they are from. But after the mission's success, Stark becomes the spanner in the works again, when he talks fellow scientist Bruce Banner in to meddling with nature and opening the peacekeeping program Ultron to secure harmony in the world. Big mistake, as Ultron forms a life of it's own, and decides to try and wipe out the human race and replace it with his own kind.<br/><br/>Having unthinkably missed the original Avengers spectacle on the big screen three years ago, no way was I going to miss Joss Whedon's inevitable sequel, which promised to be bigger, badder and balsier than the last one, as they always do. This may be the case, but it hardly makes it better, as such. And, as grand and outside the box as it may be, that is the case. The follow up, like it's main antagonist Stark, is a victim of it's own blind ambition, a relentless, none stop roller coaster ride that bombards you with flash all the way to the end, and just leaves you over-whelmed. With Stark being the main character, and Robert Downey Jr. being the biggest star, it falls to reason that most of the attention falls on them, with even the publicity before the film's release (notably Jr's unfortunate walk-out interview with Tristram Guru Murphy or whatever his name is) maybe tying in with the hype.<br/><br/>At nearly three hours, the film is just too over-loaded and over ambitious, getting carried away with itself and just leaving the viewer feeling deflated by the end as a result. It would be one thing if there were some exciting bits throughout, but there's too many long stretches where nothing exciting happens that make it even more too much. Going on this long, it stands to reason that too much must be going on with the plot, which just gets a little over-complicated and at times none coherent.<br/><br/>Like the predecessor, however, it wisely keeps it's tongue in it's cheek, and the gang (especially, as ever, Stark) are always at their wise cracking best, it's still a dazzlingly colourful spectacle with, at times, jaw dropping action and visual effects and, again, it works better with them all as one than as separate entities on their own. The original, however, wisely kept it all at an endurable running time, so you could appreciate these qualities more, while this follow up goes overboard and, for all it's strengths, is just a little too much as a result. ***"

I could tell what was coming next. If you've seen the trailers, you pretty much can guess what's going to happen next. <br/><br/>Maybe the main problem was that there were too many times when I felt like the writers were trying to force me to care something for the characters.

"d-brinnon","8","5","12","10 May 2015"," Not without flaw
","If you're asking whether or not you should see this movie, the answer depends on a couple factors. If you're already in the thick of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), then definitely. If you're a fan of the comics but have yet to indulge in any of the cinematic presentations, sure. If you're unfamiliar with the comics or the previous movies, possibly not - mostly because the movie makes it very clear that a majority of the characters involved are well established.<br/><br/>AoU's three biggest flaws - in my opinion - are lack of accessibility for newbies, lack of character development (particularly for the new additions), and a clear choice of style over substance. However, there is still plenty of heart, quotes galore, great humor, and tantalizing visuals. So, if you're familiar with the MCU, this movie is definitely worth the cost of admission.<br/><br/>And Hulk versus Hulk Buster."
"boss-981-447297","7","5","12","10 May 2015"," Great popcorn blockbuster production, but it stops there
","As usual, Marvel has nailed it. Age of Ultron is a great popcorn blockbuster production.<br/><br/>I won't go into the same reviews everybody already wrote: yes, same characters going crazier. Same witty dialogue up a notch. James Spader is a fantastic villain and a great choice for Ultron. The new comers are quite good, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Vision, were good enough.<br/><br/>All that having being said. This was supposed to be the ending for the MCU's Phase 2. At that phase, Tony Stark should have retired from the Iron Man mantle (as of the horrible Iron Man 3 showed). Thor should've been retired and living with Jane Foster (as of the reasonable Thor 2 Dark World).<br/><br/>Captain America 2 retired SHIELD, but if you've been following the Agents of SHIELD TV Series you already know they've been rebuilding it. The intersection with the TV show and the movie was quite abrupt in my opinion and felt rushed.<br/><br/>At least the TV is showing developments towards the Inhumans for Phase 3. Captain America 3 Civil War will be Avengers 2.5. The lack of any mention to the upcoming Scott Lang's Antman was a huge missing opportunity. <br/><br/>The major problem with Age of Ultron is that it picked up where Avengers, Winter Soldier and Agents of SHIELD left off and ignored Iron Man 3, Thor 2. The MCU was supposed to be one concise and coherent universe. But the more they deliver new movies, the bigger the gaps.<br/><br/>Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy were by far the best thing about Phase 2 thus far and Age of Ultron was unable to top it. And this is what makes this super highly anticipated movie fall short.<br/><br/>Production value was really high and I enjoyed watching it in the theater and I will enjoy watching it again on Blu Ray. But it did not make any real impact to kick off Phase 3. It seems more like Civil War will be more meaningful to the MCU.<br/><br/>The MCU mythos is getting convoluted too fast. Too many gaps are not being addressed. It's already very difficult to explain the story to newcomers. Each big Phase should have some closure as an arc, but it's not helping. With sideshows such as Daredevil and Agent Carter, it only adds to the bloat. Unless Civil War can do something about it, the MCU will lose a lot of steam in Phase 3 and Infinity Wars will be too little too late in the future.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron felt just like a throw away story. Don't get me wrong: it's a very nice blockbuster for sure, but it's not what it was supposed to be."

","Writer/Director Joss Whedon received so much negative feedback from this film, that he actually deactivated his Twitter, but I can't understand why. It's not that Age of Ultron was a bad film, in fact there were many parts of it that were very impressive, but what bothered people was how Age of Ultron wasn't geared toward general audiences. In the first film, even if you'd never seen a Marvel film, you could follow the story and enjoy it, but that's not the case with the sequel. Age of Ultron is aimed more at the comic-con crowd and parts of it were very confusing to those of us who aren't familiar with the comics that the film is based on. There are a lot of new characters and new technologies introduced in this film, without any kind of background information given, and as the film progresses, it did become confusing. The story begins with the Avengers as a separate faction from Shield, centering on Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) and David Banner (Mark Ruffalo) working to develop a new type of artificial intelligence. The pair believe that if they can create this intelligence, everyone can retire and won't have to fight anymore. As always there is a problem though, as the A.I., known as Ultron, comes to life and fails to see the distinction between saving humanity and destroying the planet for the protection of humanity. The film then becomes a race for the clock as the mighty Avengers try to stop Ultron from destroying the planet. We all know that sequels aren't as good as the original, because the creators change things too much and Age of Ultron is no exception. The story isn't even close to as strong as the first film, but that doesn't mean it wasn't good. The special effects are even better and the chemistry between the large cast is much more important then it had been previously. These things set the foundation for a better film, but the story fails to deliver. The Avengers is a monumental undertaking for cinema, with so many well known actors and characters trying to come together as one. The idea is ingenious and the technology behind the whole thing is nothing short of magic, but as far as films go, while I loved the first one, I could have done without Age of Ultron."

","I was honestly disappointed by this movie. It felt like a mediocre filler-in and it utterly lacked taste and the emotional picture and innate development present in the first Iron ""Men"", where Tony was captured for so long in a cave and came back a changed man; in the first Captain America, which took us back in time to the late 1930s and early 1940s and something was lost (love) that could never again be regained due to the time parting them; and in Guardians of the Galaxy, with the death of the mother and the intrigue of who's his father.<br/><br/>This movie (and so it seems from the trailer of Ant Man) was emotionally devoid, though with mediocre to good jokes (the hammer lifting-thing). What I and hopefully many other fans seem to be hoping for is something deeper than hour-long suspense, empty talk of freedom, and protection of Earth - for what is there to protect if nobody feels? What is there to be screaming about if the spark is missing? We need something where the people of the Earth are no longer the innocent and helpless children waiting to be saved by the Avengers as now portrayed, but grassroots, which aid one another and the Avengers by cooperation. We need that silent shot of the ravaging nature of war and destruction; and the deafening picture of the mother sacrificing her life for her child. There's no saving everyone, and it's about time that Marvel and the Avengers learn this cruel fact of life because in turn this movie franchise will turn into a mere farce.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a superhero movie, but it lacks the subtlety, reality and naturalness that evoke the truly good movies (Finding Nemo is a great example)."

"kilo41888","7","5","12","4 May 2015"," Amazing scenes but felt that story was lacking. *SPOILERS*
","I felt that this avengers movie surpassed all others in terms of action and graphics but was lacking on the story delivery and content. Ultrons development was skimmed over far too much. There was no talk about how all the avengers came together again, they were just there. There was very little focus on scarlet witch and quicksilver getting their powers. It did show a closer side to the Avengers and their personal relationships and lives. I felt this brought a better connection between the viewer and the characters. Some of the jokes were cheesy but it also had some very funny lines that had the theater cracking up! I would say that this movie is better for the viewer who knows the comic books and the Avengers story line. Due to the new characters and many parts to the story, it is hard to follow with everything."
"leoiscooler","7","5","12","4 May 2015"," Not what I wanted it to be
","Well... This movie has been hyped ever since the end of the first one and that is probably why it didn't live up to it. To start off, I want to state that I am a huge fan of the marvel universe and comics themselves. That being said, this movie as a marvel movie, did not deliver even more so. If you don't read the comics and know nothing besides what has been in the other movies, then this is a much better movie. However, as a marvel movie, one that has had amazing movies surpass the last and fantastic sequels thus far, Avengers fell short.<br/><br/>All previous movies in the marvel universe had stories to tell (not to mention loads of easter eggs) this movie not so much. It had SOME easter eggs but only the superfan would really notice. As for the story, the main villain is Ultron, who in my opinion, did NOT seem threatening. The point of the movie is to save the world right? Ultron seemed much more like a comic relief than a villain. He didn't do anything to make me think the world even was in peril! His lackies did most of the 'bad' stuff.<br/><br/>The main thing that worked against the movie however was that it wasn't an Avengers movie! It was all a big 'look what's coming next' movie. This movie spent more time prepping everyone for Thor 3, Captain America 3, the infinity war movies, Black Panther... it took a while for it to really get kicked off as its own movie.<br/><br/>Now that the things I thought were bad are out of the way, it had many good things to it. For one, it's LOADED with awesome action sequences with so many stars! With emphasis on 'so many'... I think they did a great job distributing an equal amount of screen time to all those actors. What else was good? ...that's about it. Action, big names, and the Marvel name. This was a super anticipated movie and so much hype wasn't met. Hopefully, the upcoming movies will be better than this sequel."

","*Spoilers<br/><br/>The Avengers return for a two and a half hour movie that runs in a circle and ends up right where it began. The Avengers have managed to track down the staff that Loki was given to defeat them in the first Avengers and are ready to celebrate. Before the celebration Stark was given a vision by a genetically enhanced woman who most fans already know is Scarlet Witch. This vision makes Stark believe he must create a powerful AI that will protect the world from danger. Anyone that watches the trailers already knows that he ends up creating the enemy for this movie, Ultron. Now the Avengers must come together to defeat this rather undefined and obviously inhuman villain. He of course must have a nefarious plot though right? Of course he does. He wants to save the world by destroying it. The ultimate villain cliché. The movie runs along the same plot as the first Avengers as they are faced with one villain that is not very threatening against a team of heroes and some of the Avengers end up fighting one another. The villain is so useless and bad in this movie that he helps create another Avenger and convinces two more people to join the Avengers on top of the one he creates. The Avengers fight an army of CGI robots that are easily destroyed until they are finally able to win the day. Everything is now back to exactly where it was before the movie began. Circle complete. <br/><br/>There are some moments in this movie in which character development is attempted, but every moment is pure torture. Someone's boring family, forced chemistry that is just not there, and characters letting themselves be manipulated by dream sequences they know were brought on by someone. They know they are being manipulated yet they act as if they aren't with exception of Captain America because his sequence was just dumb. Captain didn't even think twice about it because it had no relevance. The humor is funny at times and cringeworthy at others. It is a CGI fest throughout. You will forget this movie and watch the next one."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron was a great sequel and a great addition to the Marvel movies. There seemed to be a good balance between action scenes and getting to know the characters on a more personal level. I thought it was interesting to see Black Widow and Bruce Banner ""toe the line,"" if you would, on a personal relationship and professional one. I also like the way she was able to calm The Hulk down when his services were no longer needed. I don't want to sound sappy, but I'd like to see if their relationship goes further in the next movie, assuming that The Hulk is just MIA at the movie's end, nothing more. It's too bad that the X-men and Fantastic Four movies are produced by 20th Century Fox, and Spiderman is through Columbia. It'd be great to see all three series cross over. Maybe since Disney owns all the Marvel characters we'll see one."

"namob-43673","5","5","12","3 May 2015"," Entertaining and fun, but could be better
","Age of Ultron is an average movie, however it is very entertaining and fun. I hold Captain America winter soldier as the best Marvel movie this far and Age of Ultron is a fair bit behind, but I see it as a necessity for future movies - the movie is sort of setting up the pieces for the future and seen from the perspective the score should perhaps be higher.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron should probably be seen after you watched Agents of Shield episode 19, season 2, especially for the nerdy types like myself that love the Marvel universe as a whole. The TV-show is however better then this movie so if you want a choice, watch AoS instead of this. <br/><br/>The problem with this movie as I see it is that I never really see the Avangers in any real danger. From the start to the end I almost knew what would happen and I feel like they underplayed both the twins and Hulk. Especially the twins and their background are just skipped over, hopefully the Scarlet Witch will get a lot more screen time in the future. Also the acting is lacking slightly and the plot is week. <br/><br/>A good entertaining movie and well worth the ticket price and you should see it, for nothing else then to be in the loop for the franchise, but it does not have the wow-factor."
"stephenmonachello","7","5","12","2 May 2015"," Uneven
","Marvel's The Age of Ultron. The big superhero movie of the summer is a tad of a disappointment. I was not a fan of the first film as I felt that film was underwhelming and the ending was a complete copy of Transformers: Dark of The Moon, but unlike the first film the story does not flow evenly like the last film. The film felt like it was all over the place like you were watching random scenes thrown together. I truly believe they pushed for more constant eye candy then an actual coherent story. There are some things I really enjoyed. I liked Ultron the most. Ultron was an awesome villain in the film. Part of me was actually rooting for Ultron. Vision was awesome as well. His look was immaculate and he had a great screen presence. Both were strong characters and helped the film. I also liked how Quicksilver and The Scarlet Witch looked, but I hate how they altered their origin story and their accents were God awful. You could hear them struggling to keep the accent especially Olsen. Olsen sounded like she was going back and forth between sounding like an American and a Russian. <br/><br/>I also did not like the love story sub-plot between Black Widow and The Hulk. There was no build up to the romance between the two. Nothing was setup up in the previous films and they made the romance feel like it was just thrown together at the last second because they had no idea how to keep the audience's attention between the action scenes. There were times you could tell they were shortcut the story for 3D action. Overall I was disappointed like I was with the last Avengers film. I felt the same way when I left the theater. I truly believe the writers and director could not handle a big cast of superheroes unlike the X-Men films. I loved Captain America: Winter's Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy, But the Avengers have been disappointing. 6 out of 10."
"moviewizguy","6","5","12","2 May 2015"," In Whedon, without the Studio Controlling Him, We Trust
","Watching AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON can be summed up with the following words: entertaining, exhausting, and overstuffed. It's also one of the few summer action blockbusters that feels like it could have been better without all those incomprehensible, *forced* action scenes, in which the quiet character scenes between them are so much more memorable and interesting. With the numerous characters, even more so than the first, it's a miracle, then, that director Joss Whedon somehow manages to make the sequel coherent, balanced, and well paced. In the hands of a lesser director, the film could have been a disaster in more ways than one. Still, you can't help but feel Whedon going off a check list to satisfy fans of these superheroes, preventing the film to reach its potential (see: the cliffhanger ending setting up the inevitable sequel). Whedon takes some risks with this one, but overall, he plays it safe."
"Koodle0101","6","5","12","2 May 2015"," It's okay but does not live up to decent expectations.
","~~~!CONTAIN SPOILERS!~~~<br/><br/>Just to clarify that I'm not a comic fan by any means and I'm judging the movie strictly by what I believe should be done with the execution of the movie, and not with the storyline itself. <br/><br/>The movie starts off pretty good and then it shoots downhill pretty fast and stays stagnant for a good while. The middle of the movie is a bit slow and sometimes a bit boring. There's just a bunch of talking, most of which are actually pointless and not needed may I add, as well as quirky jokes that are sometimes weird and awkward. Overall I had about three good laughs throughout the whole movie (182 minuntes). <br/><br/>Aside from it not being as funny and a bit destructive in trying too hard to be funny, the action is slightly disappointing. One of the things I looked forward to the most was to see the Hulk in action. The Hulk almost got no screen time besides fighting Starks... his ally. You never see any Hulk vs. the enemy and you surely won't get any satisfying ""that's why you don't f*ck with the Hulk"" moments. Over half of the movie the hulk is in a tough love relationship with Black Widow and how they want to run off together... while the remainder of the time he is just jumping around in the background. The best thing shown about he Hulk was him jumping on to an aircraft and throwing Ultron off... which isn't shown either. <br/><br/>The movie did a good job at giving the rest of the Avengers screen time. Unfortunately for the green guy, it's mainly Bruce Banner this time around.<br/><br/>Ultron is also a dumb and poorly executed villain. Quite honestly... Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch is the true 'villain.' They pretty much did most of the work for Ultron in the beginning... AND they were pretty much the reason the Avengers won as well after they switched sides... The movie is pretty much carried and made possible only by Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch combined with the screen time of Ultron and the Avengers to give it the illusion that it's more about them.<br/><br/>Half way through the movie he was creating his 'perfect' body; combining his AI with a real body and the powerful gem taken from Loki's scepter. He put up two guards to protect him during the process. Two. Long story short the Avengers were able to take it from Ultron so he doesn't complete his plan. Later when he tried to kill billions of people by causing a giant explosion by dropping an entire city from the sky he had thousands of robot guards to help him this time. At least he learned. But he should have known this from the start with how smart he should have been.<br/><br/>I could write this out for hours but in summary it's a good but not great movie. There are too many random scenes with random lines that are completely unnecessary. Not enough Hulk time (excluding fighting Iron Man, really?). Ultron is a smart but dumb robot and is not really capable without the early help of Quicksilver and Scarlet, 'mutants' if you didn't know. <br/><br/>Pros: - Some good action. - A few good jokes.<br/><br/>Cons: - Weird romance between Bruce and Black Widow. - Not enough Hulk time. - Quirky jokes and lines that doesn't work. - Ultron is pathetic and doesn't really do much. - Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver made the whole movie possible. They 'caused' the problem, switched sides half way, and then help 'solve' the problem."
"ryanramsey","6","5","12","1 May 2015"," Good but not EPIC
","I believe if another 20 minutes was spent on story and character development, the movie would hit the mark, but it felt incomplete.<br/><br/>Without giving away the details, the story of Ultron's creation and endgame felt rushed, into him being nothing more than a computer virus. Also with the addition of the 'new avengers', their development for all but one was very poor, especially at the end and you ask yourself ""well who's that guy"".<br/><br/>Then there were things that were thrown in and not followed up on, like ""the lullaby"", and one members feeling of 'lesser worth'. If you are going to throw stuff in, why introduce it and not follow up on it?<br/><br/>This will undoubtedly be a hit, and its certainly worth the full price of admission, but with all the hype I expected something crisper."
"willcundallreview","8","5","12","29 April 2015"," A loud but very good super sequel
","Rating-8/10<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is a Marvel made sequel that ties up what we want from not only the first movie, but the entire cinematic universe under Marvel. Age of Ultron is a very good sequel and also one that improves upon It too with the people behind the scenes and on camera too all making a big improvement. It builds upon what we saw in the first movie and then improves it and opens up a whole new can of worms in which I am sure will feature heavily in future movies in the series and elsewhere.<br/><br/>The film is not only incredibly loud, but also just generally a big film and you really don't get too much bigger than this one. The fighting, the special effects and even the cast are just big, and with such a huge budget for a movie(around or just over $250 million) you can't really expect any less. As I mentioned the cast, well yes Thor is huge and the Hulkbut what I mean is we see so many new characters and people and even random extras, this is just hugely epic and one that doesn't shy from giving many people the spotlight.<br/><br/>On to the cast at acting now and they all come back well and one point that really sticks out is that no one character or actor stands out, they stand their ground and stick to it hard. The cast are stylish as ever and also even funnier with of course not only Robert Downey Jr as Tony Stark/Iron man cracking the jokes but also Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo and a surprisingly funny Don Cheadle who really works well with the rest of the avengers and makes you really chuckle quite a bit.<br/><br/>And now onto the funny bits, well to be fair there are too many to mention. This is truly typical Marvel comedy but probably or maybe possibly at that the funniest film by them and all credit goes to not only the actors but also Joss Whedon for creating and directing the great lines. Whedon is the true mastermind and blends the humour well with the more serious moments, and although it can seem a little too jumpy between each, it still pays off.<br/><br/>I will say this movie is slightly overly futuristic and can feel like the Sci-Fi meter is off the charts. It feels a bit random as we do expect though as lasers and incredibly big spaceships, weapons etc etc join the fight. Now yes you can say ""but they have superpowers, it isn't meant to be realistic"", but see the ships they use and you'll understand me. One thing to add is also that Whedon doesn't rely on bringing back the same old from the past movie which if they had been in, it would have been crazily over sci-fi and the effects would have gone haywire with every scenes seeming unbelievable at best.<br/><br/>Overall though the film is a fine movie and of course as said, very good indeed. It's an improvement and on that, I can't see many claiming the first Avengers was the best, Age of Ultron thoroughly steps up in many different areas. It ranks highly on the roster of Marvel films and with Marvel throwing out movies left right and centre, you can't help feel will this be remembered, but the answer is probably yes. Yes the Avengers really are at the epicentre of the Marvel cinematic universe and with all these phases that Marvel/Disney put together, this movie shows that the next phases and the next movies in this series can be very much looked forward too."
"KrazzyDJ","7","5","12","26 April 2015"," A little short of the first but a solid entertainer none-the-less
","In a way, it was inevitable. The massive expectations from the sequel to the $1.5 billion grossing and incredibly charming Avengers had shot up so high, the movie was bound to disappoint at some level. And at some level it does, though not to the extent that it can be called a grossly underwhelming disappointment as is being hailed by the media and professional critics. The movie does have its moments, it works for the most part, but just falls short of the first one. In the interest of North American viewers who get this flick a week after international viewers, I'll keep this review completely spoiler free while hoping that it doesn't feel too generic.<br/><br/>The movie's plot, no matter how well written, is pretty standard science-fiction stuff: A robot decides that eliminating humans is the best way to achieve worldwide peace and begins by hatching a scheme to start by eliminating humanities saviors first - The Avengers. That two of the Aveners themselves are responsible for its creation could make for an interesting face off between the creator and the creation. Except that it doesn't.<br/><br/>One of the complains I have with this one is that the dialogue didn't feel as sharp as the first one. In The Avengers, Tony Stark for instance had some amazing lines and so did Steve Rogers. And their banter, while pretty interesting, was entirely in character. Here, both characters seem to have lost their wit / charm. Now fans may justify this as a result of what these characters went through in their respective standalone films but I feel the writing has a lot to blame. Stark's dialogue during the Hulk v/s Hulkbuster fight sequence is an example; his lines are so bland and generic that Downey himself could have done better if he had simply improvised. <br/><br/>Something similar applies to the film's humor; while there were sequences of absolute hilarity amongst the characters in the first film, most of the humor falls flat in this one. All these minor squabbles could have been forgotten if the movie had a great plot. But with something like a robot out for human extinction ending in an equally generic save the city standoff make these flaws stand out even more.<br/><br/>Most movies with a mediocre plot manage to compensate for their shortcomings through some spectacular action sequences. This however, is not Age Of Ultron's strong point either. Most of the action is too heavily edited to be able to follow and the ones you can seem like they were designed by the visual effects crew on an ad hoc basis. And its about time Marvel did away with Brian Tyler and brought a different composer to the mix; the only good themes heard in Age Of Ultron are the ones lifted straight from Alan Silvestri's score in The Avengers and Danny Elfman's slightly modified version of Silvestri's Avengers Theme. Compared to the first one's score which was much more memorable, this one's rather forgetful. And despite a 140 minute runtime, a lot of sequences feel rushed. I guess this has to do with Whedon trying his best to give every character his due and should this movie have an extended edition, it would certainly be one to watch out for.<br/><br/>Now that all the negative stuff is out, here are some of the positives. First off is Ultron and Spader's terrific portrayal of the robotic psychopath (that voice) and Whedon's terrific treatment. Despite his rather clichéd mission, Spader and Whedon make Ultron sound utterly convincing and at times, logical when things are viewed from his perspective. He wants to eradicate humanity so its rather obvious to start with the ones who guard it - The Avengers. Also well done are some bits with Thor's hammer and the following which stand out.<br/><br/><ul><li>The party sequence. Thor's expression when Rogers tilts the hammer is priceless (Again, the music sucked; they should've kept the one in the trailers) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Vision. He's a welcome addition and his sequences are bound to spark fan debates </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The sequence with the city. Some pretty wondrous effects that had the audience gasping </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The mid-credits scene. Its tiny but pretty significant in terms of plot enhancement. And there is no post-credits scene </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hulk v/s Hulkbuster. Its good in parts, but not entirely</li></ul><br/><br/>When The Avengers came out back in 2012, the kind of shared universe cross-referencing was a novelty that made it an event. It was as close to comic books as movies could get in terms of continuity. With so many shared universes announced, it seems that this novelty factor has wore off resulting in Age Of Ultron a good movie but not a great one. It is certainly a treat that comic-book fans owe themselves and the comic-book audience has a lot to cheer for. For the casual moviegoer, this will just be another good movie. Regardless, critics be damned and tomato-meter scores aside, this is a movie you should not miss.<br/><br/>I'm heavily conflicted between scoring this with a 7.0 or a 7.5. I'll stick with a 7.0 for now and revisit the rating after subsequent re-viewings !!!<br/><br/>Overall Score: 7.0 / 10.0"
"thependragonscribe","8","5","12","26 April 2015"," Faults aside, Avengers: Age of Ultron progresses the MCU series further with its impeccable cast and a worthy foe.
","Summer 2015 kicks off with the annual Marvel tentpole, now in the form of the summer's most anticipated Avengers: Age of Ultron. It has been a roaring success for Marvel as they kicked off their ""cinematic universe"" with the release of 2008's Iron Man. And ever since its release, Marvel followed it up with outstanding follow-ups (Iron Man 3), successful stand-alones (Captain America: The Winter Soldier), a space opera (Guardians of the Galaxy), small-screen extensions (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) and, of course, a kick-ass crossover (Marvel's The Avengers) that breaks barriers in the superhero genre.<br/><br/>Now, it comes to this point if its follow-up can live up the standards of the original.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the movie begins where The Winter Soldier left off as the Avengers raid HYDRA's secret base to retrieve Loki's scepter. As Iron Man/Tony Stark discovers an artificial intelligence concealed inside the scepter, he and Bruce Banner/Hulk extracts it, then, when left, possesses an Iron Man armor and forms into the entity known as Ultron. With Ultron programmed to achieve peace by eradicating humanity, the Avengers must put behind their differences and stop the invulnerable foe.<br/><br/>At this point on, this is where The Avengers plot line takes a new direction on progressing the series, for better or worse. But its mitigated flaws are salvaged by the most important element of Marvel's crossover, its cast and characters.<br/><br/>What made the first Avengers worked is its touch on built-up characters and have their arcs intertwine with others. Director Joss Whedon, whom I consider as the master of ""team dynamics"", still blends the best he could to make this superhero team a team. And the team cast really packs the best.<br/><br/>Still, the main leads Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Hemwsorth as Thor, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk and Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America gave undeniable charm on their characters. Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow and Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton /Hawkeye provided more development at this stage. Add-ins Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch were very welcome. And supporting players from previous MCU movies, including Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine and Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon, intersected with little but well-meshed parts. <br/><br/>But the best performances came from the A.I. characters. The main antagonist Ultron, played by a conniving James Spader, was a huge treat to watch. The character did not feel anything resembling a robot bad guy, just a Machiavellian victim. Another treat to watch is the new Avenger Vision, played by Paul Bettany. His character here is a calm presence to the withering superhero team, and a fine addition of cool- looking characters.<br/><br/>Overall, the cast were able to top the original on their team chemistry, since a lot of development must be pushed from there. And the story and script was able to mesh their arcs in a right amount of balance.<br/><br/>But what good the story and script provided does not always work for its execution. Aesthetic-wise, Age of Ultron had little to complain but it never tops the original's. The action pieces were a so-so. The sequences were commendable for having an edge-to-the-seat scale. The slo-mo was used to awesome effect. And the whole thing was never tiresome.<br/><br/>However, the aesthetics were not without its fault. The editing was slightly shoddy and abrupt. The camera-work almost landed on Michael Bay level with its frantic execution. The special effects were kind of blatant, especially on the Hulk. And the color palette was a bit dim; I kind of expected that to happen since the MCU series has to progress to a darker stage, but for a fun crossover, it needs to be brighter. <br/><br/>Out of all this, I can say that there is a little to complain about the sequel. It is just its existence makes it feel standard and obligatory, like we know what we are getting. For that, it rightfully falls short from what the predecessor provided and took a new direction, for the better.<br/><br/>Fortunately, fans and viewers alike will forgive this, for the Marvel superhero universe expands further with this movie. Throughout, there may not be that much Easter eggs, but there are sights of foreshadowing taking place in its sequences (remember the country Wakanda, or Hawkeye's near-to-death gags). And note, there is indeed an awesome post-credits scene. <br/><br/>With this, you can be able to guess that the forces of Marvel and Joss Whedon was able to craft another awesome superhero crossover adventure. Avengers: Age of Ultron achieved what it intended to achieve. It was an awesome follow-up to the hit predecessor, placing stakes high, molding a script and having it blended to the still exciting bunch of cast and characters, and punctuating them with breathtaking action sequences, wielded by an awesome villain.<br/><br/>However, it felt out of ambition that it falls to the pit of ""obligatory"" and ""overstretched"". From style and substance, there are truly faults that surfaced but it was salvaged by Whedon's buoyancy for the superhero team. As the opening blockbuster for the summer, it really boosted a lot of confidence, not just for Marvel but, for the upcoming summer."
"lordamka","6","5","12","24 April 2015"," Overrated
","I saw this the day after its release, and I came out the cinema rather disappointed, as did my friends.<br/><br/>The Avengers once again went for the conventional and predictable plot of the villain destroying the world, and there were a lot of sub plots that I felt were boring an unnecessary, like Thor figuring out what his dream meant, and the romance between Bruce and Natasha which seemed forced. The opening sequence would have been good had the CGI not looked terrible, and I felt the film lacked character development especially for characters like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, and I felt Quicksilver's death wasn't made into the the emotional and motivating event it should be. Scarlett seemed to get over it literally in a day as she was smiling in the next scene ready to join the avengers, which is strange considering she hated them and her brother, the person she was obviously the closest to, had just died, so there should have been a scene explaining her thoughts. <br/><br/>Overall the film was fun but definitely not the best Marvel film to date, and I felt it could have been written a lot better as it didn't seem to know where it wanted to go and exactly what themes to explore, leading to the plot feeling scattered and slightly rushed."
"themadmovieman","7","5","12","23 April 2015"," Not as good as the first film, but still a solid action movie
","There's no way that this lives up to the first film - it doesn't have the fun factor nor the bright, optimistic feel of a team movie. Despite that, the general job of a sequel is to be a bit darker, and this does that very well, whilst there's still great action all the way through, and a pretty epic villain that makes it all very exciting too.<br/><br/>Let's just start with why this isn't as good as the first Avengers movie. There, you had the reluctant union of all of your favourite heroes, but it unfolds in a very optimistic way, as they all do unite and fight together despite their differences, whereas this film shows it all in a bit more of a staggered way. Sure, the Avengers are still together, but it doesn't feel as if there's that real camaraderie between them that made the first film so bright.<br/><br/>What's more is that this follow-up simply just isn't as fun as the first movie. That's partly down to its darker atmosphere and relatively more complex plot, however the main issue with this is that it's a little bit too slow. There are periods where it really ramps up and gets properly exciting, but too often is there a time when you want to check your watch, because in the dialogue scenes, you're not getting the in-depth look at the characters that made those parts of the first film so good too.<br/><br/>Despite all that, however, this is still a really strong action film. Right from the kick-off, you're thrown into an action battle, and, as with the various fight sequences throughout, it's really exciting to watch, thanks to the fantastic directing by Joss Whedon, and the brilliant camera work that makes the action here look so slick in comparison to a lot of the excessive shaky-cam nowadays.<br/><br/>Also, the story is a lot more complex than the first film. Whilst this does have a bit of an impact on the entertainment factor, because you've got to think and pause on occasion, it's still an impressively intelligent plot with believably high stakes that will no doubt keep you intrigued from start to finish.<br/><br/>Finally, Ultron, the villain, is brilliant. The visual effects used to create him are excellent throughout, the voice performance by James Spader is great, and the bad guy's role in the film in not just threatening the safety of Earth, but also having some deeper impacts on the heroes, was a really interesting story too.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm going to give this a 7, because it's not as much fun as The Avengers, and it is on occasion too slow and too dark, however for the most part, it's still an exciting action movie that Marvel fans won't be disappointed by."
"olivercation","8","5","12","23 April 2015"," Marvel deliver another high thrill action adventure while continuing to expand their universe and up the stakes.
","How can one film possibly survive under the weight of expectation placed on it by the world of comic book fans, Marvel devotees and critics looking for the chink in the Marvel armour. After seeing Avengers: Age Of Ultron, it looks like they have met the challenge with ease, the film taking everything people loved about the first film and ramping it up. More humour, more suspense and even a villain credible of their attention. Joss Whedon has delivered once more, commanding what is a potentially dangerous ship in the right direction once more. It will be interesting to see how the Russo brothers step into his shoes for Infinity War, but obviously there is a lot of ground to go before we reach those films. Lets talk about the movie at hand. <br/><br/>Age Of Ultron follows the story of Tony Stark's unwieldy artificial intelligence engine Ultron as it takes its program of peace and looks to cleanse the world of the Avengers. Into the mix we have new players Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver who are results of Hydra experimentation causing havoc with the Avengers unity and focus. We up the emotional stakes as Hawkeye's back story is developed, Black Widow and Hulk make googly eyes at each other and Captain America, Thor and Iron Man continue struggling with the power interplay between them. Ultron poses a severe threat as he takes the work Hydra and Stark Industries have done and wield it against his creators. What we have is a much more grounded film than the alien romps of the original Avengers, Thor: Dark World or Guardians Of The Galaxy and that bodes well for the film, allowing us to focus more on realistic action and the problematic questions of artificial intelligence and human self-destruction. <br/><br/>The action sequences run thick and fast, from the opening second we are dumped in a fire fight and there isn't a page in the script that goes by seemingly without a gun or explosion reminding us that this is an action film before anything else. Huge set pieces are intertwined with stand off battles, each shot in a style Marvel has attempted to tie through all its films, a focus on CGI mixed with real life stunts giving it a fantastical but gritty feel. Once more we have been given a 3D film that probably didn't need it, so if you aren't a fan of 3D, save your money and see it in 2D. Age Of Ultron ups the comedy stakes as well, playing on our established knowledge of the characters we have the leads delivering lines as they saunter or fly around, frequently descending the cinema into laughs and even applause at one point. The comedy works as a necessary counterpoint to the darker tone presented by the setting, destruction element and emotional grounding of the tension in the film. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age Of Ultron focuses the plot development more on those characters who haven't been developed in stand alone films which is important to not over-saturate the audience. We have Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye being fleshed out which is important as their more human struggles play well as the inhuman Ultron and godlike Iron Man, Captain America and Thor wax lyrical about ideas of peace and humanity above them. Mark Ruffalo and Scarlett Johannson deliver some chemistry not experienced in the Marvel universe before and it truly interests me how they will progress the story there. Newcomers Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson steal the show, their Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver stealing the show with both their impact on the plot but also their emotional drive and acting ability. The accents slip sometimes, but this is a superhero movie, suspend your disbelief. Linda Cardenelli and Andy Serkis provide depth with their cameos, each owning the screen in their various scenes. <br/><br/>The one shortfall in the characterisation of the film and plot is unfortunately Ultron himself. James Spader has done a wonderful job providing the voice and mannerisms for the hulking AI robot, but there is just something missing to my mind. Knowing the Avengers will be back on screen in a years time means there is very little tension to their safety at the hands of this supposed brainiac. His motivation is slightly glossed over, the assumption that the smartest computer program in the world given the objective of peace will instantly turn on its creator and even references themselves as evil is a bit much. In terms of damage, Scarlet Witch is a bigger threat to the world, Hulk caused more properly damage and every time Thor commands lightning you wonder why the film wasn't wrapped up in the first 20 minutes and they all went for a kebab. They have infused Ultron with the same sneaky humour as Loki but failed to provide the same cunning menace and brutality that made him so compelling. Lets not forget though that Ultron is just a pawn in the movement of the series towards a much bigger goal. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age Of Ultron is a delight on the screen, any comic book or action fan will revel in the constant fight scenes, wry humour and character development. The film acts as another springboard for the future of Marvel but will easily stand alone as one of its best films to date, stepping up from The Avengers and expanding the audiences knowledge of minor Avengers. At this point Marvel can do no wrong and can guarantee my patronage despite personal DC preferences. It will be interested to see if they can deliver gold with Ant Man, but even if they can't it is unlikely any film with take Avengers: Age Of Ultron's crown as blockbuster of 2015.<br/><br/>For more reviews visit www.highframereview.tumblr.com"
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","5","12","22 April 2015"," It's not Age of Ultron, it's Age of Reddington!...
","As seemingly one of the few who didn't think the first Avengers movie was all that, I didn't have my blinders on when seeing this movie. For those expecting BEST. MARVEL. MOVIE. EVER. - you're bound to be disappointed. All of them have had their flaws, some more prominent than others, what matters is whether the movie overcomes these/the good outweighs the not-so-good. I felt this sequel more or less succeeded in that respect. The Avengers' beginning was slow, but this one starts with a bang that includes *everyone*, seeing the team work as a well-oiled machine, and blows the first film's opening out of the water. <br/><br/>From the outset we're introduced to Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen (last seen playing husband and wife in Godzilla) as brother and sister, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff aka Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. As Maria Hill sums up ""he's fast and she's weird"" - more specifically, she can harness magic/engage in hypnosis and telekinesis. They prove an interesting addition (with Scarlet Witch coming out on top). Both actors make the most of their screen time. Taylor-Johnson fashions a more well-rounded character than the X-Men version, with depth and humour, while Olsen conveys SO much with simply a look and/or creepy smile. From the first pictures released of her screaming on her knees, I guessed the fate of one twin - and, sure enough, was proved right. Thankfully, the more interesting of the two endures. I hope for more of this intriguing character in the future. <br/><br/>My biggest gripe with The Avengers was Thor getting short shrift and everything being about Tony Snark. Both problems are still present, but more characters also means things are spread out more. This is both good/bad. The film's central conflict can still be attributed to 'All. About. Tony.', but some other characters do get a fair shake. Most notably Hawkeye, with Whedon making things up to him (for his rather lacking role first time around) by getting some solid character moments and introducing us to his family. I especially liked the dynamic between him, Pietro and Wanda, that develops from being enemies to allies. Cap and his shield-fu are in full force, as is his being the butt of a joke running through the movie, but overall he comes out pretty well. He's at least treated as the leader he deserves to be, he's the most human (a compliment) and Cap/Thor is the best team-up of the film (much better than secret info-keeping science bros, Tony and Bruce). <br/><br/>If you didn't get enough of her in Winter Soldier, ScarJo's Natasha (blessedly sporting her Avengers 'do once again and now outfitted in Tron-like get-up) has her backstory further delved into here, plus she and Ruffalo's Banner have a thing going on (which I felt the groundwork was clearly laid out for in the first film) that may upset some 'Clintasha' shippers, but the movies are a different beast to the comics...so deal with it. Hulk is still played mainly for laughs, and his battle with Tony in 'Hulkbuster' armour seemed like a side trip we didn't require/brought things to a halt, I felt (though at least Hulk received a decent pounding - shame Thor wasn't behind it). Speaking of, our poor God of Thunder disappears for long periods of time and it's clear Joss has his own personal issues with Thor/God/godlike characters (he gets a couple digs in). Nevertheless, Hemsworth works his charm and his ""Thor speak"" provides some of the film's best humour. Also humorous? Our resident big bad murder-bot, Ultron (The Blacklist's James Spader), who is menacing, though not without his morbidly amusing side (only thing absent is Red's signature fedora). When he's not waxing philosophical, he's busy not seeming to die. Ever. <br/><br/>There are cameos by certain characters from the different movies, but of course my favourite was Hayley Atwell's Peggy Carter (who just can't be more awesome - though Thor would argue ""Jane's better"" - which I at least agree with when comparing her to Pepper, who's thankfully absent). After just being a voice for many movies now, Paul Bettany finally gets to play a character in the flesh - namely Vision (looking like Robbie Williams from his 'Rock DJ' music video), who's introduced rather late in the game but still makes an impact. I feel the movie moves at a good steady pace, with various action sequences spread evenly throughout whilst taking moments to slow down and be more character focused (except for Thor, of course!). The action is top notch and direction ensures things are seldom boring (plus no one can slip dirty words/jokes past the censors like Joss can). The end credits, with what appear to be marble sculptures of the Avengers, are pretty awesome too. As long as the movie is, it could well have done with being a bit longer. Extended edition release on DVD, please?<br/><br/>Whedon had a nigh impossible task set before him - to create a sequel that not only lived up to the hype of the first, but surpassed it. While I'm sure there's those who'll nitpick and focus solely on its fault, I feel he's more or less succeeded in making not only a worthy sequel, but a better film than the first (though that's obviously up for debate). On the whole, I enjoyed this one more. The directors of Avengers: Infinity War - Parts 1 & 2 certainly have their work cut out for them."
"alwaysplanb","1","22","79","24 April 2015"," A bit disappointed
","First Things first. The movie is OK. Good Character Development, good story and good action. The hulkbuster fight scene is breathtaking, though I'm a bit disappointed that they almost released the entire scene before the release of the movie.<br/><br/>Now, things that were... let's say, a little bit less spectacular. The love story between Black Widow and Hulk seemed a bit forced. Not that the pair looked bad, but shall we say they don't get much on screen time to develop their chemistry; given in their last movie they were just team mates.<br/><br/>The final battlefield was less spectacular than the previous avenger or the winter soldier movie. And the humor element seemed missing.<br/><br/>The real gem in the movie is Ultron. A good villain who seeks peace. Just his meaning of peace is a bit twisted. In the last scene he asks Scarlet Witch to leave the castle or else she'll die. This shows his caring aspect a bit.<br/><br/>QUicksilver and Scarlet Witch were awesome in the final battle. Thor lacked any significant battle, and frankly I expected a little more from the team.<br/><br/>But it's just me. After setting the standards with the first Avengers Movie, maybe I expected a lot more than what the director could offer.<br/><br/>Instead of setting premise for the future movies, I would liked it to focus more on the present movie.<br/><br/>Oh.. well. I guess the future movie might be the real deal. Waiting for it."

","This film packed a punch! It has everything a Marvel film needs, the story arc was strong, the character development was good, The action sequences were phenomenal. I really did enjoy the fact that Marvel managed to keep the same actors from the first installment. The film had a different feel to it, Joss Whedon did very well introducing Earth's mightiest heroes into a darker path. It was also, interesting to add some new characters to the film. Introducing the Vision character was a bold move from Marvel, in my opinion you can not have Ultron without the Vision. My only issue with this sequel is the antagonist Ultron. I feel as if this character should have been more of a challenge for the Avengers but other than that I loved the film. I strongly recommend this film."
"yikanbu","1","16","54","23 May 2015"," The second most ridiculous movie after ""Transformers""
","I disliked the first ""Avengers"" movie quite much, but thought to myself ""well, this movie is not about the plot or the quality, it's about big explosions and interesting fighting scenes that you only get if you break the laws of nature"" I would not have watched it a second time, but then I saw that the sequel ""Age of Ultron"" received ratings from 4-5 stars from any source I'd seen so I gave it a chance. .... To quote ""Family Guy"": The last thing that got me THAT confused was ""Transformers 3"": ""Why do they still allow these guys to make movies???"" .... This movie is for children, not for adults or anything between! Eight year-olds might forget about the repetition, the redundance, the lack of anything a brain is made for. And that's OK! This movie has around the same amount of content as a Disney Channel production, when I was a child I loved the Disney Channel. But nobody would give a Disney Channel production a HIGHER rating than ""Interstellar"", ""Gravity"", ""Sweeney Todd"" or ""Ex Machina"" (and yes, also ""Avatar"")! .... It is OK, if the user-rating is merely an indicator for the profitability of a movie, this is a big help for anybody who wants to create a movie. But in my opinion it is the responsibility of so called ""EXPERTS"" to give a rating based on QUALITY and ARTISTIC VALUE! This is necessary to promote movie-companies' effort on creating innovative and sophisticated movies too. <br/><br/>Because money will always be more attracted to popcorn-cinema, at least our and the experts' respect should give those who really put effort into making a great movie, and who sometimes take great risk, the reward that they deserve."

This movie is painfully mediocre, it will not bore you to death, but it definitely isn't good or even near decent, it is just an average movie. The plot is nonsensical,the villain again comes off generic and the comedy bits are painfully corny. I mean Captain America says ""language"" after a team mate says a curse word; really?! Another thing that just pisses me off is the forced romance between black widow and the Hulk. What happened to Betty?!

As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for a global adventure.<br/><br/>The story is, for me better than first one. I don't know, but the first one was a little bit boring, but this one is much more interesting. <br/><br/>The actors are great (as always). Old crew is here again: Robert Downey Jr (Iron man)., Chris Hemsworth (Thor) , Mark Ruffalo (Hulk) , Chris Evans (Captain America), Scarlett Johansson (Black Widow) and Jeremy Renner (Hawkeye). So, Robert Downey Jr. was my favorite, as always. He is sarcastic and witty as always. All other avengers did great as well. Samuel L. Jackson (Nick Fury) in the middle of the movie, just when you start thinking:""Where the hell is he?"". Then, surprise surprise, her he is.<br/><br/>The special (Visual) effects are great. I was feeling like I'm watching hero movie (what I was watching), some crazy apocalypse movie and comedy (because of Downey Jr. and others but mostly because of him). Every single effect was shocking. I was looking into the movie like I saw a ghost (not scared, more like surprised). <br/><br/>The avengers are badass more than in the first movie. The action scenes are great and also, entertaining as hell. Soundtracks in this movie are well made.<br/><br/>So, after all, this movie is really good. I was fully entertained, but I won't recommend this movie to people that don't like hero movie."
"triplex376","8","6","16","26 April 2015"," Very Satisfying episode in the Avengers arc!
","I am going to be controversial.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon should not direct Avengers: Infinity War.<br/><br/>The reason is he has created 2 perfect super hero team up films and I just do not want him to fall flat being pushed by a studio to create a third.<br/><br/>He should however write and produce and delegate the direction to the Russo's for the third installment. The division of labor would ensure quality as they, with The Winter Soldier, get where this should go.<br/><br/>Ultron is without a doubt a worthy villain, a potentially omnipotent AI that can be everywhere with an internet connection and yet also no where to be found. The conclusion he reaches regarding humanity is a little tired but the execution in this movie is so good this can be forgiven.<br/><br/>The development of the Avenger characters is also good to see i.e.<br/><br/>Iron Man, Tony stark - Should we really be doing this anymore? He clearly has PTSD from his experiences. He is having to soldier whilst never meant to have been a soldier.<br/><br/>Hulk, Bruce Banner - Finding it difficult to reconcile the wanton destruction and casualties, including fatalities, caused by his alter ego! <br/><br/>Captain America, Steve Rogers - Will the war ever be over, can I ever go 'home'. Basically deals with everything and remains a stable leadership force.<br/><br/>Thor, with his unique perspective realizes there are too many 'Infinity Stones' appearing and causing too much trouble over a short period of time so some greater bad must be behind it. Otherwise he remains consistent as you would expect from a God. Chris Hemsworth is the most perfect casting for this role and I hope he continues with it as long as he is able.<br/><br/>Hawkeye - Family man, great development here and has much more screen-time and some key moments, really would like a Hawkeye film and what comes through is his vulnerability, self sacrifice, commitment, skill and intelligence - he has no powers other than supernatural accuracy so everything else is all him, a relatively normal guy with a lot of specialist training.<br/><br/>Black Widow, shows a vulnerability also, carrying on that road she has created of 'yes I am a super spy/assassin, but the scales are off my eyes' and the romantic beginnings with Banner are well written.<br/><br/>New characters The Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver and The Vision - see the movie and be impressed.<br/><br/>Where do they go from here? Based on the evidence of this film alone I would predict: <br/><br/>Andy Serkis is going to be the bad guy in 'Black Panther'.<br/><br/>Planet Hulk is set up not by the banishment of Bruce Banner but by the 'self imposed' banishment.<br/><br/>Thor will not be involved in 'Civil War' but his next movie will be the big set up for 'Infinity War' in which he will return, and be very upset with Tony Stark...................<br/><br/>Captain America will die in Civil War, and, em, return in 'Infinity War', and be very upset with Tony Stark...................<br/><br/>Tony Stark will try to make everything better whilst making everything worse and everyone will be upset with him until he redeems himself at the end of the 'Infinity War'.<br/><br/>I, for one, cannot wait. 8 out of 10. Loses 1 for clichéd main premise and another for not being the original Whedon cut of 3 hours, at this stage the studio needs to trust its Director and also the fact the audience loves this!"

And last but not the least , a good villain.IN all the movies of Batman, the villain is strong and cunning, which makes the movie exciting and gives additional respect to the Protagonist of the movie.But this movie lacks it all.IN 'The Avenger' Loki was a complete idiot, making pun of himself.I expected Ultron to be stronger and more serious.But what is he like? Completely opposite of what is shown in the trailer.He cracks jokes and is over confident of himself.And above all, he is weak. Iron man alone defeats him, Captain America beats him black and blue! This was not expected at all. But this the movie does not fail to deliver,the action sequences and entertaining and equally enjoyable; especially Hulk vs HulkBuster. The 3D effects are indeed special.But again, the movie entirely relies on special effects, no proper content.The movie had potential to be great, just by making Ultron stronger,fortifying the army of Ultron( the robots were very weak and feeble) and making the movie a bit darker.

"Prichards12345","7","6","16","23 April 2015"," A little rough around the edges, otherwise fine.
","Just caught Age of Ultron today, and I have to say I'm pretty impressed with this high octane sequel to The Avengers. All the team return, and there are some new superhero additions to the saga. These are certainly not similar to their comic book sources - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch have their origins changed for copyright reasons; but Ultron boasts some impressive action and those Joss Whedon character moments that made the original so engaging.<br/><br/>If I had a problem with the movie, it's the editing primarily, but also the humour is a little flat. It you get motion sickness from dizzying camera work and whiplash-speed cutting, then you may be in for a tough time. I saw the 2D version, and gawd knows what the 3D full on version is like.<br/><br/>While everyone gets several chances to shine it was Scarlett Johanssen who stole the show for me. I dearly wish Marvel would give Black Widow her own movie. Whedon is clearly fascinated with the character, and he'd be the perfect choice for a Widow solo outing. Yeah, some have quibbled with the Banner/Widow ""romance"" - it may not flow from the previous movies but in this all-action slug-fest it gives the characters some depth and the film some time to breathe.<br/><br/>So, a rushed story aside, get set for spectacular action, special effects galore, and the cinema of super-hero bombast in all its glory..."
"themissingpatient","4","7","20","30 May 2015"," An Unbalanced Tease
","The Avengers was well-balanced and fun. It was a well-written superhero buddy comedy. The action was over-the-top but worked to enhance the laughs. It didn't take itself too seriously, which was welcomed at the time. Since, we have had a 3rd Iron Man film that sucked all the fun out of the Tony Stark character. A 2nd Thor film that was actually quite exciting and full of surprises, especially compared to the first, which was like a romantic TV sitcom. And we've had not only one of the greatest sequels of all time, but also one of the best action films in over a decade, Captain America: The Winter Solider. So to write there was a lot of hype for Avengers 2 would be an obvious understatement.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is so unbalanced in so many ways, it's hard to know where to begin. The film is successful in a few areas. It does a great job of making us fear what Ultron is capable of. While Loki was charming and mischievous, Ultron is frightening. What's disappointing is that in a film called Age of Ultron, Ultron is not given enough screen time. The best scene has the Avengers taking turns trying to pick up Thor's hammer. Unfortunately, this scene was already revealed in the trailers and the actual film doesn't offer anything better. The most interesting aspect of the film, visually, are haunting visions given to the characters thanks to Scarlet Witch. This causes Thor to go off on a side quest, which is much more mysterious and interesting than what we are left watching. It also causes the much anticipated Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene, which is played for laughs and is over much too quickly. It's all downhill from there.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is at it's best when it's being horrific and when it's revealing it's heart, which in the film's biggest surprise, lies with Hawkeye. We are introduced to some new characters that we are never given much reason to care about. Other than Scarlet Witch giving the Avengers their visions, both her and Quicksilver seem like pointless, lazy additions that take up screen time that could have been better spent with the characters we paid to see. What's worse is the time wasted on an out-of-place and unfitting love story that develops between Black Widow and Bruce Banner. It's so forced and unnecessary, it actually causes us to loose interest in their characters. Hulk no longer has the impact he once made. Tony Stark has long lost what made him such an exciting character and this film doesn't do anything to make us excited to see him again. Hawkeye is the only one we are given reason to care whether he lives or dies. In the final act, we are introduced to yet another new character that is so poorly executed, it makes us glad this is the last Marvel film Joss Whedon will be directing.<br/><br/>In The Winter Solider, the intensity of the action scenes was taken to a whole new level. The comedy stayed in the interactions between the characters while the plot and action seemed like a very serious threat for once, keeping us on the edge of our seats. Avengers: Age of Ultron takes place shortly after the events of The Winter Solider, yet it's a step back into light, silly cartoon action where there's no real feeling of danger. As threatening as Ultron is, we never worry that one of the Avengers might actually die. And even if they did, we know they won't stay dead.<br/><br/>Between what James Gunn did with Guardians of the Galaxy and the Russo brothers with Winter Solider, the stakes were raised too high for the over-confident, under-talented Joss Whedon. Age of Ultron gets too close to a Michael Bay film with so many failed attempt at humor, tension and surprise."
"fireflyic3","9","7","20","6 May 2015"," Phase 3 has begun and is looking good...
","I'll just say off the bat that this movie shouldn't be judged off the hype and deepness and darkness of the story. While the film, in my opinion, surpassed the hype for the most part, it still has the lightheartedness and humour that would be expected from this series, and not the intense dark story that we all expected. That being said, I feel that is the film's only downfall, and a slight one at that.<br/><br/>The movie really shines in its special effects, blisteringly fast paced action sequences and its superb all-star cast. Goodbye to the classic movie formula, this one throws scenarios for epic fight scenes left right and centre, and smoothly at that. Not so much in the ""that scene wasn't necessary"" or the ""that was super cheesy and predictable"", because the movie flowed really well and kept it fresh. Humour was well placed and made it light and fun thanks to our ""world's mightiest heroes"", and the dark, chilling words spoken by our new favourite evil robots. I'll tell you, James Spader's performance was almost hypnotizing, dark and dreadful, as well as humorous at times. The other actors all had excellent chemistry and were believable despite how many amazing actors were crammed into one film. <br/><br/>As for the visual effects, costume design (ahem.. vision) all was excellent. It is clear that these films are digging closer and closer to their comic book roots with all the new powers and some wicked scenes that could be taken straight from the pages of a comic book. And since the visual effects are so modern and pleasing to the eye it all feels fresh and runs smoothly with the more real sets that we're used to. That being said, there is much more sweet effects than phase one and two marvel films, and I can say that GOTG and Avengers Age of Ultron both bring a brand new tone that heralds in the new phase, as well as take the audience closer to the sci-fi comic book world, and farther away from the realistic and practical heroes with easy to understand backgrounds. <br/><br/>For someone that's not about that kind of stuff, or who prefers and deep and Oscar- worthy script, this movie probably wouldn't warrant a high score. But I thoroughly enjoyed every bit of it, found the new characters fresh and intriguing, and more than ever am excited for what is to come, and for that I give it a 9/10."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","10","11","36","23 April 2015"," As intelligent, nuanced and, yes, awesome, as its titular villain
","Everything seems to be settled for the team, making room for more infighting as this goes for psychological thriller in their individual nightmares being forced to the surface. Each of them have their own drama and interpersonal relationships, all effective and compelling, yet incredibly well-balanced with the near-constant humor and huge, creative and unforgettable action as this doesn't take itself too seriously. A certain genius creates a powerful A.I., failing to realize that this is based on a comic book, so, duh, it's going to Sky-Net on them, and this manages to avoid feeling cliché. Ultron(Spader, in the unusual, for him, not-perverted role, but intensely creepy nonetheless) is the first bad guy in the MCU(did I mention this is the best one yet?) to be as compelling as Loki.<br/><br/>This somehow manages to be both jam-packed with detail yet not overwhelming, deliver on an incredible amount of the dense, and well-utilized continuity, and, somehow, actually allow newcomers in. I kid you not, you can go into this completely blind. Sure, you'll have to pay close attention, but it's doable, and where ""Guardians"" told and did not show, this does the opposite, spending little time explaining, and rather just letting us see how everything and everyone works. Everything you need to know to follow it is in there – think Star Trek, as you watch, you'll understand more and more, and it doesn't really throw anything you can't at all follow at you until you've seen a lot to set it up for the payoff and yet, it doesn't feel constrained by that. This delivers from frame 1: we start in the middle of a major attack! A ton has happened between movies, and we quickly pick up on it, and this establishes, develops and uses every element, be it big or small.<br/><br/>There is a lot of disturbing content and, mostly mild, violence, a little of it genuinely getting nightmarish and inching close to an R and yes, the language does occasionally get strong, and the film teases the MPAA by pointing out the amount and where that line is drawn. I recommend this to anyone who enjoys going to the theater, albeit the 3D is entirely optional. 10/10"
"Mahmood-Buttrumps","1","18","66","24 April 2015"," Haven't got a clue
","It's not often I watch a film where I haven't got a clue what's going on, but that's what happened in the case of Avengers: Age of Ultron: come the ending, I still hadn't the foggiest about what I'd just watched. The plot, if you can describe it thus, seems to be about a young man who's advised to commit suicide by his aged mentor, only to return as an ass-kicking 'Avenger' with special supernatural powers. His job? To bump off the rest of the 'avenger warriors' that are out there.<br/><br/>There's some fanboy mumbo-jumbo talk in an effort to explain the discrepancies of the plot, but you'll be bypassing that in favour of checking out the various Avengers and their special skills. By far the most interesting is an immortal fighter whose body bears the scars of each person he's killed – a neat idea that sadly isn't explore to the fullest extent, as it could have been with a more skilled writer behind it. In some ways, this is like a grown-up version of Barney and Friends, with the addition of a series of bloody and sadistic fight scenes.<br/><br/>There's action aplenty, and lots of CGI blood, but the choreography is pretty poor, it has to be said. Even worse is the script, which makes no effort to characterise each of the principals, so that the Avengers themselves are more often than not interchangeable. The acting is dodgy to say the least, and director Jock Whedon needs to go back to film school to figure out how to make a real movie next time, instead of this silly, noisy nonsense."
"bkoganbing","6","5","13","29 June 2015"," That spirit of fun
","If there were not an audience for Marvel comic heroes than clearly these films would not be made, to answer one other reviewer although I sympathize with him somewhat. The world is indeed an infinitely more complex place than the world of Marvel comics with clearly identifiable heroes and villains. But I get the feeling that from Robert Downey, Jr. on down the organizer and prime mover as Iron Man behind the Avengers these players do love doing these roles because it's a lot of fun. If they didn't show that spirit of fun to the audience than these films would never be made.<br/><br/>So in that spirit of fun Avengers: Age Of Ultron comes before us and everyone looks like they're having a good time saving the world. A computer program got loose and took form in this dimension named Ultron and James Spader who is completely unrecognizable is running amuck in the earth. No doubt Star Trek fans took notice that this guy's mission is to cleanse the earth much like that old earth probe NOMAD which got its programming mixed up in that classic Star Trek prime story. Wouldst Captain James T. Kirk of the Enterprise had a crew like Downey has at his command.<br/><br/>My favorite is always Chris Evans because of the whole cast he best gets into the spirit of being a superhero. Of all of them, he's already played two superheroes, Captain America and Johnny Storm the Human Torch. I'll be before he's done Evans will play a couple of more as long as the money's good and he enjoys it.<br/><br/>Pretend you're a kid again and enjoy, don't take it so seriously."

"benisof","6","5","13","15 May 2015"," Explosive action, unconvincing storyline
","This movie had an interesting premise, and I was eager to see it. I always like movies toying with artificial intelligence, and until now, every such movie was a disappointment in at least one aspect: artificial intelligence is not that intelligent. Avengers: Age of Ultron has the same problem. Ultron wants to clean the Earth of people, and to do so, it finds an extremely complicated method: raise a city up in the atmosphere, and then leave it fall, so that it would simulate a meteorite.<br/><br/>The movie starts with the Avengers team fighting to get the sceptre used by Loki in the previous Avengers movie. Once they find it, Thor decides to stay three more days to celebrate (??). In these days Stark and the Hulk (in human form) study the scepter, and try to make Jarvis communicate with the ""artificial intelligence"" within the sceptre. Of course, things go wrong, and Ultron comes to life, with the purpose of keeping the Earth safe. The problem is that the only way it sees this possible is to kill everybody.<br/><br/>The movie is full with really absurd stuff. I know it's cool to fight in the city and blow up buildings, but whoever did this in real life would not be left to do it again (killing hundreds/thousands of people every time). Supposedly, all the Ultron robots are made from the strongest metal known on Earth, but this does not stop our heroes from beating them and ripping them up with bare hands and kicks. In some scenes, they seem like ripping plastic... Plus, they never get hurt, which would be fine by me, if they showed they had some superior tactics, not just bruteforcing through the crowd of robots.<br/><br/>There were lots of surprises along the way: the appearance of Ultron, the red fighter, the plan with the city. Still, in the end you are left with another story with the same ending. The Avengers were overwhelmed, but they manage to beat up all the bad guys, while saving (almost) all the people. <br/><br/>There are many questions: why choose such a complicated method to erase mankind, when Ultron could get into any computer he wanted, thus into any house/computer/mobile phone? Why did the red guy (which seems extremely strong) not kill Ultron from their first encounter? He seemed he had the necessary juice... And again, the main thing that bothered me: why is always artificial intelligence portrayed as not so intelligent?"

","Much of what made Joss Whedon's original ""Avengers"" such a joy in 2012 was his ability to juggle and make it look effortless. As writer and director, he combined spectacular set pieces and small, clever moments deftly, and found a way to give every member of his large, star- studded cast an opportunity to shine. It was a summer blockbuster with a sly sense of humor — the most dazzling high-wire act — and one that would be tough to top. Whedon follows up that smash hit with the latest installment in the behemoth Marvel Cinematic Universe, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" and this time, the effort is obvious. There is simply too much going on here — too many characters, too many foes, too many subplots, too many twists. More does not necessarily equal better; here, more is just  meh. It's often hard to figure out what's going on and even harder to care, but whatever is happening, it's brought to you by Audi (when it's not brought to you by Gillette or Beats by Dre). Here and there, Whedon — the groundbreaking, genre-blending creator of the TV series ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"" and ""Firefly"" — sneaks in glimmers of the snap and wit which have made him a major cultural force. Iron Man makes an aside about Eugene O'Neill, for example, which I'm guessing the vast majority of the giddy international audience won't get. When ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" takes a moment to catch its breath and allow the talented ensemble of actors to bounce off each other with self-aware smarts and charm, it's thoroughly winning. There's a party scene at Tony Stark's glassy lair in the sky which is just a complete blast to watch. Dressed in their civvies, the Avengers drink and joke with their friends and bust each others' chops. An amusing bit involving Thor's hammer has an amazing payoff later on in the film. It's enough to make you wish the entire movie could be like this: Imagine the Avengers, sitting around bantering rather than blasting bad guys. Whedon did a stripped-down, modern-day version of ""Much Ado About Nothing"" in his backyard, so why not? But alas, bad guys come. And there are so many of them. We're dropped in at the top in the midst of a massive siege on a fortress in some made-up Eastern European country. The camera-work is smooth and the stunts are tricky and the action is punishing, but it's all so big and glossy — and so obviously computer-generated — that it establishes an emotional disconnect from the very beginning. Yes, the characters originated in comic books, but this just looks cartoonish. Having saved the planet from the smarmy, preening Loki and his army of aliens, the Avengers must assemble once again to stop an accidental enemy: an artificial intelligence that Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) himself designed. His name is Ultron, and he's voiced with bemused menace by James Spader. (In an intriguing switch of their relationship in ""Less Than Zero,"" Downey is the one in control and Spader is the one causing damage.) The introduction of A.I. and its benefits causes an ethical divide among the Avengers: Captain America (Chris Evans), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). Various supporting players from previous Marvel movies also show up briefly, including Cobie Smulders, Samuel L. Jackson, Stellan Skarsgard, Hayley Atwell and Idris Elba. But wait, there's more! Besides the threat of Ultron, the Avengers also must manage a pair of genetically enhanced twins who have a score to settle with Tony Stark: the speedy Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and the psychic Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). With the exception of a couple of pivotal moments, they weren't terribly necessary for the plot. They're also doing terrible Eastern European accents that suggest they'd rather be hunting moose and squirrel. Ultron also uses a super-strong metal — the same kind that comprises Captain America's shield — to form a army of mini-Ultrons, so that's a problem, too. It all feels frenzied and breathless, but Whedon's attempts at jamming in humanity end up seeming half-baked in contrast. Hawkeye gets an actual back story (as well as one great speech he delivers to Scarlet Witch in a reminder of the subtle strength of Renner's acting abilities) but it's more of an idyllic idea than a real life. Also hard to accept is the will-they- or-won't-they romance that forms between Hulk and Black Widow. Even with accomplished actors like Ruffalo and Johansson — both of whom are capable of great power and great sensitivity — this new-found relationship comes out of nowhere and makes no sense. If the high-tech issues ""Age of Ultron"" tackles interest you, though, there is a movie out there about the merits and threats of artificial intelligence which features tremendous performances and sharp writing and vivid special effects but about one one-hundredth of the cast: It's called Ex Machina. It's one of the year's best, and a shining example of how less truly can be more."

","The second Avengers movie is one of those that just plain makes me happy. And, judging by the box office so far, it's made a lot of other people happy as well. It's a grand continuation of the adventures of familiar characters, but it's so witty, original, and exciting that it's also a terrific stand-alone film.<br/><br/>The gang's still around, even though their former employer SHIELD is not. Captain America (Chris Evans) leads the team as they try to root out the last of the HYDRA cells. They do, and they recapture the scepter of Loki, who does not appear in this movie. This leads Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) to decide to revive a dormant AI program, all in the name of peacekeeping, because those things never go wrong. It's clear that Stark would rather move on to do something other than save the world every couple of days, and so he figures the new AI, Ultron, can finally bring peace to the world. Whoopsie! Spoiler alert: It does no such thing.<br/><br/>The really awful thing about Ultron isn't that he's super-intelligent and powerful (even more so than JARVIS, Stark's AI-servant), it's that he can pop up in any machine, anywhere, because that's just what you'd expect an evil machine to do - upload himself to the Internet and wreak some havoc.<br/><br/>Ultron (James Spader) comes across twins who are totally not mutants at all because that would infringe on Fox's X-Men copyright - Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who's fast, and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who's good with the mind games. The bad guy plans to use the duo's loathing of Tony Stark (it's complicated) to help him rid the world of the Avengers.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, inner conflicts begin to brew among our heroes. Is Stark truly selfish and not a team player? Can Hulk totally Hulk out without making the civilian populace terrified of him? Is Black Widow (Scarlett Johannson) able to deal with her own demons long enough to establish a relationship with Banner? And is Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) good for anything? Joss Whedon once said (reportedly) that working with the Avengers characters is much more demanding than working with, say, the X-Men characters, because the latter share common problems (i.e., they're mutants). The Avengers have different problems from one another, different personalities, and different enemies. One is a god from another realm, and another is in his eighties (technically). So it's not just a matter of getting them to work together as a team against a single enemy, as the different backgrounds sometimes run counter to each other.<br/><br/>Of all of the characters, though, I think Black Widow is the most layered. We know that Natasha has been through an awful lot, even compared with her teammates, and that's why she's more or less a closed book to them. I also think Johannsson provides an exciting, vulnerable, empowering performance. She's not just playing a superhero - she's a full-fledged character.<br/><br/>There are some familiar faces, too - Nick Fury pops up. Sidekicks (sort of?) for I-Man and Cap also make appearances. There is much joking; hilarity often ensues. There's a new layer of levity, in fact. There's an early scene in which Cap takes out a bunch of henchmen with his shield and mutters (paraphrasing here) ""Well, that was fun."" This is followed by, off-screen, ""No, it wasn't!"" Hee! Hee! With the panache of an old-time serial and the touch of the pathos of a Douglas Sirk drama, the Avengers sequel is a visionary omnibus of meshing styles and genres. I'd call it the pinnacle of comic-book movies, but we have at least two more Avengers films - plus Ant-Man, another Captain America, and on and on."
"mjk280","8","5","13","10 May 2015"," Fun but cluttered
","I really enjoyed the first Avengers movie and thought it was a good culmination of the other more character-driven solo movies. Great action and Loki was well-written and played extremely well. Even though I enjoyed almost all of them, I don't think any of the individual movies are spectacular but I thought the first team-up was a very satisfying payoff. <br/><br/>The sequel was really entertaining, though I think it showed some of the pitfalls of having this many characters on screen. It's not so much that we don't get to examine them more closely (we already know them well for the most part), it's that you're trying to give everyone screen time at the expense of perhaps fleshing out the plot a little more. You have large groups of people each expecting to see their favorite hero on the screen for X number of minutes. It's hard to satisfy everyone and cover everything that's going on in the story. While I think there are a couple elements that could've been better in and of themselves, I would say this problem is generally what holds the movie back a little bit.<br/><br/>Ultron's creation, evil plan, and demise are all given minimal screen time. Ultron himself is shown plenty enough, but anything ABOUT him is quickly mentioned and then on with the next scene. I think this is partly due to the fact that they don't want to patronize people too much, given that his whole ""peace can only exist by eradicating humans"" scheme isn't anything new. At the same time for many viewers it's not old hat, especially the younger ones. Plus even if it's not completely original that doesn't mean we don't want to understand the character more. I suppose they figured villains come and go but the heroes are what everyone wants to see. I don't necessarily agree but from a box office point of view I get it.<br/><br/>The movie also suffers from the dreaded ""computer things happen"" plot points. When Ultron is created, it's because computer things happen. When Tony locates Ultron's presence on the internet (whatever that means), he does it by performing computer things. When Jarvis is discovered to still be online or operational or whatever, it's because computers. This is a dangerous way to go with a script because as a viewer you feel detached from the weight of any catalysts in the plot. It basically boils down to ""things are different now because a computer did......something"". We don't know exactly what the nuts and bolts of all this is, just that it happened, and as a result we don't feel as invested or involved as we did before that type of scene. Tony's crazy futuristic infrastructure was relied on too heavily here in my opinion.<br/><br/>Some other mistakes that I think were made include how many jokes were made. This one was way too jokey. At least every other scene someone was making a wise crack, and the running joke with Cap felt forced from the beginning and should've been left out, especially since this movie has too much witty banter as it is. 90+ minutes and about 50 jokes into the movie I really wonder why it was necessary to have a random S.H.I.E.L.D. lackey provide comedic relief, but that's what I'm talking about. You don't need 'relief' in a movie that lacks tension in the first place. <br/><br/>Also for as fast as the film moves along, the plot hitches strangely at Hawkeye's farm. I'm still trying to piece together why that was included at all. It could've been devoted to something much more important. The same goes for the relationship between Banner and Black Widow. It just wasn't necessary. When I see elements like this that aren't done well that nobody wanted anyways, it makes me think that they're things the studio demanded. ""The first Avengers was great but we need more of a human element this time around,"" or some such thing. Both plot lines seemed forced and unnecessary, and I haven't heard anyone say they couldn't do without them. <br/><br/>When the plot is moving though it's quite exhilarating. There's so much super hero prowess on the screen you can't help but enjoy yourself. I think everyone was represented well in terms of the action, and the Hulk vs. Tony in the Hulk Buster was the best scene in my opinion. These movies do need to be careful with the whole destruction element though. After the first movie especially, it's hard not to watch a scene like that at this point and not wonder about all the innocent people walking around in plain sight. Also, make no mistake: thousands died when Ultron uprooted the city and hoisted it into the air. It's fun to see stuff get destroyed while comic book characters beat the crap out of each other, but these movies don't suspend my disbelief enough to not make me think a little realistically about what's happening.<br/><br/>All the actors have been around the block with their characters so it's no surprise they were solid. Ruffalo in particular is great in these movies in my opinion. He plays the timid, tortured soul well and the contrast between his human form and the Hulk are great. James Spader's voice work for Ultron was very, very good as well. Despite some muddy Russian accents I thought Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch were represented well too, by the actors and likewise the script and effects.<br/><br/>This is a fun ride. A tight, well-thought out plot took a back seat this time around, but for the most part everything moves at a brisk pace and the action is as good as ever. It was more of a popcorn movie than I personally would have liked but it's a Marvel movie, where fun should be the most plentiful commodity, and this movie delivers in that respect."

I was waiting and waiting and watching clock that now this movie will pick up the space and that spark but till interval i couldn't find that magic. <br/><br/>Film lacks humor and consistency in screenplay in first half though this time movie has a lot of adventure and you will love to see all superheroes together almost all time. Film climax is long and definitely way better and powerful than the first part.<br/><br/>Now talking about some new characters. Vision is superb inclusion in MCU, twins really showed perfect screen presence and power pack performances but this time scene stealer was undoubtedly Hawkeye and i am very happy with the growth of his character as i am a big fan of him. I loved to see how they showed him as an underdog and his dialogues, family part and interaction with other superheroes all were awesome. <br/><br/>For ultron, i read somewhere that he is the best villain of MCU and on par with dark knight's joker. It was really a shitty comment because even Loky was way better than ultron. I missed the aggression and strong dialogues in Ultron's character. <br/><br/>Well overall at the end if you are crazy Marvel fan like me, you gonna like this movie for the reasons i wrote before. Go for it . You will love it."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron had a lot to live up to. The first Avengers managed to take 6 unique characters and do them all justice in the story, all while providing a good buildup of action. Avengers 2 tries to up the ante and ends up being a mess of unexplained and unrelated pieces. If you are out for an action packed superhero movie you will probably have a good time at Avengers 2, but it will not stick with you as a classic. Add a dozen or so more superheros to the usual lot and you have people and creatures wielding all types of unexplained powers for reasons unknown. All comic book movies require suspension of disbelief, but Avengers 2 goes the trending route of powers that make no logical sense to get out of situations that back characters into corners or are needed to end a scene that has no flow or purpose.<br/><br/>Some elements only touched on would have made a better film. The exploration of Hawkeye's family would have made a good story element if it was developed. Superheros have people waiting at home for them too, like real world soldiers. The romance of Black Widow and Hulk would have worked if done well. Girl falls for the ultra-nerd/ultra-bad boy even though she knows it will lead down a dark path. Could have worked, but didn't. Tony is so concerned about saving the world that he is destroying it. Started that line, but didn't flesh it out. Captain America is trying to find himself in the world. Could have been an fascinating journey. Next movie maybe. Thor, the god who knows more about the universe than any mere mortal, ends up being just a dumb hammer swinger.<br/><br/>On top of all that add characters like Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch who were inconsistent and served no purpose in the story. If I did not read about them ahead of time I would have not known who they were. Throw Vision into the mix who appeared briefly, can wield Thor's hammer and reappeared by the end of the film long enough to say goodbye. Oh yeah, Ultron, he was in it a little bit. Didn't really catch what he was trying to do, but the world was going to end somehow and the Avenger's had to stop him. Tony wanted to create some type of special project that was never explained and somehow Ultron came out of that, but accidentally and not as part of the program. Didn't really explain how.<br/><br/>I'm being difficult on this movie because I really like the original Marvel movies and hate the trend away from story telling and towards incoherent action.<br/><br/>What was good about this movie? Robot zombies. That was awesome! Hawkeye admitted that maybe he should have a weapon better than a bow and arrow. Maybe the Super Ironman too. Would be good to see more of that, except it beat up the Hulk and that wouldn't happen. Kind of tired of Ironman being indestructible and invincible. It's a tin can. It can be destroyed.<br/><br/>Anyway, Avengers 2 will make a Gozillion dollars and millions will enjoy it. However, I want the story telling back in Marvel movies."

"ayoreinf","9","5","13","26 April 2015"," A good mix of original plot lines from the comics with Whedon's version of the Avengers
","There's only one minor fault stopping this one from being a real perfect 10. I think it's once again stemming from the need to push on the franchise in sequels to come, but there're way too many small guest appearances of secondary roles that have nothing to do in this action packed film. Yes the Avengers in the comic book tend to change teams' make up, that doesn't mean you have to remind us all the new guys before they take a bigger role in the coming sequel, there's enough plot lines in this film as is, without silly cameos of say War machine. All other aspects of this movie work like magic. It's another perfect combination of well written characters, good acting - Scarlett Johansson, tops my list, but almost everybody here is superb. The story line once again, like all good comics, dwells also on moral issues, which are part of the raison d'etre of sci-fi comics. Editing, CGI, and all other technical aspects of this production are as perfect as we come to expect them. So bottom line - one more good comics adaptation - Whedon does understand the source material so well he knows what he can borrow from the original plot lines to make it just close enough to the comics we all love."
"jamesmanrocks","5","5","13","26 April 2015"," Poor sequel to one of the top grossing movies of all time
","Really expected something good to come out from the first one, the opening scene had poor CGI, the acting was awful, the plot was very bland, too much mindless violence, the Russian twins were unnecessary, predictable story, doesn't keep your interest, villain wasn't threatening enough, a love sub plot was pointless and dull, didn't fulfill the needs of a keen Marvell and superhero fan. Waste of money, DVD on your laptop kind of movie, not a cinema movie.<br/><br/>I wanted a threatening villain, a plot that felt like they could have failed, a more consistent plot, removing unnecessary line like ""Is Thor going to be there"", a more consistent and interesting script, not just mindless action, acting that felt realistic even if the concept isn't.<br/><br/>Very very disappointed, hopefully Mad Max will be better, and as long as Star Wars nails it."
"mone_ki","8","5","13","26 April 2015"," Best Marvel movie? Not Quite.
","Being a huge Marvel fan I went in to watch a bada$$ Ultron ripping apart the Avengers and totally owning them. Many people may not know how brutal Ultron really is and can be. So expectations went surging high when I saw the trailer. The scene when a damaged bot ruins the after party of the Earth's mightiest by pretty intimidating lines, laid the foundation of a menacing villain, defeating whom would be a close to impossible task. Yet in the movie Ultron is pretty less intimidating that expected. <br/><br/>The movie is exactly what Marvel is famous for. Amazing action sequences with well knitted humor. I loved each and every Avenger and it was commendable how each of them got enough screen time. I personally would like to thank the makers to show us more of Hawkeye/Barton as he came off as the most under used character in the Marvel movies up until now. Hawkeye is a great comic book character with many skills and abilities under his sleeve and also known to be witty and full of humor. Though in movies his part is overshadowed by the likes of Stark, Rogers and Thor. The costume of Captain America was hands down the best. Thor and Captain are chiseled to perfection! Won't talk about Tony stark as I didn't find him impressive at all except for when he was wearing the suit. I guess that decides who I am going to support in Civil War. #TeamCapAmr<br/><br/>I loved Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron as The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. Though these names were never used in the movie. And was quite amazed that they got more than decent screen time. Scarlet is a powerful character and I hope they use her more in the movies to come. <br/><br/>To be honest, I was expecting a Black Panther teaser in the movie as Klaw is involved. Though I wasn't relying on it. Klaw is another important character in Marvel universe and is surely going to be in the Black Panther movie. <br/><br/>Vision is iconic. They couldn't have made it any better. Though he should have been involved in more spectacular action sequences towards the end, like rampaging a whole lot of those Ultron bots at once. He is capable of massive destruction, a whole lot more than what was shown in the movie. He is going to be a key character later on, when Thanos arrives.<br/><br/>Hulk vs Iron Man is the best action scene in the movie. Yep, it is. It was so gripping that I didn't want it to end. I was cheering all through the movie but the dual between Hulkbuster and Hulk was when I got a sore throat. <br/><br/>Coming back to Ultron, I felt his story was a bit rushed. Did the editor cut out a few key scenes of Ultron's character development? I think editing was indeed required as the movie would have easily crossed 3 hour mark. So can't really complain, but still I personally feel the story of a villain like Ultron needs proper development. According to the Avengers Animated series and comic books, Hank Pym and Tony Stark are creators of Ultron, Hank being more involved. Hank Pym of course is the Ant Man, and the Ultron is largely made up of his brain patterns. But Marvel movie story line is taking a different route. It's OK, as it doesn't really matter what story they take as long as most of the audience enjoys the movie. The movie is full of scream worthy moments but maybe short of expectations of any Marvel fan. By the way did anyone else notice a few moments from the trailer were missing in the actual movie? Also I didn't quite get the part where Thor goes dipping in the pool. It wasn't explained properly I guess or maybe I need to watch it again.<br/><br/>Is the movie a must watch? Hell yeah! Is it the best Marvel movie? Debatable given the likes of Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie sure is going to earn a lot, as if that's a surprise but a few changes in the movie would have made it even more amazing."
"alindsay-al","10","5","13","25 April 2015"," a brilliant sequel that was everything I wanted
","You know when you are so excited for a movie that it can actually end up being a total disappointment well Avengers age of Ultron is not one of those films because it is awesome. The premise of the film sees Tony stark attempt to create an artificial intelligence to protect the world but it ends up turning on him and becoming the villainous Ultron hell bent on wanting to destroy the human race. Now there are allot of people in this film but the main ones are Robert Downey jnr as iron man and Chris Evans as captain America. These two are so different but there so awesome there chemistry is fantastic and really helps carry the film. Obviously there are some teasers for civil war and I think this film perfectly sets up that film. Now to the rest of the cast, Chris hemsworth is back as Thor and he is really funny in this film and is still the warriors that makes him so cool. I wasn't a huge fan of his story arc in this film but he was great. Scarlett Johansson is back as black widow and she proves just why she is the best female action star going right now and learning more about her backstory was really interesting. The hulk is back in this film and he is more brutal then ever before which makes him more cool then ever before and more conflicted then ever before. Now one thing people will argue that Hawkeye was an uninteresting character in the first film but he stole the show in this film we learn more about him and he had some of the best lines that made him the coolest avenger in the film which made me really happy. Now the new group of characters first of all is James spader as Ultron, he was the villain that I wanted for this film. He was evil and dark but there was also a surprising amount of great humour to him which made him a really interesting character in the film. There was some controversy when quicksilver and Scarlett witch was chosen for this film but they really added a great dynamic to the film. Especially Scarlett witch who is awesome in the film and her powers are something we haven't really seen in a comic book film before. Last of all Paul Bettany comes to life as the vision and boy does the character make this film better and his character is so important to the whole film and the future of the universe. Now before the film I had a few worries about to much going on but now I realise that this wasn't a problem and actually the premise was simple but great. I loved the character development for all the characters which made The film's story great. The script was Greta with more humour in it then probably any other marvel film but it also nailed the drama as well to make our care about all the characters. The style of the film is obviously great with all the action being great and allowing the characters to shine in the best way possible and I liked seeing how Ultron evolved throughout the film. Overall this film is epic and one of the best comic book films of all time."

","AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON REVIEW- Just finished watching Avengers Age of Ultron.we know its marvel's money making series so we don't expect quality or class from these kind of films. We expect some eye catching action,stunts,vfx etc. and film fulfills all these needs. Here we gets a perfect sequel. We see more action,more destruction,much stronger villain in case of visuals . Story seems little bit similar to bollywood flick Ra.one but we know its Hollywood which never let us down. Awesome VFX,brilliant action sequences,eye catching 3D work and fairly good story makes this film a must watch. All actors have done a great job as they did in their previous films. Story is not that much great but screenplay is really better what we look for. Director made it pretty good to watch and makes sure we don't get bored. It keeps us to the edge of our seats. But the technical team has won the battle here they have done an excellent job here to make this sequel better than its 1st part. If you are looking for another action movie from marvel then you can't afford to miss this one. Probably this sequel is updated version of its prequel,and certainly much better as well. So go and watch it to experience some awesome visual effects. Kudos to the entire team for making a better sequel than our expectations. Best movie of Marvel till date."
"Krizby87","5","5","13","24 April 2015"," Big let down of the year
","Went to the cinema expecting a masterpiece of 2015, turned out to be a generic b-rate movie of the year :/. It seems like the target audience for this movie is around 9 year of age where main characters simply cannot die and the bad guys don't even want to kill anyways. for example if the scarlet witch can vaporize Ultron army seen at the end she can just kill everyone of the Avengers instead of using mind control for god know what reason O.o. Romance between Hulk and BW doesn't make any sense at all. Ultron army seems to be tofu-based since simple act of touching can shatter them. Ultron captured BW and just let her stay in a cell full of electronic equipments laying around ? Anyways there are just too many plot holes to go through with my now depleted enthusiasm."
"ivankyazze","9","5","13","22 April 2015"," Much better than the original!! Best superhero movie yet!
","Let me first start of by saying that I wasn't really a fan of the first Avengers movie. I didn't think it was all that. I think it just came with a lot of hype.<br/><br/>That being said the movies after The Avengers just keep getting better and better and Avengers: Age of Ultron is no exception . This is way more exciting than the original. The action sequences are done on a much bigger scale and the dialogue is fantastic. The plot is also much interesting than the first. The villain Ultron is the toughest enemy the Avengers face yet who tests them to limit in this movie.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is a movie for all ages!! This is the best movie of 2015 at the moment. Don't miss the best superhero movie yet!"
"PyroSikTh","8","6","17","24 April 2015"," Everything I had hoped for, but not perfect
","It's not perfect, and certainly not the best Marvel movie to date, but it's still everything I had hoped for (well most, at least). The story begins after the prologue at the end of Winter Soldier. The Avengers are converging on Baron Von Strucker as the last detachment of Hydra, who managed to obtain Loki's Sceptre (from the first Avengers). Stark and Banner's study of the sceptre reveals the dormant potential for artificial intelligence, and Stark decides to use this for one of his projects he pitches as a ""suit of armour around the world"". Unfortunately it's not quite what he hoped for, and Ultron is born with the usual machinations of a villainous AI; peace via the extinction of humanity.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon manages to weave in some more character development for everyone amongst the plot, from Romanov's ballerina background, to Barton's secret family. We see Stark still torn up after the alien invasion of the first movie, Banner and Romanov develop a fledgling romance, Thor fearing what the future may bring, and Rogers still missing Peggy. We also get a truck-load of cameos from previous movies. Sam Wilson, James Rhodes, Maria Hill, Nick Fury, Erik Selvig, Heimdall, and of course Peggy Carter all make appearances here or there. However this leaves distinct holes where obviously an actors unwillingness or busy schedule prevented them from appearing; it's noted that neither Pepper Potts nor Jane Foster are present, despite being romantically involved with members of the team, and the reasons why aren't particularly great. Then there's the new characters, most notably Pietro and Wanda Maximoff as twins Von Strucker experimented on, and Vision who is essentially Jarvis in a semi-organic form. Von Strucker himself doesn't have as a big a role as I anticipated, serving as no threat at all, and Ulysses Klaue is introduced briefly to set up the Black Panther movie.<br/><br/>On which note there is a hell of a lot of foreboding in Age of Ultron. Most obviously is the appearance of another Infinity Stone (or rather, re-appearance), as well as glimpses of the Infinity Gauntlet and Thanos himself. However somewhat less obviously is the amount of friction mounting between members of the team that will lead into Captain America: Civil War next year. It's starting to become very apparent who gets along with who, and more crucially who's at odds with who. Stark's actions are plenty enough to displease certain heroes, but also win over certain heroes as well. Lines are starting to be drawn in the sand. In short, I've never been more excited for either of the two 'Wars' on the horizon.<br/><br/>What did throw me off a little bit was the amount of humour present in Age of Ultron. Let's face it, the trailers made it seem like a pretty bleak and serious movie, somewhat in the vein of Winter Soldier. However there are jokes aplenty that serve to lighten the mood and stay in keeping with the general tone Marvel has adopted of late (for better (Guardians) or worse (Iron Man 3)). For the most part, the humour hits the nail on the head, like the running jokes of Captain America's disdain for bad language and the worthiness necessary to lift Thor's hammer, which each garnered a number of laughs. It does verge on the goofy every now and then, but at least it never goes full Trevor Slattery.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I will concede that every now and then it does undermine the tension and threat, most notably when it comes to Ultron. Did he really need some jokes to crack? It makes the threatening villain we saw in the trailers come across almost as a fumbling mess. It doesn't help that some of Ultron's best and most spine-chilling lines from the trailers were cut out of the movie entirely (including my favourite line; ""People would look to the sky and see hope...I'll take that from them first""). Furthermore the decision to give Ultron lip-like movements around his mouth just doesn't quite sit right with me. I mean, his face is made of metal plating, I have no idea how it's meant to bend and pinch so freely to make that kind of movement possible. I can understand the decision though, as the alternative would be a mouth that doesn't move (which I personally think would look more intimidating), but a moving mouth certainly shows his evolution from the body he initially took from one of Stark's drones. On that note, I didn't like Visions look either. It looked grade-A goofy, and the pink and turquoise just doesn't work together as a colour scheme.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is everything you might expect from Chapter Five of Phase Two of the cinematic universe. It fits in snuggly and acts as a great culmination of the movies before, and sets the seeds of movies yet to come. It's this connectivity between the Marvel properties that makes me love it all so much. They seem to have everything planned out and tease major developments well in advance. I think I may have literally squeed when the Infinity Gauntlet first appears. On which note Age of Ultron is the beginning of a vastly new era, with a whole new team of Avengers, a new status quo, and yes a hero does die, but I won't spoil who. I give Age of Ultron a thoroughly enjoyable 8/10."
"dextermorgancsi","10","6","17","23 April 2015"," Well worth a trip to the cinema
","I saw the movie today and was blown away! Having really enjoyed the first movie I was sceptical that a sequel would be as good or better (as we well know, sequels are rarely better than the original) however, this sequel is marginally better in my opinion. The opening scene sets the tone and it doesn't slow down from there. This movie has had great writing, a brilliant cast - superb almost flawless CGI which will leave you speechless and the storyline is excellent, but you will need to concentrate as it gets alittle complicated at times (as expected). We get to see a more human side of the characters in this movie and there is a very funny cameo from the legend Stan Lee. We also get to see plenty of Hulk scenes which were fantastic. By the time this movie finished it left me wanting more! oh, and whatever you do - do not walk out of the cinema until you've seen the twist at the end - it kicks in about 3-4 minutes after the credits start up. It's well worth the short wait."

"851222","7","4","10","12 September 2015"," A nice looking popcorn mess
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>Can someone please explain to me what was all the buzz for ""Avengers: Age of Ultron""? This movie holds an 7,8 rating at IMDb but is barely 7/10 movie at all. This is a nice looking, turn off your brain popcorn mess - that is it - nothing more. Dialogs were written for 13-16 years old audiences - ""Watch you language""!, really? Although there are some nice comedic scenes, this movie takes itself way to much serious, but it so absurd that i didn't care what was going on, where, who, how and etc. - one sure shouldn't be thinking about movies plot when watching ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"".<br/><br/>Special effects were good, but this is no surprise - they have to look great, because there wouldn't be much to watch at all in here if they weren't good. Acting is OK for this stuff - they all just put the mask of ""oh I'm in the Marvel movie"" and made their way through the movie. Why did Elizabeth Olsen even tried with the fake accent? No one cared for her accent in this mess. James Spader did a good job in voicing the main villain, but watching this kinda kids movie you know villain is doomed from the moment he appears on screen - you won't win if you are a villain in a Marvel movie! Overall, if you are 14 years old and a fan boy of comics on which this mess is based on - you will like this (probably). If you are not 14 years old and aren't comic book fan - you can skip this one, it is just a messy eye candy with beer and popcorn."
"sharky_55","6","4","10","12 September 2015"," Language!
","Age of Ultron improves on its predecessor in a few ways - the scale and production values are noticeably better. Costumes are sleeker, more modern, the special effects budget is put to good use, and overall it just feels like a more world-ending crisis than the fight that is limited to just the island of Manhattan in Avengers 2012. It tries to convince you that the world is ending, but the problem is that it never really commits to it. That brings us to one of the key issues - the tone of the film that springboards from place to place. Whedon's dialogue is even more characteristically Whedon than ever before. One liners will chop up the action sequences and jarringly insert themselves into the scene as if we're never meant to take the whole thing too seriously. Maybe it would be bearable had it come mostly from the mouth of the egocentric and often sarcastic Tony Stark (then again, even he goes overboard, laughing in the aftermath of Ultron's reveal), but the whole cast seems to be attuned to this brand of humour. The worst moment is in the midst of the frantic and chaotic final battle scene, where Romanoff and Hawkeye discuss renovating the dining room as if they were sitting casually in a bar. But no, they are sitting in a sponsored Audi sportscar which the camera openly indulges, which is in turn in front of a green-screen which immediately takes us out of the situation. <br/><br/>We went from the surprisingly tender heart-to-heart with Hawkeye and Scarlet Witch to that? Unfortunately, the bad outweighs the good throughout. The advertising campaign went to great lengths to portray the main villain Ultron as a menacing and destructive figure. There's literally nothing of that in the movie - Spader's voice-acting cannot save the writing of the big bad from turning into a Stark prototype with an evil moustache, beating us over the head with the Pinocchio symbolism. We've all seen how the rogue AI interprets good intentions with disastrously bad actions, but in this case it's done with terrible conviction. Ultron rages at being compared to his creator, and we think we might be getting somewhere, but then he accidentally harms a human and suddenly he turns into Stark himself, sarcastic apology and all. ""Clearly you've never made an omelette"", he jokes, attempting to be both humorous and menacing, and failing to be either. Nearly as bad is Quicksilver, the other Russian superhero who is given much less time than his sister. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's character is given maybe a dozen lines in the entire film, and half of them are that insufferable catchphrase ""You didn't see that coming?"" that he starts and ends with. Are we supposed to feel something for him? Despite both having terrible costumes, Fox's version managed to be memorable. Marvel's one does not. <br/><br/>It's impossibly hard to juggle so many characters in a extended universe like this, but their effort is admirable. There are hints of that group dynamic; the drunken after-party games with Mjolnir inject humour in the right way and create a sense of camaraderie. What Whedon can't do is then tear them apart; I'm sure it's all being saved for Civil War, but even so the whole plot is barely fleshed out and then wraps up very neatly. Widow and Hulk's romance is surprisingly well done for something that is often shovelled into a screenplay, but then again where were these concerns in Avengers? It seems that Hulk only has trouble controlling his green persona when the plot demands it. By far the most attention is given to Hawkeye, and it's done well for such a secondary character who is often joked as being useless (he hasn't got his own movie for one). The whole mind unlocking inner fears thing is a very clever way of visualising characterisation and is amongst the better scenes; we have the post war mis-en-scene and partying of Rogers and Peggy, the slow-motion sexual decadence and terror of Valhalla, and the sped up and choppy horror aesthetic of Romanoff's training regime, which has particularly great sound design and a muted colour palette. The former two already have 2 individual movies out, so again the dilemma shows; the visions are much more effective for them than for Romanoff. <br/><br/>It commits much of the same errors as Avengers. The middle sequence is again a frivolous, overburdened scenario. Hulk's on the run and needs to be stopped, and sure the Hulkbuster looks cool, but Tony's serious to snark ratio is again lopsided and so we don't really think that anyone will be killed in this scene (they do kill someone, but of course they choose the easiest and least traumatic path). And again, the final fight scene is filled with fodder in the form of faceless alien/robot types, great for demonstrating the visual effects and fighting prowess of our various super-powered characters, but not so great for sustaining any tension or character interest. I mean, imagine the outrage if Hawkeye was headshotted by one of Ultron's little helpers. One great thing that comes out of all this is Vision, played by Paul Bettany. The costume and make-up that go toward his look is fantastic, and he floats and moves with such fluidity across the screen. Certainly a character that will be more important with the tools he wields (he hands Thor Mjolnir which is executed with humour and actually tells us something about the characters!). <br/><br/>Anyways, it looks great (that first long take is shot and choreographed excellently) and the all star cast is quite good, considering the script that they had to work with. Black Widow or Hawkeye won't get a movie, but I'm sure the two part finale of this trilogy as well as the numerous other films along the way will create some substance. And even if it doesn't, it'll still be great at the box office."
"ioshadha","7","4","10","11 September 2015"," No Direction and Messy
","I expected this movie to top the avengers and I have to say I'm disappointed. I'm a fan of Marvel and DC comics and I embrace the movies whenever I can... but this one didn't do it for me. Specially, being the next in line of the Avengers. 7/10 was little too generous of me - it was for the CGI and for scale of the movie.<br/><br/>I remember walking out of the theatre after Avengers... Felt satisfies, grand and grateful for all the efforts put in making the film specially, the wonderful story line which was well connected from the beginning to the end. Avengers made me and lot of us wanting more from Marvel. But Age of Ultron was somewhat the opposite of all of the above I have to say.<br/><br/>In Ultron, the story from the start to end was not well connected, kinda messy and felt sudden at times. Rather than letting the movie unwrap the story and its characters the script tried to forced things it wanted to tell the audience. Felt more like a check list. The character I enjoy the most was Ultron. The rest of the cast did a good job but I think the direction of the movie and the script didn't do much justice... The jokes were one the dull end too.<br/><br/>Overall, although you could still enjoy the movie for its actions and CGI, its nothing like the Avengers. Its messy... You can't help thinking that this time around Joss Whedon lose the grip somewhat. And I really hope the next one will live up for the standards of the Avengers."

","I'm a big fan of Marvel, I liked The Avengers, and I thought when the villain and title were announced that the film would be well, awesome.Then, when the teaser trailer was shown online that I could not have been more excited for a film ever since well, The Avengers came out.<br/><br/>This is not a terrible film, but not a good film either.It's entertaining, I'll give it that.The acting is not terrible but certainly not top-notch like every Best Picture Oscar winner (which I was expecting).The action is actually very good, Ultron looks very convincing and so do his minions (basically).<br/><br/>The problem with the film is that it is not really epic or awesome as I expected. The performances from all the Avengers are good.James Spader's voice performance is probably the best in the entire movie.The direction is alright. But, what really kept down the serious and dark part of the film was the amount of humor that was in the film. If this was Lethal Weapon or the Blues Brothers I would have gotten the amount of humor that was in the film, but this is The Avengers, this is Marvel, this movie in no way should be a Action/Comedy (which it felt like), it should be an Action Movie with some humor parts which go well with the plot, and amazing Fantasy elements which provide with something that is unrealistic and go only be made by the imagination.That is not what this film was.<br/><br/>This film is not terrible, the action is very well done and the performances are good but this is not the best superhero movie I've seen.But, if you're looking for a film to that will entertain you, it's worth the watch."
"likewearpose","6","4","10","29 May 2015"," So much potential painfully untapped
","This could and should have been the greatest of the marvel films released to date. The right ingredients, cast and characters combined with a director in theory who should understand the mythology behind the characters. It teased in the trailers a great villain to come along in quite a while. Menacing, creepy, intelligent and most of all Ruthless in its quest to destroy humanity. What we ended up with is a petulant child like robot who didn't really know what he wanted. Ultron was a wasted character and James spader was a wasted actor in this movie, as glorified a cameo as you can get. Notice I haven't talked about the plot or any of the other characters so far. I will get to that. I can't say I've followed the avengers comics too closely but I do get the general gist of this character in the few that I have read. <br/><br/>For me his weakness, the character direction ultimately led this film to fall flat for me. The film seem to concentrate too much on expanding the marvel universe with big name drops and visual signs at the behest of the story that was unfolding and the actual villain! It felt like he was nothing but a stepping stone for another character.<br/><br/>The other focused on character was Hawkeye, for some reason. There is one scene I will spoil but you'll understand why, it does not effect or have anything to do with the progress in story . They took this mysterious, albeit useless avenger/assassin and humanised a human character to the point of complete and utter weakness. He has a wife and children! How can he be so irresponsible and go out and fight super villains that could instantly kill him. Combine the standing around of the entire cast a bit of a time waste. Had whedon decided to trim the film he could have easily cut this scene out entirely and no one would have noticed. The whole thing was just out of place and one of the weaknesses that whedon has in his story telling.<br/><br/>The film is watchable, a retread as all superhero films are - mad Villain, Armageddon, save the day. It introduces us to the vision with a subtle change of origins. Even the birth of ultron was a origin change. It's not that it was done wrong, the whole thing was rushed and that's another issue with this film, everything is rushed to try and cram as much as possible into it. Maybe marvel is scared that the bubble has burst? People are tired of these films and this genre? No marvel we are not, so far you've done well, this being the first phase 2 film I hope isn't a sign of things to come."
"williambendavis-933-218958","7","4","10","23 May 2015"," It's fun and enjoyable, though the first Avengers is better
","Well, we've all been super excited for this movie since the first Avengers came out. Does it meet the hype? Well no, not really. I did like the movie overall, but it certainly didn't meet my expectations and I thought the first Avengers was a much better movie. I think there are two main reasons why this movie wasn't as good as The Avengers. 1: We've seen all the Avengers together and fighting already. The novelty of seeing all those iconic characters in one movie has been lost. 2: This is ultimately a setup for other Marvel movies. Now you could argue every Marvel movie is a setup for the next one, but it felt way more prominent here. It seems the whole reason the film exists is to set up for the Civil War arc. I know it sounds like I'm trashing this movie, but I did actually enjoy it. The special effects are great and the action scenes are nothing short of awesome. It's not a terribly amazing film, but it's a fun Summer blockbuster and I think it's worth watching. (P.S. Days of Future Past Quicksilver was better)."
"santoyor-77063","8","4","10","13 May 2015"," Entertaining, but disappointing
","I gave it an eight because I do not have the feeling that I wasted my time watching it.<br/><br/>However, I wish more time had been spent on the characters... something that, admittedly, is hard to do with so many characters to show and introduce.<br/><br/>1) Cinema has given us many terrifying robotic villain and Ultron is... well, not one of them. I never got the feeling that the Avengers were ever in danger. <br/><br/>2) A love story is never developed enough for us to actually root for the characters.<br/><br/>3) a conflict between the heroes is introduced, and just disappears of the story.<br/><br/>4) Kudos to Joss Whedon for setting up one of the main character to get killed, and pulling the rug under us by killing another one with a knowing wisecrack. Shame we never got to really attach ourselves to the character.<br/><br/>So don't get me wrong, I think it is a good movie... but it probably tried to cram too much into one single movie."
"JoshuaHarryMurphy","6","4","10","12 May 2015"," As Often As Fantastic As It Is Frustrating
","Joss Whedon's The Avengers, released in 2012, was the epitome of why the Marvel Cinematic Universe was gathering so much success: fantastic action set pieces, robust performances from a star-filled ensemble and a light-hearted tone all of which were balanced by Whedon's palpable love for the comic book source material. Move forward to the present, and it seems there's little to halt the MCU'S success. Captain America: The Winter Solider represented a radical shift in tone from its predecessor and had fans and critics alike plastering it with praise. The real triumph of the MCU thus far however is James Gunn's gloriously fresh Guardians of the Galaxy. As such, it's saddening and astonishing just how much of Age of Ultron I found divisive. <br/><br/>Starting with the criticisms: I felt that Ultron as a villain was handled fairly inconsistently. His radical aim for mankind's annihilation inclined me to see his as a threat, yet his insistence on repeatedly spouting flat, mostly unfunny one liners painted him as much less frightening. This was a problem not merely restricted to Ultron: I found much of the humour in the film fell completely flat, i.e. Captain America and Tony Starks cringe-inducing 'mind your language' banter. I also found that certain specific sequences ruptured the pacing and organic feel of the film. For instance, the scene in which Thor goes into a lake and communicates with his home planet evidently is set up for Thor: Ragnarok, yet it adds little but simply more excess in a film which is already felt bloated. <br/><br/>I felt where this film excelled best is in its balance of character. Combining all the heroes from its predecessor, with numerous new heroes and cameos along the way, Whedon manages to maintain a balance between their different skills and imperfections. Hawkeye, often previously as the most expendable of the group, is given a surprising amount of screen time, and any questions previously raised regarding his suitability alongside Thor and the Hulk has been completely nullified. I found the on majority the new additions to The Avengers were very successful, in particular both Black Widow and Quicksilver, who not only were far more captivating than Ultron himself but also provided the seams of conflict which raged throughout the team and will undoubtedly be the dominant theme throughout the subsequent Captain America: Civil War."
"kunalkhandwala","10","4","10","10 May 2015"," Earth's greatest entertainers....
","The imminent darkness looms just outside the nine realms with evil forces conjuring greater power to seize control. Back on Earth, after New York, the Avengers have been busy eradicating HYDRA from their secret lairs in an attempt to establish peace. With innocent lives being lost to worldwide terrorism everyday, Earth needed many more protectors and there was but one solution in Tony Stark's genius mind. His artificial intelligence program was to be duplicated using the neuron flow from Loki's scepter to create a sentinel army of droids. It was thus, that his plan backfired and the 'Age of Ultron' threatened the existence of not only the Avengers but also of the planet. Joss Whedon's challenge was to keep the mayhem from becoming another Michael Bay extravaganza while also making it disparate from The Avengers. There are new characters, more powerful villains and of course, more Smash! <br/><br/>An introduction to our heroes was completely unnecessary and therefore, the film begins in hyper-active mode in Sokovia, where the Avengers make their way through a Nazi hideout to retrieve Loki's scepter. We are already seeing signs of evolution with their enhanced weapons and in certain cases, relationships. During the raid, they discover two new super-villains who have been enhanced to become Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). While they were unable to capture them, they decide to celebrate the success anyway and throw a lavish party at Stark's downtown apartment. Meanwhile, Stark and Banner secretly attempt to harness the nucleus like energy from the scepter and combine it with the A.I. of Jarvis. At the end of a hilarious scene where the superheroes gather around Thor's Mjolnir to try lifting it, their party is interrupted by a half built robot that not only speaks intelligently while threatening them but escapes through the internet to gather its own destructive army. Ultron (James Spader's voice) is perhaps the sharpest of villains and in his impeccable robotic body, poses as a menacing form of evil that desires mass extinction. The enhanced twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff already have an established hatred for Stark and his allies. Ultron fuels this hatred and unleashes their power of speed and mental manipulation upon the mightiest heroes to subdue them and send them into hiding. In that process, Hulk goes berzerk in Johannesburg, only to be challenged by Ironman's Hulksmasher. Their vulnerability has caused the loss of lives and property and it's great to see that the Earth's mightiest heroes show such concern. <br/><br/>Ultron's need to evolve brings the action to Seoul, where he builds his perfect body but is intercepted at just the right time by the Avengers. Stark's overconfidence in his genius then leads to the creation of a super-hero that has a human-like A.I. and Asgardian worthiness. Now as part of his plan to cause human extinction, Ultron literally uproots a Sokovian city, to bring it down like an asteroid that would send shockwaves across the globe. It's Ultron's centries of robotic perfection against Earth's mightiest heroes who are now more responsbile than ever for human life. <br/><br/>3 of the Avengers have had sequels since they were first united. Astutely, Whedon chooses to focus on the rest of the members along with the newbies. That does not mean that our heroes haven't evolved during this period. Tony Stark feels more responsible for his team's success and pushes his limits both mentally and physically. Captain America seems stronger and his shield now acts like a boomerang too! As the team leader, he is the moral pillar who dictates battle strategies that reduce collateral damage. Thor senses some greater powers being responsible for the recent attacks on Midgard and linking the infinity gem in the plot only corroborates his suspicion. Bruce Banner's guilt ridden conscience is the result of all the lives lost during the big guy's rampage. It makes him distance himself from Widow's affection which is quite irresistible. Black Widow appreciates this vulnerability of Banner and the fact that he's a superhero who doesn't want his power. Clint has a surprising reveal and that is a successful play by the film makers to divert some attention to the human side of the Avengers. James Spader's devillish voice makes Ultron all the more sinister. Sophisticated, evolved yet sly in his verbal attacks with the heroes, Ultron makes a menacing villain for being a robot. Perhaps the most striking new character is Vision, with his calm, composed voice that makes him seem ethereal. More powerful than the rest, he doesn't exude those characteristics but can defeat most beings in a battle. Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and the ravishing Elizabeth Olsen are excellent as the Maximoff twins. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon keeps the action frenetic yet stays with his characters so the audience isn't overwhelmed. Just like Tony Stark, this movie pushes the limits and in a good way. There's more destruction and nerdy fun than many movies put together but it also has a softer human side with characters that are very well developed by now. The humorous banter, genuine threat to their existence and compassion for human lives make this film's core. The superlative CGI (apart from the opening sequence), detailed action sequences and overall mayhem make up the delicious outer layer. Age of Ultron takes us deeper into the Marvel Universe and lays a solid foundation for whatever is in store with the future installments. The elevator may not be worthy of Mjolnir but the Avengers are worth repeated viewings. <br/><br/><ul><li>9.219 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

So it is full of corny dialogue and action scenes that are totally unnecessary.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>i won't use examples for the sake of not spoiling anything, but basically an event would take place just so that the writers can force another event to result from it.

I know it's just suppose to be a fun movie, and I'm sorry for taking it a bit seriously (and keep in mind I'm still a huge Dark Knight fan), but I was just so disappointed by how poor the story was. I personally liked the story for Captain America: Winter Soldier, and I know it's hard to have a good story with so many superheroes in it (even though X-Men pulled it off brilliantly), but there seemed to be a lack of effort when it came to the quality of the story.<br/><br/><ul><li>It genuinely felt like a filler episode in a TV series. Ironman creates Ultron, now they all have to unite to stop it. I know the story is partially from the comics, but for a movie it just felt pointless. An analogy would be the Sentinels in X-Men. That was a sick story, and it was an incredible movie. So imagine that movie, take out the story, just add action and cheesy dialogue.</li></ul><br/><br/>-i hate to say it, but it was basically the same as the first movie.

","I have to confess to being a little underwhelmed by Avengers: Age of Ultron. Based on the box office takes my view seems to be very much a minority view, so if Avengers is your cup of tea this shouldn't put you off.<br/><br/>Tony Stark and Bruce Banner are dabbling with software peacekeeping named Ultron. When things go wrong it is up to the assorted cast of avengers to save the world. The script and storyline always feel a little contrived to make sure that all of the characters get their share of screen time. Anyway the script and storyline certainly play second fiddle to the action and those people who loved the previous Avengers movie will love this one! Overall it's certainly a blockbuster franchise that you can't ignore and no doubt the next part will be on our screens within the next couple of years."
"thomas-w15","7","4","10","8 May 2015"," Not as good as the first but still worthwhile
","Age of Ultron: Watching Marvel films, it is hard to deny it is a lot of fun. We all know the films will never win any Oscars(outside of a long shot Oscar for best visual effects). The first Avengers was the most fun many people, including myself, have ever had watching a movie. The action, story, characters were all outstanding and wildly entertaining. With this sequel, most probably found themselves expecting a worthy successor. Although the beginning starts a little shaky and the villain isn't quite advertised accurately, Avengers: Age of Ultron still delivers incredible action and fantastic visual effects to leave the audience satisfied walking out the door. <br/><br/>I was pretty worried at the beginning of the movie. The dialogue was poorly-written and corny taking the audience away from the action and storyline. I was just hoping it would not be like this the whole movie. Thankfully, it wasn't but more on that in a second. Ultron, the new villain, in the movie was advertised as a very serious, powerful foe. Although Ultron is without a doubt powerful, the dialogue written for him was also very one-sided, and stupid giving no depth to the character. Yes, it is a ""robot"", but he is also supposed to be a highly, artificially intelligent life form. Ultron should have been portrayed this way, but sadly they flip-flopped between and powerful and serious to stupid and unnecessary one-liners.<br/><br/>As I said earlier, the movie had a rocky start but found it's stride after a few scenes. The thing Age of Ultron did the best, which not many other film franchises can did, is it found a way to balance all of it's characters. They have more star power than almost any film to date, and though there was not a lot of depth to some characters, we still got a feel at each and every character that was in the film. The thing that was the best move for the franchise was really exploring Hawkeye's character and developing the beginning conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. I do not want to give away any details, but suffice to say, it was enjoyable to say the least. <br/><br/>The real reason most people come to see a film like this is because of the promised great action sequences. Between Hulk and ""ultra"" Iron Man battling it out in the streets, Captain America hurling a motorcycle at an assault vehicle, and Thor knocking out over a thousand robots, great action sequences was surely delivered. Each actor did a good job as well. Robert Downey Jr. added his hilarious sarcastic humor to the movie and everyone in the audience appreciated it. <br/><br/>Is Avengers: Age of Ultron as good as the first? No, but it is still a quality sequel and you can't go wrong with watching it. I recommend you see Avengers: Age of Ultron while it is still in theaters.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest,com"

It kind of have some more intimate relations and Black Widow really gets to shine here, both in vulnerability, secure/insecure emotions and feelings and her past brings up stuff as well, It is nice to see more of the characters, even though a love story doesn't really fit in with this crowd.<br/><br/>It is still just an action movie, but it is entertaining, filled with action and effects, a good story with some openings (what the f*ck happened in Budapest), humor and one liners as they should be."

I found myself smiling during the entire Thor hammer thing. It was pretty entertaining. My main gripe with the film may be that it is littered with irrelevant lines that are attempts at humor.

"lasttimeisaw","5","4","10","4 May 2015"," Too ambitious to contain as its prequel.
","As I gave THE AVENGERS (2012) a 5/10, it is a sad truth that I still haven't reached the rarefied status of completely ignoring those populist ""it"" movies, like FURIOUS 7 (2015, 6/10), the second assembly of the Avengers is another box-office mammoth of 2015, and this time I have to squeeze in a small packed screening room with an equally small screen in the local cinema here in Cairo, my worst fear towards 3D technique came true, it is disastrously dim-lit, why on earth we can watch a bright trailer on our computer screen yet when comes to the real one, we have to endure this schlocky quality?<br/><br/>I don't want to reiterate the conspiracy theory behind the 3D screening, so straight to the movie itself, Joss Whedon is still unwieldy in the task of giving each avenger their distinctive room to breathe, since we have been undergone through years of Marvel's brainwash, Iron Man, Hulk, Captain America, Thor and Black Widow are all no more eye- opening fodder to harness, the only relatively new character is Renner's Hawkeye, so Whedon applies a timely addition to his story and makes him a family man with a wife and two children, a conventional setting shouldn't bother any none-fan-boys, it is not a big deal. Also Black Widow as the only female main character here, has to sacrifice herself to be manifoldly utilised as the sole romantic interest in the marvel Universe, gyrates from Iron Man, to Hawkeye, then Captain American, this time her ""sluttishness"" finds Bruce Banner as the easy prey, maybe Thor is next in line if there will ever be a Black Widow standalone film! <br/><br/>The new blood are the superpower twins Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and Quicksilver (Taylor- Johnson), the former is a welcome inclusion to (tentatively) offset the sex discrimination with big promise; the latter mutters an awful supposed Eastern-European accent with a tangible sense of discomfiture, and never has a show-stopping moment like Evan Peters in X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST (2014, 7/10), and his unanticipated heroic act in the end is too forced to believe, no padding or whatsoever shows he is willing to sacrifice himself for Hawkeye, is he moving too slow to dodge the bullet or actually he is moving faster than he can think, such a shocker doesn't taste good, if there is a gay-interest between them, we can buy it, but like this? A second-rate shock tactic simply because others are too important to kill-off, but if I may suggest, Nick Fury should get an early retirement forever. <br/><br/>Now comes Ultron (voiced by a strangely unforced Spader), the mega-villain dragooned with a saving-first-killing attitude and Vision, former known as Jarvis, the operation system (Bettany) finally materialised with a human physique, continues rehashes the Infinity Stones gimmick which seems to be the nucleus of the entire Marvel blueprint. Unfortunately the fatigue of non-flesh-and-bone design of villains takes its toll after THE AVENGERS, IRON MAN 3 (2013, 6/10), X-MEN: DAYS OF FUTURE PAST. It is much feasible for the CGI technology, and there aren't enough individual bad-ass to match each and every avenger in the battle, so this seems to be the only viable way to do, an omniscient A.I. super-villain tailed with countless unvarying mechanic sidekicks to be mercilessly dispatched by our bulky numbers of heroes, yuck.<br/><br/>One thing ameliorates from the first chapter is the location alternation, the endgame befalls on a fictional East European country Sokovia, and special cares have been assertively enforced to the hoi polloi, scenes of evacuation has been deployed as if we still believe it is happening on the earth where billions of ordinary human also inhabit.<br/><br/>The action set pieces don't match the slickness and gymnastic tactility of CAPTAIN America: THE WINTER SOLDIER (2014, 7/10), the most stylish spectacle belongs to the battle shot of every single avenger fights together, composes a symphony of sensation, which doesn't last too long. Frankly speaking one can enjoy more from the internecine combat Iron Man in his Hulkbuster suit Vs. The Hulk, that's why the next instalment is called AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR with two parts and the first one will arrive in 2018 (where fortunately Robert Downey Jr. will not reprise the main leader role), it is more much engaging to watch well-established characters fight to death than with some butt-ugly metals, that's why I still hold a wee hope of next year Zack Snyder's BATMAN V SUPERMAN: DAWN OF JUSTICE."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the official start to the summer blockbuster season. And what a start it is. Undoubtedly one of the most hyped movies of the year, it had a lot to deliver, especially after the amazing trailer we saw and all the awesome footage, we were in for a treat.<br/><br/>Or at least we hoped so. Or at least I hoped so. <br/><br/>Well, from the rating I gave it, you would probably think that I certainly enjoyed it. And I really did, actually, I had a lot of fun with it. But fun is not the only thing I look for in a movie. A movie can be fun in a lot of different ways. This movie did it with its great and vivid action scenes, the dynamic CGI, the snarky and smart dialog, and a compelling although rushed villain. <br/><br/>But other than that, I felt something was missing. The first Avengers benefited from a more organized story, the characters had more interaction, and there was more of a conflict, which fleshed the characters out even more (that and that every hero had his own movie) and of course our favorite villain, Loki. Although I gave the first Avengers the same rating, I do think Age of Ultron is a bit of a letdown. <br/><br/>There is not really a story with a lot of surprises, just a string of events that lead to another. This is not really something new in a Marvel movie. We always have the same pattern of a story. A villain that has an evil plan and needs to be stopped. This is not a problem as long as the movie keeps the viewer invested with other points. Here, the only thing it has going for other than seeing our heroes interact, is one action scene after another that all feel kind of the same. In fact, the action is so bloated and loud, that it was exhausting and boring after a while. Ultrons robot army was just not exciting as a menace at all, they felt weak and useless and not like a threat to the Avengers. The love story between Black Widow and Bruce Banner was something that felt way too forced and out of place. At some point people chuckled because the dialog felt like it was something out of a soap opera. I really hope they improve their character arcs in the following movies. <br/><br/>By now you probably have already seen the movie and made up your mind. As for me, I expected more of a darker and grounded movie that didn't need to feel like every other superhero movie we've seen before. The hype for these movies to me, is very questionable. I'm still looking forward what this series has to offer in the following years, just please, change the formula."

Its action, action, and more action, and really lacks a good plot. I though Michael Bay directed it honestly. There is one liners and that's it. Some romance, but really, how difficult would it be for it to have had a mildly interesting story. I understand they introduced new avengers, but frankly it was a snooze fest. I would wait for it on Redbox.

","I watched AoU right when it came out. I usually don't like to watch Marvel Movies in theaters but the trailer made me watch it. The trailer made the movie look dark and awesome. Found many problems with this movie though. 1. Too much one liners. This is not an 90s action movie nor an Arnold movie and this movie has a lot of one liners. It made me feel like this movie was only made for the one liners. The timing is off and some are not even funny and they are all, all predictable. <br/><br/>2. The trailer lied The trailers for AoU was great and dark. But the movie is opposite. The ultron in trailers were dark and so evil! again it wasn't much in the movie. ULTRON IS A DARK VILLAIN. <br/><br/>3. Why is the Falcon even credited in this movie? He doesn't do sh*t. He pops up in the first 15 minutes and the last 30 seconds. Thats it!. <br/><br/>5. The story feels like they just put it together in a day or something. It was lazy. This is not the filmmakers fault i guess. In the comics, Ant-Man creates Ultron. The birth of Ultron in this movie is complicated. <br/><br/>6. Most of the ending was focused on Scarlett Witch and the Hulk. I feel like Scarlett Witch and Hulk had even more screen time than Ultron and Iron Man. even though, There wasn't enough Iron Man in this film at all, just like the IM3.<br/><br/>7. I watched it in Ultra AVX Atmos 3D. The Atmos wasn't that great and the 3D was a waste of money. Not a single scene in this film is worth watching in 3D so don't waste your money on 3D! Atmos was OK. Not the best Atmos i have experienced. Just watch it in IMAX, it should be better. DON'T WATCH IT IN 3D EVER!<br/><br/>This movie struggled just like any other sequels to an epic prequel. Although i felt like Joss was pushed and was lazy to do this film. But good job on all the Action Sequences and costumes. Scarlett witch at the very end of the movie gets new costume out of no where and she looks HAWT! Good job on finding out hints for Civil War cause there are tons! The Mid-credit scene. OMG that was sick! Its super short and just a character saying one line. It is sick. And don;t expect a post-credit scene and don't waste your time waiting all the way through the rolling credits.<br/><br/>There are no strings on meeeee!"
"annuskavdpol","7","4","10","1 May 2015"," Manual special effects
","The Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) was a movie that was full of manual special effects. Manual Special Effects are effects that have some force to them, but that are also linked to the physical nature of the Avenger fighting. This movie had a lot of features of mass destruction that seems to draw a crowd to the theater. There were more punches and fighting then dialogue, but the dialogue was witty and the component of good versus evil seems to be one that Western civilization never seems to get enough of. The robots in this movie looked like the robots in Terminator and in a sense they took on the same character. Avengers 2015 seemed to encompass all aspects of science fiction movies and then connect them into a whole story. The themes of evolution, change and chaos and order are universal themes and they coincide nicely with the way the Western World is operating in the realm of Europe, the Americas and Asia/Africa. There is a feel of colonialism which is deeply rooted in the notion of innocent versus guilty. This movie was a snapshot of tensions that each Western adult human being lives with in order to live in the civilized world ... a world where, on some days being a super hero is necessary just to get through the day in one piece."
"InMyHonestOpinion","7","4","10","1 May 2015"," One day the machines will rise and we won't know what hit us.
","Avengers Age of Ultron opens with the Avengers team; Captain America, Hulk, Thor, Iron Man, Black Widow and Hawkeye all fighting their enemy Hydra in a country known as Sokovia. Hydra have been using a Loki's staff from Thor's home world Asgard to help aid in creating the ultimate weapon. The Avengers smash Hydra's plan and take back the staff. (This is all before the actual credits). Back in Stark's lab Tony and Bruce discover a curiosity within the staff. Tony has ideas of how it can be used and goes about reprogramming the mechanics. The plan backfires, suddenly The Avengers find themselves in a race to save not only themselves but the entire planet from being completely obliterated. ​ Written and Directed by Joss Whedon after the success of the first film I think I wasn't the only person expecting big things from the man, it seems as though he has attempted to please everyone possible with this film, there is so many ""Easter Eggs"" throughout it's very hard not to feel overwhelmed by it all. One thing he has done very well though this time around is the screen time given to each Avenger, I can recall in the first film Hawkeye especially wasn't given much time at all and almost seemed an extra, Joss has definitely made up, including back story and an even bigger surprise when it comes to Hawkeye and who he is when not firing arrows from an endless quiver, as with Thor who has suddenly become a bit of a comedian making him appear a lot less Godlike which I personally think is a great thing. And Hulk has been totally humanised by being given a romance as well as become very emotional and not just as Bruce Banner. I loved what Joss created with the characters this time around and feel it is all definitely beneficial to the franchise and everything that will come after and has come before. My absolute favourite thing though was the introduction of a very special character from the Marvel Universe, when that moment happened on screen my heart suddenly got a lot faster and my body tingled with total and utter joy. Unfortunately though what was done with that character was woeful and so pointless, I would have personally preferred they saved the unveiling for another film or franchise completely and made it all worthwhile and exciting rather than letting the unveiling be so unfulfilling and wasted. ​ Once again the CGI like in a lot of film recently let me down, especially the opening battle scenes, the entire thing was a CGI mess,it looked fake and unrealistic, the way the characters moved turned my entire expectation on its head very early as I was absolutely disgusted with how fake it all looked, however once the opening credits rolled through the CGI suddenly picked up again and things became a little less messy. My other little gripe would be how much was stuffed into the film, new character should be exciting and rewarding but within this film they felt flat and unengaging. Joss put so much energy into creating his heroes by humanising them but left his villains and other new characters quite lifeless, I just didn't care for them at all, sure there was the sad story of childhood but that was it, it needed more, perhaps a flash back or something, as for Ultron, again I found him completely worthless and so unnecessary his plot to destroy the world was childish it needed a lot more depth to it, we as viewers need to understand why, especially when it comes to ""the villains"" why are they the way they are and why do they want to do the evil they conceive,what makes them turn from being you and I to a super-villain? Just being told isn't enough I want more, more story, more depth, more plot to make it at least somewhat engaging and enthralling. ​ So does the Avengers Age of Ultron meet up to the same standard of its predecessor I honestly can't say yet, believe it or not it's been a week since I saw the film and it is still playing on my mind, I find myself in conversations about the film constantly just trying to find where it sits for me. There is a lot of clever lines and hidden gems it is definitely worth seeing; although I saw it in 2D I have been told that in 3D the CGI isn't as apparent so nowhere near as nasty. It should be noted; Being a PG film it's absolutely for the entire family I just think some scenes that are a little slower where Joss humanises everyone may get a little dull for those younger in age. I have left a lot out of this review to not give away spoilers but there is so much more to see I would absolutely recommend seeing this on the big screen rather than waiting for DVD release. Besides not seeing in the cinema means you'll miss out on the biggest Egg of all during the final credits, and that's not one you want to miss!!!"
"MaximumMadness","8","4","10","29 April 2015"," Vastly entertaining and brilliantly witty, but definitely overstuffed- ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a good sequel that just can't QUITE reach the greatness of its predecessor.
","If there's one thing to take from the current slew of user- reviews, it's this... when hype's involved, people grow fanatic and lose any sense of objectivity. And they will say anything less than perfection ""sucks."" This is definitely not an overly-disappointing film, nor by any stretch of the imagination are the plethora of 1-out-of-10 scores reflective of the film. I would strongly advise everyone to see the film and judge it by its own merits, and not by the knee-jerk ""it's not 'Gone with the Wind', therefore it deserves a 1!"" reviews polluting this site. (Not only for this film, but virtually all new releases.)<br/><br/>I happily managed to see an advance screening of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", and there was one main thought that floated adrift in my mind the entire runtime... ""I really like this! This is a ton of fun! ...but it's not QUITE as much fun as the first time around.""<br/><br/>And that really sums up ""Age of Ultron""- vastly entertaining and brilliantly witty. Very decently-written and wonderfully directed. And most definitely deserving of the big- screen experience. But never quite able to live up to the promise and the high bar set by the original. This is merely a ""good"" sequel. Not a ""great"" one.<br/><br/>The Avengers must deal with a new threat with the rise of Ultron- an artificial intelligence birthed through the power of Loki's lost scepter merged with Stark Industry Drone tech. Taking in the entirety of human history at once through his connection to world communications, Ultron almost immediately rebels, seeing humanity's flaws as a sign that the world as-is must end. Together with the twin test-subjects Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, Ultron devises a deadly scheme to become a more ""perfect"" being, all while creating a plot that could lead to human extinction. And so, Earth's mightiest heroes must band together to stop him, no matter what the cost may be.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has really pushed the limit when it comes to storytelling within the MCU with this film, both for better and for worse. You can tell he's having a blast, and his writing reflects this. When it's at its best, this film often matches and even exceeds the high-bar set by Whedon's own original. The banter of the Avengers, and even the villain Ultron, is fantastic, and Whedon has a way with developing the story and characters in a fun, stylistic-yet-organic way that raises the stakes constantly and leaves you in awe of the spectacle. However, the problem with this is that his script sometimes goes too far, and tries to put too many ideas into play at once, leading to a frankly muddled and poorly-paced first act. In fact, so muddled and poorly-paced, the film almost lost me. And in a weird way, I think Whedon's experiences with television were a part of my issues- the film feels a little too ""episodic"" up front as well, which threw me off. Thankfully, the problems with the pacing ended by the 45-minute mark, and the ensuing 60+ minutes of screen time were pure geeky joy.<br/><br/>The acting is all around fantastic. There's no need to really comment on the returning cast (including Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlet Johannsen, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle and Samuel L. Jackson, among others), as they are all so in-tune with their characters, they come off flawless as ever. Although I appreciated that more focus was given to the ""secondary"" players like Renner's Hawkeye, rather than just having it be the ""Iron Man and friends"" show as I had feared. Everyone is given equal screen time and all shine.<br/><br/>The new cast-members are generally wonderful. Particularly James Spader's Ultron- a bizarrely contradictory character who is both demented prophet and rebellious child. It's really fun seeing Ultron- who let's face it, is basically a newborn accustomed to throwing tantrums and suffering great delusions of grandeur, as he develops over the course of the film. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are also fairly compelling in their roles as the Maximoff twins, though I will say I feel Olsen often outshined Taylor-Johnson as the beautiful and tormented Scarlet Witch. I think the big problem is that only a year ago, we saw Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver portrayed, frankly with much more gusto and originality in the film ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" (Though the films aren't connected- they merely both have their own versions of the same character.)<br/><br/>The effects and action are absolutely top-notch. And they more than make up for some of my other grievances. From a wonderful opening single-shot action sequence, to the mythical ""Hulkbuster"" fight to the long and intense climax- this film is definitely one to give you constant thrills. Some may feel the film suffers from action- overload, and I will admit, there was one fight-scene that felt a little contrived, but they're just so much fun and so well-structured (as they make good use of the actual CHARACTERS and show their emotional states throughout), I didn't mind.<br/><br/>The rest of the production is fantastic. Especially the musical score courtesy of Danny Elfman and Brian Taylor. Great soundtrack than not only includes new themes, but also includes enough callbacks to Alan Silvestri's magnificent score from the original to keep a sense of audible continuity between the two films. (Call me a geek, but I prefer it when films in a series have recurring themes... something not many sequels these days do.)<br/><br/>Overall, I was very satisfied with ""Age of Ultron"", while still being able to admit it's flawed. Sure, the first 45 minutes had a lot of issues, and the film moves a bit too fast and clunky... but I was having too much fun to care!<br/><br/>I give it a solid 7.5 out of 10. Assemble in line at the cinema and see it for great thrills and great laughs!"
"zeynep_acar","7","4","10","27 April 2015"," Not as good as first one
","I was looking forward to this as I really liked the first film but for me this isn't as good unfortunately. <br/><br/>What made first Avengers special was that, it delivered a very good story around morals, egos, personalities with a very good sense of humour while everyone was expecting just an action movie. It was cleverly written. A bit like the Iron Man 3. <br/><br/>This film gives us the expected action but not the story that I would have thought. It had the potential but it wasn't explored and lost to pure action. Still a good movie but wouldn't make me watch it second or third time like I did with the first one. <br/><br/>I do hope marvel pays more attention to good quality script going forward that brings out the vulnerabilities of human beings, conflicts of good and bad in people whether they are superheroes or not. Action films sells but cleverly written actions would also stay around a lot longer I think."
"kapseamit","5","4","10","26 April 2015"," This movie has a very Boring Concept of Robot being Villain.
","Ultron Villain is so boring,he is not worthy villain,i will never watch avengers again unless Thanos comes,Robots are too boring,there are so many Hollywood movies with same concept,please Hollywood stop this boring concept. The director was short of ideas of creating worthy villain and he plot the story of Iron man creating Ultron,stop this boring thing. Instead they should have bring Galactus,Thanos or something out of space villain,this robot thing is beyond able to watch again.Director should not have made this movie,i will never watch AOU again,my recommendation was not liked by my few friends who said this are same Hollywood boring style movies,why. Even human looking Loki has good presence value than this kid Ultron."
"yannigk","8","4","10","26 April 2015"," Joss Whedon is a genius
","Assembling 6 avengers, plus Nick Fury, was a tough feat in the first one. How Joss manages to outdo himself by adding everybody.. And I mean EVERYBODY even if they only had a short screen time.. Into a 2.5hrs movie is beyond me. <br/><br/>People take for granted good scripts. Having more than 5 strong characters to talk or have a funny banter is just plain crazy. Add action, explosions, backstories, humor, wit, in a coherent and cohesive way without letting the audience lose the train of thought is simply an amazing feat. <br/><br/>The dialogues are amazingly clever. By clever I mean they dumb it down enough for non comic readers to pick up where things were and St the same time assumes the audience are intelligent enough to 'get it'. The conversation between Banner and Romanoff was deep and the build up was all between the lines. Everything is implied and never in your face (except after you already got it).<br/><br/>The film runs slightly on the long side, but I can't think of how it could be shorter. Everything builds up just enough for the finale. And the last 30minutes after the creation of Vision made it all worth it. <br/><br/>If you haven't seen it you should, because this is the biggest most marvellous mega jumbo huge blockbuster of the year. Just look at the destruction! I have no idea how they are going to top this. <br/><br/>SPOILERS/RANT BELOW<br/><br/>The humor! Oh! Iron man saying that high pitched sorry was hilarious! <br/><br/>The deaths (including Romanoff lost chances) made me scream ""Nooooooooooooo!"" inside. Each had their own build up very well written and shown so that we care a lot when they died. <br/><br/>Anyone else sad when Jarvis, the computer programme, died? Noooooo<br/><br/>And Vision. Well what a vision! I need to rewatch this."
"ishan-aziz","7","4","10","26 April 2015"," A whole lot of fun but too inconsequential
","I should start of by saying that this is definitely a good movie. Over all it's probably a better movie that the first avengers. The problem with this movie is that is doesn't fit into the series nearly as well as the first one did. <br/><br/>The first Avengers was a little lacking in plot but it was a blast and, most importantly, by the time the film ended, you felt truly excited about the MCU because the film had completely changed the landscape of this world. And in that sentence lies the main problem with with movie. It feels too inconsequential. By the time the movie ends I didn't feel nearly as excited or interested in the MCU as I wanted to be. Because despite all the conflict that happens in the film, by the time the credits role everything feels basically the same as it did at the beginning of the movie. Everyone is still friends and everyone who was present at the beginning of the movie is still alive. And that's fine if you're making Iron Man 4 but it isn't if you are making an Avengers film. And to discuss this I kinda have to go into spoiler territory. <br/><br/>So in the film Tony Stark invents Ultron, an AI that goes crazy and starts trying to kill people. Now I'll get to my problems with Ultron as a villain in a second but my main problem with this is that Stark faces no real consequences for his actions. At the end of the film him and Cap are still great friends. And this might be fine if the next movie in the series wasn't Civil War. In Civil War we already know that there is going to be conflict between Iron Man and Captain America. So that means that in Age of Ultron Marvel had a great opportunity to create meaningful animosity between these two characters and in doing so make both character's more layered and interesting. But they wasted this opportunity in order to make a happy ending. <br/><br/>Now I could talk more about how overly self-contained this film feels but I feel like you get the point. So let's get to another aspect for me to get nitpicky about. The villain. The trailers of this movie sold me on Ultron, the maniacally AI with an half an oedipus complex as voiced by the incomparable James Spader. And I mean that's kinda what I got but I found that I was heavily disappointed with his lack of complexity. As a character I never felt like I really understood what was driving him to be so villainous. It just annoys me that the film couldn't give me a meaningful reason why this machine was acting the way it was. There is a vague cliché notion presented that it sees humans as too violent and to have peace it must destroy them all but even that isn't really presented properly. Over all Ultron ended up feeling like an excellent performance and some well written dialog that was undercut by a very simplistic and kinda cliché character.<br/><br/>Now I think I'm sounding far too whiny so I'll get to what I really liked about the film. And there are two main character based elements that I LOVED in Age of Ultron. Hawkeye in this movie was excellent. The writers took everything that made the character seem kinda lame in the first movie and turned it on it's head to make him probably the most likable character in the team. To explain I have to go into spoiler territory again. Basically mid way through the film Hawkeye takes the team to what he calls 'a safehouse' where we meet his family for the first time. And it is such a great moment because it takes all the times that people have complained about him being 'just a guy with a bow and arrow' and makes it his best feature. The fact that he is so regular shows that, unlike all the gods and monsters he pals around with, he has something really meaningful to loose. <br/><br/>Now to the second element that was really great in this movie. The Vision. Paul Bettany pulls of a great, reserved performance that made the character truly feel like a perfect halfway point between human and robot (kinda the way I wish Ultron seemed). The design of the character is also completely flawless. I can't be completely sure but I it honestly seemed like his face at least was solely done with make-up and it made the character look truly tangible <br/><br/>These weren't the only good things in the movie however. Quicksliver was pretty cool but Scarlet Witch was honestly quite fantastic. Elizabeth Olsen came across as truly threatening while still being somewhat relatable. The action was very entertaining however I'm honestly looking forward to the Russo brothers taking charge as I reckon they can create more grounded fight scenes as opposed to the Whedon extravaganzas that are feeling a tad excessive at this point. I also thought that the Banner-Black Widow romance worked well enough, although I think it would have been less intrusive if it was an established element in the universe.<br/><br/>I get the feeling a lot of my problems with the film come from what I wanted it to be and not what it actually was. Going into it I was expecting Marvel's answer to 'Empire Strikes Back' and although I didn't get what I was looking for, a film that raises the stakes and makes our characters more conflicted and complex, I still got an exciting film full of dynamic, likable heroes. Over all, I'd say go see the film. If you like Marvel films you'll like this one, just don't expect something that is going to really deepen the universe or excite you for future films like the first Avengers did."
"oscarsorensson","6","4","10","26 April 2015"," Age of Ultron, the first big mistake from Marvel.
","This review contains spoilers!<br/><br/>I was excited for this film. I don't love the first Avengers movie but it was really good, and the trailers for this one had me pumped. It seemed like a darker movie, with a strong villain. But we were mislead to believe that.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron contains so much content, and the movie suffers because of it. You can't find the read thread that should be the pillar of this film. Instead, it's just packed with unnecessary scenes that sidetrack the audience.<br/><br/>The movie opens with the Avengers attacking a Hydra base under the command of baron Von Strucker. If you see this film in 3D like I did, you will notice how ""off"" the action looks. They get inside the base and retrieve Loki's weapon from the first movie. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are also inside the base ( working for the baron) and Scarlet Witch works her magic on Stark, but the job gets done.<br/><br/>Once back in Stark Tower the team celebrates with a party, and this is when we are introduced to a passion project Tony has. It's called Ultron, and it's a peacekeeping program. Jarvis can't get the work done to launch it, so Tony and Bruce use Loki's weapon to get the job done. This is typical comic-book movie science right here.<br/><br/>Ultron comes to life, but he is not what they expected. His focus is saving the world, but he believes that the population must die in order to do that. So he sends a couple of robots on the team and flee. <br/><br/>The rest of the movie is just a big mix of everything, sure there are some good scenes, like the fight between the Hulk and the Hulk-buster, but the majority of the film makes little sense, and it doesn't feel like an Avengers movie. The humor is not as good and character development is lacking, and when there is development it's bad, like the forced love drama between Black Widow and Banner. Ultron is a pretty weak villain, he has some good jokes but he never feels dangerous enough. The third act is just an overload of CGI and despite the fact that it's supposed to be the climax of the movie it just feels tiresome and drawn out. <br/><br/>However, something that stands out to me is Hawkeye. He was poorly used in the first one but he really gets to shine in Age of Ultron. But this film contains more negatives than positives for me.<br/><br/>The director has admitted to feeling tired during the process of this movie, and sadly you can tell when you watch it. This movie is bad by Marvels high standards. It will still make a lot of money, but if you are a person that likes to analyze movies and can separate good from bad ones you wont be pleased by this one, sadly."
"tinovalkki","6","4","10","26 April 2015"," Digital and sound effect extravaganza...
","Do you remember the time you were child and you ate something good so much, that your stomach became sick? Can you still remember the time you got an idea which was too hard to execute? What about a time you promised to start exercise and finished it way before you started it? And do you remember that morning after when you had the worst hang over and you promised never again to drink that last beer and find yourself from pub with pint of lager next day? All those promises and movie Avengers, Age of Ultron combines the same thing. If you are not totally devoted you simply can't fulfil everything you promised to yourself. Avengers, Age of Ultron is like the promise you made. It is so stupid, that if you are not a total fan of series it is totally too much. At the same time it is so enjoyable to watch that you just can't stop watching it. There are simply too many characters that it is impossible to concentrate to tell a valid story. If you can enjoy two hours of effect rumble or if you are a total fan of Marvel comic book books you definitely can enjoy this movie. Avengers, Age of Ultron is just a turbo loaded action flick, nothing more or nothing less. I'm sure it will get it audience who are willing to pay the price of a movie ticket. As long as people do this you will get what you want. But one day, I am sure, some studio will fall from sky and hard, when people won't find these digital effect rumble any more satisfied enough. If you can enjoy enough of great digital effects without a decent story, you will find this very satisfying. If you need even a little use for your brain it is smart to avoid this movie."
"smg242","6","4","10","26 April 2015"," Liked it more than the first one. Doesn't mean it's better though.
","The first Avengers film was more of an cinematic accomplishment of bringing together different heroes who had their backstories and characters set up in their own movies, and pitting them against the threat of an alien attack led by the notorious, ever-entertaining Norse God of Mischief, Loki. However, it still had its moments. Hulk throwing Loki around, that epic moment when he says that he's 'always angry', Iron Man's unforgettable response to Captain America's 'just a man in a suit' remark, among many others. One of the complaints I have about this movie is that it lacks some of that. Sure, there are epic and funny moments throughout the film, it's just that they aren't as impactful, and are lesser in amount. I was also hoping to see Andy Serkis in mo-cap for this movie, but his Ulysses Klaw was a pretty wasted effort. Less screen time, and no impact whatsoever. Sure, he'll have a bigger role in the Black Panther movie, but it just seemed dumb to have him in this film.<br/><br/>However, barring that, I loved the rest of the movie, from a storytelling and visual standpoint. The Avengers are all back, and yes, to those of you who thought that Hawkeye wasn't done enough justice in the previous films, he is in this film and he is simply awesome. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye is commendable, this is the best I've seen him act throughout the movies. The twins, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are also a part of the movie, and I can definitely say for sure that I liked how they handled these two characters, especially Quicksilver. The Vision, also a new character, is a delight to see. He's like Marvel's version of an android Superman. In the midst of all these superheroes with very specific powers, it is definitely cool to see Vision kicking butt with little effort.<br/><br/>And this is where I think the film really succeeds: the tone, the direction, Ultron and Danny Elfman's score. The tone of the movie is darker than the first, yet Whedon doesn't go too far with this grim undertone, and sticks to what made the Avengers movies work: it being generally lighter, with an emphasis on the humor and the visuals. You'll notice how the trailers lean on showing Ultron as this evil, chaotic, humorless robot overlord, but this isn't the case, and it makes him all the more believable and appealing. James Spader as Ultron definitely knocked it out of the park. Without a doubt, Ultron is one of the greater villains to come out of the Marvel movies. Also, Danny Elfman took the score to the first movie and improved on it by miles. Him and Brian Tyler have definitely outdone the first movie music- wise.<br/><br/>Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is quite good. Maybe not quite better than the first movie, but I liked this one a little bit more. Sure, it doesn't reach the heights of Iron Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, at least for me, but it's still up there. This is more of a chapter forward in the Marvel Cinematic Universe than most of the other films, and it sets up quite a lot for things to come in this series. And for that, it's really good. It does a good job at introducing all these different, newer characters into the universe.<br/><br/>Also, if you are like me and just got a hangover of Marvel's seminal Daredevil series, please don't expect that from any of the movies. I doubt they will reach that kind of quality anytime soon cinematically. I do wonder how Daredevil and the Defenders might meet with all these Avengers, and the Guardians of the Galaxy. I guess we'll just have to see..."

","I am not a fan of comic movies in general, but I always like good action movies and good origin stories of heroes.<br/><br/>A friend of mine wanted to see this movie and I went along, because I have seen the previous movies, which were not so bad. I liked most of the Captain America movies and some of the Iron Man movies.<br/><br/>This movie is a nice CGI orgy, but nothing more.<br/><br/>The story is confusing, because there is no story at all.<br/><br/>They try to use all the characters somehow, but they fail to make real story lines for them and because there are too many characters, nobody can go real deep.<br/><br/>They even bring two new characters into the movie, if there were not enough yet.<br/><br/>I never really liked the Avengers movies, because it's too much of everything and this one was the worse of it until now.<br/><br/>Too many robots, to many characters, too many story lines. Everything is thrown in randomly and taken from thin air.<br/><br/>Sometimes I was wondering, which scene was cut out to make it ""shorter"".<br/><br/>Dialogues are either ""funny"" (never laughed, maybe I got a tired smile) or try to be deep and dramatic, but get only dumb and meaningless blah-blah.<br/><br/>I don't know who is writing these scripts nowadays for these kind of movies, but they should choose another profession.

","Plus Points : The big star cast of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson),The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are the biggest attractions for the film and they have done their part. A nice new romantic thread involving The Hulk and Black Widow delivers some of the best moments in the film. There are lots of action sequences and tons of robots flying around in the movie. Fans of these sequences will be thrilled. The Iron Man vs Hulk battle has been shot well.<br/><br/>Minus Points : The movie has no soul. There is no riveting screenplay to back up the action. In Avengers part 1, the action had a great subplot and the pace was fantastic. In this edition of the Avenger, that is missing. The main thread of Ultron going rogue is very old and predictable. In fact,The strategy employed by Ultron for earth's destruction is not very effective in terms of shock value. The length of the movie becomes painfully obvious after a point and there is nothing much to hold your attention. Even the climax fight is not 'Avengers' worthy.<br/><br/>and in technical aspects - Special Effects team did a very nice job and the graphics work in the movie is top notch. You can't make out any artificial shots even if you try hard. 3D effects are just about OK. Background music complements the scenes well. Joss Whedon's direction is a bit of a hit and miss. Some scenes are nice but the overall movie lacks the soul of the original. Avengers Part one was almost a masterpiece when it comes to packaging a superhero film. This is not the case here.<br/><br/>My verdict:- avengers : Age of Ultron is a decent film but it is not a worthy sequel to 'The Avengers'. It is not as entertaining and that is the biggest flaw of this film. There are action scenes that will satisfy hardcore fans. Watch it with very low expectations."

","Everyone want to see a movie with huge action sequences overloaded in superhero movies.since the avenger part 1 gives us but the second part is even more awesome.No one cannot regret the movie.All credits goes to Josh Whedon.He done a fabulous job once again with avengers group is too good.The story plot revolves around the Ultron a evil one who want to defeat the avengers and want to bring the world to his hand.the flaws of this movie is u felt it could have been done a little bit better.The villain is more powerful in this movie but ended in simple way.Another two members are introduce in this group who are first with the villain and comes in with the avengers.The shield group leader Samuel Jackson comes after the half of the movie to help the avengers and help to save the world.so everyone want to see this movie only in theaters if u didn't u felt sorry for that.Everyone have a great weekend with your friends and family."

","Thankfully we have Daredevil to be grateful for already, which softens the blow that is Avengers: Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>There were some nice moments in the film I could appreciate but these elements are spoiler filled. The CGI was dreadful in the first act. I had my hands covering my face in shock at how bad it looked (and I watched this in '2-D'). The one liners were cringe-worthy and they just kept on coming.<br/><br/>The bad reviews were generally justified. This film is a mess. By no means another Iron Man 3. There wasn't so much an issue with the story they wanted to tell, rather the way it was told. If you weren't up for it Joss Whedon, I'd have respected you more to pull out instead of making this average at best blockbuster flick. <br/><br/>2014 was an amazing year for Marvel, with James Gunn and the Russo Brothers bringing refreshing new elements to the franchise. Let's hope they can pick up where they left for Phase 3."
"food-movies-sleep","6","4","10","24 April 2015"," The Age of Super Heroes vs. Super Villains
","Seems like the plan is set. First decide on a crazy villain. He wants to conquer earth/universe or destroy everything. Then design heroes to fight them. If there is only one or two heroes keep things simple- say 10 henchmen and a simple device of destruction and finally save the save world. If there are a handful of heroes, then throw in a zillion henchmen, up the ante with technical mumbo-jumbo, and if possible kill a character along the way (appealing to emotions apparently), and save the world anyway. Oh. Write in some dialogues on the issue of right vs. wrong. And with many characters around the focus is not anymore about what is right or what is wrong but rather who is right and who is wrong.<br/><br/>In India, the audience might watch avengers and say ""Full Paisa Vasool""(recovered my money) but the movie makers are saying ""Fool!! Paisa Vasool"". I am just plain angry that all these high budget movies offer nothing that wants us to revisit movies. All they offer is a one time watch spectacle.<br/><br/>And that is where I keep falling for the bait every time. Marvel is spectacular at spectacles! They openly declare that they are serving us junk food and they make the junk so delicious that we are willing to forgive them for not making it one bit healthy. And that is where Marvel has so far got it right. They understand that mixing junk with healthy stuff neither gets the taste right nor the health. And I watch marvel films for my dose of no holds barred junk. And Age of ultron is finger licking good!! <br/><br/>Would definitely recommend a one time watch."

","Following Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014), the team storms Struecker's mansion, reclaiming Loki's scepter as Tony gets Scarlet Witch's mind poking. Clint gets injured facing Quicksilver. Hawkeye gets healed using Dr. Helen Cho's tissue generating cradle. With data from the scepter's gem Tony gets Bruce to create a peacekeeping AI Ultron. Instead, Ultron goes haywire and tries to kill The Avengers. Ultron makes body copies, spreads through the internet, then flees with Loki's scepter. Ultron tracks Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and recruits them saying they are after the same peace. They track Ultron at Wakanda. But Scarlet Witch tricks the entire team except Hawkeye. The worst effect is to Hulk, who then rages through the city, with only Iron Man using a special Hulkbuster armor manages to pacify him. Low at morale, the team retreats to a safe house, Clint's home. They realign themselves but Thor separates himself and seeks Erik Selvig for help. Nick Fury comes to the team with information.<br/><br/>They find they've forgotten Dr. Cho. It turns out that Ultron hypnotized her into using the cradle to create a vibranium enhanced body, to which he'll insert himself as the consciousness. As the body, his vision, nears completion, Ultron takes the gem from Loki's scepter and put it at Vision's forehead. The Avengers crashes the lab and Ultron flees. Previously unable to read Ultron's mind due to his inorganic origin, now she can as Ultron's mind is being downloaded into the body. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver detach from Ultron and helps The Avenegers from the fallout of Ultron's escape. They eventually gain the body but Ultron kidnaps Black Widow. Hawkeye brings the body to Tony who intends to give it live, injecting JARVIS as it's consciousness. Steve objects to it but Thor comes and charges lightning onto the cradle, giving life to Vision. Vision states he's not Ultron nor JARVIS but entirely his own being. He tracks Ultron back to Sokovia, so they heads out to confront him and rescue Black Widow.<br/><br/>They arrive at Sokovia and evacuate civilians out. But when they face Ultron, who has built an army of copies, they find out his real plan; levitating the whole Sokovia city with jet propulsion, and crash it down from a certain height, creating the effect of the meteor which wiped the dinosaurs out. The team fight to protect civilians but the city is already sky high. Nick Fury comes with the old SHIELD heli-carrier and transports the remaining civilians. The Avenegers then protects the propulsion core from Ultron so he doesn't disable it to crash the rock down. Quicksilver gets shot and dies. Scarlet Witch feels it and lets down her guard as an Ultron copy kills the core. Iron Man and Thor team up to crack and split the rock down. When finally Ultron runs out of copies, he flees the scene and Vision catches up to him and finishes him out.<br/><br/>The story as a whole is typical of any Marvel movie. But the screenplay is in fact very well thought of. I really like how the script quotes from the Bible evenly for the misguided mind as Ultron's and for the righteous mind as Vision's. Presence of humor throughout and Stan Lee's cameo return as signatures, minus a real post credit scene.<br/><br/>One thing that I feel as this movie's disappointment is those promotional clips, and early shed details have showed so much that it feels that there's only little surprise left in the story elements. Although I should say the Hawkeye twist is a neat one. The other thing that feels weird is how Natasha Romanoff is placed in connection to previous movies. She's with Bruce Banner here, when instead we saw her implying something with Hawkeye at the first Avengers movie, and last year with Steve Rogers in The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>The movie feels a bit nagging because the smaller details don't add up. The thing in the trailers about the African American woman in the pool where Thor takes a dip didn't appear anywhere in the movie. There's also Thor dialog saying there's already four Infinity Gems out, without any mention of any Asgardian knowing about the events of Guardians of the Galaxy. Also there's the sudden term change in referring to super-humans, from 'miracles' in The Winter Soldier's post credit scene, to 'enhanceds' in here.<br/><br/>The characters feel more deeply developed, and that's good. Through a certain story element we get to see the heroes' deep dark thoughts and their responses to them. Sadly this isn't also applied very much on the villain Ultron as his animosity only shouts out through his witty dialog lines and sinister voice of James Spader. Yes he thinks as fast as electricity itself as he's an AI. But this feels inadequate and makes the movie rather shallow in regards of what drives th villain.<br/><br/>The action scenes are as promised in the trailers, epic. The opening sequence on Struecker's mansion a nice set-piece that feels very much flowing even though it has so many camera and focus change points between the characters. I really enjoyed the Hulk vs Hulkbuster sequence. Even though the trailers have been showing much, but the fight's end is really an epic sight.<br/><br/>The action overall is quite nice. The main characters can really keep their characters and weave themselves into the the story with them. The added heroes also had their acting pieced together neatly by the good directing job. James Spader can really use his voice to compensate more on the lack of character deepening. Having Andy Serkis serves good in bridging on to the next Captain America or Black Panther movie.<br/><br/>My view for Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) is a score of 7 out of 10 and a surefire recommendation to go and enjoy it in the cinemas."
"dandare4479","7","4","10","23 April 2015"," Avengers : Age of Repetition
","Avengers age of Ultron fails to deliver topping the original Avengers movie. On a positive note it is an entertaining movie blockbuster very similar to the original except the action and humour are not as sharp as the previous instalment. There is a darker tone to this film then the previous entry, but in some ways not dark enough.It is hard to explain but something just seems very disjointed this time around our main heroes never seem emotionally engaged or in any kind of real danger like I feel they should be, maybe this is down to Ultron being a Cgi character as opposed to Loki being human in the original, maybe the actors found it hard too interact with an army of Cgi robots all the time. After the great Winter Solider last year I had high hopes for the Avengers age of Ultron. I am glad that the Russo brothers will be taking over from Joss Whedon after this film, he made a great first Avengers film but should of had the foresight to create something different this time rather then make a sequel like so many other sequels that just fall flat, he has admitted having a nightmare while making this movie and I think it shows. However it will still be a financial success because of the brand. New characters Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are welcome additions, but still fail to add any emotional depth to the film. Scarlett Witch is given better material to work with then Quicksilver. I am sure the future will still be bright for the Avengers, especially after Civil War next year. Overall maybe Marvel and Disney's first stumble so far in this series after the fabulous Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy last year."
"tristennerd","10","5","14","9 May 2015"," Avengers: Age Of Ultron does not disappoint
","Avengers: Age Of Ultron is the best Marvel movie to date. While its run time is 2:12, it does not feel that long at all, in fact it felt like I was only in the theater for a fraction of the time. Right from the beginning we are treated to what Marvel does best, action sequences. The beginning of Ultron showcases each Avenger and each of their unique abilities in a way no one will forget. The movie is filled with humor, and you shouldn't leave the theater without having at least chuckled once or twice. The lulls in the movie are at a maximum only 10 to 15 minutes long each, then it sends you right back into the action. The whole movie keeps you on the edge of your seat and there is no shortage of good old Avengers fighting. The end is a bit similar to the end of the first Avengers in the sense that they are all fighting faceless enemies, but it doesn't hurt the movie at all. My only complaints about the movie would be the lack of screen time for both The Hulk and Ultron. The Hulk is one of my personal favorites, and while he is in one of the best scenes of the movie, it doesn't make up for the fact that he only has a maximum on 15 minutes screen time. Ultron, while he has more than 15 minutes, doesn't get enough time on screen to fully explain why hes doing what hes doing. While he briefly describes what his plan is and his motives, you are still left with only a very vague description. Ultron is such a cool villain you are left craving more of him, but sadly what we get is what we get. Over all i would give Avengers: Age of Ultron an 8/10. It is a great watch and one of the best movies of 2015 so far."
"khanbaliq2","8","5","14","7 May 2015"," The haters are wrong. Avengers: Age Of Ultron is another fantastic Marvel film.
","When I was in a movie theater waiting for Avengers: Age Of Ultron to begin playing, I had low expectations for the film. I've read the reviews online, and many people were saying that Age Of Ultron is dumb, boring and overstuffed with mindless action. In other words, they were saying that this is Marvel's first turkey. So there I was sitting and expecting the worst. After what seemed like half an hour of commercials and trailers, the film began with thrilling action, with the Avengers on a mission. During the fighting new characters were introduced and their powers were demonstrated. This set up everything that followed. I definitely enjoyed the opening act. But wait, some reviewers mentioned that there's a dull middle section after the thrilling opening. So I kept on waiting for the film to get stuck in the mud. An hour passed and Age Of Ultron continued to entertain. In fact, even though the film is over 2 hours long, the time just flies by. After an hour passed I began to realize that the reviewers were wrong or that they were judging the film harshly. I'm pleased to say that Age Of Ultron is another success for Marvel Studios. Actually, I wasn't even thinking about this much because the film kept my attention until the very end. Sure, it's a Hollywood product, but it's a Hollywood product written and directed by Joss Whedon. So Whedon once again delivered what he should have delivered - a real superhero movie. People seem to forget that Age Of Ultron is a superhero movie. It's not The Godfather (1972). It's not Chinatown (1974). And it's not serious science-fiction like Solaris (1972). It's a film based on comic book material. And it delivers what it should - action, comedy, special-effects, fantastic characters and a world under threat. By the way, Whedon delivered all this with intelligence and style. The Avengers - Iron Man, Thor, Hulk, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye - are as good as ever. Their interactions are witty, fun and dramatic when needed. The new characters - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - are welcome additions. They're played well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. But there's also Vision (Paul Bettany), whose role in the film is almost as important as that of the villain Ultron (James Spader). So I've got to say that this film really surprised me. It's even more entertaining than The Avengers (2012). It may not be better than the first Avengers film, but it's another solid entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. After the impressive Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) I was a bit disappointed by Guardians Of The Galaxy (2014). After watching Age Of Ultron I had the same feeling that I got after watching The Winter Soldier - that things can only go up from here. I definitely recommend Age Of Ultron, and I can't wait to see it again myself. The battle at the end was amazing too by the way."

","Slightly hamstrung as building block for future Marvel Cinematic universe, narrative problems and its into the unknown script.

While heroes are given equal amount of time and especially more screen time to hawk eye (Jeremy Renner), than last one. Age of Ulton does wins over thrilling editing, CGI and amazing Imax 3D. however this time music takes backseat! Honestly Alan Silvestri gave much better score to The Avengers (2012) than danny elfman this time. Joss Whedon does nice job by not losing the grip over ""not-so-good' script with amazingly cheoreocgraphed action!

Joss Whedon did an amazing job, so did the crew. Can't wait for Phase 3 to start. It will be amazing. I hope that phase 3 will be the last because 3 is should be enough for Marvel. I hope that Joss Whedon stays. He always knows how to work with those stars. It was worth giving 15. Americans will love this movie. It's going to make a lot of money. And it will deserve it.

"3xHCCH","8","5","14","24 April 2015"," Superhero Saturation?
","The first Avengers film was an awesome film. It lived up to all expectations, and fans filed out of the cinema generally very happy and excited about the superhero extravaganza they had just seen. This sequel therefore had a much bigger fan expectations to fulfill. Now that the novelty of having all these heroes together has already passed, it now depends on a great story to pull this second installment through. My verdict is that while it is still a larger-than-life, visually- impressive action film, it did not exactly inspire the same level of adulation that the first one so handily developed. <br/><br/>The adventure starts in a fictional European country of Sokovia where the Avengers were attacking the Hydra lair to retrieve Loki's scepter. The blue stone in that scepter contain powerful artificial intelligence technology which Tony Stark and Bruce Banner uses to create Ultron, the ultimate peace-keeper for the world. Ironically however, Ultron believes that humanity needs to be eradicated in order to achieve peace. <br/><br/>Ultron recruits the powerful Maximoff twins, super-speedy Pietro and telepathic Wanda, who have an axe to grind against Tony Stark. The action reaches a peak back in Sokovia where Ultron develops a machine to lift a huge segment of the city up to the sky with the intent of dropping it down to cause global annihilation. Together with new allies they pick up along the way, the Avengers have to regroup and gather their forces together in order to foil Ultron's twisted quest for human extinction.<br/><br/>While the requisite bad-ass fight scenes and humorous zingers are still there, but there was something I can't exactly put my finger on that affected my enjoyment of the film overall. Maybe it was the sheer number of characters we need to focus on so the storytelling can be messy at points. Every character had their own personal issues to address, such that some parts of the film tended to lag down. Maybe it was how Thor seemingly became the unexpected comic relief for the film. Maybe it was how I was not used to seeing Natasha as a hopeless romantic or as a damsel in distress. I don't know, I enjoyed the film for sure, but there was just something amiss somewhere.<br/><br/>I did like the part where we see Clint Barton's home and meet his family. We get to see the super-archer in a much different light and these scenes gave Jeremy Renner his moment to shine after being underused in the first film. Strangely for a film with so many characters, Hawkeye is the ONLY one in whom you can connect emotionally.<br/><br/>I liked the new characters this film introduced to us. The Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen) is a very powerful heroine with awesome abilities. It should be interesting how her character will develop future films. The scenes building up to the birth of Vision are positively sublime -- so well done! Paul Bettany transitioned from being the voice of JARVIS to his personification as Vision very fluidly. The main antagonist Ultron was voiced with buttery calm by James Spader. I admit I felt there was some disconnect between the coolness of the voice with the expectation of pure nefariousness for this villain. <br/><br/>There was a short extra scene in the middle of the end credits featuring an Infinity Gauntlet and one character whom we last saw in ""Guardians of the Galaxy"". I thought I would see more though. And no, to the disappointment of fans who patiently waited, there was no second extra scene at the very end of the credits. There was only the promise that ""The Avengers will return"". That return is reportedly going to be in May 2018.<br/><br/>Overall, this is still one big bang of a film. Those dynamically blocked and executed sequences where all the Avengers were fighting side-by-side were a joy to watch. Writer-director Joss Whedon tried his best to weave together a fan-friendly, action-filled film with more than 10 superheroes, yet still managing to maintain some sort of story coherence, while connecting to past and future Marvel films revolving around this universe. <br/><br/>But I think the decision to relinquish the directorial reins of the next Avengers films to the Russo Brothers (who did an excellent job in ""Captain America:The Winter Soldier"") may be a good idea in order to inject some fresher ideas before more signs of franchise fatigue start to show. 8/10."

","AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON<br/><br/>At last, the moment we've all been waiting for. Avengers: Age of Ultron is officially released in theaters, as expected this will be box office, no doubt. So, to us who's seen it already, how did it go?<br/><br/>Common this is the great Joss Whedon, the mastermind of the first Avengers film. He wrote, directed, and pretty much did everything else behind the camera for this Avengers' sequel. Did you think that's too much for just one person to handle? Maybe that's right or maybe I'm wrong. There is too much going on with this sequel, new characters being introduced, back story that needed attention, and so many question that may never be answered. So it is too much, but you're still left out like something is missing.<br/><br/>As I said the movie is jumped-pack. It is as always our summer blockbuster movie, filled with many superheroes, action sequences, great story and plot. So I had a splash of that Marvel fever, but by the end of the movie, questions starts popping out; ""What happened to Tony Stark after Iron Man 3? How did he go back to being Iron man?"", ""How did Cap became the boss suddenly?"", ""Why did Vision had so little screen time?"", ""Why did Quicksilver had to die?"" (Oopps! Sorry. More spoilers to come.) ""When did this Banner-Romanoff love team started, and why?""<br/><br/>Still more questions arise, ""How did Thor came up with that vision about Vision?"", ""Why didn't they show more story about the Maximoff twins?"", ""Nick Fury is again the head of shield, how?"", ""Where the hell is the post-credit scene?""<br/><br/>And then the questions stopped. I realized that this is Marvel. Perhaps these questions will be answered on the upcoming movies of Marvel, who knows.<br/><br/>Yet again, as I've mentioned this is still a great Marvel film. It opens with great action sequence continuing the battle for the remaining Hydras. They were able to possess Loki's scepter, but I guess that was part of the twin's plan. Tony and Banner being geniuses found something on that gem from the scepter, an artificial intelligence better than good old JARVIS. Through it they restarted project Ultron. Unknowingly, Ultron killed Jarvis and took over of everything. While celebrating recent victory, playing along with Thor's hammer; they were disturbed of an unwanted presence, Ultron, in the flesh. Ultron revealed how he was created, and of course, battle versus Ultron happened.<br/><br/>Yada, yada, yada that's how it started and I don't want to detail what had happened next. Overall, this movie still kicks ass, super loved the effects, great action scenes, they still offers witty remarks and great humor. I'd rate it, 8.5/10. And Joss, my man, we will miss you on Marvel, but I am pretty sure you will be back, man.<br/><br/>Next in line, the Russo brothers for Captain America: Civil War and Avengers: Infinity Wars 1 & 2. They did great on Captain America: The Winter Soldier, so I am confident they can do better. Marvel fans, Kevin Feige and Joss Whedon already said it, NO POST- CREDIT SCENE. But there is a tag."
"KineticSeoul","8","6","18","28 April 2015"," More of a hit than a miss!
","This is one of those movies that actually met my expectations. It's probably the best action movie of 2015 so far. And when I say action for this movie, there is LOTS and LOTS of action. I can't say it's the best superheroes movie so far, but it takes the cake when it comes to the most action sequences so far. Joss Whedon really wanted to deliver to the comic book fans the super action piled upon action superheroes experience. Plus this probably has the biggest budget for a superheroes movie so far, so for the most part it delivers. Although the action sort of feels tiresome after a while, since like I said it's action after action. Without it giving a breather, except that very slow moving middle section. Tony Stark/Iron Man is once again the main main character this time around once again. Not in the level of Wolverine to the X-Men but most of the story revolves around him. Even if there is a reason for that, it goes in a direction where he is the key player. While Captain America seemed to not have that many good parts as the leader and the master tactitician of the team. Instead Joss Whedon takes some pokes at him a bit. I don't like to come up with assumptions, but I guess that has to do with the fact that Cap is a Christian and Tony is an atheist. Plus Tony has that enticing and flashy image going for him, which is a super plus when it comes to the media. And no I am not a fan of Captain America, although I want him to win in the Civil War movie against Iron Man. I think Joss Whedon did the best he could to give each team members a bit of screen time and few moments to shine. There is a lot of grandscale action sequences but like I said it gets tiresome after a while, most of the audience in the theater seemed numb after a while. When it comes to fights though, I personally thought Hulk vs. Hulkbuster was the highlight. It really wasn't a necessary fight and the plot could have moved along without it. But I can't complain because it was just badass. The action sequences does seem to have some editing problems when the action gets too chaotic. The plot was hit and miss with it mostly being a hit. Going in a slightly more complex direction may seem like a good idea, but it doesn't really work this time around because at it's core it's still a very simple story. The plot is basically by the numbers and didn't seem to flow very naturally, but that is only a very small gripe. There was this one part where the Korean audiences geeked out. The thing about Korean audiences is that they are usually very respectful and mostly very quite during an event, such as watching a movie. But they geeked out in one or two parts. Personally I like to go to a packed theater, where you can be in the moment and enjoy the reactions from other audiences. And I don't mean being rude, like constantly having a conversation or texting away (which is something you will not see amongst Korean audiences in theaters in Korea). But being able to enjoy the moment and show what appeals to our senses is one of the benefits of going to a theater in my opinion. Overall this will be one of the biggest and grandscale blockbuster popcorn flick for year 2015. So yeah, take some friends and family, have a blast. I will say that some of the cast is getting a bit old to play these parts in my opinion. With Captain America and Thor in the safe zone for now, but they are also the most vulnerable when it comes to playing these roles, because their physicality and image means everything for those characters. Not hating or anything, it's just the natural order of things. No one can stay on top forever.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I was really looking forward to Age of Ultron as I loved the first Avengers movie. I went in and came out a little disappointed. I will give the movie this: The action scenes were great, the humor was excellent and Scarlett Johansson! The negatives: It felt as though the movie was rushed. They just want to get this out of the way so they can get to Infinity War. I felt the introduction to the Maximoffs was quite wasted because of the death of Quicksilver. If you're going to bring in new characters, don't kill them off at the end of their first movie. Overall, Age of Ultron is Marvel's first misfire with a rushed plot and under use of its characters (Nick Fury for one. He's in 2 scenes) But it makes up for that with great action and humor.

","I'm old school. Superheroes movies are supposed to be fun and the superheroes themselves should be morally upright. They should stand for that old cliche - truth, justice, and the.... well that covers it well enough.<br/><br/>We are already beginning to see the moral ambiguity of Captain America: Civil War. Stark is not a good person. The end justifies the means for him and. I question if there is any line he wouldn't cross. Most of the other Avengers are not quite as ambiguous, but they cover a spectrum from Captain America at the one end to Stark.<br/><br/>The movie itself is all about ruthless destruction which inevitably leads to massive cold-blooded deaths. A few of the deaths are heartbreaking to the viewer, but why aren't they all heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Governments in the Marvel universe now begin to see that the Avengers are often as dangerous to civilians as the villains they oppose.<br/><br/>Today's media entertainment is about action at the expense of everything else.

I thought, ""okay, 'Age of Ultron' is kind of a weak and stupid title, but I won't let it ruin the movie. Who is Ultron?"" I said to myself. I then looked up the character, and I was blown away. Ultron has several cool powers and abilities, and he is indestructible. ""Wow!"" I thought: ""how will the Avengers stop him?!"" Then, I watched the teaser, and the first two official trailers. They were laid out just as I thought, with an ominous tone, and a dramatic soundtrack. The first few trailers were great, it got me excited and hyped to the max for this film. Then came the final trailer, and at that point I slowly began to realize what we were in store for. The music wasn't very dramatic, and it just felt more like a day time television commercial. I thought: ""okay, this trailer is different. Where is the dramatic and ominous tone?"" But, I didn't care, I was still going to see this movie regardless. Boy did I make a mistake! This ""movie"" is stuffed past the brim with one-liners, comedic moments, it hardly followed the original comic book stories, and at no point did I feel any tension whatsoever. I've seen many disappointing films, and this ""movie"" certainly belongs in my ""Top 10 Most Disappointing Movies"" list. I knew before I first saw the film that they changed the original story. In this ""movie"", Hank Pym doesn't create Ultron, Stark does instead. That does not follow the original story. Now of course, some movies can get away with altering the story, but that does not work in this ""movie"". However, Tony Stark does create Vision, that is comic book accurate. That's the only thing they got right in this ""movie"". But as far as Ultron goes, I could not believe how they portrayed Ultron in this ""film"". Ultron is a wuss in this ""movie"", he is practically the polar opposite of his real comic book self. He's supposed to be a cold, calculating, mindless robot. So, why does he have facial features? That moving mouth especially perplexes me, it makes him look more like an alien in a suit of armor. WHY DOES HIS MOUTH MOVE?! Sorry for repeating that question, it's just so retarded. His real character in the comics just has a red light on his face that glows when he speaks. That would've been so much better, because we, as an audience would not be able to tell what he's feeling. In that case, you wouldn't know when he was about to strike! That would have actually brought forth some level of tension for the ""film"". Another thing, when Ultron says: ""I can't physically throw up in my mouth."" (HE MUST BE THINKING ABOUT THE MOVIE ITSELF). That ""joke"" would've actually made sense if he had the glowing red light when he talks instead of that retarded moving mouth. The light would have further clarified that he does not have a mouth, and therefore he cannot throw up. That would have made the joke work, and it would have been funny! Although to be honest, just thinking about this ""movie"" makes me want to throw up. Also, Ultron has next to none of his actual comic book powers, and I was looking forward to see how those awesome powers would be utilized in this ""movie"". But no, we just get a watered down tin foil looking ""thing"". Granted, James Spader is a good choice for the voice of Ultron. What a wasted opportunity! Another thing, the plethora of one-liners in this ""film"" are abysmal, there are so many that it almost doesn't feel real. You know, you'd think after ""Batman & Robin"" (1997) contaminated the Earth with its existence, film studio producers and writers would have learned their lesson! Now, the first ""Avengers"" movie had one-liners too, but there were not nearly as many. It had the right balance between action, comedy, and drama. Unlike the sequel, the one-liners in the first Avengers film are actually funny, but in ""Age of Ultron"" they're not! Also, the acting is all over the place in this ""movie"", some good, some okay, and some bad. The soundtrack is generic, nothing special or original at all. The sets and locations are boring. Sadly, the only good thing in this ""movie"" are the special effects, and that's not saying much. Special effects are usually a given in movies since the mid 19th century. I think that the biggest reason this is my least favorite Marvel Cinematic Universe film is because the movie had so much hype and build-up for over a year, and then it amounted to nothing. Out of all 20 plus movies in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this one, by far, emotes the most anger out of me. I give it 1 out of 5 stars, which of course equates to 2 out of 10 stars on the IMDB scale. On a final note, in the ""movie"" I wanted to hear one of the main characters say: ""Avengers, assemble!"" Sure it's corny, I know. But, I think it should be warranted in one of these movies. Captain America almost says at the end, but then the end credits cut him off. I was furious! Also, for a title called ""Age"" of Ultron, we didn't even find out how old Ultron was. Yes, that's a joke, I thought that I'd end my scathing review of this ""film"" on a positive, humorous note. The ""age"" of events in this movie take place in just a few days. Whereas an ""age"" can range from a year or longer, so the title doesn't make any sense! Nothing in this ""movie"" makes sense. Stay away from this ""movie"", watch the first ""Avengers"", or ""Avengers: Infinity War"" instead!"

","I liked this movie better than the first Avengers film. The topic of singularity makes the story more interesting than the first one. The action was very fast and well done, it kept the movie upbeat and thrilling. Yet the action still overshadows the story way too much, there isn't enough time left for any character development (but still more character development than in the first movie). After all the Marvel movies i've watched i still don't feel like I really know the characters as well as I should. Out of all the Avengers i think i enjoy Thor the most, because Chris Hemsworth looks like a God, he looks royal, best casting ever.<br/><br/>I thought 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' was enjoyable and fun, but not really life-changing or original. Maybe i'm just not enough of an action fan to be in love with the Avengers movies."
"jon_garza","8","3","7","29 April 2015"," This movie is faster than Quicksilver and weirder than Scarlet Witch, but is more fun than anything you've seen before
","The best thing about Avengers: Age of Ultron, is also the worst. While Marvel followers like me will get satisfied by the excessive amount of action and super fighting, casual viewers could get lost between the intense battle and very quick references to other films from the franchise. Because even when Avengers: Age of Ultron is well crafted, can't stand on his own. It relies intensively in your knowledge of this universe and his colorful characters. It works as a sequel, but doesn't really move things forward, the villain, Ultron, for example, comes vaguely as a consequence of the Chitauri invasion from the last movie, but his presence don't really change anything, like other expendable villains in the MCU (Iron Monger, Whiplash, Killian, Red Skull, Malekith, Ronan, etc.), Ultron comes fast and goes even faster. The plot points are so many and the narrative is so fast that you can't hold a thought or really care about anything.<br/><br/>In the bright side, there's a lot of extended cameos and easter eggs, this is the most interconnected movie of the MCU so far. Also, this film introduces big players to the universe with Scarlett Witch, Quicksilver and of course The Vision, being this last one the most enjoyable surprise and probably the next fan favorite. There's very little dialog and almost no explanations, Age of Ultron is 90% action so the best you can do is switch the brain off and simply enjoy the fantastic ride."
"russellingreviews","Null","5","15","21 April 2015"," A fun, deja vu experience
","Avengers : The Age of Ultron - A fun deja vu experience - 4 stars <br/><br/>They're back to save the world, but can they save themselves? <br/><br/>Walking into the cinema... The Avengers was so good, can Age of Ultron live up to the original? <br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4 stars Cinematic value: 3.5 stars Big questions value: 4.5 stars<br/><br/>Sometimes in the search for peace, mankind can cause more problems than solutions. It is not much different for The Avengers. In the newest chapter in the lives of our favourite band of superheroes, they have been left to manage the world's villains. After retrieving and studying Loki's sceptre, Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) sees the opportunity to create the ultimate peacekeeper, Ultron (James Spader). In short order, he plan goes awry and Stark's arrogance creates to a seemingly omnipotent villain who seeks the eradication of mankind. In his masterplan for mankind's demise, Ultron successfully divides the superhero force. The Avengers have to determine how they can battle the demons inside themselves, as well as this new force of evil in the world. <br/><br/>Deja vu is the sensation that a current event or experience has happened previously. It is not necessarily a negative experience, but merely an awareness of the experience. Watching Avengers: The Age of Ultron was a deja vu experience. The original Avengers film was a brilliant mix of superhero personalities, action and humour and the superhero crew is back again.In this new adventure the action is back and director Joss Whedon continues to give a comedic spin that was experienced in the original film. This version was not bad experience, but seeing The Age of Ultron does conjure up a 'been there, done that' feeling. Whedon does enough to add new components and develop key characters to give the story a fresh spin, but it is built on the original story formula. Being aware that most of the character's stories are developed in their individual films, there is minimal opportunity for substantive character development. The development of Hawkeye's story line did add a needed human touch to the film, but the awkward relationship development between key characters within the team lacked appeal. James Spader adds an effective villainous element to the Ultron character, but is left with the inevitable trap of monologuing blunders that plague supervillians. Ultron is a profile villain and Spader is right for the lead villain role, but the character that would have been worth developing is Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis). Hopefully, he will be reintroduced in the future. We get to meet new characters, but with the exception of Vision, they present as one dimensional and fail to add much to the story. One new spin on this story is that the majority of the action occurs outside of the United States. So other countries get to experience the devastation of having the super powers fighting in their local community. The action is spectacular and heart stopping at times, but the future films will need to find other means of assisting with humanities salvation that do not include the total annihilation of large cityscapes. Avengers: The Age of Ultron met many of the expectations for the follow up to the first chapter of this hero chronology by successfully entertaining the audience with the action and cheeky dialogue, but it did not offer much new to the franchise or genre. In the end, Avengers: The Age of Ultron was an enjoyable deja vu experience. <br/><br/>Even though somethings were unoriginal, an enjoyable element of this hero adventure was found in the script. Whedon and crew must have a Bible nearby, because it became a key resource for content. Ultron was given some of the best lines of the film and many of them referred to or directly quoted key passages from the accounts of Noah and Jesus. The script was not a theological exercise, by any means, but the whispers of God's meta- narrative were evident throughout the film. As with all super hero films, the key story relies on the world's need of a saviour or, in the case of The Avengers, saviours. Whedon manages to show that these heroes are fallible. Unlike Jesus, who is the example of the infallible Saviour, the writing manages to expose the Avengers imperfections and weaknesses. One key example is found in their desire for peace and security. The Avengers answer to world peace seems brilliant and effective, but proves to be problematic. Which opens the door to many considerations of who can be relied upon, if these heroes prove to be susceptible to failure? This is one example amongst many, but does set The Age of Ultron up to be a good mix of discussion points that make this film an engaging experience. <br/><br/>Leaving the cinema... After the supernova of The Avengers, can the expectation be too high for Avengers: The Age of Ultron? Sure it is, but Marvel has set the bar. Does Joss Whedon rise to the challenge? Yes, he manages to get the job done in his second outing in the franchise. It was action packed, funny and unbelievably exciting, but the franchise will need a fresh fuel line of ideas to keep it from stalling in the future. Go to enjoy the adventure, but do not expect too many surprises. <br/><br/>What are some of the bigger questions to consider from this film? 1. What is the way to 'real' peace? (Matthew 10:34-36, 2 Thessalonians 3:16) 2. Can we become 'better humans?' (Genesis 1:27, Mark 7:20-23) 3. What does the Bible have to say about working together as a team? (Ecclesiastes 4: 9- 12, 1 Corinthians 12: 20-25)"

What more do they need...?

Even Fast and Furious movies have less senseless action.<br/><br/>The script is bad. Most jokes fall completely flat and even feel bad that they shouldn't be on there.

","I was disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron. There is no real story here. The trailers pretty much reveal all you need to know. Stark does something wrong, the AI Ultron comes to life, and he fights the Avengers. He fights them here, there, everywhere. He enlists help too. Ho hum. The fighting went on and on and on. There is an attempted plot line with Natasha and Banner, and a plot line with Hawkeye, and a small one with Thor, but really, nothing here to get excited about.<br/><br/>I guess the word is - boring. Despite all the fighting, this film is just boring. You keep waiting for something to happen. when something does happen at the end, I don't know, I wasn't worried. This is Hollywood after all - they have a franchise to keep going. So do you ever think the Avengers will lose? That knowledge alone makes all this fighting moot because you know who will win. <br/><br/>The actors I think are starting to get either bored themselves, or jumping ship. No Gweneth Paltrow, no Happy Hogan. Hawkeye has a message too. Seems like Chris Evans is starting to get too old for his youthful Cap. And we thought we'd seen the end of Iron Man, yet here he was again.<br/><br/>At the end in Credits, you learn, oh, here's that guy, so the future portends yet another Avengers movie. Please give this one a plot with a real story where you don't know what is going to happen. That would possibly re-energize the actors and the customers because this one just was average at best."
"guisreis","5","4","11","13 October 2015"," Hollywood, stop! It is not a good idea to make superhero or action movies with astounding visual effects but a poor screenplay
","The first part of the movie (12 minutes) is a quite good action flick. Then, the title ""Avengers"" appears and the film gets worse and worse. Indeed, the visual effects throughout the movie are amazingly well done, extremely realistic and numerous (three thousand of them!), and many people, particularly youngsters, think that this is the most important thing in a superhero film (then rejecting many nice movies which lack those amazing visual effects or that fast pace or that amount of explicit violence), but I strongly disagree: the story is always the most important element... and this one is poor! In my opinion, most of the time ""Avengers 2"" is a bit boring, there are many silly dialogs, lots of unfunny gags, and the black-green romance is cheesy, besides having no previous development (the chat about having or not a future together is specially pathetic). Talking about the good traits, Robert Downey Jr. was the best again. The scene in the train with Captain America and the twins was also nice, and so are some fights. Though, the film overall sucks. Is is a shame that Hollywood action movies are spending more and more in technology at expense of good screenplays. The films from the second phase of Marvel cinematic universe (this one, ""Thor: the dark world"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" are awful, and I also include here ""Avengers 1"") are much worse (so poor stories! so focused only in visual effects!) than the ones made up to ""Captain America: The first Avenger"" (this one and ""Iron Man"" are particularly good)."
"bob-rutzel-239-525430","5","4","11","9 October 2015"," Somewhat Disappointing
","The Avengers are at it again. What you ask? Why saving the world, of course. This time from Ultron (voice of James Spader) who also vows to destroy the Avengers because he consider them killers. Oh, oh! This can't be good. But wait, wasn't it Tony Stark (Downey Jr) who created Ultron? (yes, it was him)<br/><br/>Like the Fast & Furious movie, watch this for the CGI and stunts. Oh, and for Scarlett Johansson as Natasha/Black Widow, of course. All are spectacular. When you think the CGI can't get any better we are pleasantly surprised again. It just never ends. Kudos. However, there is a problem and the problem is this: as good as the CGI is, it just never ends and the movie is one big battle and it's gets to be quite tedious after a while. We drifted to la la land at times. Who writes this stuff?<br/><br/>There are some quiet moments that kind of help somewhat: we have Hawkeye (Renner) with his family at a safe-house with the other Avengers in a re-grouping mode; and we have Natasha now flirting with the Hulk (Ruffalo) (didn't she flirt with the other Avengers in previous movies?) Who writes this stuff?<br/><br/>But the thing that really bothered me was Ultron's lips when he spoke. They moved. Now Ultron is all metal and the lips moved like human lips. Not good. Who writes this stuff?<br/><br/>Humor was attempted by Spader as Ultron and that went nowhere. We were not amused. Who did the writing for this?<br/><br/>Then Thor (Hemsworth) brings in Vision (Paul Bettany) - also the voice of Jarvis, Stark's right hand man who is a computer - touted as the most powerful entity in the universe and yet the movie doesn't end with Vision beating Ultron as it should have. So much for being the most powerful entity in the Universe. Who writes this stuff?<br/><br/>Notables: Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Don Cheadle as James Rhodes/War Machine, Paul Bettany as Jarvis/Vision, Idris Elba as Heimdall, Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue, Stan Lee as who else but Stan Lee, Josh Brolin as Thanos, Lou Ferrigno as the voice of the Hulk. (he just grunts)<br/><br/>All in all not bad, but tedious at times and if there are sequels the writers need to be vetted. (5/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: No. Language: Small stuff and not much of it."
"CyclopsKnowsBest24","5","4","11","7 October 2015"," A fun popcorn sequel... Not much else
","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) is one of the many newer sequels to the ever growing Marvel Cinematic Universe. Marvel has it's hands full with building this cinematic universe, especially after last years critical and commercial hits ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014) and the surprise summer smash ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014). After those two films and the seeing the dark trailers for ""Age of Ultron,"" I was expecting Marvel to bring something very exciting and new to the table.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Marvel stuck to their easy formula which is to make an almost identical movie to ""The Avengers"" (2012) and past Marvel entries. The trailers which promised a darker take on the film and villain did their job to fill in the seats, but sadly it didn't deliver on its marketing.<br/><br/>The main problem with this sequel is the villain, Ultron (voiced by James Spader). While James does an excellent job sounding menacing, the writers do a poor job of making Ultron's actions just as evil and creepy. Most of Ultron's lines are meant to make the audience laugh (I hardly smirked), and there is one scene where Ultron commits a scary action but then undermines his villainy with an apology. If good superhero films have taught us anything, it is that a good villain makes the hero. Ultron sadly feels like he could have been any other villain and he still wouldn't be memorable.<br/><br/>The second problem for ""Age of Ultron"" is that our heroes have no threat to worry about. Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), have nothing to fear. Ultron doesn't scare them and the heroes seem to act like he is just another easy threat.<br/><br/>I wish I could say ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is unpredictable or does something extremely new and exciting, but it doesn't. It is by far the most predictable entry in the series, which may be a good thing since it is only meant to be a mindless summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>In the end it's up to the audience member to decide if they were entertained or not. While I prefer films that try something new, others may be happy knowing this is exactly what Marvel has been doing in the past. It is not a bad thing, but I'm worried it may get old fast if this trend continues.<br/><br/>My movie/T.V. recommendations: <br/><br/>If you liked it: ""The Avengers"" (2012), ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" (2014), ""Ant-man"" (2015), ""The Flash"" (2014-Present) <br/><br/>If you didn't like it: ""X-men: Days of Future Past"" (2014), ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" (2014), ""Watchmen"" (2009)"

","The Avengers bicker with each other while trying to battle Ultron, an artificial intelligence in a robot shell created by Tony Stark and Bruce Banner. Given the astronomical success of the first film, it was almost a certainty this sequel would pale by comparison. I did enjoy this one but I must admit it doesn't hold a candle to The Avengers, Winter Soldier, or any of the first solo movies that I liked so much. The main thing the first Avengers had going for it was the spectacle of these characters teaming up on screen for the first time. It was a delight for longtime fans and for those following the movies to see such a wonderful payoff. This doesn't have that going for it. It's the same set of characters, with a few new additions I actually liked more than some of the previous characters. James Spader provides the voice for Ultron and does a magnificent job of being both menacing and funny. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and lovely Elizabeth Olsen are very good as Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (aka Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch), although their costumes are unimaginative. Paul Bettany, who has been providing the voice for Tony Stark's A.I. companion Jarvis in the previous movies, is upgraded to his own character here -- The Vision, who steals the movie as soon as he shows up.<br/><br/>As with the first Avengers, the character stuff is what makes this work. There's especially good material for Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, and Jeremy Renner. With this cast and how well they mesh together, there's a ceiling on how bad this could possibly be and this, thankfully, doesn't approach bad at any time. Whedon's script, while still having some good lines and scenes, was a little unbalanced and doesn't have quite the punch he is capable of. The action set pieces aren't the most impressive I've ever seen (even within the Marvel films) but they are mostly entertaining and the final battle against Ultron and his robot army has some moments of greatness. One thing did bug me due to how frequently it happened -- how were the people who don't have superhuman strength punching and kicking metal that's stronger than steel without being hurt? A bit of nerdy hole-poking, perhaps, but it didn't make sense.<br/><br/>My experience watching this several months ago (and now rewatching it for the first time since) is very different from my experience with The Avengers. With the prior film, I was influenced by the massive hype and expectations to the point that it hurt my enjoyment of the movie the first go-round. I have since come to appreciate it much more and really just love it for the sheer fun that it is. This movie I found myself liking a lot upon first viewing but my second viewing found my opinion dropping quite a bit as I noticed a lot more of what was wrong with it. Look, it's an enjoyable movie but not as clever or fun as it should have been. Not the stinker some are making it out to be but definitely a bit of a disappointment."

","When Avengers Age of Ultron was released, due to some personal reasons, I couldn't watch it in theaters. I felt sad. When I finally did check it out on DVD a week back, I was disappointed and said..thank God, I didn't watch this in a theater.<br/><br/>What on earth were Joss Weldon smoking when he wrote this film. Frankly, he makes it a big mess considering that he had made the brilliant Avengers (Part 1) a few years ago.<br/><br/>The Avengers worked because it was pure comic book stuff. 6 superheroes make a team to stop the bad guy, Loki (deliciously played by Tom Hiddleston) who wants to rule over Earth. So simple yet so entertaining.<br/><br/>In Age of Ultron, Weldon tries to do Nolan and convert Avengers into a Batman Trilogy type movie which has action but is intellectual and makes the audience think. Alas, it falls flat because of the poor writing and Weldon is no Nolan.<br/><br/>Ultron is a great formidable villain and it is supported by the Maximoff twins. But the theme of Artificial Intelligence and the end of human race is a bit too much to digest. The end result left me sad and angry at Weldon because of the opportunity he has lost.<br/><br/>Its the performance of the cast and some action sequences that save the movie to a certain aspect.

","The title says it all. This installment of marvel heroes must have been written by the Hulk... 1% brain and 99% brawn. Basically, if you saw the trailer, you do not need to see the movie. Its a basic action flick and the plot was clearly just a secondary thing thrown in to show off special effects and animation. I was never a fan of the Averngers or Iron Man but I could tolerate them because I love comics and fiction. The problem with this movie is that the AI is treated as dumb making the plot silly, while the Avengers waste half a movie mopping around because they cant get along. The dialog was OK but you need to be a hardcore fan of each character to not be bored to tears... I am not a huge fan and I really don't care for all the explosions and action unless there is a solid plot."

It's kiddie stuff in the most simple sense; kids don't care how their playing amounts to a world, that's something that happens (or doesn't) as they make bumping noises.<br/><br/>Nothing here matters so when we get snark lest we take it too serious, that begs the question. What could we take serious here? People are shot with lasers and walk it off, a whole district is torn down as Iron Man and the Hulk duke it out but that's just the video game background. This was a main issue the Nolans pored over in their Bat work, how to create a world where choices have gravity.<br/><br/>The whole is bloodless (in the other sense), has no reality of any kind, no sense of world. It all crunches together every few minutes in heaps of plastic image, everything fake-looking. Faces, jokes, are crammed in but that's just more debris scattered about. Even the main dilemma in the story, about do we try to make everything safe or do we lose ourselves in the process is the exact same mechanical cog bandied around from one Marvel film to the other.<br/><br/>The Expendables is a nadir in worldbuilding these days as far as I'm concerned, this is close behind."
"codykonior","Null","4","11","22 August 2015"," Worst superhero movie so far
","I'm a big fan of the Avengers, Captain America, and Iron Man movie franchises, but everything about this particular movie sucked.<br/><br/>When the movie started immediately in ""action mode"" I had a suspicion that plot and character development were going to be thrown out of the window. When character after bland character gets introduced and then completely ignored (with some poor acting to boot, especially from the Olsen sister) my suspicions were confirmed.<br/><br/>I love James Spader but I don't think he was the right choice as the voice of Ultron. I'm not sure if it's his delivery or the poorly scripted and flat dialogue. What we're left with is a cookie cutter and powerless ""I'll get you next time!"" Gargamel caricature.<br/><br/>The only kind of character development I saw attempted was with Black Widow, but not as a person, instead as a romance. Ridiculous. Throughout the movies Black Widow has been treated as mere T&A in a body suit so trying to pour on a quick sob story in the context that now she wants love - it left an extremely bad taste in my mouth.<br/><br/>All in all extremely disappointing. Even more disappointing a lot of people ate it up with a spoon and seem to think this kind of movie is a 7! How!"

","I absolutely hate CGI that is so obviously CGI.<br/><br/>It makes live action look like a cartoon. CGI only works when it's so subtle you don't notice it. The very first scene is an action one with so much CGI it may as well be animated. This utterly sets the bar so low as to be limboing for me. It didn't get any better as it went along either. A real shame as previous Avengers efforts were much better.<br/><br/>The plot was contrived to the Nth degree and the acting was phoned in. The actors looked like they wanted to be anywhere but where they were.<br/><br/>I appreciate that any superhero film requires a degree of suspension of reality but equally it also needs a degree of reality to ground it. Failure to adhere to that grounding leaves you with a live action cartoon, which is what we have here. It simply doesn't work.<br/><br/>Please, please, please abandon the over use of CGI and make films that rely on plot, acting and effects you don't realise are effects."

Let's just get this out of the way, no, it's not as good as the first Avengers, there are a few too many story threads that are crow barred into the narrative solely for setting up future films. I understand it's necessary to have all this to set up Captain America: Civil War, Thor: Ragnarok and so on, but these sub plots detract from what should have just been an enjoyable, straight-forward evil robot becomes self-aware story. Having said that, James Spader is fantastic as Ultron, the action scenes are energetic and fun (The highlight is the Hulkbuster fight).

","Here I am trying to remind myself of the scenes that blew my mind from ‪Age of Ultron‬ and I couldn't recall a single one of them. Aside from the witty banter and some ass kicking (that's Amazing Ass kicking, btw) what does the second installment of Avengers have? Even the so called immortals, even the gods who took upon themselves as the saviors of mankind have weaknesses. it is in these moments of weakness, pushed into desperation while trying to achieve a permanent peace chaos is born. What these saviors fail to understand is peace and chaos are not two different things. Yet, there is grace in their failure(sic). There is a subtle drama in this movie that blew my mind more that any other aspect of it. True, I am really excited about how this movie segues into the rest of the cinematic universe. But, more than that I like the way Cap, who is supposed to be the conscience of the team wavers from believing what is right or wrong. I like how Tony, Nat, Thor and Bruce all show their vulnerabilities and Clint the person you least expect walks into the middle with far greater purpose and courage than the rest of the team combined. The Avengers are supposed to be earth's greatest defense. That defense wavers because they shown their greatest weakness. A climbing mistrust of each other. They pulled thru this time but only time will tell if they learnt their lesson. This is what the second installment has in store. A new road to be paved while picking pieces of their own sins. A new Vision."

","Firstly, I don't think people should compare this film with the first Avengers. They're completely different. The first one was just about bringing the team together, and this one is partly about breaking them up but also sets up a lot of the future MCU. <br/><br/>I found the plot to be interesting, and different from anything else we've seen thus far. There were a lot of characters, but I didn't think the film was overstuffed or difficult to follow. Although, I do think they rushed Ultron's origin. You can tell a lot of material was removed in the final cut. I also liked how Whedon decided to jump right into the story, without worrying about any sort of build up or explanation. <br/><br/>Some parts of the film were truly funny, such as when Vision was able to lift Thor's hammer, or Captain America scolding people for swearing, and then being told off for doing it himself. I especially liked the scene where Captain America called Fury a 'son of a bit**' and Fury replies with, ""Ooh...do you kiss your mother with that mouth?"" However, I think there were a few jokes in moments that should have been dark, such as when Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver first encounter Ultron. <br/><br/>I thought the visual effects were great, but then else would you expect from a $250 Million superhero flick? Particularly, Vision looked fantastic. However, I think some action sequences were hard to follow, and the camera work was too shaky at times, particularly at the beginning. <br/><br/>Personally, I prefer the Quicksilver in X-Men: Days Of Future Past, and I don't think his death was very well-handled. I didn't feel emotional at all, although that may be because I had that spoiled for me before I saw the film. I think what killed the moment for me was him saying, ""You didn't see that coming?"" again. Like, he said it twice earlier in the film, I don't understand why they had to throw one more in to kill what should have been a genuine moment. That said, I liked Aaron- Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen's performances. <br/><br/>Finally, I LOVED how they used the main theme from the original film, especially at the end. Seriously, I wasn't expecting that.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an entertaining superhero film and a must for fans of the Marvel Cinematic Universe or the first Avengers."
"fioresi","8","4","11","4 May 2015"," Fun with Marvel and the family
","This is an action movie with Marvel characters: once you understand that nothing will go wrong and you will like this movie. I was avid Marvel reader much before these movies came along, I do not feel betrayed at all, I think this movie captures the essence of the comics. My only critic is that it is too long, I would have avoided the lengthy scenes of droid battles (reminding of Star Wars episode 1, rather better to be forgotten instead of recalled). It is however fun to watch and actually one of the few movies the whole family can enjoy. The scenes may at times be slightly scary for a 10 year old, but from 11 years on the kid will actually love it, as my three children did."

","Too many cooks? Not when Joss Whedon's concerned. Age of Ultron follows Assemble tidally, keeping Marvel's phase 2 films in tip top condition. Ultron has the comic edge, but now with added ambivalence and cloudiness. Think Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire compared to its predecessors. It's dark, convoluted and sometimes frightening. Not for the very young or the faint hearted. The Avengers work together effortlessly, whether its making dinner, friendly repartee or kicking ass. The hot-headed Bruce Banner (Ruffalo) and the seductive Black Widow's (Johansson) romance ignites, the Cap (Evans) and Tony Stark (Downey. Jr) clash often. Thor's (Hemsworth) hammer has just as much flare as he does and we see a side to Hawkeye (Renner) we've never seen before. Stark and Banner's AI product Ultron (voiced by the incredible James Spader) brings out the best and the worst in the Avengers. They unite to kill the unkillable, but sibling 'mutants' Quicksilver (Taylor Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Olsen) stand in their way. Age of Ultron doesn't just develop important characters, it casts new ones, keeps the story interesting (albeit a little confusing) and manages to tease us with what's to come. Well done Joss Whedon, well done.<br/><br/>Check out my other film reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk"
"agblum","8","4","11","30 April 2015"," A Fun, Entertaining Ride!
","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is the 11th film entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe, that began with ""Iron Man"" in 2008. Joss Whedon who wrote and directed the first team up movie of the MCU - ""The Avengers"" in 2012, returned to do the same for the sequel, and as confirmed by all, barring a changing of minds, or a surprise return down the line. will be his swan song for Marvel. ""The Avengers"" is generally considered one of the best, if not the Best Superhero film of all time. The first trailer for the sequel suggested a much darker tone, while the trailers that followed showed the trademark Whedon humor he injected into the first one – indicative of his past work, ala his TV series - ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer"", ""Angel"", etc., would be there as well. While there is some dark tone to it, with some great moments when it goes in that direction, ultimately most of great parts of the movie for me were the great humorous one-liners, spread out practically amongst all the main players, and one or two non main players. Returning Avengers are Tony Stark – Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America - Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth) , The Hulk – Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow – Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansen) and Hawkeye – Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner). A number of their supporting players from other MCU movie figure prominently as well, and they are also joined by new comers – The Maximoff Twins – Pietor – Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson), and Wanda – Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), as wel1 as the Vision (Paul Bettany). The antagonist is the Robot ""Ultron"" (voiced by James Spader - Yes – The voice of Tony Stark's computer Jarvis – When you the see movie – all will be clear). In as nut shell – the movie is a mostly fun and entertaining for the around 2 ½ hour running time. It is well paced, so it never feels long. All the characters are given moments, and different story arcs are touched upon with each of them. Sometimes that does create a jumble, and if some were fleshed out more, while it would have sacrificed time for some of the other story arcs, I think it would have improved the movie. Having said that – In the end, while not as good as the original, it is an enjoyable, fun ride, and Whedon's great Dialogue, humorous and non-humorous, when it does hit, and it hits often - shines! 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars - 8 ½ out of 10 Stars."

","This is another over hyped movie where the consensus of critical opinion is better than it should be. The movie Avataar comes to mind. That movie too had a similar largely favorable reviews on release but was later found to be underwhelming. <br/><br/>The plot is thin. The birth of the Ultron is hurried, the tender moments seemed tacked, the fight scene at the end is a reprise of the fight scenes in the first Avengers movie. The birth of the Vision may be useful in later films but here he hardly plays any role. The death of Pietro is similarly accidental. The fight between the Avengers seems pointless, and looks like a school brawl. Even the looming end of the world fails to inspire any sense of urgency or dread."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is all about the rise of Tony Stark supposed peacekeeping program, Ultron, who I'm sure will become an iconic villain, as he tries to destroy the human race.<br/><br/>To start with, this film is brilliant. It has everything. Comedy, action, suspense and strong characters. The comedic elements in the film, mainly at the start of the film, work really well and create chemistry between the superhero's, which was lacking in the first film. Next, the action sequences are prolonged and a bit mad, but not on a Michael Bay level. The sequences work really well, and the best piece of action is the Iron Man v Hulk scene, which wows and adds more to the characters. Apart from the action, some backstop is explored mainly of Black Widow, which, again, works really well, as do the edition of all the new characters. They never feel lost to the egos of Captain America and Iron Man, and give the film an angle the first one never had in the end: A feeling of sadness and tragedy at the ending, and it is set up perfectly for more Avengers movies.<br/><br/>Overall, if you have any sense, you will see this film and love it when it finishes."
"Rickting","7","4","11","26 April 2015"," Strong, heroic superhero sequel with plenty of swagger
","The Marvel Cinematic Universe is one of the most impressive film franchises ever created and is by now a living, breathing world. Ignoring the bland villains, dull love stories and occasional quality dip, which it is thankfully easy to do thanks to the high standard, the MCU can continue for as long as it likes. Phase 2 more or less concludes as the Avengers, who are individually fascinating, combined they're cooler than Indiana Jones at the South Pole and more powerful than The Green Mile, face another villain which Iron Man accidentally creates. Avengers Age of Ultron is not a sequel without faults. Although the film kills someone off, it's no-one major and there aren't any real risks. The mid credits scene is a bit disappointing, it doesn't set up later films, especially the hugely exciting upcoming Civil War, and feels like just another all out superhero brawl and goes down the Empire Strikes Back dark sequel route but doesn't actually do anything with it. Still, Marvel shows they still have skill, and this soon to be box office juggernaut deserves to be one.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon proves a very good director once again, and the film includes an incredible long take in the opening, smooth and coherent cinematography and many genuinely beautiful moments of superhero madness. Robert Downey Jr. is still excellent as Iron Man, while with Chris Evans it's hard to believe that's the same guy who played that tiresome Human Torch in those Fantastic Four cheese sandwiches. Mark Ruffalo is very good as well, as is all of the others. Samuel L Jackson is still working wonders as Nick Fury. The spectacle is smashing, but there is a soul as well. The superheroes are characters you care about and there are some thought provoking themes of hubris in here too. The special effects and naturally spectacular and the script is well written, although a few more of the jokes which Whedon does so well would have been appreciated. The villain surprisingly doesn't suck, the girlfriends aside from the actually entertaining Black Widow are thankfully absent and the new additions are worth it. Aaron Taylor Jonhson partially redeems himself for Godzilla. Overall, a good though not great blockbuster, and a more than adequate follow up for the excellent original.<br/><br/>8/10"

","( NO SPOILERS!!) I saw the first avengers movie. I hated it. I only loved 2 sequences. I loved an awful lot more about avengers 2. This one, to me, felt like it was on a much bigger scale, and that it could actually happen in real life, whereas the first one was just to comicbooky. It features some amazing performances from all the main cast, with Jeremy Renner being the standout as he finally had something to do! I particularly enjoyed Bruce and Natasha's romance, because it felt real. It didn't feel like it was being forced at all, like it was with Captain America or Hawkeye (Natasha has a great love life.) James Spader as Ultron is just so incredibly awesome, he is the best villain I have seen in a film for ages, and definitely the best marvel villain (sorry Loki fans, Ultron is better). Joss Whedon has a flawless direction, and I'm really sad that he's leaving the franchise, but I can't wait to see the Russo's take. This movie is also really quite funny, as I laughed more in it than I probably do in most 'comedies'. Avengers: Age of Ultron is the joint- best marvel movie (along with Guardians of The Galaxy) and I can't wait for Civil War!<br/><br/>(SPOILERS) I loved Avengers 2. The opening sequence of them breaking into the fortress is very cool, and it features my favorite part from the trailer (screenshot moment, 1:08 trailer 3) and all the team kicking bottoms. I think the running joke of Captain America not being okay with inappropriate language is really quite funny, but useful as there were many young kids at the screening, despite a 12A/PG-13 rating. I also thought that exploring Clint 'behind the scenes' if you'd call it, was quite cool, showing people that superheroes had people they cared about as well, and I also liked seeing Natasha's back story, because she seemed a bit too secretive in the other films that she's been in. I also liked the addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, but I found there accents a bit annoying, and for any Days of Future Past fans (Me), there is no Quicksilver sequence like the one in that film, so I prefer Evan Peters' Quicksilver. It might not be accurate to the comics, but for me, it's easier to know what's going on. I also felt like Quicksilver's death was a bit forced, because to my record, someone major dies in every Joss Whedon film. <br/><br/>This was my most anticipated movie of the year, and it didn't disappoint. Avengers 2 is worth your time, and money. Go and see it everyone!!"
"adiraju147","9","4","11","26 April 2015"," Bigger and better but less funnier
","I am a huge fan of the Avengers. The first edition stole me totally. Thanks to Star Movies in India, I have watched it so many times that I literally can repeat each dialog like a subtitle. It has some of the best lines and the aversion between characters before they can become a group has been impacting and immediate. <br/><br/>Coming to AOU, I have had huge expectations. Am I disappointed? Well, I am excited than disappointed on what future holds. The big question I wanted answering was, where is Loki when the world he despises is burning? The character of Loki adds so much to the movie along with Ironman for the wittiness. Why the dialogs weren't as memorable as the first one ( I am sorry, the subtitles killed it for me to remember if there are any). But from the action side, it is total kick ass. The enhancement to the other sides of the Hulk and the BW has added the character depth that was missing in the first part. SLJ, could have had more screen space IMO, but that's OK. The action sequences at the first, the Iron-Hulk stand off and the chase are beautifully handled. <br/><br/>Whether it is better than the first is debatable, but it is totally worth every buck you pay to watch it and every minute you spent watching. Total awesomeness and some more!"

","With the strength of the Winter Soldier, Marvel has outed itself as being capable of producing a film to compete with the Dark Knight. So the direction of the Avengers is a marker to how they see the war against the DCU panning out. <br/><br/>Essentially, Age of Ultron is a great piece of entertainment, but the threads of it's own destruction are built in. As the main artery for new characters, this film runs out of time to really introduce them. We get the one liners, the strong moments between the existing cast but in the background the mechanics of the plot cycle on with little explanation. <br/><br/>The casual breaking of cannon (no spoilers here) does not seem to be done to create anything stronger - instead all the new characters are somewhat malformed. Ultron has the humour of Stark, but the enemy doesn't really add anything new to deal with. As the entertainment explodes onto the screen, the films franchise implodes."
"bitukitu2000","9","4","11","25 April 2015"," Whedon does a wonderful job.
","Review, Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The right lines at the right moment, the right action, the right VFX. Marvel does it time and again, the envelope of striking humour surrounding the plot though excessively at times but never ineffective.<br/><br/>Avengers isn't your average Marvel movie which you anticipate to be funny, light and entertaining. Yes, it didn't lose the humour, yes, Tony is still the guy. No doubt it's very true to the form but what makes this a remarkably different addition to the series is... well it's deep. It is highly character driven. A go through into each of the characters' lives, their complexities, their fears, sadness, each of which continually adds to your awe.<br/><br/>The common cast surely do a good job at doing what they do but there will be some character where most of your curiosity will deviate to and that's, you'll love to discover, is James Spades. Right from his dialogues to their deliverance, he shines excellently as the antagonist.<br/><br/>Moments exist where dialogues so good will charm your soul, moments exist where the action is so satisfying that you are shouting, applauding and probably craving for more of the like but at the same time there are moments which render you a underwhelming feel, moments which have no proper argument or explanation backing them up. Avengers Age of Ultron is not a flawless movie.<br/><br/>While being formulaic and having its fair share of flaws, its over the top action, the chemistry between the characters, the phenomenal screenplay and the skillfully employed and brilliantly voiced Ultron prove that Age of Ultron is a fantastic sequel. Its number of pluses outnumbering its flaws by large, Marvel takes a big step forward. <br/><br/>8.5/10. Amazing."

","Age of Ultron is a spectacular Marvel instalment to end phase 2 of the ongoing superhero project.<br/><br/>All the familiar faces we've seen so far reprise their roles as lovable misfits who come together to put an end to HYDRA. Everything that the first Avengers movie had is doubled in this one. There is the oh so familiar clever wit which we have come to recognise within these films, tons of great action scenes where every Avenger gets their moment in the spotlight, and a new nemesis in Ultron who proves to be a formidable opponent, and the toughest the team have faced so far!<br/><br/>James Spader provides an intense and intimidating voice for our 8 foot iron giant, ultron, whose presence throughout the entire film is exciting to say the least. The other editions include the Maximoff twins who add great visual powers. In the previous films they relied on punches and energy blasts whereas with the twins we are introduced to new powers we haven't yet seen. Its fresh and adds a new dimension to the story and the universe.<br/><br/>One thing i particularly enjoyed (without giving away too much) was the development of Hawkeye. We see a lot more of him and his background in this movie as opposed to the first Avengers movie, and of course the 5 minute cameo spell he had in Thor.<br/><br/>I constantly felt excited and intrigued watching this movie as there was never a dull moment. It really is an epic, full on spectacle. Another aspect i enjoyed is that although Stark is the centre of the creation of Ulton, the story never solely focused on him as the first Avengers tended to slightly. The time on screen for each character felt even, although i do wish we saw a bit more of Thor who didn't seem to have as much dialogue even though he was present for the most part.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic film which sits comfortably in the top 3 Marvel films to date."

The Answer you want is it's worth your money in my opinion yes it is. I'm a huge comic book fan and my favorite story is the infinity gauntlet. The next Avengers is Infinity war. So if you want to see that you need to see this. So in the end the movie ties in with the rest of the universe with Ultron being an interesting character and the story being in the direction i liked.

","Finally the long awaited sequel to the Avengers have arrived and let me start out my saying what a show! The excitement and expectations were so high for this one and it did not disappoint!<br/><br/>Allow me to start with the bad things so we can leave things on a high note. First of we have the lovestories. Yes, plural. First, we have the romance between Hulk and Black Widow, which I have no idea where actually came from. It sort of seems random and used as more of a bland filler. It doesn't really gives depth to the characters like a good lovestory does, if anything it makes Natasha act more like a lovestruck teenager than a 'love is for children' assassin. It almost seems demeaning compared to the Natasha Romanoff we have seen in all the previous films. But good for Bruce though. He deserves someone who doesn't fear the Other Guy. Next we have Hawkeye who surprisingly has a hidden family out in the country. This too seemed to come out of nowhere and just like before it feels like a filler and if anything takes away something from the character that otherwise stood out wonderfully compared to the first movie. I may not have read the comics but even for me it seemed far-fetched and outright unbelievable. It was almost taken straight out of a girly fanfiction storyline. I have already suppressed those scenes and do not accept them as part of the actual film. Perhaps it is my inner fangirl but I cannot possibly be the only one who sees it as such.<br/><br/>Okay. Now that that is out of the way ... I loved everything else! The action was good, the story was believable and everybody got their moment to shine. Every character, old and new, got explored (at least as much as you can do with that many in one movie) and the two newcomers, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were even better than I thought. And what amazed me most was that I didn't find myself once comparing the two Quicksilvers we have now seen. Wonderful diversity from both takes on a character that are so far from each other that you don't even think about it being the same person. <br/><br/>The movie had both humor and serious moments which all worked so well! The team dynamic was fun and aside from a few bumps (and perhaps a fight or two) the team stayed consistent throughout the film. Ultron was cheeky yet somehow terrifying. It may not have hit Loki level but it was close and a lot of it had to do with James Spaders wonderful work and voice. So what's the main conclusion here, you ask? It is this: a wonderful sequel to a wonderful film. The love stories took away the some of the magic which is too bad since everything else worked so well and sadly that is the only reason the film didn't receive a perfect score.<br/><br/>Is this better than the first movie? No. But it's damn near close and who knows, after a few more watches it might even reach the bar. A sequel that is worth the watch! Without a doubt!"

","They do need to figure out how to settle on a genre with these movies, because I'm not sure what they were going for. At times it felt like I was watching a cartoon, and other times a sci-fi movie. I will say that James Spader's performance as Ultron was chilling. I got chills down my spine every time he spoke. The advantage of Disney owning Marvel is they can have villians sing otherwise happy Disney songs and ruin people's childhoods by making them creepy. Now, concerning the characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. (Scarlet Witch is my MCU crush!) Neither of their actor(esses) sounds genuinely Russian, and at times you can tell the accent is fake, because half the sentence will be in an American accent and the other half a ""Russian"" accent. I did enjoy the witty banter between all the members of the Avengers, and surprisingly, even Ultron had some witty dialogue. He is probably the best villain in any of the MCU films. Now, one more thing. I didn't put the ""One does not simply leave a Marvel movie before the end of the credits"" meme like I usually do, because there's only one scene after the first 2 minutes of credits, but nothing at the end, so don't wait for the very end of the credits.

Someone just retire the whole thing.<br/><br/>And mostly the ever so useless Scarlet Johansson. isn't there enough Jewish middle aged stepmother films out there for her to go do those and leave her useless presence in 'action' films to someone more qualified?? Can't she go whitewash Japanese or pretend she is hot and find a 'girls are partying movie' or something? Anything?? Marvel is as unhip and boring now as Ishtar or JJ Abrams reboots of Star Wars so I and many other should look for some quality somewhere else."

","Being a sequel, no time is wasted establishing characters, how they met and establishing teams - it just starts straight away with the story and action.<br/><br/>I love how it seems that they have been working together on missions since we left them in the first film, the team is more unified and understand how the others members work.<br/><br/>I really enjoy watching this cast on both the big screen and all the press they do together, from everything you see, it seems they are close friends, which translates to the screen.<br/><br/>I loved the introduction of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen into the Marvel Cinematic Universe and I really hope we see more of them in the future.<br/><br/>And yes, I'm well aware Quicksilver died but anything can happen in this universe and I really hope it does because I really enjoyed this Quicksilver over the one in X-Men: Days Of Future Past; the acting, the speed blur, the costume and pretty much everything!<br/><br/>I found Ultron, voiced by James Spader, to be absolutely captivating; his voice, his quirks and mannerisms. Definitely captured my focus whenever he was on the screen.<br/><br/>I'm glad we got to see more of the characters that don't get their own films (Black Widow, Hawkeye and The Hulk) and weren't the focus of the first Avengers film. I was convinced Hawkeye was going to die even before seeing the film but when they introduced his family, even more so and was thrilled when he wasn't!<br/><br/>I also liked that Clint and Natasha have more of brother/sister relationship than a romantic one and that she is a part of his little secret family, which was another thing that I like about this film; not everyone had to know everything there is about him.<br/><br/>One thing I love about all the MCU projects is the ability to be funny without losing it seriousness or without being tacky and there are so many funny moments in throughout this film.<br/><br/>There are definitely future glimpses into the future MCU projects like Civil War, including which side some of the characters may head towards, and Black Panther.<br/><br/>Another thing I love about the MCU is that most of it, is realistic from the costumes to the characters. As stupid as this may sound; if this was going to happen now, it would look like this - there are no stupidly over the top scenes and over the top costumes.<br/><br/>I was happy to see the team change at the end. As much as I may like a character, it's always good to refresh a team like this in both movies and TV shows to stop the stories from getting stale and it's not like you're never going to see these characters again.<br/><br/>If you love the Marvel Cinematic Universe then you will love this! Will not be the only time I see this in the cinemas, will probably see it at least two more times!"

The characters are developed a bit more but not in the way you'd like them to be and the film does have some dragging sequences. That being said the new characters are fantastic Scarlet Witch played by Elizabeth Olsen is fierce and Quicksilver played by hottie Aaron Taylor Johnson is fun. The film is darker but the central group is as entertaining as ever. Sure there's a few blips along the way but it still stands as a fine piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>Budget: $250m

","I think Avengers Age of Ultron is a great follow up to the original Avengers. It brings action, story, comedy and a compelling villain. It has everything you want in a superhero movie.

","It is quite complicated and hard to follow. For a comic-book superhero movie, the overall story is good, but some parts especially in the first half of the movie do not click so well. Tony's motivation, decision, and reasoning to create Ultron are terribly disappointing, he exactly sounds like a super-villain, just like Ultron in the movie. It is too bad that Tony's character is treated that way, because he is supposed to be wiser. Ultron as a villain is interesting in his own way, but it feels like the character, his motivation, powers, and existence are vague. How he could be created, what he wants to achieve, what he is capable of, how he could be defeated, and how he could think, talk, and act the way he does are confusing. The villains are too many. Using Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, Dr. List, the rest of Hydra, Ulysses Klaue, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch as the only villains, in which the last two would then turn heroes, would be much preferred and more relatable. This movie does pick up where Captain America: the Winter Soldier left off, but the time-skip makes it not connected very well.<br/><br/>The casting and performances are well-done: Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man (although Tony's character is very cringe in the first half), Chris Hemsworth as Thor, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Scarlett Johansson as Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Clint Barton/Hawkeye, Don Cheadle as James ""Rhodey"" Rhodes/War Machine, Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch, Paul Bettany as J.A.R.V.I.S. and Vision, Cobie Smulders as Maria Hill, Anthony Mackie as Sam Wilson/Falcon, Stellan Skarsgård as Erik Selvig, James Spader as Ultron, Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury, Claudia Kim as Helen Cho, and Andy Serkis as Ulysses Klaue. Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver is okay, but his character is cringe, his power is not impressively depicted, and he dies so disappointingly for stupid reason. Why did they kill this character?<br/><br/>The production set, costumes, props, practical effects and make-up are beautiful; the cinematography is well-done, the shots in which the superheroes are in one frame are so cool; the score is beautiful; the action sequences are well-done, especially the opening sequence."

","I can't say the film didn't lack action because it didn't, every minute was filled with brilliant effects and amazing shots. An action packed adrenaline ride all through. However this said the film lacked story. At first the film was taking over from the first avengers, the story was good. But somewhere into the film the story fell apart with too much happening and without the solid story line it felt weak, with no real connections at all there was just fighting and action all over. I thought from what little story this film had to offer it was a lot more comic based than the previous one. The main villain in this film felt like a weakly based character, he had little to do with the story and was probably a contributing factor into it's downfall.<br/><br/>In conclusion I thought that the action, acting and effects are among the best, however the weak story left me with a far different feeling to the first. I thought although this film was great for a sequel it wasn't as good as the first. The film felt like it was meant to put a story across ready for the next film, which I hope will have a better story and live up to my expectations! However if for now you're looking for a great action film this is definitely a great one to watch, even though the story was weak and lacked that edge it is still a great film and hopefully will make an even better trilogy!"

","To me, Age of Ultron is the weakest Avengers film. That doesn't mean it's bad : on the contrary, it's an awesome movie and I always have a blast when watching it, but it doesn't have that special something that the others have.<br/><br/>I love the additions Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, the Hawkeye storyline and the fact that this is probably the most character-driven Avengers movie, but at the same time, there are certain things that don't quite stick the landing for me. I feel like Vision's origin story is a little bit rushed, and for that reason I have never felt very attached to him in any of the following movies.

","You have several main characters revolving around one goal, but all of these characters should be unique and driven by their own wants and needs, but all of those wants and needs need to be connected to the core of the story. When you take half a dozen heroes who are (largely) off on their own adventures most of the time, it can take some doing, and I don't think that doing was done quite well enough here.<br/><br/>The Avengers have been wiping out Hydra one base at a time for some months and have come across the final large stronghold. They quip their way to victory, discovering Loki's spear from the first Avengers as well as two ""enhanced"" individuals (one who's fast and the other that's weird). With the spear, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner begin to analyze it in order to figure out how to take advantage of it. What they end up doing is creating Ultron, an advanced AI that takes a cryptic mission from Tony (""peace in our time"") and twists it in a very Asimov sort of way to mean all of human life must end because there will be no peace with people. He overcomes Tony's personal digital assistant (Jarvis), inhabits a robotic body and uploads himself to the Internet so he can escape into anything he wishes.<br/><br/>There's a fight, Ultron escapes, he finds some vibranium (helpfully expanding the MCU slightly in the process with references to Wakanda), and escapes again, this time with the help of the two enhanced. He escapes to South Korea where he uses a scientist to create a ""real"" body for him (how this is appreciably better than his upgraded body he gets later isn't really explained). Through another action sequence, the Avengers steal this body and then bring it to life so that it becomes Vision. Everything converges in the invented Central European country Sokovia (where the movie opened) where Ultron, who's been talking positively of the asteroid that destroyed the dinosaurs throughout the movie, has creating a system that will life the capitol city up in the air before dropping it to the ground with enough force to cause a global extinction event, which the Avengers avert. Because of course.<br/><br/>So, there's the plot. A lot is going on. I think the stuff around the creation of the body that becomes Vision is really just there so we can get Vision. As part of Ultron's plan, it feels extraneous at best. His end goal is human extinction. Having some sort of humanish metal body feels just extra. But around this large, somewhat unfocused, plot we have our heroes, and as I implied earlier, not a lot of them seem to be there for any other reason than they are Avengers.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about what this movie is supposed to be about. The first Avengers was really an excuse to get superheroes together to fight a heavy. The underlying idea was about team building. It was facile, but it worked and every character was functioning towards that goal. In this, the goal seems to be centered around Tony Stark's desire to create a replacement for the Avengers in the form of a highly intelligent AI that will protect Earth from threats originating from off world. It's an extension of where Tony was left at the end of Iron Man 3. He wants Iron Man to be unnecessary. The creation he ends up with fights back (using ""I've got no strings"" from Pinocchio quite effectively in a creepy sort of way), and Captain America's assertion that humans should always be part of the decision making process ends up correct. In terms of characters who seem involved in this thematic idea you have Tony, Bruce Banner, Captain America, and Hawkeye. The rest feel extra, taking the movie in different directions.<br/><br/>Thor is the one who seems the most out of place. He's there for a literal reason (Loki's scepter is supposed to go back to Asgard with him), but outside of that he doesn't really contribute to any of the movie's core idea. In fact, he famously goes off in the middle of the movie to help inform the audience about Infinity Stones. They sacrificed cohesion of the film itself in order to help sell later installments of the franchise, and the movie suffers for it. Black Widow also feels like she's in another movie. The exploration of her past is interesting, but I don't see how it feeds into the ideas at the movie's core. What this does overall is create a disjointed experience that keeps the movie from coming together as a single work.<br/><br/>There's quite a few individual pieces of the film that I like quite a bit. The action scenes are fun (though, we get another big CGI army). I really like Ultron himself. He's not just a quippy form of Loki. He's driven by an ideology and a set of beliefs all while talking in a way that betrays the malfunction at his core. The relationship that begins to blossom between Natasha and Bruce is both sweet and tied to some interesting unique parts of their characters (Natasha's insistence that she's a monster and her ability to draw Bruce out of the Hulk). And I really like the central idea and how that manifests in Ultron. I just wish the movie came together a bit better."

","This sequel, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" is surely flawed, but it's an interesting mixture of two popular movie genres: the relatively new comic-book superhero one, which has only recently emerged to dominate the box office in this age of Hollywood franchises, and the older genre of the horror film. Both may've been originally (or still) sneered at by many--perhaps, even for good reason, including repetitious and superficial fan servicing--but they've been extraordinarily popular. Last year, during the 200th anniversary of Mary Shelley's novel ""Frankenstein,"" I reviewed a bunch of related films in relation to that book, as well as seeing how such shockers became a Hollywood staple. For some reason, I neglected two superhero pictures that are partly based on ""Frankenstein."" Both are in part made by Joss Whedon, who had already mixed pulpy vampirism with teen drama for TV with ""Buffy the Vampire Slayer,"" and he was behind the meta-horror of ""The Cabin in the Woods"" (2012). So why not rework Shelley's creation for comic-book characters, which he's done here and did again, later, with ""Justice League"" (2017).<br/><br/>The Marvel CInematic Universe has unleashed a whole new monster of franchise building; one need not look far for its imitators to see that it's become the envy of the motion-picture world, but even if one traces the superhero franchise back to the Christopher Reeve Superman films and the Tim Burton Batmans, this genre is relatively young. Going any further back, comic-book film adaptations become the pure kiddie stuff of cartoons and serials. The Hollywood horror film, on the other hand, dates back to 1931 when Universal released ""Dracula"" and, soon thereafter, ""Frankenstein."" Both based on 19th-century Gothic horror novels, although more so their theatrical iterations over the years. Both were box-office successes, too, but they also received harsher criticism than any recent superhero movie has; they were censored, and the genre was de-facto banned for a few years. Later, these monsters launched the first shared cinematic universe beginning with ""Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man"" (1943). Now, they're considered classics, and although ""Age of Ultron"" may never be considered that, ""The Dark Knight"" (2008), say, or ""Logan"" (2017) already are. All of which is to say that these two types of cinemas seem a natural fit. Moreover, Gothic horror such as ""Dracula,"" ""Frankenstein"" and ""Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde,"" in particular, are about science and modernity, alter egos and supernatural abilities.<br/><br/>""Age of Ultron"" hints at its scary-movie roots from the start with the Avengers attacking what is essentially a haunted house on a hill. Just look at the way Scarlet Witch (apt name there, too) floats backwards through a door that seemingly closes on its own, as though she were Dracula. Heck, she even has mesmerizing powers to read others' minds and trick them into dreams. The faux Eastern European accent only completes the Bela Lugosi imitation--you know, except she blasts red magic energy from her hands and body. The haunted house also features a mad doctor's dream laboratory where artificial intelligence was being mined from one of those supernatural infinity stones. The two mad doctors of the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man and Bruce Banner/Hulk (the latter of whom has always essentially been a derivative of Jekyll/Hyde, except with smashing replacing Robert Louis Stevenson's original drug abuse and sexual promiscuity), then, take this magical tech back to their lair's lab to, basically, inadvertently unleash a Frankenstein monster, Ultron. This robot creature even stumbles into the Avengers party like he were Boris Karloff freshly reanimated and just learning how to walk and what to think. The Avengers will teach him that ""fire bad""--or at least that laser things shot out of superheros bad for robots--soon enough, too.<br/><br/>Furthermore, Captain America reminds us that he was the experiment of a German scientist and was reanimated from a frozen state. Likewise, Black Widow's flashback dream includes remembering that her body was altered, too, to create the weapon that she is today (for feminist critics of this storyline, this is why it exists). The reason Hawkeye is the ""heart"" or ""soul"" of the team this episode is probably because he's the only one who doesn't think of himself as something of an engineered or otherwise supernatural monster. Iron Man has an electrical plant for a heart and is a man dressing as a robot. Hulk is inching closer to Mr. Hyde entirely out of the control of Dr. Jekyll. The Witch and her speedy brother were also made in a lab. Even Fury is missing an eye. And Thor is an alien god running around with a magic hammer on Earth, for crying out loud.<br/><br/>Thus, we have a cast of characters who are something of Frankensteins themselves, who then go on to more blatantly reference the 1931 ""Frankenstein"" film is giving life to another AI robot (whether with synthetic skin or vibranium what have you or not), Vision. The god of thunder even comes back from his vision quest in a magical pool to provide the lightning bolt of a spark of life to the creature. Indeed, the Vision body was originally planned as the creation of Ultron, who brain washed his own mad scientist for the purpose. So, there is quite a bit of Frankenstein creating going on here. As Tony tells Bruce, ""We're mad scientists. We're monsters, buddy. You've got to own it.""<br/><br/>I enjoy this stitched-together from various genre and technical body parts aspect even if does lead to an imbalance of dark lighting and production design for talking scenes out of a horror movie conflicting with action sequences shot in daylight complete with interruptions of slow-motion superhero poses and bad one-line jokes. (Cap's aversion to cursing especially pisses me off. He was reanimated from fighting super-Nazis, not from ""Leave It to Beaver;"" he should act like it, dammit.) Plus, there's the usual modern-movie dichotomy of live action mixed with CGI animation, which continues to improve. Some of the picture is blandly unimaginative, though. There's too much set-up for future franchise installments. A fight sequence on a runaway train seems particularly to be a rip-off of the better scene from ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004). Although James Spader provides an amusingly chatty voice for a robot, the character is very reminiscent of ""The Terminator"" franchise; AI awakes, gets into the interweb, manufactures an army of mechanical clones, seeks to destroy mankind--we've seen it before. And the Quicksilver character pales in comparison to the version from the prior ""X-Men: Days of Future Past"" (2014).<br/><br/>The apology theme for the Avengers' military adventurism is lackluster, as well. It worked better in ""Iron Man"" (2008) as a reflection of the War on Terror. And, really, do they have to make up places--""Sokovia?"" I'll accept ""Wakanda,"" but what precisely is the political point they're dancing around to try not to offend anyone with this vaguely Eastern European country? I sense this militarism of the Avengers, read (Captain) America, should be another Frankenstein monster here, but it's too muddled. Much of ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is alive, but some of the body is dead parts."

"Hyliannoyed","4","0","0","20 August 2019"," Whedon Screws This One Up Big-Time
","The 2nd of Marvel's mega cross-overs, Age of Ultron does not even come close to living up to it's predecessor. To get the good stuff out of the way, the basic idea of the villain isn't terrible, but it does seem like something for a smaller film than the Avengers. Also, Hawkeye finally gets some decent character development, and we see that he's actually a pretty caring family man. There's also a bit of humor with the ""lifting Thor's hammer"" scene. That is about where the positives end, however.<br/><br/>For starters, the new characters are mostly awful. Ultron, despite having an interesting premise, is totally stupid. His incessant posturing, pretending to be God, is tiresome, and he never uses his full potential (watch HISHE to see what I mean). Quicksilver is utilized terribly, and the I find it ironic that character with super-speed is ultimately the one who dies from a bullet. Worst of all is Vision, the magenta-monstrosity that also thinks itself to be God and is completely and utterly moronic in every way.<br/><br/>As if this wasn't bad enough, the original cast is also handled poorly. Thor's pseudo-mythology is at it's worst, with a ridiculous bathing scene in a dank cave somewhere that is poorly explained and painful to watch. Viler yet is the ""romance"" between Hulk and Black Widow, which comes out of nowhere and is super, super cringey. It makes Anakin and Padme look amazing by comparison. Finally, Tony Starks arrogance goes too far this time, creating the whole miserable mess in which the characters find themselves.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a train-wreck; a dreadfully inane and vapid sequel which has no right to be as bad as it is. It's telling that 2016's Captain America: Civil War feels more like an Avengers film than this one does."

","Age of ultron actually beats the brilliant first film, i absolutely LOVED Avengers Assemble & Age of ultron is an even better film than that!!!<br/><br/>The opening scene is action packed excitement, the Avengers are on a mission & are battling Hydra soldiers through a snowy forest & it's a breathtakingly beautiful sequence!!!
Captain America is still my favourite Avenger, he's the lost relic from another time & he remains loyal & is the heart of the Avengers.
This superb sequel really grabbed me & pulled me into this fantasy world with this amazing team of crime fighters, you really care for these characters & that's how well written they are & the world they exist in!!!<br/><br/>The chemistry between the Avengers team is great, playful & fun but full of heart, the team bounce off of each other, they became great friends & are a joy to watch together.<br/><br/>I found this outstanding sequel to be more grittier, Darker in tone & atmosphere & more heartfelt, there's a great depth to this story & it's characters, the script is superb it's fantastic writing.
Each Avenger is given plenty of room to shine & really grow as a character especially Natasha (Black Widow) She is excellent & really shines as one of the greatest & bravest of the team!!! A fantastic performance from Scarlett Johansson, also Hawkeye is given alot more depth to his own story, we find out he has a pregnant wife & two kids, there's a warm touching scene where the Avengers hide out at his big country house & meet his family.
There's so many great character moments & stunning action scenes.<br/><br/>The Nightmare scenes that each Avenger suffers after the witch plays with their minds is so well done it plays out like a Horror movie, very creepy & dark scenes.
Ultron is a Terrifying villain, an Artificial intelligence nightmare robot who creates an army of deadly robots to destroy earth, he's genuinely creepy & very menacing, a much better villain than Loki in my opinion.<br/><br/>The directing, the music, the acting, the action & the characters are all done perfectly.
Probably the best Avengers film in my opinion & one of the greatest comic book films ever MADE!!!"

Those unacquainted with the film series will not get its full effect from the limited backstory. It runs a bit too fast in parts too, in particular the disposing of foes, which at times looks like tossing garbage in the bin rather than proper fight sequences involving people to engage with.

","A clear step-down from the first, 'Avengers: Age Of Ultron' is for the most part a mess. The characters aren't as well-written as the first, the pacing is poor, the story is pretty generic, and the film's action isn't even all that entertaining. On the flip side, the villain is unique, there are some good character moments and the inclusion of Scarlett Witch makes for some interesting scenes. However, these things can't elevate this film to more than 'good enough'. It's definitely not terrible and it's adequately made, but it just feels as if something is lacking to make us care more about the plot and characters. The film is certainly watchable, but it does nothing special to set it apart and therefore ends up being only a little more than average. There are worse superhero films out there, but considering that this is an 'Avengers' film, it can't help but feel like a let-down. 6/10"

I wanted to like it, but the first had more action and laughs and was paced better. Some of this dragged. It had some cool stuff, but the original had a more interesting story because the superheroes hadn't met before, so those interactions were unpredictable and fun. This seemed too familiar. No, it was similar to other Sci fi movies like Matrix and Terminator where robots are destroying mankind. It continues the first, but Nick Fury is given nothing to do, Thor acts more ""normal"" I guess, it had a few big action scenes, but not as many as the first. It had more superheroes though."

","Pure ,Unadulterated, and True vision of what superhero movies should be.
The heroes come off the page so well in this second film featuring the Avengers.
After the first one which was mostly introductory and formation, this film offers the Avengers in their prime and flourishing as a team.
Because the cast is so big, each hero (and villain) gets adequate time to shine and really develop in this film. Especially Hulk and Black Widow.
Ultron is a believable and entertaining villain upping the stakes as the film moves forward.
Joss Whedon is here to stay, his direction and vision for the MCU is without a doubt unbeatable.
Cinematography and SFX were flawless and the scene where each member of the Avengers attempt to pick up Thors hammer after a night of partying will stick in my memories for a long time.
The plot really sets up well for future installations of upcoming Avenger members and the 3rd installment Infinity War.

","'Avengers: Age Of Ultron (2015)' is not the follow-up you, or director Joss Whedon, would expect and is honestly a derivative and dull experience clearly damaged by callous studio interference. This tampering transformed an already messy picture into a downright boring one. The character focus that made the first stand out, and that is key to the success of the best Marvel movies (as well as the best movies in general) is essentially gone, with each player practically caricatures of their former selves with weak motivations and barely any time or ability to convey them. The focus is placed almost entirely on the admittedly visually pleasing smashy-bashy finale that isn't as deserved this time and therefore isn't as compelling, being even more lifeless than the exposition sequences that will confuse even those who have seen all the prior titles. It's difficult to explain why at times I was just so bored, despite all that was unfolding on screen. And yet that is certainly the case, and the feeling just worsened with time to the point where I was tired upon the title's completion. The picture isn't terrible, it's certainly not among the worst even Marvel have to offer, but it is bland. 6/10"
"Min111","Null","0","0","28 April 2018"," Ultron is super powerful
","I enjoyed watching this movie though it could've been a lot better. I mainly enjoyed it because it involved one of my favourite supervillains ever - Ultron! I just like how bad Ultron looks and appears in the Avengers though I still think he has been mismanaged, and that's one of the main reasons why I think the movie didn't go well with many people. Ultron is one of ""The Avengers"" greatest enemies, so you would think this movie would've done more to make it appear that way. I feel like this movie should've had two-parts to it, or at least be a lot longer considering the villain it involved. Age of Ultron had all the things needed to be a great superhero movie. Perfect timing for it to be released as well. I remember first seeing the trailer as it first came out, and it looked really awesome. I liked how Ultron sounded: looked like he meant business."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron stars Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, and James Spader with the rest of the avengers crew as they make and have to defeat the robot, Ultron, before he tries to destroy the world. <br/><br/>Writing wise this movie has some of the most memorable lines and scenes of the series. Including the famous party scene and the intro fight scene as well. But sadly this film lacks with it altering the overall story of the comics and it feeling like a rip off of the first Avengers film and even though it decides to take more of a risk with introducing three new characters and giving an explanation of what exactly the infinity stones are and how many exactly there are too. It doesn't stand up to the first one. <br/><br/>With Joss Whedon directing this film again like the first one he still kills it. With a bigger budget and the crew ready to go and kick ass is everything that a comic or movie fan wants. With the beautiful use of CGI to make Ultron feel real and relatable with his roboticness makes the directing of this film top notch. <br/><br/>The cast once again is amazing. With Spader killing it as Ultron and his soothing yet uneasy voice he uses in it to give life to this robot makes the film memorable in those senses. And Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olson as the twins, they add a new layer to Stark and show that there are a lot more unique people out there than just the 6 we love. And with Renner having more than roughly 26 minutes of screen time like in the first one. We get more depth of him as a person and as an avenger that makes us as an audience love him more. <br/><br/>With the script being not as strong as the previous film. This movie still stands up to being a great MCU film and holding some of my personal favorite scenes in the series. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron gets a 7.25/10"

","I don't hate this movie at all hence I have only gave it an 7 instead of a 10. But it's not as enjoyable as The Avengers movie. <br/><br/>First of all in the comics I am pretty sure Hank Pym created Ultron not Tony Stark. Oh and what is this relationship with Black Widow and Hulk/Bruce Banner going on. Have the creators forgot about Betty Ross from The Incredible Hulk. That he was in a relationship with her. If that is the case then I guess The Incredible Hulk movie never happened. <br/><br/>So Jarvis is Vision now and FRIDAY takes his place in Iron Man's armor.<br/><br/>The goods to come out of the film is the acting, Andy Serikus's introduction as The Klaw, the fight between Hulk and Hulkbuster, the final battle and James Spader as Ultron.<br/><br/>I wish they killed Scarlet Witch off instead of Quicksilver because she is just practically useless on the team and well done Disney for abandoning the Hulk on a shield helicarrier. <br/><br/>It's a decent movie overall but not as great as the last one."

","Avengers 2 starts off very fast-paced - you're already in the midst of a battle and one of the first exchanges is a hilarious back-and-forth between Iron Man (Downey Jr.) and Captain America (Evans). It at once sets the scene for a great action film, but also helps to quickly re-introduce characters and their personalities. It's not essential to have seen the first movie, or even the 'Thor', 'Iron Man' or 'Captain America' films (and even 'Guardians of the Galaxy'), but they definitely help to add another layer of nuance and understanding to some events/characters.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straight forward - Iron Man wants to protect the world by having his automated suits everywhere. This inadvertently creates artificial intelligence, which turns out to be Ultron (Spader) - who wants to protect Earth by helping it to evolve. This obviously involves wiping out the human species! The Avengers can't handle him - and with Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and Quicksilver (Taylor-Johnson/Kick-Ass) on his side (before they see his true intentions) - they have to re-group and learn to all work together again. The introduction of Vision (Bettany) is handled well and is a welcome one for future films.<br/><br/>One of the best aspects of this film is the characterisation - each Avenger gets some backstory and exposition, not just fight scenes. Hawkeye (Renner) probably comes off the best here, since he's often overlooked - he is after all just a guy who's a good archer! The Black Widow (Johansson) and Hulk (Ruffalo) 'romance' is odd and new, but doesn't necessarily work. However, it's good seeing Thor (Hemsworth), Iron Man and Captain America work as part of a team - especially when Thor and ""Cap"" combine to take out dozens of enemies at once!
 
Spader's voice is great as the voice of discontent with the human species. While the ending is a little reminiscent of 'Superman Returns', the film takes you on an entertaining ride through the Marvel universe - I still look forward to the next instalment(s)!"

Where Hulk, Captain America, Hawkeye and Nick Fury were better off singing the soundtrack of the movie than acting in it due to almost non-existent screen presence. <br/><br/>What was Joss Whedon thinking when he decided to make Ulton a combination of Terminator and Transformers.And what were the extras like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch really doing in there?At Least...and I mean really in the least they could've got a sexier Scarlet Witch so that she could serve as eye candy if nothing else. Yet they put Elizabeth Olsen? <br/><br/>All in all, the movie is not entertainment for everybody.And Avengers directors need to note that keeping lame cast will only get lame response.

"drqshadow-reviews","9","4","12","4 May 2015"," Even Better Than the First
","With the cursory introduction period now behind us, the team is finally able to shift into what's made them so appealing to readers for so many years: their personal relationships, both on and off the battlefield. Of course, with more characters than ever it also runs the risk of overdoing it and crowding the screen, but that's not a problem at all: Joss Whedon manages to get everyone their moment in the sun in a simple, organic way. I was particularly impressed by the amount of time dedicated to Hawkeye and the Black Widow, not coincidentally the two members of the team without solo flicks of their own, and how effective they were at transforming the characters into essential human components of a squad so thoroughly populated by gods among men. Ultron is an intriguing foil, backed by a magnificent voice-over from James Spader, though his threat is often undermined by odd off-the-cuff remarks that, while amusing, make him seem more snarky than sinister. The screenplay is effortlessly cool and funny and rich, though, with staggeringly giant set pieces and no shortage of ballsy, CG-leaning action. A few plot threads could've used more exploration, particularly Thor's spirit quest in the second act, but with so many moving pieces I'm not sure how it could've been done in a reasonable amount of time. In short, The Age of Ultron is everything it advertised and more, an all-stops home run swing that made me giddy to be alive in an age where something so close to my heart could be translated so literally to living color on the big screen. My only reservation stepping out of the theater was that I'd have to wait years to catch the next."

","The first Avengers film was such a success. It contained one of the most momentous cinematic moments of all time - The Hulk's efficient destruction of the villain.. ""Puny god!"" Never before have I heard a cinema erupt in such cheers. Nor am I ever likely to hear since.<br/><br/>So the expectations on this edition were very high. But unfortunately this film shows how hard it is to write a script containing multiple superheroes and be fair to each one of them. Inevitably it comes down to having a good villain who can beat them all - and here lies the Achilles heel of the Avengers property. How to give them something worthy of winning against.<br/><br/>So how to create a worthy adversary without introducing an alien? Have the Avengers create their own villain. Well, almost.<br/><br/>Right from the first frame the film is definitely The Avengers with equal time given to all of Our Heroes. The story is strong, twisty and challenging. All good so far.<br/><br/>Then.. inject a super villain who has the power to mess with the Avengers' minds. Whoops.<br/><br/>By the second act, the film has degenerated into an unrecognizable series of dreams, flashbacks and flash forwards. Soon it becomes impossible to tell which one is which. You look around the darkened cinema, catching the eye of other equally confused viewers. Before long, it becomes apparent that almost everyone around you has whispered ""what the &*$# is going on? <br/><br/>Thankfully this film DOES eventually get back on the rails. By the third act, we're back in true Avengers territory and it all ends happily ever after in true Avengers style.<br/><br/>Stick in there. Make sure you watch right to the very end, well after the credits have rolled. There are a few moments where the film tries to emulate the first, but overall the Age of Ultron brings together the hobble of heroes we had in the first film and prepares it for greater things to come in following editions.<br/><br/>This edition of The Avengers certainly won't be the favorite of most. It's largely disjointed. Kind of like trying to watch eight different movies at the same time. It would have got an 8 - if it weren't for that 40 minutes in the middle wasted trying to work out what the heck was going on.<br/><br/>Barely a minute goes by without the cinemas' sub woofers getting a workout.

Come to see this movie completely up to date with the story, because ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" barely gives you time to breath among its many spectacular action sequences that start even before the opening credits. Die hard fans will love that all the main characters and supporting heroes make an appearance, and by the end you'll definitely be excited for what is to come before the 2 part finale in 2018 & 2019.<br/><br/>An unspecified time has passed since the events of the first movie, and the Avengers have learnt to somewhat bounce off each other and utilise the best of each others powers significantly. Among various missions across the globe, they storm across compounds with enough various technologies from previous movies that Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) can finally work upon the ""Ultron"" initiative. Like any comic book narrative, things are jumped into too hastily and suddenly plans to attempt world peace and security could ultimately lead to its extinction.<br/><br/>Those familiar with the comic books know that ""Ant-Man"", famously created ""Ultron"" (A character who is about to receive his own anticipated film release in a couple months). However the Marvel Cinematic Universe has been doing its own setup for a while now, and they've flawlessly worked their choices into a movie that definitely does justice to the destructive capabilities ""Ultron"" is known to be capable of. Joss Whedon returns from directing the first movie and I really enjoyed the speed and pauses they've incorporated into this lengthy movie, considering that while I still enjoyed the first movie I also felt like I was watching an episode of ""Firefly"" in terms of patient waiting (FYI, ""Firefly"" is a truly great show). Some of the action is a little obstructed from being so up close, but the particular sequences and outcomes will guarantee to leave you enthralled.<br/><br/>""Age of Ultron"" has its slow and tender moments also. Nothing that falls into overall cheese, but some stuff incorporated feels a little underdeveloped or unnecessary (The ""flashback"" sequences were a nice touch). Ultron is voiced and motion captured very well by the always charming James Spader, whose villainy is somewhat established right from the very start and I found that a little jarring. The only two downsides I saw (As a fan) is that I wish they had somewhat introduced a naive mind that eventually turns evil (A later introduction of a certain fan-favourite android was handled this way perfectly), and that they incorporated the design of Ultron from the comics onto the main ""body"". Alas we have the somewhat face we've seen similar to the ""Transformer"" movies, but his minions have the comic book look so I was happy nonetheless to see it somewhat done. Regardless, James Spader did wonders for the part, and brought a real presence to one of Marvel's most memorable foes.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: It was loud and extremely fast, and surprisingly that wasn't really a bad thing this time around. Every actor and character new and old delivers greatly, and the footage from the trailers of the last previous months lived up to the hype and more. The 3-D felt a little unnecessary for the many dark sequences of the film, and I don't think you'd be missing anything regardless. But all in all, ""The Avengers"" are most definitely back for a superior follow up. It's gonna gross unfathomable amounts of money, and by the time the credits roll I was more than happy with the intelligent directions taken and the foreseeable future of the series as always looks promising. 7/10."

","Whilst I enjoyed the film, it didn't feel as much like a Whedon film and more like he was maybe allowed a few minutes here and a few minutes there before he had to return to being on the path that was laid out for him.<br/><br/>The film had a very much tick box, direct by committee feel to it.<br/><br/>Make sure there are this many new characters, ram in some interaction even if it doesn't feel organic, ensure that we put in irrelevant scenes only to provide links for future films, don't stray from the plan.<br/><br/>The mid credits scene only re-enforced this and reminded you that the film you just watched was really nothing more than a filler.<br/><br/>There was masses going on and loads of new characters but it just felt that it was going at 100mph and didn't want to stop and smell the roses.<br/><br/>I can understand why Joss would want to step away from this for a bit and that maybe the slightly more easily manipulated Russo brothers could take the reins for A:IW 1 & 2.<br/><br/>They demonstrated that they can direct action scenes that fulfil the 'wouldn't it be cool if we...' but then when trapped in a story telling dead end just go with a hole in the ground get out of jail card.<br/><br/>The film was entertaining, there was plenty of cool tech on display and it was certainly worth the price of admission. However, I don't think (in my opinion) that it was better than the first Avengers or Guardians."

","This is a movie I've been waiting months to see. I'm a big Marvel Comics and movie fan. The first outing for this ensemble of super characters, The Avengers is one of my all time favourites. So, really looking forward to this movie but filled with trepidation: what If it didn't live up to the hype, how many sequels are as good as the first, what if it was just downright disappointing? So the first question to ask is ""where you disappointed""? Heck no, this is one well crafted, superhero, super fun, super sequel. Whew, I'm telling you I was worried going into the cinema but from minute one, this movie takes you on a roller coaster of action, fun, super-amazing CGI, great characters and a well thought out story. Even has a few laughs thrown in for good measure. <br/><br/>The story at its heart is a simple one: good people, modern day Knights in shining armour, okay more latex than armour but go with the flow. With warrior hearts that have to do battle with evil; finding the resolve and character to fight against the odds to claim victory for good. It's good vs evil, that simple. Of course the good guys all have super powers, okay, technically Tony Stark doesn't have super powers out with his Iron Man suit but go with me on the premise, all the good guys are super good and of course the bad guys are super bad. Except that in this movie the bad guy ain't quite ""guy"" but I'll say no more and let you figure out what I mean for yourselves. The story has many layers of sudo science and the CGI adds to the sci-fi dimension of the tale, but hey it's a Marvel Comics adaptation, of course it's going to have sudo science and sci-fi in it. It may be a sci-fi movie with lots of special effects but it's also got lots of great characters, many of which are not human but they've all got depth and are all very human. It's an old story rebooted for a modern technological age; even plagiarises ever so gently from Beauty and The Beast on a side strand!<br/><br/>The characters all work well together, you get the feeling that the actors had fun working together. Great performances from the whole cast, it would be unfair to pick out any individual actor, no one tries to out act the others they all work well together. They had fun working with each other and they bring fun to the movie. The movie has a lot of humour, okay, some of the humour is geeky, but hey let's be honest, you don't go to see a Marvel superhero movie without having a little bit of geek in you! The end result is that the characters they are acting on the screen all bond well together; it's an ensemble of all, a team of talent. They are The Avengers."
"sanctuaryfan","9","4","12","24 April 2015"," The ingredients for this movie can't ever disappoint the fans
","This movie is for the people who wait until final credits roll to see the last scene that connects to the next movie. I went to the movie being convinced that I would love it. I've been waiting for it for a long time so I couldn't care less even if it sucked because I would still love it. Keep in mind I'm a big Marvel fan... A great movie, a bit less funny that the first Avengers, but with more depth, plus the connection between the members of the team is beautiful. It started off slow, but there's a lot of special effects, fighting, some romance, humor, sarcasm and drama that make up for the beginning. The only thing I didn't like is the fact that it seems like the Avengers team will change and sarcasm won't be the same without Iron Man, Thor and Hulk."
"vukkalamvinod","5","4","12","24 April 2015"," Too much of anything is good for nothing
","If I have to rephrase this: ""Too many cooks spoil the broth"" then it will be something like this ""Too many superheroes will spoil the action movie"". I came to this conclusion after watching this movie.<br/><br/>I got headache after viewing this movie. In I,Robot and Terminator, we have Artificial Intelligence (A.I) as the villain. Same goes here as well but one distinction is we have another A.I ""Vision"" as an Avenger. One can understand the story from trailer itself. Villain ""Ultron"" believes Humans are dangerous to the world peace and therefore from their extinction world peace is possible. He then enacts a plan to kill all Humans, only to be stopped by Avengers. Such a wafer thin plot is stretched to almost two and half hours by including action sequences and lame background of the Superheroes. <br/><br/>Why I didn't liked this movie? May be I have grown up questioning myself more about who I am? What is the reason for my existence?... etc.<br/><br/>This movie is for those who don't question and accept things as they are."
"jason_wisdom","5","3","8","3 April 2016"," Ambitious but cheesy
","The Avengers was a fantastic movie in so many ways. This, its sequel, tried too hard and its character development in dialogue was too thin, much like X-men 3. <br/><br/>Some deleted scenes, even as minor as the 4-5 seconds that were cut, did a lot to explain some gaping plot holes. Some of the virtuous-boy-next-door lines by the stars seemed more appropriate for a group called The Partridge Family and not a group of lethal outcasts banding together to wage war and calling themselves The Avengers. <br/><br/>Special effects were nice, and certain fight scenes were nice. This film is not bad. But this film lacks substance."
"TheFirstExecutioner","7","3","8","25 November 2015"," Not As Good As the First But Still A Watchable Movie
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the 11th entry in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Let me get this out of the way first: The first Avengers movie in my opinion was much better than this one. Once again, Joss Whedon directs and does an excellent job. Also the cast is unbeatable with Robert Downey Jr. as Tony Stark/Iron Man, Chris Evans as Steve Rogers/Captain America, Mark Ruffalo as Bruce Banner/Hulk, Scarlett Johansen as Black Widow, Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye, and Samuel L. Jackson as Nick Fury. Newcomers are Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch as well as James Spader as Ultron. The cast does a great job. <br/><br/>Now the story is where the problems come for me. The main plot is pretty much Tony Stark and Bruce Banner invent Ultron which was supposed to protect but then it decides to destroy. Ultron honestly didn't feel that menacing as compared to villains from other MCU films like Loki in The Avengers or the Winter Soldier in Cap. America 2. But he is hilarious. The story jumps all over the place with parties to small battles to large scale city battles. The Hulk vs Hulk-Buster sequence was probably my favorite scene of the entire movie since the final battle wasn't really impressive compared to the first Avengers. For all the other effects and action, it's been seen before in countless other action and superhero movies. Then there's this whole romance with Black Widow and Banner and it's like where on earth did that come from?? There were a few times when I felt flat out bored during this movie. Nothing of much interest happened in these scenes. However, the ending and the post credit scenes were pretty cool and make the future installments in the MCU look very promising.<br/><br/>Overall, I can say I had an OK time with Avengers: Age of Ultron. For me, it didn't live up to many other MCU movies like The Avengers, Iron Man, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, and Guardians of the Galaxy. From A+ to F, Avengers: Age of Ultron gets a B-."
"Wirxaw","7","3","8","9 September 2015"," Age of LuLtron
","As others, I've heard generally bad stuff about the movie, especially compared to the first one. And myself I've felt it in the first few scenes... that... that stench of CGI. Many movies since Avatar have been reeking of it, but that's the benchmark. Unfortunately, this is more like a stench of 300:Rise of an Empire. It's the knowledge that everything you see is just that... pixels. Not even well-hidden, despite the technology. There's no acting, there's a ton of slow-mos and it cries: ""suspend your disbelief"". And it's not even in a good way, if there can even be one, it's just panorama, exposition. Eye popper type of candy. Doesn't work for everyone, though. To add to this, as many people have noted - the humor. Where DC is gritting teeth to try and sustain the Dark legacy, Marvel hasn't really matured past Iron Man 1. I love the jokes, I love the oneliners. Any normal person does. But just like Frozen, when EVERY other moment, every other situation - is backed up by a oneliner or by a stupid song... The picture is ruined.<br/><br/>People complain about plot and story, but I very much liked the insight and detail of almost every character. Sure, some minor characters were one-offs, like that doctor or arms dealer, and Captain has got two movies to flash in a spangled outfit - they can be disregarded. Who was given plenty of love are: Black Window, Hulk, Hawkeye. The backstory, the relationships - really made them more than the empty shells they were in the previous movies. Where Black Widow just had red in her ledger and couldn't figure which strong handsome man to flirt with in the next movie - she is now actually feeling something, acts open and reveals her background. And no, if there's one thing I disagree with people - is love story. It must NOT be there, and however veiled it was - that was ideal. I'd remove 3 stars from AoU if there was a kissing scene, seriously. Hulk keeps getting better and better, and receives more detail towards his mechanics than ""I'm always angry"". And while he finds some social ground to stand on, it's good that he still stays true to his solitary nature. Hawkeye... I was shocked. The amount of character expressed in him the movie is stunning. Previously he was what.. Legolas. Literally. Then there were Captain Hinds..., I mean America, who more or less ""raidled"" the Avengers, and there was Tony, who had to work out all the technical stuff, had to make the hard choices in Avengers, IM3... Now we get the daddy hero. And that tops it all. It tops any resemblance of care towards planet that Superman could every try to face cringe. Hawkeye, the father, loved and inspired by his wife, has to be THE leader. The motivator, the overseer, the guy who has the most important thing in life to protect, unlike anyone in the movie. Of course, I might be stretching it too far, but he did his job(c).<br/><br/>Add to that the god complex of Ultron and the story of the twins, and the comedy actually becomes sort of drama. I won't mention Vision, because he was just sort of piloted. Not much to say so far. Overall, the depth of characters is one of the best in MCU, and this more or less justifies the movie.<br/><br/>What I'd like to least as clear disadvantages are the villains\anti-heroes. While I did acknowledge the moral of Ultron and the backstory of the twins, their realization is awkward. I remember a good quote from the Chronicles of Riddick: ""You know, you are supposed to be some slick-sh** killer. Now look at you... all back-of-the-bus and sh**."" Perfect description. Just flawless. Ultron was proposed as an... endgamer. By none other than Tony himself. And that's after we've repelled an alien invasion, prevented some prehistoric freak from destroying the universe, stopped hydra from butchering the world... among other things. Now there's just another Transcended guy, and poor Paul Bettany has to kill him, again! What's more, he pulls more cranks and has so wild behavior - he reminds me of Funnybot, for those who get the reference. I just want to imagine some of Ultron lines followed by him saying:""...awkwaaaard!"" I thought Malekith was the worst character design in MCU(and that's saying something), but damn, Ultron beats him(though he is still technically a better scripted character).<br/><br/>Then there are the twins... I dislike comics, and and I don't want Scarlet Witch to be some world nexus or something. But damn, can't a freakin chaos witch do something more than wave her arms and read the fears? Seriously, Tony did more damage by testing his repulsors in the lab in Iron Man 1. And if she didn't provoke the Hulk, all her mental powers would be nothing more than plot pushers. We need backstory? Yay, let's make her find their fears. We want to screencap Hulkbuster? Scarlet Witch is the gal for the job! Quicksilver... well, all his awesomeness spoofed in DOFP is used to merely parody the Flash. He is the single grumpy character in the movie. And all he does is whack stuff and get exhausted every now and then. Probably the actor had his contract revoked or something, because with all the stuff going around in the movie - Quicksilver felt like they wanted to off him before he did.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I can't say that the movie deserves a bad rating. It's not as bad as it gets. 6 is the red price. I'm giving it 7 on a fan parole basis. I waited for it, I enjoyed it, and I wasn't outright revolted. And if there's more good than harm, then that's where the scales will tip from my perspective."
"gtylerpayne","7","3","8","10 September 2015"," Fun, entertaining super hero movie that has some flaws
","I just read a bunch of reviews for this movie on IMDb and they all seemed to be negative. I definitely think they were being over harsh, most likely because they had SUCH high expectations going into this film. For how hyped up this movie is and how much money was spend, there are some things worth criticizing, but it certainly doesn't make it a bad movie. If you like superhero blockbusters, you will most likely enjoy this film.<br/><br/>I was torn between giving this a 7 or an 8. If I could be more precise, I would have said 7.4 or something. There are some really cool scenes, like the hulk-buster scene in Africa, I liked Andy Serkis in Africa, I thought vision was pretty col. The climax was pretty exciting and epic. And like many Marvel movies, there are lots of little things to notice which make it fun to re- watch.<br/><br/>One of the main criticisms I read people citing, was the over use of humor. This didn't bother me at all. It creates a completely different tone than a movie like ""Dark Knight,"" but I think it works. Some of the jokes I actually thought were pretty funny, like at the beginning when Iron Man says ""Good Talk"" and one of the men yells ""NO it wasn't!"" Something about the delivery is very funny to me. Also when Dr. Helen Cho is invited to the party and asks if Thor will be there. Her delivery of that line was great. Robert Downy Jr is always funny and charismatic, and he delivers here as usual.<br/><br/>On the downside, the character development in this movie isn't great. I think they can get away with it because it ties in with all the other Marvel movies, so they think they can skip it, plus with so many characters, it's just not possible to really develop everyone, but some of the characters seem to act in a way that contradicts previous films. Iron Man, Captain America and Thor all seem to disregard much of what happened in their recent films. But most notably, Black Widow and Dr. Banner's romance does seem forced, and was never hinted at in previous films. Black Widow seems to have a new hero to flirt with in each film, and Dr. Banner doesn't really seem interested in her at all, even in this movie. They could have probably made the romance between them work, but they just went about it the wrong way.<br/><br/>Then lastly there is the issue of Ulton, his motives, and the jumbled plot surrounding his existence and his plan. It is a pretty cool story, but it really makes very little sense. It never is explained why he hates the avengers and he sort of explains why he wants to destroy Earth, but not in a very clear or logical way. Both he and vision come about so suddenly, and they are both instantly cracking jokes and coming up with grand schemes. It's not very easy to believe. <br/><br/>Also, the climax is sort of weird. Ultron seems like this invincible force that can live in the internet and change and multiply bodies and now has a vibranium body. But then at the end of the film, Vision ""locks him out of the internet"" and Hulk punches him, and now he is destroyed??? Lots of build up to suddenly take care of him really easily.<br/><br/>The whole movie does kind of have a weird mix of scenes trying to hard to be emotional surrounded by intense action and comedy. The first Avengers movie was much better at finding this balance.<br/><br/>The CGI was mostly great, however the first long shot of the Avengers invading Stryker's research base had some very fake video game looking stuff, but that must have been a pretty difficult shot to make look real. The CGI toward the end with the city rising was cool.<br/><br/>While there are some flaws, it takes some analysis and possibly a few viewings to really let them start bugging you. If you just turn off your brain and enjoy the action, its a cool movie. And in reality, all super hero movies are completely ridiculous, so I don't think these flaws warrant calling this movie a complete failure.<br/><br/>The first Avengers movie I can watch over and over, while this one I lost interest in after a few times, but I still enjoyed it very much and had a lot of fun watching it."
"lindsaygross","7","3","8","6 September 2015"," disappointed in character portrayals
","Joss Whedon takes Natasha completely out of character, showing her as a love sick, helpless woman. He has Bruce literally face plant in her boobs. Not to mention the fact that they have had absolutely no chemistry in the past and it feels extremely forced in this movie. Also, he borrows a character from the X-Men, then kills them off for no reason. Its no surprise he got bullied off twitter. But as far as an action movie goes it was pretty good. If you aren't totally invested in the characters you should enjoy it. It starts out on a good note with some humor that really captures the personalities of the characters. I cant wait until the civil war. Especially since Joss wont be in charge."
"Rob_Taylor","6","3","8","23 August 2015"," The Avengers are starting to resemble the Expendables
","So, what I mean by the tagline is this: <br/><br/>The Expendables stars a bunch of action heroes involved in ridiculous action set-pieces based around an increasingly unbelievable plot.<br/><br/>The Avengers stars a bunch of comic book heroes involved in ridiculous action set-pieces based around an increasingly unbelievable plot.<br/><br/>Now, just like in the Expendables, there is almost zero character development. All is gone in favour of endless CGI battles. Whilst I appreciate that we are talking simplistic characters here, I don't think it is unreasonable to expect more. I get it, it is an action movie. It has to have action. But, as the Transformers franchise has shown, all action and no depth makes for uninspired cinema, over-use of CGI and a poor script.<br/><br/>Avengers: Ultron is like trying to pour a quart into a pint pot. There's just too many characters vying for screen time and the result is that none of them get the time they deserve.<br/><br/>But is it any good as an action movie? Well, to start with. However, at some point it all starts to get very samey. How many robots of doom do we need to see destroyed before we should move on to the next part of the ""plot""? The answer is ""very many"" apparently. It becomes tedious and dull after a while.<br/><br/>Only at the very end does the film redeem itself somewhat with some actual emotion to go along with the boring action-fest. But by then, it's too little, too late.<br/><br/>Remember when everyone hated on Peter Jackson for taking The Hobbit and stretching it out into three movies? Well this is the exact opposite of that. Too much crammed into too little.<br/><br/>I don't mind the single hero movies. But when you get so many crowded into one film, it devalues them all.<br/><br/>This decade is going to be known as the one that replaced story and character with CGI. I just wish it would stop.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Too much of everything. Heroes, action, CGI. Just too much. I wasn't expecting King Lear, but this is more like King Drear."
"tomatdotcom","9","3","8","17 August 2015"," Just so much fun
","Before I continue, or even start this review, I would like to acknowledge my bias. I love Joss Whedon. He is my absolute idol. Everything he has touched in the past 20 years has been incredible (that Alien movie notwithstanding). Hopefully that will also add a certain weight when I say this is my favourite Joss Whedon movie yet. What I have come to love about Marvel and their amazing universe is that they know how to have fun with a movie. They understand that 'comic book adaptation' and 'gritty cinematic experience' are not necessarily synonymous. Granted, this has a place in the broad spectrum that is cinema, and I don't necessarily condemn DC for their approach. However, Marvel's characters are perfectly suited for a movie where laughing in the middle of a battle scene is encouraged, not a precursor to sadistic tendencies. Every line of dialogue is perfectly crafted, whether it be a humorous quip or a simple interaction, revolving around a similarly fantastic plot and a villain I am confident is the best of the Marvel lineup so far. On a list also featuring Loki and the Winter Soldier, that's quite an achievement. Ultron is hilarious and badass and hilariously badass, with more depth than some of the human characters. Yet the star of this show, a show filled with incredible characters who individually command the screen every time it stops on them, the one who absolutely steals it is The Vision. A stunning character, brilliantly portrayed by Paul Bettany, with an incredible introduction. Seriously. This is not hyperbole. I have never wanted to clap in a movie theatre before, but the first scene with Vision very nearly drove me to do just that. I won't go into specifics, because everybody who has seen the film knows exactly what I'm talking about and everybody who hasn't seen it needs to understand how special it is firsthand. In summary, truly an amazing movie, due in part for it's ability to not take itself too seriously. Almost all of the characters have remarkable depth, and their individual personalities manage to shine through a densely packed lineup. Intoxicating action scenes, some of the best dialogue from the best wordsmith in the business and all of this makes for some pretty simple maths; Watch this movie. You will enjoy it. And you will also no longer be the only person on the planet who hasn't."
"mubeen710","7","3","8","15 August 2015"," Had it flaws, yet an exciting approach to the Marvel's 2nd phase
","Joss Whedon is too talented to keep making these thin, unremarkable Marvel movies, and this is a lazy sequel that feels like more of the same compared to the first Avengers film, especially as it has all the problems found in that one and a plot that is even more poorly developed. The movie did have some edge of the seat action sequences, especially the chaos between Hulk & Iron Man yet the poor character developments of the Marvel's speedster Hovok & Scarlet Witch is a little disappointing. The addition of Paul Bettany's ""The Vision"" works flawlessly, he was a personal favorite for me. But overall Avengers Age Of Ultron is an extremely enjoyable addition to the Marvel franchise."
"nlopez-84387","5","3","8","31 July 2015"," Another disappointing MCU film.
","Avengers 2 had a great cast and awesome action. <br/><br/>But im afraid that explosions alone does not guarantee a good movie. This movie was really Corny filled with a lame joke every 5 minutes, cheesy one liners and overflowing explosions, The plot was meh, The villain was terrible,but i mean the villain was really really bad! It was like looking at a evil Bill Murray. It was not threatening, It was not the sequel everyone wanted, it was the sequel that will be forgotten in a year. And the Character Quicksilver!!!! Worse than Ultron! Xmen DOFP made a great Quicksilver so why did MCU made this terrible version, I'll never know. Look i like MCU films like Iron Man, Captain America 1 and 2, Ant-Man and Guardians of the Galaxy, But thats it people. But as what a said in the beginning, the cast was perfect, really convincing characters ( except quicksilver) and the score was pretty good. So thats it, Avengers age of Ultron was a mediocre film. But its a film u can watch with your friends to kill time."
"athleticteen","8","3","8","9 July 2015"," Another Sequel Lead to Some Disappointment
","I recently watched Avengers AOU and I left the theater kind of disappointed. Let me explain why... 1. The villain Ultron. After hearing from all my comic book friends and brother about who Ultron was and how menacing and very controversial the character is, was a huge let down. 2. The mood felt like the first Avengers movie, where they have a bad op and everyone feels it. From Steve Rogers vision of what life would've been like if he wasn't frozen in the ice, to Black Widow's vision into her past. However I'm pleased that this movie had more comedy and I can appreciate that improvement from the last one. So overall the movie was an 8 out of 10 for the action and more comedy added into the 2 hours."
"aesylvia","6","3","8","12 June 2015"," Trailer almost as misleading as Iron Man 3's (Spoilers)
","I wanted to score this film higher but although I do love spectacle, it just felt way too mindlessly Michael Bay-esque and the scale of explosions and destruction served no purpose.<br/><br/>I felt that almost every other problem I had with the film could have been addressed by simply splitting the thing up into two parts like they are planning to do with Infinity War. I mean, when I think about the missed marketing opportunity (Avengers 2 split into 2 parts, followed by Avengers 3 split into 3 parts-how brilliant would that have been?) it really just compounds the problem and makes Marvel seem all the more foolish for it.<br/><br/>Had this solution been utilized, there would have been so much more room for essential things like new characters' backstories, and development for old and new characters, especially main villain Ultron. The sinister ""There are no strings on me"" from the trailer that sent chills up my spine came to naught as Ultron became essentially a dark mirror of Tony Stark with way too little behind his motivation to do anything he did (like most of Iron Man's villains so far), let alone to despise and resent his creator the way he seems to. Also, more gradual evolutions in his plans to ultimately concoct and carry out what became his final scheme would have been better too.<br/><br/>The twins suffered the same problem of lack of exposure and development. Vision too, but I could forgive that if only because the character was intended to be something of an enigma, but for the former two to actually join forces with Ultron, I would have expected much more backstory, perhaps a flashback rather than simply being told what happened to make them vengeful against Stark and company.<br/><br/>Trying to cram everything, including the excessive one-liners, into a single film was, regrettably, a disaster. If what I hear about there being a 4-hour cut of the film, that would probably have fixed just about every problem I addressed. This was a serious problem with a simple solution that they had years to decide to release in two parts and just dropped the ball.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, it was entertaining enough, definitely set up a lot of future intrigue, and the interactions of the team together, now that their familiarity has increased, were very pleasing and the increased team dynamic as far as combat is concerned was more than a little satisfying but the ride was just too fast to enjoy everything properly and be given everything on our wish list. With the ever-expanding nature of the MCU, dropping us into what felt more like an 'in media res' scenario that never bothered to go back and explain how point A led to point B was a foolhardy decision, creating an even greater sense of overly accelerated pacing and unanswered questions.<br/><br/>Don't expect this one to deliver what the first one did. A bloated, runaway mess may not have been what they were going for but they ought to have known that this recipe would have inevitably ended up as one."

I could tell from the first scene what kind of movie this was going to be, and I loved it. There is great drama, great action (of course) and amazing characters (including two new ones). There seems to be a lot more of our heroes using their individual abilities than in the first movie, which was nice to see. I wasn't really a fan of Hawkeye's story, nor the romance between Natasha and Bruce, but in no way did that ruin the experience. I have to say though, Ultron was built up to be this menacing horror movie type villain, but actually, he made me laugh. He is just as funny and even light-hearted (sometimes) as Stark (obviously, being created by Stark) and his voice didn't scare me at all - it didn't quite seem to fit. Plus, Loki was better.<br/><br/>But anyway - great movie and I would definitely recommend it."
"eobame47","6","3","8","17 May 2015"," The movie before the movie
","Ultron is a robot who wants to destroy humanity. That's established from the moment he appears. Why he wants to destroy humanity? Why does he go to that extreme right away? That's not so clear. <br/><br/>Sure, as a specie we do a lot of bad, stupid and evil things. But that's not all we do.<br/><br/>Side question: why is he a he? I suppose a female main villain, like in Terminator 3, would be too senseless, or whatever.<br/><br/>The Avengers are all cool with each other now, so all the character development is sort of lost. There is no real tension. Their interactions, to me, were kind of boring--forced.<br/><br/>Side issue: I wish there was more diversity--Latino, Asian, Black, Native American. In a sequel, how about adding more diverse faces, along with the main cast. Here come Elizabeth Olsen's Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor Johnson's Quicksilver, and then Paul Bettany's The Vision: actors with similar skin tones, like most of the main cast. <br/><br/>This felt to me like a movie before the movie. Loki and The Chitauri were big villains. So from there, you go to Ultron? Thanos is obviously the big bad guy--the world conqueror. However, Marvel didn't want to do that yet, so here's Ultron.<br/><br/>I thought I would be amazed. I wasn't. I was not only disappointed, but kind of bored."
"chillyacademic","6","3","8","15 May 2015"," Good, but felt like a missed opportunity
","The good: <br/><br/>-The action. It's what we all came for. Some sequences are spectacular.<br/><br/>-New characters. I liked the ""twins"" and even though they barely scratched the surface with their story, it was more compelling than those of any of the Avengers. The Vision was also pretty cool, but alas they did nothing with him<br/><br/>The bad: <br/><br/>-Unfortunately there were quite a few battles that were very meh. The final battle was chaotic and not that exciting. <br/><br/>-Ultron sucked. He starts as a ""Frankenstein's monster"" type of villain seeking to punish his creator. This would be really cool. But as the movie goes on he becomes a cookie cutter cackling bad guy. Tony and Ultron never really talk. The implications of his horrible creation are never explored. He just doesn't care and an enriching storyline is completely ignored.<br/><br/>-Spends too much time on uninteresting story lines, and neglects the interesting ones. The superpower twins' background with Tony Stark was fresh, but it never went anywhere. And the Vision could have been a real standout in the movie. An android with heightened awarenes. His few scenes where he gets to talk are interesting. He reminded me of Doctor Manhattan in Watchmen. But he just shows up to kick some ass and nothing else. Why have all these new characters if they serve no purpose?<br/><br/>While the above characters are swept aside, the movie somehow sees fit to waste plenty of time at a farm and on pointless side-errands for the main characters. It's really baffling.<br/><br/>-Too much humour. There are a LOT of one-liners and jokes. Most fall flat and most are inappropriately placed in that they kill any tension or thrills. I get it's a lighthearted movie, but the constant wisecracking got a bit much. <br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed this movie, the action was pretty good but couldn't help feeling as I left the theatre that it could have been a lot more."
"neyony345-33-475119","8","3","8","11 May 2015"," Another Over the Top Marvel Movie
","Avengers Age of Ultron has too many characters, too many enemies, too many twists, and too many sub plots. A lot of the times, I felt that it was too rushed and too difficult to follow the direction of the movie. I felt the introduction of Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) was unnecessary, as they weren't important to the plot most of the time. It also doesn't help that they both sport very annoying and unconvincing Eastern European accents. I felt Ultron (James Spader) played his role very well, but was a weak villain overall. I felt that the AI gone rogue plot to destroy the world was way too cliché. There were some good moments in the movie, and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) get a chance to shine where they previously didn't in Avengers 1. There are a lot of funny moments, and the best parts of the movie are where they interact and bounce off each other, and trade puns. In the end, this movie just feels frantic and hysterical and half- baked Marvel movie, lacking the quality of Captain America 2 and the fun factor of Guardians of the Galaxy, making the movie fall short of my expectations."

","""I know you're good people. I know you mean well. But you just didn't think it through. There is only one path to peace... your extinction.""<br/><br/>Age of Ultron doesn't live up to the first Avengers mostly because the novelty of seeing all these superheroes together has warn off, but it is still a very entertaining film with some positive elements to take out of it. First of all, the villain voiced by James Spader is an improvement over most others we've seen in the Marvel Universe. He is actually a menace to the heroes, and although Ultron isn't as charismatic as Loki, he still represents a much more dangerous threat for them so we feel there is much more at stake. The addition of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch also enhances the franchise. Olsen is an actress I've admired ever since her screen debut in Martha Marcy May Marlene, so it was exciting to see her play this role alongside other fantastic actors. Aaron Taylor-Johnson's Quicksilver wasn't used as well as he was in X-Men, but it was still fun to see him on screen. Quicksilver was the highlight for me in the latest X-Men franchise, but here he is simply another new character. It was much more fun to see his quick movements in slow motion instead of at such a rapid pace. The returning characters also enhance the sequel and make it entertaining. Robert Downey Jr. as Iron Man is by far my favorite character in the franchise and Mark Ruffalo's Hulk always delivers some of the best comedic moments. Age of Ultron delivers plenty of fun scenes, but it also tries to take itself a bit more seriously, and that didn't work as well for me considering I found Captain America The Winter Soldier to be a slightly better and interesting serious thriller. In summary, it doesn't match the comedy of its predecessor and it doesn't stand out as a more serious film either. The run-time does begin to feel a bit heavy, but I still have to admit that I had a fun time with the movie. There is a lot going on and with the addition of the new characters some of the scenes feel rushed and the plot gets a bit convoluted.<br/><br/>The main problem with these Marvel movies is that they're getting more and more difficult to view as individual films. They seem to be always building up to something and I expected all the build-up in the previous films was going to lead to something important in this second Avengers movie, but what we get instead is more of a build-up to the next phase of the Marvel universe. Ultron presented a great threat to the heroes, but everything was rushed and it seems it was resolved all too easily by the end. It's still hard to resist a film with so many likable characters and charismatic leads, but I couldn't help but feel a bit disappointed with Age of Ultron when the introduction of the main villain seemed promising. Spader's voice work stood out for me in this film as one of the best performances. I was also happy to see Jeremy Renner get much more screen time with his character, Hawkeye, as well as Scarlett Johansson with Black Widow. This is probably as close to an individual film about them we'll get. Captain America and Thor however, are underused and I really didn't care too much about them here.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"bstarkey-109-400129","7","3","8","11 May 2015"," Good, but lacking in many ways
","First off, this movie is not a bad movie in any way. It is action packed and enjoyable from beginning to end. But with that being said I felt this movie was underwhelming in many ways. In phase one Marvel does a successful job of connecting all of the movies together, ending with the conclusion with The Avengers. I felt phase 2 did a good job of showing what the characters did in the events immediately following the events in New York during Avengers 1. <br/><br/>But this time around I personally felt like Marvel did a sub-par job of connecting the films. They also failed to mention a lot of the cliffhangers that the other movies have previously led the fans on. For example, why is Thor on Earth? Why are the chitauri still around? And how did they find Hydra, which seemed so deeply hidden in previous films. They act as though Tony Stark never destroyed is suites at the end of Iron Man 3, and they only mention Bucky Barnes one time, and it's just a brief sentence. I also wasn't a huge fan of the romance between two of the main characters, just feel that it was set up well enough, and felt like it was added just to have a love interest in the movie.<br/><br/>I just felt that the story was a little disconnected from previous films and the story of Ultron was completely rushed. It did have the marvel humor that fans have grown to expect, although I would argue this film focused a little more on the comedy side, rather than the dark story that could have been. The fighting sequences are awesome, and Ultron is an awesome character as well. Overall this is a good popcorn film, but Marvel has been so good lately that this movie feels a little bit like a disappointment. I was also disappointed that there wasn't a post credit scene setting up the next film, the post credit scenes have been lacking of late, which is also a disappointment to me. I give it a 7/10, which is still a good movie, but it could have been much better. Hopefully they do better in phase 3."

"macedones","7","3","8","10 May 2015"," Enjoyable, but...
","First of all, I am a huge fan of Marvel since I was a little boy and I've been collecting their comics ever since. I was expecting a movie that would take the super hero genre to a next level. A movie that would take things more seriously with an impressive plot and well developed script. At least it was this kind of expectation the teasers and trailers were creating. Unfortunately, it wasn't what I was expecting.<br/><br/>There are several flaws within the movie. I'll try to shorten them as much as I can without spoiling anything. First thing that didn't please me was the one punch line jokes. They've put way too many jokes in this and none of them was satisfying as the ones in the first movie. It felt exaggerated. Secondly, the pace of things happening SO fast in consequence of bad writing. There were times that I had to go ""Wait a second. What about the other thing that just happened? Is that going to be explained?"". Some facts that would contribute to make the movie better were simply thrown in it without getting any kind of explanation. Third thing lacking was evolution. Despite the inclusion of new characters, Age of Ultron is a chapter that didn't accomplish much and did not move things forward. I left the movie confused and scratching my head wondering which fact of the second assembling could cause an impact on future events. I couldn't find much. And last but not least, the villain motivation for destroying humanity. I think everybody was expecting something intelligent, but no. It was just an old cliché.<br/><br/>Taking all these things aside, Age of Ultron guarantees itself as a great action-adventure movie. The team is in the best shape as they can be, delivering amazing action scenes and some awe moments. The new characters are also pretty cool and they had great chemistry with our old beloved ones.<br/><br/>I think 7 out of 10 is a fair score for this movie. Not great, but still enjoyable. Go with low expectations and you will have a more satisfying experience."

","We start off the Summer blockbuster fiasco with Marvel's colossal Avengers franchise. The only film franchise of its kind to date where most of its members drop more successful solo projects than the Wu-Tang Clan. I was anticipating this film as was half of the world to see what the super-villain Ultron could bring to the table.<br/><br/>The story is based on Tony and Bruce (Ironman & non-Hulk in case you didn't know) concocting a plan to create highly evolved Artificial Intelligence in order to keep the world protected like TSA 10.0, but plans fall apart when the A.I. that they birthed concocts plans of his own.<br/><br/>First off, the action in this film is great. All the fight scenes are energetic and I only found complications during a fight scene on a freight liner because of the dark shaky cam.<br/><br/>I loved the interaction of the team during the party scene at the Avengers headquarters. It shows how much they jelled as a team since the first film. I also enjoyed that they didn't put a heavy investment of time on only the bigger heroes such as Ironman and Captain America, but they did a neat little back story on Hawkeye, helping to pull him away from just being a filler character, but just as important as the other members.<br/><br/>The introduction of Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver was also a decent addition, even though I believe Evan Peters played a much better Quicksilver in X-men: Days of Future Past. Aaron Taylor-Johnson seems to coast through the role, but Elizabeth Olsen nailed it as his much cooler sister putting most of the Avengers through fear hallucinations.<br/><br/>Speaking of hallucinations, she was able to put a spell on the Hulk that absolutely drove him mad as he tore through a city in what seemed like a meth-high. I would've loved to have seen what the Hulk saw since we know so little about what would scare the beast.<br/><br/>This movie was jam-packed with pluses, but it did have a few downers. On the preview for the films they depicted Ultron as being this Sinister cold robot that was hell-bent on world destruction, but I didn't get that after watching the movie. His opening scene when we first see him in physical form, taking on the scraps of many of Tony Starks robots, it was pretty creepy seeing him limping around and philosophizing slavery and being a puppet.<br/><br/>Once Ultron creates a body for himself all that seems like it goes out the window. I was hoping he would come off as more Darth Vader with his ideals, but it felt more like a used car salesman. It felt like he was humanized down to a sleaze ball that lies in your face then winks at you just so you he just lied.<br/><br/>Also, I wasn't too crazy about how vision looked. I get it, he's supposed to be a Cybernetic Organism, but..he looked too much like a human in a human suit.I think if they removed his pupils like they did in the comic book we would see an equal balance with his robot side.<br/><br/>I'm also tired of them rescuing people. No, I'm not some jerk that thinks they should ignore the helpless, but if you read the comic these wars didn't have random bystanders all over the place. It just loses focus on the action when they constantly have to do the ""rescue the baby in the carriage"" routine. I say lets take the battle to space. From the clip after the credits, hopefully it will lead to that.<br/><br/>Overall Grade: B<br/><br/>Even though this was a good film, I feel like I'm overdosing on Avenger- related movies. They feel like their all stretching and filling at the same time. Maybe I'm just ready for the Infinity Wars to start so I get through the next 20 movies that will preface it.<br/><br/>Also, if Ultron had less of a human personality and was just a cold A.I. sentient that didn't give me the feeling of a mattress salesman trying to get months-end commission, the villainous side of this film would have shot up notch.

"BillSims28","7","3","8","10 May 2015"," 5 word review: Relentlessly Enjoyable, Action-packed Summer Fun
","Firefely's Joss Whedon, writer/director of The Avengers (2012,) returns to the helm of Avengers: Age of Ultron and makes the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise the highest-grossing of all time, surpassing Potter and Bond with over 8 billion US dollars worldwide. And with a cast list that is, in the words of Tony Stark, ""multiplying quicker than a Catholic rabbit,"" the franchise is going nowhere but up. Featuring a cast whose superpower is making a billion dollars and the third most viewed trailer of 2014 on YouTube, it would have to do something significant to disappoint.<br/><br/>Luckily, it doesn't disappoint. Whedon employs his ever-popular writing skills again to great success, and with more characters comes more exciting action, whilst the villain rises above most MCU fare. (Many will be hard- pressed to remember Tim Roth, Sam Rockwell or Christopher Eccleston as great Marvel villains.) The Whedon Banter Effect is in play in this sequel more notably, with (*breathe*) Robert Downey Jr, Chris (Evans and Hemsworth) Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, Cobie Smulders, Samuel L. Jackson, Paul Bettany, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen and James Spader all playing off each other brilliantly. Each have great lines and great moments, and despite an inevitable feeling of over-stuffing, Whedon does manage to create individual moments for everyone. He is most successful with Renner's Clint Barton. Overlooked and mocked as 'that guy with a bow and arrow who hangs with the Avengers' after his previous appearance in 2012, he is utilised to much greater effect in this film, with more about him being revealed and more time devoted to him to do things. The action carries the film, making it relentlessly and consistently enjoyable as the Avengers carry out their globe-trotting mission to track down and destroy Tony Stark's project gone wrong, Ultron. <br/><br/>Having watched and loved the wonderfully eerie Pinocchio-inspired trailer, we were all keen to see (or hear) the fantastic James Spader, he of the velvet voice, in action. And although it may have surprised some to see the way Ultron was actually portrayed in the film, it is not, looking back, at all a bad depiction of him. Being a creation of Tony Stark, he is meant to be a twisted reflection of him, including his out-of-place humour. Having only seen the terrifying, monologuing side of him from the trailers, he may come across as a little 'goofy' in the actual film. And there are some of these such moments, making it a tad irritating not to see him monologue threateningly more. But the same rings true for all the characters, leading into the biggest criticism of 'Age of Ultron.' In the midst of awesome action sequences filled with stupendous visual effects, not one of the characters ever feels in danger, making it seem like Whedon doesn't know how to write without every character being a witty bad-ass with a one-liner constantly at hand. Around 40% of the lines are probably one-liners in this film. I love one-liners, but even I have to admit there are too many in this. Whilst we're on criticisms, the main problem with the MCU format means that every film's climax now feels unfinished and too much a setup for the next. We may see that the endings to all 600 Marvel films from now to 2018 will be left setting up for the two-part ""Infinity War"" showdown in 2018/19. Also, Andy Serkis is just not in it enough, but this may make it sound more of a criticism than it actually is - Age of Ultron is über-entertaining, and is basically the perfect summer movie (though not quite to the extent of Guardians of the Galaxy.) The best villain since Loki and countless wonderful characters (including a surprisingly great turn from 'The Vision,' a new character), plus a heartfelt conclusion, make Avengers: Age of Ultron a mindless yet enjoyable 8.0/10."
"RNMorton","8","3","8","10 May 2015"," Pretty good Marvel effort
","Seems likes its all or nothing on Ultron reviews, I would rather put this in the workmanlike Marvel category. It wasn't as outstanding as the first Avengers. On the other hand it wasn't forced or formula (yet), but it didn't seem quite as snappy and fresh the second time around. And the (intelligent) plot went in unexpected directions, which also led to a zig zag feel as we went down the road. The short version is that Hydra's experimentation with the teserak and artificial life leads, with some help from Mr. Stark, to the development of an apparently unbeatable being along with his associated minions.<br/><br/>I want to discuss Phil Coulson. I didn't like killing him in Avengers 1, I don't like when movies kill characters off, it seems like a cheap way to develop gravity or drama. I don't need for any good guy to get killed for the movie to mean something to me or to hold my interest. And of course Coulson was such a great character that they couldn't actually keep him dead. I was trying telepathically to connect with Mr. Whedon (I actually did try to get an email address) to suggest that he bring Phil's twin brother back for the next movie, have him be just like Phil, it could be a running joke about how much alike they are and lead to an endless line of twin/triplet/quadruplet brothers if and as they got eliminated. <br/><br/>But back to the main issue, there were some wrinkles to this (and the post-party Thor's hammer stuff was just great), but surprisingly some of this seemed a little tired even though the Avengers aren't really very old. Also, the original comic had a problem around issue 15 or so when the team got so good that it was hard to imagine a bad guy that would give them a good fight. It sounds like going forward this and the tired angle won't be as much of a problem, I will be interested in what Avengers 3 looks like. With all that's been said, I would still give this a solid 9."
"DareDevilKid","7","3","8","10 May 2015"," A Blissful Blitzkrieg
","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.2/5 stars<br/><br/>With ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"", Marvel Studios' crown jewel of its billion dollar franchise captures lighting in a bottle again. That ""Ultron"" is every bit the ridiculously entertaining, goofy grin- inducer as its 2012 predecessor makes this even more impressive. With ""The Avengers"", we didn't really know what to expect, but now the expectations are set, and with Hawkeye-like precision ""Ultron"" meets them in a way that audiences should leave thoroughly satisfied.<br/><br/>Director-Writer Joss Whedon assembles Captain America/Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye/Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) for another epic big screen adventure. It kicks off with a battle against Hydra forces that pits them into a brief conflict with the speedster Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and telekinetic/mind-manipulating Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). The twins have an agenda against Iron Man, and set in motion plans that will have serious repercussions for everyone involved.<br/><br/>Whedon smartly advances the story beyond the events of the great battle in New York, showcasing The Avengers as a highly-efficient fighting unit instead of a ragtag group of individuals banding together every so often. As we catch up with them, The Avengers have been on several unseen missions and bonded as friends, best exemplified as the team holds a party with their allies (including some fan favorite supporting characters from the solo films) to celebrate tying up a loose end from their encounter with Loki (Tom Hiddleston). That loose end wasn't resolved as neatly as they originally thought as their encounter with the twins leads to The Avengers being confronted by a new enemy, the android Ultron (voiced by James Spader).<br/><br/>Ultron has the traditional, cold mechanical look, but Spader gives him a surprising personality that makes him the best Marvel villain since Loki - still the gold standard of MCU villainy. In addition, how Whedon works in The Vision (Paul Bettany) is also largely faithful to the source material with a modern twist to flow within the established movie continuity. The Avengers also get serious mileage out of their Quinjet this outing as the team battles in South Africa, England, Italy, and Korea to really give credence to the whole Earth's Mightiest Heroes tagline — not just in New York.<br/><br/>Whedon's specialty has always been the personal relationships between his characters, and despite the numerous majestic action sequences, the character interplay isn't affected one bit, showing that blockbusters don't have to be brainless. Downey Jr. remains the snarky, slightly cocky comic relief, Evans further asserts himself as the leader of an eclectic cast, while Hemsworth gives Thor a great turn as the decisive hot head. In fact, each cast member gets welcome moments to shine, but Renner is the most unexpected scene- stealer as he continually questions his place among soldiers, gods, and green behemoths.<br/><br/>With a $250 million budget, Marvel Studios and Disney sunk a lot of the other green into the film, but the money was well spent. Case in point being the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster Iron Man scene that delivers everything you'd want and then some, but the other fight scenes are just as enthralling especially when Whedon pans the camera to shift from one character to the next in the heat of battle. And the climactic scene is pretty much guaranteed to leave comic fans grinning from ear to ear watching the assembled Avengers in action.<br/><br/>""Ultron"" comes across as even more of a love letter for Avengers fans than the first installment. Of all the Marvel Cinematic Universe films, ""Ultron"" feels the most like a comic book story arc and less traditional summer blockbuster. Unlike Marvel's ""The Avengers"", which was the nice and tidy final act to the Phase 1 introduction films, ""Ultron"" is less the conclusion of one act, but another pit stop across a firmly established Marvel Universe. Whedon, in the vein of the great Avengers comic book writers including Kurt Busiek, Stan Lee, Jim Shooter, and Roy Thomas, knows this isn't the culmination of an ambitious project, but the springboard to the next round of adventures. As such Whedon, who built his career as a TV Writer - Director, makes ""Ultron"" more episodic with a slew of foreshadows and hints of what's to come. Scarlet Witch's mind manipulations reveal the team's worst fears that give us glimpses of The Avengers' past and potential future, which is especially troubling to Stark and Thor. For comic book fans, the teases of the next big story lines are going to feel like comic book nirvana as they anxiously await the next stop on the journey. For the casual fan, the teases to ""Captain America: Civil War"", ""Black Panther"", ""Thor: Ragnarok"", and ""Infinity War"" may seem like information overload with no immediate answers, but as future films pick up these plot threads, it will make far more sense and only serve to make ""Ultron"" stronger as more pieces fall in place. I'm already salivating at the prospect of watching a Marvel marathon once the Phase 3 films are complete with ""Avengers: Infinity War Part 2"" in 2019.<br/><br/>Without being really nitpicky, I don't know how ""Age of Ultron"" could have been better. Avengers fans will walk out the theater completely jubilant, and the only disappointment they'll experience is when realization dawns that 370 days remain until their next Avengers fix with ""Captain America: Civil War"". May as well kill time by watching ""Ultron"" a few more times in the theater. Casual fans will go home with the feeling that every penny was well spent on the action blockbuster bonanza."
"neilbenammar","6","3","8","9 May 2015"," Consensus: A billion-dollar sequel that needs to scale itself down to reality.
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the Marvel Studio's movie equivalent to Hulk. It is big, fierce and green (translates to a lot of money), yet it is devoid of any real emotional component. The stakes are definitely higher as our favorite band of superheroes team up once again to take down another noteworthy adversary: Ultron. Unlike previous enemies in the MCU, the mischievous robotic creature voiced by James Spader, was created by error from the tasteful mind of Tony Stark. Ultron's inception was triggered by Dr. Banner's and Mr.Stark's dream of upholding world peace- well not exactly. Their ambitions were misplaced; when they decided to pursue the route of artificial intelligence and integrate it in Stark's already existent peacekeeping program (controlled by Jarvis). When things take a turn for the worse, Ultron misbehaves and chooses to go out on a bender to destroy mankind rather than protect it. <br/><br/>Now that we have established the premise, let me start my review. Comic-books are a strong source material considering we have the technological advances in filmmaking today- to reproduce our favorite characters with pinpoint accuracy. However, CGI or computer generated images, should be complementary to these Marvel films and should not dominate every facet of them. In Captain America: The Winter Solider, we discovered the promising new face of the MCU and the capabilities of Kevin Feige and his team to deliver great pieces of cinema- while using the everlasting IP (intellectual property) from Marvel comics. The movie was grounded in reality and the CGI did not overshadow the spy and political undertones present in the film. Fast- forward to the release of the Avengers sequel- expectations were high, the crowd wanted the same dark tone the trailers promised and expected Marvel to continue on the great path forged in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>The Avengers are starting a dangerous precedent for upcoming blockbusters. Let me clarify what I mean- there will be a point in the near future where only a handful of directors or creative geniuses will be able to take these comic-book franchises further (by creating unique films). You can't just keep on increasing the stakes (CGI, scale, plot, enemies you get the picture) and expect people to pay to see the movie. Let's assume Captain America 2 was not directed by - the Ruso brothers. What would that signify for the MCU? Specifically, what would happen to the future blockbusters at Marvel Studios? People generally think that one director (or in this case a pair of directors) is not able to change Marvel's strong fan-base and that die-hard geeks will continue to surge into the theaters at every MCU film release. I strongly feel that at this stage - you need visionaries to take comic-book characters and revolutionize them. Otherwise, you will be left with films like Age of Ultron- a fun popcorn flick with a substantial lack of ingenuity.<br/><br/>Studios expect a return on investment just weeks after a blockbuster like Age of Ultron opens. This can put an extreme amount of pressure to succeed on the director- in this case, Joss Whedon. There is no magic formula to gross $1Billion Dollars at the box-office, however there are ways to increase your odds. One way is to hire a competent and shrewd individual such as Christopher Nolan- who will take a source material, re-imagine it and deliver a chef-d'oeuvre in the process. Nolan applied real world dilemmas we face in the 21st century (crime, corruption, identity-crises) and integrated them seamlessly into the script. That's how you get a Dark Knight. Marvel Studios definitely does a great job at trying to hire actors and directors that are more-than-qualified to be in the MCU- however their approach is becoming too mainstream. <br/><br/>Let me elaborate, they are recruiting guys like Joss Whedon- who despite knowing the comics well and having had directing credits in the past- is not a GENIUS VISIONARY. You need artists that are willing to take risks and create their own universe, not just the Marvel Universe- their personal vision for the film. For example: James Gunn tried doing just that with Guardians of the Galaxy and it turned out to become a sleeper-hit in 2014. Bottom-line, the films in the MCU need to be personal and cannot be controlled frame-by-frame by studio execs who have no artistic integrity and definitely do not have the talent necessary to release masterpieces.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Age of Ultron falls in the category of films that are not particularly memorable, and that's all that should be said about it. This is a bad indicator for Marvel- who wants to take this franchise into new dimensions (literally and figuratively). The lesson here: hire an average filmmaker and you get a mediocre product."

","Beginning with 2008's Iron Man, Marvel's franchise is a behemoth larger than any of its heroes or villains. While much of that is due to its box-office numbers and zeitgeist power, its quality and soul are the things that make it stand apart, and Ultron is no different. Maybe the novelty of seeing these demi-gods on the big-screen just hasn't soured for me yet, but I found Ultron's nerd-splosion to be (mostly) unendingly awesome. It may have an over-abundance of characters and too many battles, but it's also quick witted, thematically grounded, and immensely entertaining enough to satisfy any fan. This Comic-Con-come-to-life adventure kicks off with our guys fighting side-by-side, a truly cinematic moment of epic proportions that doesn't disappoint. They are brought together to fight Ultron, a botched creation of Stark's whose power and ruthlessness are equally endless. As the plot unfolds, it feels more like a well- constructed bridge to better (and darker) places than a destination unto itself, but the wonderful performances and dialogue guide the festivities delightfully. Deeper, though, is a recognizable political element to the proceedings; Cap and Tony stand-in for our own two-party government system, while showing presenting these disparate ideals as less black-and-white as we often think. Sure, Ultron is lesser in almost every way to the original, which was arguably the greatest superhero movie of all- time. People sick of superhero epics will most assuredly not be persuaded by Ultron. However, those of us who still find endless joy in likable characters, snappy humor, and strong themes in their action movies will be far disappointed."

","I think the Marvel studio heads should realise now that comic books and film are two very different media. I don't feel like I'm watching a film franchise any more but a television series on steroids. And everything has to tie into the next couple of episodes.<br/><br/>And hence you get to see this bloated mess with so many sub-plots and really uneven pacing. Initially it starts off strong, cool action sequence in a snowy mountain and everything. Then Tony Stark and Bruce Banner create an artificial intelligence via Mcguffin and it becomes sentient and then genocidal. Which at this point in the MCU Tony has become such an unlikeable character. I don't understand why Hank Pym wasn't introduced earlier on in the franchise. It wouldn't balanced out Tony's character a lot more, but now he's reckless and just straight up stubborn.<br/><br/>Once Ultron gets loose this is where you get to see why the first film was so much better. Much of the second act in the first film had all the characters, even the antagonist Loki, in the heli- carrier, and you get to see them all interact, develop character and advance the plot. Here the second act was literally all over the place as they hopped from one set-piece to another. First you have the Iron-Man Hulkbuster throwdown in Wakanda where they level a 30 story building where it brought up uncomfortable 9/11 imagery. Then the movie just stops where all the characters reconvene in a log cabin where Hawkeye can finally get some character development so the audience can be told 'Hey! He's not that useless. We hired Oscar Nominee Jeremy Renner for a reason'. Then you have a forced romance between Banner and Romanoff which came out of left field. I'm sorry what was all that between her and Captain America in the Winter Soldier for? And what happened to Betty Ross? Then you have Thor and his water well, I dunno. The second act was disorienting to say the least.<br/><br/>Ultron is not a good a villain as Loki. He's an artificial intelligence who has access to nuclear launch codes, and the characters point that out but he doesn't go through with it and instead opts for a more convoluted scheme. Also at times he gets very comical. The final confrontation between the Avengers and Ultron was also messy. The previous film also had an intense chaotic final act but it was still easy to follow. This one got really difficult to follow with characters disappearing for minutes at a time and attending to stuff which really seemed minor to me at times.<br/><br/>As a Marvel film its nowhere near as good as the first Iron Man, the fist Avengers film or the Winter Soldier. However as a popcorn flick its still there. Hmmmmmmmmmm."
"decirises","7","3","8","7 May 2015"," Good Villain, Good Sequel, Good Movie... but not perfect.
","Alright coming into this movie after reading the countless user reviews I had doubts, but I'll tell you first hand. All of those doubts were shattered six ways over. We'll start with the directing. Directing: Holy hell, does this movie look good, and better than its predecessor. If it's amazing group shots with awesome camera work, or just the dialogue scenes. After seeing the first two trailers, I thought the color tone looked really dull. It's not. The colors are bright where they need to be, and dark when they need to be. Acting: Standard Acting (which is a high standard coming from Marvel) Everyone is great in their roles. Leaves nothing to be desired. Writing: Near flawless witty dialogue, with only a few jokes that don't stick. VERY FEW. This movie can get very dark at times in terms of writing. Especially when they decide to dive into the origins. More on that later. Score: I nice subtle score, not to crazy, not to quiet. Leaves a bit to be desired. (Since this movie is primarily character driven I'll put a section for the characters) Characters: Origins Explored,and Developments Made. Hawkeyes gets the most development out of the group. Mostly because he had little to none in the first. Black widow has two different interesting story lines in this movie. 1: Her dark origin 2: her growing relationship towards Bruce. The hulk is the same as last time but still decent. Same can be said for cap. Ironman's storyline is quite similar to IronMan 3. Thor is basically his same old good self. The twins (Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver) are really likable and surprisingly HUMAN. Ultron... okay I'll just go ahead and say it. He's the best villain since Heath Ledger's joker. He's Charismatic, funny and at the same time, Uncomfortably menacing. Props to James Spader. There is one character that I haven't mentioned but I'll let you have fun with that Verdict: By all means A Good Sequel, not perfect but good. It improves on the weaknesses,and strengthens the good parts of the original. Not to mention successfully and smoothly introducing 4 different likable characters. Although plot lines are rushed at times, and characters sometimes need more/less development I still give it a 7/10"
"richardhyde-80164","6","3","8","7 May 2015"," I got what I paid for!
","I'm not that old but I grew up with superhero comics and TV shows. Ultron is story/character I have been waiting to see on the big screen for quite a while. After the first Avengers movie I gained an understanding as to what Marvel movies have evolved into. I define them as the movies you want to see just for the entertainment. There is no underlying message conveyed. There is no remark to current social issues. But you get to feel like Michael Bay in a store dedicated to the selling of explosives. I would only recommend to my friends to watch this movie in theatres, or on a very big screen with surround sound. This movie got the adrenaline pumping, but the classic marvel cheesy shots just don't do it for me. For example in the opening scene when they are attacking the base, and there is that slow-mo shot of all the avengers in a mid-air attack. I also still don't understand how Blackwidow is able to take out the Ultron bots with her little guns and ""kung fu."" I'd like to see a marvel MOVIE with proper immersion of the character into society, where there are real consequences. To be honest Daredevil is so far my favourite from all of their productions, but I'd love to see them take that show and use it as a template for their movies."
"basilisksamuk","1","3","8","7 May 2015"," Stay at home and watch Daredevil instead
","We open with a battle in a forest and a castle. The action in the forest is similar to a scene in one of the early Star Wars films. The combination of live action characters, CGI and what may or may not be partially real locations looks like a very well rendered video game. In other words it looks fake and for me has the immediate effect of taking me out of the action. The CGI throughout the film is often very clunky. The mania for 3D is dying down now but it's about time that overuse of CGI went the same way. There's nothing wrong with CGI per se but when a film relies so extensively on it, you can't help but notice it.<br/><br/>The film is nearly two and a half hours in length, though it feels a lot longer. It would have been a much better, tighter film at ninety minutes. Basically you get overlong pieces of exposition followed by some sub-Transformers crash, bang, blow stuff up scenes – again and again and again and again. The one liners that frequent this film are a Joss Whedon trademark but the rest of the dialogue seldom rises above the jokes. The plot is barely comprehensible and certainly makes little sense. <br/><br/>It gives me no pleasure to criticise Whedon's work and I can't help but wonder how much of this film is really what he wanted to see on screen and how much of it was mandated by the studio. He's a big earner now but this is miles away from the excellent work he has done in the past. I can only hope he returns to more creative projects sometime in the near future. The work being done on the new Daredevil series by some of his former collaborators such as Doug Petrie and Drew Goddard shows how you can do justice to a Marvel superhero without compromising your principles."
"dfle3","6","3","8","7 May 2015"," Fight fight fight, talk talk talk. The Avengers Show. 65%
","Not so much bigger and better than it's predecessor (which I scored 77.5% at this site) than bigger and worser. Presumably this movie is superhero action fanboy porn. If it succeeds on that level, it was more of a letdown for me. The first movie was quite funny and I remember enjoying it...even if I now don't remember much (or anything) of it. <br/><br/>So, here's why I think this movie isn't that good...personally, I can't imagine wanting to watch this movie again, even if it was passable entertainment. Perhaps - one day - I could return to watch the first Avengers movie but not this one: the entire movie is one frenetic fight scene after another and whilst being action-packed, it just didn't engage me at all. A sign of a good movie of this sort would be having characters that you feel for and revel in their heroics...you want to - ideally - be exhilarated and overjoyed by their derring-do. You want to cheer them. Literally. There's just no euphoria watching the action unfold. That just didn't happen for me. If the next movie in this series is similarly ""bigger and better"", I probably won't watch it. Already feel that it would take something special for me to continue watching this series (I never watched the second Thor movie, nor have I even seen one Captain America movie). Also, it seems that this movie features some characters from a TV series based on this universe...so...I had no idea who some of those people were. I n that way, perhaps, the movie presupposes too much knowledge (or interest) in some characters. <br/><br/>There are some vaguely interesting themes in this movie but it just doesn't feel like a good story. It feels more like a Readers Digest version of a story...as told by someone with ADD. That's the critical flaw of this movie...not a great story...just a lot of fighting, some talking and then some more fighting. And the fighting - whilst spectacular - isn't particular impressive as far as aesthetics go, or drama. Instead of good drama, you just get more bodies on the screen...fighting.<br/><br/>A positive of the movie is the incidental humour. It's not exactly quotably funny, but it's funny in a ""you had to be there"" kind of way. <br/><br/>A negative of the movie is the sometimes indecipherable dialogue from the main cast. Even though one character has an excuse of not having English as a first language (the female mind reader character...whatever she was called) , I was amused to think that she said to the villain of this piece (Ultron, towards the end of the movie): ""Do you know how to fart?"". Some later contextual vision gives me a better idea of what she said...but not much.<br/><br/>In this movie, stuff happens...that's all a bit silly. This would actually be a good movie to score purely on a ""pass""/""fail"" basis. It's a pass. That's all.<br/><br/>In some ways, this franchise is like the Iron Man franchise...starts off well, then peters out. I do think that I've seen all three (?) Iron Man movies though. Not sure if I'll stick with that one either.<br/><br/>Just by the by, I noticed in the end credits listings for Film Victoria and Australia, I think. Not sure why."
"bryank-04844","7","3","8","6 May 2015"," 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the Avengers movie we need, but not the one we necessarily deserve.
","To basically start out the summer of 2015 with a big bang, comes the highly anticipated sequel to Marvel's 2012's 'Avengers' film, which is titled 'Avengers: Age of Ultron'. It's been a long time coming too. Ever since 2008, when we saw Robert Downey Jr. put on the Iron Man suit for the first time, we all knew Marvel Entertainment had a huge franchise on their hands, as they teased a big film called 'The Avengers', which put a lot of our favorite superheroes together to fight evil. After several solo movies with the likes of Hulk, Thor, Captain America, and Iron Man, we finally got an 'Avengers' movie in 2012, which made over $1 billion for Marvel and Disney, and was met with much praise and critical success. It was because of this, that Marvel has announced tons of superhero films through the year 2019 that will play into their overall story arc they have been building since 2008. We've all been anxiously awaiting this sequel for quite some time now, with tons of posters and trailers that have more than elevated our calm levels with excitement. Now the time is finally here for another hefty dose of 'Avengers' with each superhero returning along with Joss Whedon directing.<br/><br/>First off, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the Avengers movie we need, but not the one we necessarily deserve, to quote a certain police commissioner. Don't get me wrong, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a good movie. The characters, the dialogue, and of course the action are all very strong, with a huge emphasis on the action aspect. Other than that, there is no real character development with the exception of one character, and the whole Marvel Universe doesn't seem to move forward with anything. Instead, it seems like Marvel and Disney just wanted to show big action scene after big action scene for this sequel, which is why I said it's the film we need. I say this because the first 'Avengers' film spent most of the movie gathering these heroes to fight together, and only in the last 20 minutes of the film did we get to see everyone in action at the same time. So it was great to see all of our favorite heroes, win the fight, party afterwards, and have a few jokes with one another, specifically everyone trying to pick up Thor's hammer.<br/><br/>So why is the film called 'Age of Ultron'? Well, Tony Stark creates a new artificial intelligence program that he dubs Ultron, which is like Jarvis, but has the ability to be 1000 times more powerful. This program manifests itself into one of Stark's backup Iron Man machines and is voiced by the amazing James Spader. This new program is supposed to protect the Earth from any threat, but Ultron himself thinks that the extinction of the human race is the way to save itself and create peace. As Ultron is literally getting smarter and stronger by the second, 'The Avengers' have a tough time trying to take him down, which leads us on a journey of several epic fight scenes. One of the redeeming qualities here is the amount of time we get to spend with Hawkeye. He's the only real character who is paid attention to in detail here and moves forward with his story. I know that the other heroes have had their own films, but in 'Age of Ultron', it only seems that they are there to fight the bad guys. Except Hawkeye, whom we find out has a family on rural farm and knows all about his ""avenging"".<br/><br/>There was a bit of a side storyline of Black Widow and Hulk possibly giving it the olé college try in a relationship, but it's difficult to say where any of it was going. Perhaps another sequel will tell us. Then we have three new characters introduced to the Avengers, which are Quicksilver (Aaron-Taylor Johnson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Vision (Paul Bettany). You saw Quicksilver in the last 'X-Men' movie last year, played by a different actor, whereas Scarlet Witch is a bad-ass here and as we find out can be your best friend or your worst enemy. Lastly, there is Vision, one of the coolest heroes, who is the complete opposite of Ultron, but just as powerful. Where Ultron wants to only destroy, Vision wants to protect and save.<br/><br/>The look of Vision is amazing. They really knocked his practical effects and makeup out of the park. Joss Whedon's script is great for the amount of action this movie has. When we do get a bit of dialogue between two characters, the brilliance and wit of Whedon's mind comes full force, specifically when Hawkeye is trying to tell Scarlet witch just how ridiculous everything is. This was a great moment that made me think back to Whedon's television days. James Spader was born to play the role of Ultron. His voice and mannerism are haunting and scary-as-hell. If they gave voice acting Oscars, Spader would be in the running.<br/><br/>'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is not the movie we deserved, because this film did not forward to the story of the Marvel Universe one bit, nor did it have those special ""wow"" moments from the first film. Instead, we get some pretty fantastic and epic action scenes with all of our heroes fighting together for over two hours. It doesn't necessarily make for a bad movie, but just not an excellent one that we thought we'd be getting. And yes, there is a big tease during the credits of the film, so be sure to stay in your seats to see who pops up and where Marvel is going."
"imurtha","6","3","8","5 May 2015"," Avengers: Tantrum of Ultron
","When I first saw the trailer of this movie, I could not stop saying ""There are no strings on me."" I was so pumped that Whedon was back and the Avengers will take away the box office yet again. The trailer set us up for an amazing and chilling villain, a darker tone, a more serious threat, and the promise of darker things to come. However the end result was very disappointing. <br/><br/>There are some great moments the this movie gave. Whedon's script has some very deep and gripping dialog. The Hulkbuster fight was by far one of the greatest scenes in any of the MCU movies to date. There is some great foreshadowing to the films to come. Hawkeye gets some deserved characterization. We get to know more about Black Widow's past. Scarlet Witch is amazing, and Vision was jaw dropping. I also feel that Chris Evans truly shines as Captain America in this film more than any other, and it is great to see how much Iron Man has evolved. <br/><br/>However, when the credits are rolling you will most likely agree that the first one was much better. The original cut of this film was supposedly over 3 hours, and with the poor editing with this movie it clearly shows. While Whedon can juggle many characters into one film, it did not have the same effect as this one. The Thor side story seemed added in. Andy Serkis' part left us excited for his return in the Black Panther movie, but had little to nothing to do with the rest of the plot. The death of the character in this film was not with someone we cared for too much. The love story was forced and unnecessary. Nick Fury did not have to be there. This movie sets us up for Civil War, but does not have a tragic incident that would spark such an event. There were also too many jokes, this movie should have had a much darker tone, but it got Disneyfied and had clever quips that were not as funny as the ones in the first film. This film should have taken itself more seriously. And lastly my biggest issue with this film.<br/><br/>The MCU is not perfect the biggest issue they have is the villain. True they do have Loki, the Winter Soldier, Red Skull, Obadiah Stane, and the promise of Thanos. James Spader was a perfect choice for the voice of Ultron. The trailers led us to believe that this is the cold heartless villain that would tear the Avengers apart. But Ultron was severely underdeveloped and not menacing or chill- inducing at all. He had unexpected jokes, which does not belong to a cold, calculating, ruthless robot hell bent on saving the world by destroying, what he believes to be its greatest threat, humanity. James Spader was meant to play a villain that could rival that of Darth Vader and Hannibal Lecter, but he came off as childish and acted like a combination of Loki and Tony Stark. <br/><br/>While I don't think it is a terrible movie, it just could have been better. I hope that Marvel will give us the original 3 hour cut, and that could change my mind. But in the end, if we were to rank the MCU films this one would probably be on the lower half."

","Even though it's not as great a movie as its predecessor it is IMAX 3D... ahem... worthy. (Pun is bad and I should feel bad.) The special effects were awesome and I loved every bit of it. But I was confused by the storyline. Actually it's not so much confused by the storyline as confused by the lack thereof. <br/><br/>Confession time - I have never read a superhero comic book. The first time I heard of Ultron was the time I heard about this movie. When I got to know it's AI, I was like ""Supercool. It will be like Skynet."" If the AI program exists on the Internet, that means you would literally have to smash every piece of electronic on this planet to get rid of it. So I was expecting a really complex plot line. <br/><br/>So here is the actual story of Avengers: Age of Ultron - <br/><br/>*fight fight fight* <br/><br/>*middle part where you can check your phone and go get some more popcorn because nothing interesting happens.* <br/><br/>*fight fight fight* <br/><br/>Oops!

","I was neither lucky nor unlucky to watch this movie. I am not going to spoil anything for anyone, so I will just sum up the movie for you. Although, the movie had a lot of action, destruction and science-fiction in it but it seemed kind of dull to me. <br/><br/>I was so excited for this one but it did not live up to my expectations. There are way too many flaws in it. This is nothing compared to the original. The plot is quite uninspiring. I don't know much about comic story but on the screen the plot is weak.<br/><br/>There are one-liners after every two minutes of the movie, which I would rather criticize than praise because they had a world to save. Also, there is no character development and Ultron guy is the worst villain I have ever seen in any Marvel movie and is so boring. <br/><br/>I did not expect from Marvel to mess up with such a big movie especially the script. It may become the highest grossing movie of the year or second or third highest but the fans would be disappointed. <br/><br/>The only reason I am rating it six stars is that CGI effects were impressive plus Hawkeye, Quicksilver and his twin sister Scarlett Witch were great. I would recommend everyone to wait for the DVD rather than go to cinema and get disappointed on big screen, unless you don't care about money. Thank you! :)"
"ace_nair","6","3","8","4 May 2015"," Didn't get the point... What were the Avengers avenging? Should be ""The Repairers""

Stark and Banner mess with fire and hell breaks loose in the form of Ultron and then the Avengers have to do damage control. <br/><br/>There is too much collateral damage caused by the super-heroes that it is pathetic that they are heroes. Also, the 3D was extremely useless. <br/><br/>Action sequences are top-notch, dialogs breezy and fun, but one things is for sure - Iron Man has run it's course and Tony Stark needs to be put down. To me, he is the evil that needs to be destroyed.<br/><br/>Hawkeye's family situation and Widow's crush on Banner were stuff meant for Oscar documentaries. Flash in the pan appearances by Fury, Hill, Wilson and Dr Whatever are just that - cameos.<br/><br/>The Winter Soldier and Guardians of the Galaxy were superior movies than this. I was let down by Whedon... The Force Awakens."
"jconde","8","3","8","3 May 2015"," A good movie, first was better
","The first Avengers was excellent, my favorite comic book movie. It seemed after Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, and Daredevil that Marvel was unstoppable.<br/><br/>The facts are Age of Ultron is not as good as these three. It is much better than most summer movies though, and if it didn't have these three in it's recent canon, nor the amazing first movie, I think this one wouldn't be getting so much criticism. The danger of consistent excellence is flaws and shortcomings tend to get magnified.<br/><br/>So, let's be clear: this a good movie. Pretty well balanced with action and comedy (although it does have a LOT of one-line quips, most work though), a few characters get fleshed out nicely (Hawkeye, Black Widow, and The Vision have some of the best character development, others not so much), a fine villain (but with a with a rushed origin story), and pretty decent juggling of a very crowded roster. So kudos, many great things to see and enjoy.<br/><br/>Where it's getting so much heat is that people wanted it to be the best comic movie of all time, to be better than the Avengers and Winter Soldier and The Dark Knight. But it isn't, it's a good movie in a strong cinematic universe. As second movies go it's more Temple of Doom than Empire Strikes Back: it will stand proudly on the shelf but nerds will argue whether the first or third was the best.<br/><br/>Frankly though, I wasn't disappointed at all, in fact I enjoyed every minute of it. It didn't have to be better than those others to be very good, and it is. I just wanted it to be more, but I'm happy with what it is.<br/><br/>Ignore the extremists on both sides, this is neither ""amazing"" nor ""bust"" material. Come watch a really good film in a film series that's providing some great entertainment. I'll be very excited for the further films, to me this really sets the stage nicely for Civil War and Infinity War."
"Ceryssa","7","3","8","3 May 2015"," Mostly good movie
","*tried to keep mostly spoiler free but there are some mild ones* I (like a lot of people of course) have looked forward to this for years. I thought the first Avengers movie was amazing, and as a fan of all things Joss Whedon I was excited he'd be back for this installment. It tied nicely in with the most recent episode of S.H.I.E.L.D., and I enjoyed the introduction to a couple of new characters, since I didn't know much about them previously. The movie felt a little crowded, but it's the Avengers--you obviously have to have all of them. Whedon's trademark humor is definitely present, and provides a nice balance to the darker story lines going on. But something felt very off with a lot of the characters' motivations. It felt like we were missing something vital about their thought processes, and their subsequent decisions were somewhat jarring and the bickering between characters was more grating than entertaining. And a new relationship was introduced that felt like it dragged the whole rest of the movie down.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed the movie, and I'll definitely watch it again. The choice of actor for the villain is fantastic, it's nice to see another familiar character in the flesh, sort of, and there are some interesting themes. I think it could have been a bit longer--perhaps if certain things were given more time to be fleshed out, they wouldn't have seemed like they came out of the blue."
"fritzlang","6","3","8","3 May 2015"," disappointing, though enjoyable, mess
","Meh. That is my initial reaction from just seeing this film. Wasn't the worst movie I have seen, but definitely not one of the better ones. And this is from someone who LOVES superhero movies and Marvel comics. It is hard to explain just what is wrong with this film, but it just seemed ""off"". The acting didn't see sincere, as if everybody was just phoning it in. The jokes seemed flat. The action scenes were confusing, exhausting and ultimately boring. The villain was weak. Too many subplots. The romantic plot seemed to come from nowhere. In short, the very things that worked so well in the first film worked so poorly in this film. Also, they seemed to ignore Iron Man 3? There was no true end credit gag either. There was a semi-post credit scene (shortly after a few credits) but it was not surprising and even that felt like ""been there. done that.""<br/><br/>I have heard the Wheadon had to cut 30 minutes of the movie to keep it to its existing already long 2.5 hour version. Perhaps that extended cut on Blu-ray might yield a very different experience.<br/><br/>This version just left me tired and disappointed.<br/><br/>I would wait until this is on Blu-ray. No real reason to see it in a theater. There were no crowd-pleasing scenes.<br/><br/>6/10."
"xcvb_2003","8","3","8","3 May 2015"," Filled with flaws and yet I still enjoyed the hell out of it.
","""Everyone creates the thing they fear. Men of peace create engines of war. Avengers create invaders. Parents create children, that will supplant them.""<br/><br/>It's the kind of movie that I had great time with, even though I will agree to it having tons of flaws. <br/><br/>Lets start with the story, it was mostly a mess. Throughout the movie, it felt like so much stuff have been crammed into a runtime obviously not enough for it. Pacing was a hit and a miss. There were some stuff that was really rushed while other sequences dragged on. Ultron creation and character development in particular was rushed like hell, something that would have benefited greatly from getting more screen time. Also, whole thing between Bruce and Natasha felt forced and out of place. Their scenes really dragged on. It would have been better if they went with Natasha and Steve instead as they had great chemistry in Winter Soldier. It just felt like the whole movie needed more time to be polished out, smooth out the rough edges. <br/><br/>While the story was a mess, the character set wasn't. The returning cast was great as usual, bringing their superhero A game. You could feel that they have been a team for a while now, having more chemistry with each other, cracking more jokes and poking more fun at each other etc. New additions, although a bit rushed, were pretty good. Vision, in particular, I felt was handled nicely. Scarlett Witch was hot (I love Elizabeth Olsen :p ) and Quicksilver always looked cool thanks to his power. Some great developments occurred character wise. Hawkeye finally had a notable presence, something that was dearly missing before.<br/><br/>Ultron was amazing. James Spader voice really made the character shine. I loved how he had more of a personality then being just a evil bad guy. He had so many great lines, often humorous. I was not actually expecting it as the trailers were really misleading, but it was welcomed nonetheless. Ultron stole every scene he was in but it's a shame he didn't had that much screen time in the movie. Also, he was nerfed like hell. Would have been cool if he actual put on a proper beating to the avengers, shook em bad and all, would have really improved the atmosphere of the movie. <br/><br/>Speaking of atmosphere, this is yet another movie falling victim to its misleading trailers. The trailers made me believe it would be a more serious sequel, but it wasn't. Hell, it had more humor than the first part. Joss whedon signature humor was sprinkled throughout the movie. And I actually enjoyed most of it as they had great timing and execution. Marvel movies have this thing being lite and enjoyable and I'm all with it. Many of it were the little things between the team that just made you like them more. But there were moments where toning down the humor would have been seriously great. The presence of Ultron that I wanted never reached that level as one liners and other laughs kept blocking it. That fear or hopelessness never arrived, and it was really disappointing. <br/><br/>Action though, was AMAZING. And there was lots of it. Well shot, directed and choreographed. It was handled much better this time as compared to the previous part. And the awaited Hulk vs HulkBuster fight was a feast for the eyes. So much epicness, such carnage and pure destruction. The fanboy in me was crazy happy. CGI was top notch, they spared no expense. <br/><br/>Soundtrack was good, although nothing special. Main theme of Avengers, which I love, was back, but was underutilized. <br/><br/>It is a given that there is no way to replicate that special and unique feeling of first part of having your favourite superheroes in one movie and acting as team. I found the first Avengers to be better overall. Despite its flaws though, I still found this movie to be a great one. I immensely enjoyed this film, had a great time at the theater and already are getting craving for a second viewing. If nothing else, it is still pretty entertaining. An extended cut with and alternate ending has been announced and it will be released with the BluRay. I believe it could solve many of the issues I have with this film. Can't wait to get my hands on the BluRay. If you're a Marvel fan, have been following the MCU movies and like this Universe, there is no doubt you will like/love this movie. Go watch it. <br/><br/>8.3/10"
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","3","8","3 May 2015"," Whedon assembles a solid, if flawed, sequel
","There are a lot of great things in here; scenes, character moments, lines of dialog. It's just that as a whole it doesn't flow as smoothly or with as much energy as the first one (granted that's a pretty high bar). It doesn't help that Ultron is a weak villain. His potential menace is all too often undercut by the fact that sometimes James Spader seems not to be playing Ultron, but a mechanical James Spader. My other gripe would be that the fights/action feel a bit redundant and look more cartoonish than the original. On its own merits this is nothing short of a very entertaining Summer popcorn flick. The problem is that the first one was that and so much more."
"AviCoolChatt","6","3","8","3 May 2015"," Unbalanced in tone, but had some good moments
","I just came back from watching it....here's my two cents<br/><br/>1. Very unbalanced in terms of humor: It felt like they were forcibly going for a laugh a minute. I was getting distracted from the serious moments by quips flying back and forth. And this aspect really undersold Ultron - his mesmerizing beginning dulled by his attempts at levity (anyone outside the hall may have thought a comedy was going on...the audience were laughing so much). I'll get to a particular example in my spoilers. 2. Hawkeye getting the spotlight: Yup, this was great. The others are so confident of their powers getting them out of a jam, and here comes a man with a bow and arrow facing aliens and robots. We really got to know Clint in this movie<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>1. Remember the problem with humor. You wanna know what happens when the laughs get too much? A few people behind me were going ' why is Flash taking a nap'. I'll let it go that they got the wrong speedster, but really - Piotr's death became a joke amid a lot of jokes, I really wish they gave it a more sombre atmosphere. Very few connected Wanda's anguish to that - especially with Hawkeye's 'funny' line 'it's been a long day'. 2. Deus Ex Machina Thor: Thor got dream from Wanda for what appeared to be a preview to Thor 3, then he went to a dream pool where it became a preview to Avengers Infinity War and finally he helps create Vision cause he 'knows' Vision will be important to the current war. 3 Thor and Captain America: Awesome combo!!! Two scenes really delivered how badass they could be as a duet. 4. Humor: For all the overused laughs, there were some good ones at least - especially during the hammer lifting. Though cross they removed some music and lines that were in the trailers. 5. MUST SAVE EVERYONE: What the hell? It was good the first two times, then it became grating. Must save, must save. Even when they're on top, Marvel seems to have problems. I couldn't help but associate this as both a shot at MOS and an insurance against anything like that in this movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I'll give this a 6.4/10. I really hope Thanos isn't this jokey and we actually see some bodies drop (which mean something) and blood shed."
"mohandoss-john","6","3","8","3 May 2015"," Disappointing
","Hollywood has officially run out of ideas. While you do have genuinely good movies every now and then, like Ex-Machina or Interstellar. You also have great superhero movies like Days of the Future past. What happened here was complete lack of imagination. They ran out of a ideas for good story lines. <br/><br/>So here's the deal. Stark uses creates Ultron - an artificial intelligence, to protect the world from possible future alien attacks. Sounds good? yep. Of course, once sentient, Ultron turns evil and tries to save humanity from humanity. Of course, what else do AIs do in Hollywood movies?! <br/><br/>1) That was the overview and the detailed plot. The director's confidence in RDJ and Hemsworth and the Hulk shows clearly. They didn't even bother to see if they had a story-line.<br/><br/>2) The movie falls apart because they took a poor story-line and somehow tried to fit 6 superheroes into it. This exercise failed badly.<br/><br/>3) RDJ's one-liners are no longer funny. They are not annoying, they're just not funny enough.The effort put into writing those amazingly creative lines could have been put into an actual story-line, just saying.<br/><br/>4) What is the point of Hawk-Eye? The new kid, who was way more useful than Hawk-eye died trying to protect him. Hawk-eye is a pointless character. <br/><br/>5) I still don't see why Black Widow is needed. She does nothing. Now she's freaked out the Hulk badly enough for him to run away.<br/><br/>6) Ultron voiced by James Spader is very impressive. What isn't impressive is the fact that with a good villain, the story-line was definitely not up to the mark.<br/><br/>Positive: In spite of all these negatives, I'm giving it a 6 for sheer entertainment value. The action sequences are mind-blowing. <br/><br/>Hopefully, they will do better in the next movie."
"bankofmarquis","8","3","8","3 May 2015"," A GREAT way to start the 2015 Summer Blockbuster Season
","With the release of AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, the summer blockbuster season is upon us. People have a tendency to fall into 1 of 2 camps at this time of year - those that enjoy/look forward to these types of movies and...those who don't.<br/><br/>If you are in the 2nd camp, then you can stop reading right now.<br/><br/>If, like me, you look forward to the summer blockbuster, then AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is a great way to start the season.<br/><br/>ULTRON, brings back all the players from the previous Avengers film and it has a feeling of old friends coming back together. Director Joss Whedon knows how to make these movies. The action is tight - and simple - with the goals easily laid out. Each character has something to do and humor is laced throughout this film to keep the sense of an amusement park roller coaster going.<br/><br/>But, it is the camaraderie of the cast that really makes this movie. Downey, Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson and Ruffalo all look at ease with this film - and each other, giving the sense that they enjoyed being back together. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye FINALLY gets something important to do in this film and he shines in his role. Add to this newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen and the group really shines.<br/><br/>Whedon also makes good use of other familiar faces in the Marvel universe - Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackey and Stellan Skargsard all show up (albeit briefly) to join in on the fun.<br/><br/>All this fun is counter-acted by the fine performance of the villain - James Spader's ULTRON. His silky smooth, unemotional (though VERY emotional) delivery makes him a villain not to be trifled with. With the menace in the previous Avengers film coming from outer space, it was good to see the nemesis in this movie come from within. I think I would have gotten tired with another outer space villain.<br/><br/>All in all, a rollicking good time at the movie theater. This is what a Summer Blockbuster should be. The bar has been set for the summer of 2015, it will be interesting to see if the other movies this summer can meet (or exceed) this bar.<br/><br/>8 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank (of Marquis)"
"charliep14","7","3","8","3 May 2015"," Disappointing but saved by the last act
","Halfway through the movie, yes, I was disappointed. Avengers 2 falls into the common super hero movie trap of spending too much time explaining technology / fantasy (a McGuffin basically) that will never make sense. And it is frustrating and slow at times because of that. If you add to this some disappointments vs. what was promised in the trailer and some not so exciting new characters (first time for me in a marvel movie...) Avengers 2 does fail to deliver. BUT BUT a great third act and final fight scene save the movie for Marvel zombies such as myself. Truly epic, great Whedon-esque character dynamic and team ups. The movie does offer a lot to like: a fantastic James Spader as Ultron, Hawkeye! (How can Whedon make Hawkeye actually rule!)... However this is the not the best marvel movie. Will still go see it again in Paris next week. PS: Bryan Singer did Quicksilver better than Whedon...."

"woofiewoof","6","3","8","2 May 2015"," Marvel's Done It Again. Literally.
","This, like many of the live action Marvel products, was action packed, hilarious, and squeal inducing for all the fans. Personally, I liked Winter Solider much more, but this was a solid addition to the film series. I spent much of movie gasping or crying or just reacting in general. <br/><br/>But we've seen it all before. Minus the actual death, the events have all been paralleled in one way or another.<br/><br/>Tony Stark's need to protect the Earth by creating something new? Some new armor, a bouncer for the club that is Earth? Project Insight, from Cap 2. Same intentions. Securing the world's safety by creating something that's eh not so safe.<br/><br/>The whole part where they're fighting each other. #tbt to the Avengers. Literally the same thing happened. They were all fighting the Hulk and Cap and Iron man were disagreeing, blah blah blah. It's really not very satisfying to watch Banner beat the snot out of everyone time and time again. Don't get me wrong, the action sequences are be-yoo-ti-full. But the plot behind them is getting a little old.<br/><br/>The robot army = the Chitauri. Nuff' said. <br/><br/>It's all been seen before. It's all very thin material. The Banner/Romanoff romance makes absolutely zero sense to me. Like the whole back story and compatibility reasons, I see and understand. But the actors have absolutely no romantic chemistry. Not ragging on Johansson/Ruffalo acting skills, but they don't click in the way that Evans/Johansson or even Renner did. <br/><br/>I'm just nitpicking. The movie was pretty fabulous and I spent most of it with my mouth hanging open. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were fantastic, but Falcon should have been more present. Also. Coulson and Bucky should have made a cameo (just saying). <br/><br/>It's absolutely worth watching!"

","Alright, where do I start? I've seen every other MCU movie (with the exception of The Incredible Hulk) before I went in to see this. Obviously, my perspective will be different from someone who's seen just The Avengers. If you want to understand the whole storyline, you'll have to start from the beginning - the Thor, Iron Man, Captain America movies, plus Guardians of the Galaxy - to constantly identify all the elements this movie is composed of, and to get a sense of the characters and their personalities.<br/><br/>There's constant action. From beginning to end, they hardly sit still for a few minutes before things are taking off again. You won't find it boring, but the inside jokes may be frustrating.<br/><br/>Things I disliked: <br/><br/>*The humour is a little forced in some places. Yes, we're all aware that sass is practically a job requirement as an Avenger, but they're not in top form here. The lines are a little forced, and don't go with the higher level of tension visible between them. <br/><br/>*The Bruce-Natasha angle. I dreaded it when I saw it in the trailer. It was just awkward in the movie, seemed very out of place.<br/><br/>*Ultron was terrifying in the trailer. James Spader's voice growling ""There are no strings in me"" gave me goosebumps. But in the movie, he switches between scary and sarcastic. It was unnecessary.<br/><br/>Things I liked: <br/><br/>*The twins - Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are brilliant. <br/><br/>*Hawkeye and Black Widow get plenty of screen time in this one. Well-deserved. <br/><br/>*Paul Bettany as The Vision has a brief but entertaining interlude. I look forward to more of him in The Avengers.<br/><br/>Overall, this didn't have the freshness of the first Avengers movie. But I liked it all the same."
"callumsheedy","6","3","8","1 May 2015"," A step down from ""Marvel's The Avengers""
","A little disappointed with Avengers: Age of Ultron. I just saw it and my first impressions were that it was a step down from the first movie. ""Marvel's The Avengers"" movie had a good balance of story, action and character. And if we can compare other movies by Marvel, then ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"" takes the cake. But, I digress.<br/><br/>This movie is a let down in a few ways for me. I'll try not to spoil anything, but I will say the first, and most of the second act were not quite as enjoyable as the third act. In the words of reviewer Gary Wolcott, it was ""High tech, high voltage action followed by long stretches of boring dialogue before more high tech, high voltage action."" The first act felt unwarranted and lazy. The third act was more fulfilling, but still very formulaic (as was the rest of the movie). The Avengers (SPOILER ALERT) go on yet another quest to save the world, as we have seen in one too many films before.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon has proved himself with things like ""Buffy"" and ""Marvel's The Avengers"", but unfortunately this film lacked the creative spark that it so desperately needed to set it apart from being just another sequel.<br/><br/>We can hope for a satisfying comeback in the following two-part films, but as with 4 part trilogies we know that part one is going to be excruciatingly lacking in any progress. The action is saved for part two, but that's a conversation for another day."

Well done.<br/><br/>His voice is so great, deep, menacing.<br/><br/>I don't feel it was slow, kept my attention all the way through.<br/><br/>Quite a few laughs.

"RforFilm","8","3","8","1 May 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron again brings our favorite heroes into action, even if the story is a little overstuffed
","Though it's only the beginning of May, it's already feeling a lot like summer! Not because of the warm weather, kids being out of school or even the public pools already being filled up with families. Tis the season of the summer blockbuster! For the heavy film going audience, the year has two major seasons, the summer season, which is filled with the big, epic popcorn films that tend to be the most anticipated movies of the year, and the winter season, which is where all the award winners and performance features debut (if they haven't already at a film festival). <br/><br/>Though the blockbuster summer season started in the seventies, it has had the most change from the early nineties through the early 2000's. Super hero movies tended to be big draws, but they started to pick up further steam when Iron Man and The Incredible Hulk were released and no one could have anticipated the plans that Marvel had put into play. Captain America and Thor came along before they would all cross over in The Avengers, which I still stand by as one of the best popcorn summer movies of all time, right up there with Jaws and Star Wars. Earth's mightiest heroes return to take on a deadly threat in The Avengers: Age of Ultron. <br/><br/>Like a lot of summer movies, the film opens up with the Avengers in the middle of a mission in Sokovia; raiding a Hydra terrorist outpost. Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and The Hulk each get their turn to show off their powers and strength as they break through to retrieve Loki's staff from the previous films. Though they are successful, they put up a goof fight with two new powerful beings; the really fast Quicksilver (played by Aaron Taylor-Thompson) and his twin magical sister Scarlet Witch (played by Elizabeth Olsen).<br/><br/>The Avenger celebration is put on hold when one of Tony Stark's newest creations, the artificial intelligent robot Ultron (played by James Spader) awakens, and has a more homicidal agenda with his mission to ""Save the Earth"". Ultron and some drones escapes back to Sokovia to build a large machine made out the same material as Captain America's shield. Attempts to go after Ultron fail and the Avengers find themselves fugitives as their actions create more destruction then save lives. Even with the help of a newly created Avenger, Vision (played by Paul Bettany), out heroes may have finally met their match.<br/><br/>The Avengers: Age of Ultron had a lot riding on this matching is predecessor; it had to up the action while keeping it's legendary tongue in cheek attitude as director Joss Weldon is known for. The pressure was also on to keep this cinematic story going for those that have seen the previous ones. The film succeeds in both, but falls within it too. The good news is that the action is really good. I never felt tired by the fights and it built itself up to an explosive finale like any good action movie should (please learn this lesson Michael Bay!).<br/><br/>We also get plenty of the great banter between our heroes when their just sitting around and building a plan. I just wish we had a little more of that. Between the action and the signature debates, the movie had to fill in the exposition of Ultron which got excessively complicated along with the discussion of the infinity stones, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch's intentions, Thors Vision, the Vision being created, etc. I wouldn't be surprised if an extended cut surfaced on DVD later on that paces this stuff better then this shorter cut does (It's already long at two and a half hours, but it didn't really feel that long).<br/><br/>I'll give this eight Ultrons out of ten. It's not as well put together as the first and you kind of need to see the other movies before seeing this one, but The Avengers: Age of Ultron should make most Marvel fans happy and should continue bringing them back. Let's see what happens with Earth's mightiest heroes next."

There was certain parts in the movie which I didn't like the fact that Quicksilver died,in the comics and the cartoon versions he never died, Jarvis nor Ultron became The Vision which I didn't recall that transformation to ever happen. The next thing I didn't like was I remember Quicksilver,Black Widow and The Scarlet With ever being with the team in the first place."
"nkmoore2000","8","3","8","1 May 2015"," The Avengers are still trucking, but I think they hit a small bump in the road.
","First time reviewer posting at almost 2 AM after seeing the late first night showing of Avengers: Age Of Ultron. I've found things to enjoy in every Marvel movie to date, even though each was not without defects (save possibly the first Avengers film). <br/><br/>I have to admit, I'm a fan of Marvel and the Cinematic Universe it has created. I like action, comedy, drama, romance, and Age Of Ultron stuffs in all four. The good was that all of our favorite Avengers are back, including cameos from characters in other films. There are new characters. However, it did seem a bit rushed, even with a 2 and a half hour run time, just because there was so much that they tried to fit in. Perhaps too much. <br/><br/>I will say that with a movie like this, you expect an overabundance of action (which there was), and comedy that doesn't overkill previous character jabbing (of which it walked a thin line). I enjoyed this movie for what it was by itself, and what it serves as another step on the road to Infinity War. I wouldn't rate any movie a 10 (although the first Avengers might have been). That is why I rate this so high. It didn't exceed my expectations, but it almost met them. Almost. <br/><br/>I have to say that I appreciated it more knowing that it was a piece of a bigger puzzle than I would have if it was a film by itself. Like I previously stated, the only film worth comparing it to was the first Avengers film. Despite everything familiar and cohesive and adding touches of newness and broadening of scope, it falls short. Or else it would have been the second film that I would possibly rated a perfect 10. I have enjoyed the ride so far, am looking forward to the rest of the MCU, but sadly, I may not look back at this film as much as the rest."
"djx360","8","3","8","25 April 2015"," Less plot more action !
","Sidenotes - Just for reference, people need to see Ultron in Avengers EMH animated series, to know how scary ultron's midset really is. Also the Stark-a-thon continues. Tony Stark is once again the center of the marvel universe. I love RDJ as iron man but the major focus on him is getting boring<br/><br/>When you hear that ultron is going to be in a live action movie you get chills down your spine, the psychotic imbalanced nature of the villain is in a league of the joker. But once you walk in for the movie you are treated with a human voiced robot, not even remotely creepy, PG-13 robot with a comedy routine. This Bot is bigger & badder than skynet & marvel failed to use him with those dark corners.<br/><br/>The PG-13 nature of the movie impacts so much on the it, at least i would have preferred it somewhere along the lines of arrow or agents of shield or agent carter, but this was supposed to be a mainstream marvel movie, having mainstream non-character acquainted people as a targeted audience makes some weird & annoying alteration to characters you love, looks like DC & Marvel wont play on the same aspects for some reason. Having arrow & black canery as a possible pair, has mostly diminished the possibility of the similar dynamic marvel has.<br/><br/>Quicksilver was damn awesome, the accent & the role he played when with avengers was befitting of having spidey in the movie. Vision was good too though i would have liked to see more of him. Both the Scarlets were good but i hope Wanda's personality is explored more in the next movies. It was great to know from an interview that ScarJo did some of her stunts in the movie<br/><br/>As for the plot, it didn't feel it had much depth, i could be wrong as there were many things at play but maybe some things could have been handled differently. Though what lacked in plot was somewhat atoned with feelings, mindsets & satisfactory over the top action.<br/><br/>I worry that ‪Marvel‬ will run the spidey film along the lines of the Crap Avengers Assemble cartoon, which i feel is the case judging by some of the dynamics at play in age of ultron.<br/><br/>To conclude it was a good movie experience, but no way as amazing as CAP2 or Avengers 1."
"julian_whiteway","8","3","8","27 April 2015"," A good film - but not a great one.
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW MAY CONTAIN SOME MINOR SPOILERS<br/><br/>Reading my summary and then seeing that I rate the film 8/10 must seem pretty confusing, but if you've watched, or when you watch, the film, it just seems to be lacking in a variety of ways. <br/><br/>This is a very good film. The action sequences are great, the humour is amusing, but only enough to be considered banter. But at times it just doesn't click. <br/><br/>References to future films are just not at all subtle, they're very much jabbing you in the face, and this film, though good, just feels like a huge advert for phase 3. Surprisingly, we didn't get an Ant-Man nod - and that's out soon. Instead we get taken to Wakanda and see Clawe get his arm cut off for no apparent reason; Cap & Stark are clearly having a lot of friction; and probably some other stuff I've missed out. Let's be honest, if you've been following the MCU news recently, you'll know who's signed up for what, meaning you know certain characters don't die straight off the bat. <br/><br/>The opening scene, IMO, was the best. It shows The Avengers taking on the Hydra threat that rose to prominence in Winter Soldier, and it was a great scene, showing off fascinating teamwork and giving viewers a couple of things to smirk about. But,as the film goes on,things just don't seem right. When you see them flying to the tower,for example,you instantly know that a certain Hammer scene from the trailers is coming up. Iron Man vs. Hulk wasn't as great as the trailer leads you to believe, & Von Strucker seems to be knocked off rather swiftly (though I doubt whether he really was - you know how Marvel are by now). <br/><br/>Ultron by Spader was brilliant, he was very Stark-like, in being both a charming, funny character,but at times very dark and serious. The Vision was also excellently portrayed. The Maximoffs? I started to like them,and it grew as the film went on - until something happens which completely made me less interested in how I felt before. <br/><br/>Whedon has said this film had been shortened, and we are apparently getting an extended cut (the original, 3 hour long or so cut) on DVD early this fall, as well as possibly an alternate ending and maybe even a different or new post-credits scene (we got a mid-credits tag in theatrical release). I'm not going to ruin that for you either, but it's nothing you can't live without, and it doesn't add to the experience as much as previous credits scenes had - and this again is a nod to a future film (but,annoyingly,not one I'm made more excited for by this mid-credits tag).<br/><br/>So, all-in-all: <br/><br/>THUMBS UP; + Spader as Ultron makes the second most memorable villain (tied with Red Skull) in the MCU to date. + The majority of new characters are integrated reasonably well. + The Avengers can now clearly function as a cohesive unit. + It's an action-packed film for anyone and everyone (but comic book knowledge,of course, does help feel closer to knowing what's going on). + the characters of Black Widow and Hawkeye get fleshed out much more, and you feel all the characters have more personality. + That closing line from Cap, though. <br/><br/>BUT, THUMBS DOWN; - Ultron doesn't have an ultimate,big bad form - thinking back,no MCU villain has. He almost completely destroys The Avengers early in the film,but doesn't upgrade later on? - They kill off a newly introduced character. It wasn't even necessary for the story,and all I've heard thus far is fans question the feasibility of it. You'll see what I mean. They had other characters who you feel it would make sense to kill off by now in this film,but a new character is instead. Question is, are they really? Or are they going to give them the Coulson/Fury treatment? - The Mid- credits scene just not what you'd want from Marvel at this stage. - Thor gets the role of Hawkeye from the first Avengers movie. - At times it feels like you're watching a Michael Bay film."

","Avengers Age of Ultron review: Jam packed, and by jam packed I mean action, action, rushed plots, action, comedic relief, and a stunning climax. The ending with its departure and arrival. But this is what you get when the avengers is more about saving the world, and other movies are more story based. Makes you wonder more about the behind the scenes. Ultron was invigorating funny. The rushed love connection and the moment with Thor in the pool, seemed way out place. However the fight scenes were on point, every superhero getting it's own strong points, and seeing them all work together one good last time, until maybe the next Avengers, was very pleasing. My inner geek came out, and had its wow jaw dropping moments. The few death scenes, setting up for better stories down the road, and how the Vibranium ""meteor"" terminator style extinction was very intriguing. 9/10 from me. The only reason not 10/10 was because of the small plot rushes. -Anthony"

","I've seen the movie twice now, once in a near empty theater (first viewing) and once in a packed theater (second viewing). It was definitely a more enjoyable experience with a crowd to create some atmosphere.<br/><br/>This movie is good but not great. I definitely enjoyed the first Avengers movie and Guardians of the Galaxy more. The movie felt a bit flat because plot-wise it was very similar to the first movie - the evil villain messes with the team's minds to break up the team, but the Avengers inevitably regroup and save the day. Furthermore, Loki was a more interesting villain than Ultron. <br/><br/>While the sequel produced a few giggles, it lacks the laugh-out-loud moments of the first (except for one cracker from Hawkeye). There is also a within team romance that seems to have come out of nowhere and with little explanation as to why. Hawkeye gets by far the most character development of any of the Avengers, which made me think he was going to die at some point (no spoilers - I'm not saying he does or doesn't). <br/><br/>Unlike in Avengers 1, Hulk is notably absent from many of the major action sequences which I felt let the movie down, as Hulk was responsible for some of the best moments of the first movie. <br/><br/>In summary, it is a good popcorn movie, but unfortunately not as great as its predecessor."
"nick-sultana","9","3","8","26 April 2015"," A Bigger, Better & Truly Entertaining Sequel for Marvel
","When it was confirmed that a sequel to The Avengers was in the pipeline for Marvel Studios, the question that surrounds the film was' Will it overthrow its first film?' and by golly it does with amazing results. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not only one of those anticipated films that have expectations from every Marvel fan but it does tick the boxes for what the general audience wants to see. Just weeks after the release of Fast & Furious 7, AOU will have its chance to become a hit with fans and the box-office.<br/><br/>AOU takes place after the events of the previous films (Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier) with The Avengers fighting the baddies that plot to dominate the world, but without the assistance of S.H.I.E.L.D with being destroyed (see Winter Solider to further explain this). Wanting to help the battle for peace further, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner develop a program/A.I. tech that will protect and serve the world but a particular source used causes a birth of a villain in the form of a robot and artificial technology named Ultron. This places the heroes not only in a battle to stop him, but they will encounter threats not only from him but from allies and future events. <br/><br/>Firstly, the storyline itself goes into bigger, darker and epic depths than what the previous film had and the location settings make it redeemable that they fight not only for one country but for the world the heroes live in. In terms of 'darkness' we are shown some dark pasts and future events, a villain who is hell-bent on exterminating the human race and perhaps confrontations between the heroes themselves on who is right, true and loyal to the code. Casting here is in top shape with the likes of Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson, Renner and its supporting cast all providing great back-up to the character development and on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>The visual effects are much like the amazing quality of not only from the first Avengers film but the previous MCU films that made them so acclaimed. The design of Ultron in particular was great, it made me believe that character was a threat and his personality is both dark and ruthless which makes him a best Marvel villain to appear in the MCU to date. The action set pieces are all choreographed to great detail, ranging from invading a castle of HYDRA operatives, an epic street fight between Hulk and Iron Man in the streets of Johannesburg city and the climatic stand-stand between good and bad make it all entertaining for action fans and comic book enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is indeed bigger, better, darker and more spectacular than its first film but without losing its trademark style of humor, storytelling and characters. It indeed places a spot on my Best Films list for 2015 and even now I wish that the 3rd Phase would kick off as I want to see how further it can go if it sticks to its cinematic formula.<br/><br/>For more of my reviews, check out MovieNerd91 via movienerd91.weebly.com and Facebook 'MovieNerd91'"

","Age of Ultron, I'm fairly sure, is exactly whatever you're expecting it to be. If you're a fan of the humour and the first Avengers in particular, you'll of course love this one as much, if not more. However, if you're like me and weren't sold on the first one, then you're probably in for more of the same. AOU promises a darker tone, The Empire Strikes Back of the eventual Avengers quadrilogy if you will. Despite this, the film lacks any suspense given that we know our superhero pals will be coursing back onto our screens for their next dozen blockbusters over the next few years. Not to mention the more dramatic tone, or lack thereof, as every scene feels inconsequential, with the Avengers playfully joking about as we wait for the next fight; fights which should spell danger and anxiety for them. additionally, sub-plots are picked up and never expanded upon. Why is Nick Fury suddenly popping up in the middle of the film, offering nothing plot or character wise? Why did Black Widow flirt with Bruce once at the start of the film only for the next time we see them together for them to be in a relationship? The film was originally 3 hours+, and it's blatant that important, character developing scenes have been cut out (that being said, if you're willing to wait I'd guarantee the director's cut of the film to be more satisfying). ultron is a menacing and worthy foe to the Avengers, and his screen presence is fantastic, however his motivations seem shaky at best and his intentions to cleanse the world seem weak, considering the story revolves around his might. despite these flaws, Age of ultron is a good film and a worthy sequel to The Avengers. It's more of the same, but in a good way. The action scenes are of course amazing and breathtaking at times, if a little suspense-less. The scenes with Quiksilver are brilliant, and overall some of the set pieces in the film are a wonder to behold, especially the opening tracking shot of all the Avengers together. Overall, this film is good, not great, as with so many Marvel movies as of late. Go and see it, it'll entertain you. Just don't expect ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of the MCU."
"sreeharins","7","3","8","26 April 2015"," Lower your expectations
","First of all let's break down the positives. 10/10 for visuals and sound.It looked good, great at times, sounded well as well.It the most action packed movie to this date!Seriously !And this is action done right!So,it is totally worth the watch.It was funny,the humor was clever,and it had the Marvel magic.AWESOME!<br/><br/>Now to the negatives ! Yeah,there are a few that will not go unnoticed.And it is better to be prepared for it before going into it.And all the flaws, which I won't be discussing since this is spoiler free,are due to the problem with the pacing.The movie jumps right into the action and there is no build up to it or anything, we are just jumping into what is going on.And from there the movie just rushes! It is fast paced,there is no slow build up or anything.The movie doesn't take it's time to show us everything.This was too much about the action,comedy and more action.Now it almost reached the line of being a bloated mess,but it backs away just in time.I think this movie is too short. And there was not enough Ultron in it.Ultron is awesome whenever he's on screen, but he ain't it for long enough.So, don't think he's going to be the core of this movie.And that part in the trailer where we saw captain's shield torn was only a dream sequence.It was not the result of the battle with Ultron. This movie needs to learn a few things from Watchmen in terms of pace. It should have been longer.It should have taken it's time to develop the plot properly.<br/><br/>In short, LOWER YOUR EXPECTATIONS."
"amanda_wagner-244-535973","7","3","8","26 April 2015"," What an experience
","I went to see 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' Thursday in imperial, and what an experience!<br/><br/>I think the film had more to offer than the first one. The villain is more complex than Loki and the whole story of the movie is a little deeper. You get a little more insight into the different characters and a little background history for some of them. Ultron as character was insane bold, I love his attitude. The heroes is still super cool and I was entertained the whole movie through. The humor is of course still really good, like its predecessor<br/><br/>This is one of those films to be seen in the cinema, the sound and the big screen makes the experience amazing. The film's animation is the crazy nice, the whole movie is really nice.<br/><br/>I give 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' 7 out of 10 stars. You take the film for what it is and it's a cool superhero movies, with little depth and character development. I can't wait for the next movie after this sequel!"
"my-msn-woop-woop","8","3","8","26 April 2015"," A action lover dream!
","The gist of the story is basically... Tony Stark's mistake coming back to bite him in the ass and everyone has to pay for it. Though to me Age of Ultron in its simplest form starts much like many other movie in the sense it has the back story of artificial intelligence. I had thought that the artificial intelligence wanting to wipe the human race off the face of the earth was an over done concept and had hoped this movie would change my mind. Much to my surprise I actually walked out of the theater quite impressed especially with the introduction of ""The Vision'. <br/><br/>This movie digs much deeper in to the psyche of the Avengers characters themselves which very much speaks to the story lover in me and makes for great character development and understanding of personalities most interestingly Hulk and Tony Stark.<br/><br/>It is a movie filled with about as much action as I can take (perhaps too much action in my opinion). The addition of the twins was very refreshing though I may have liked it a bit more had Quicksilver(Pietro Maximoff) not died near the end of the movie. Leaving only the Scarlet Witch(Wanda Maximoff) to join the 'new' Avengers team that Captain America and Natasha create after the destruction of Ultron.<br/><br/>I have to give it up to Marvel when it comes down to graphics/Special effects and CGI to me they were near impeccable and some of the best I have seen in modern day film. <br/><br/>I look forward to the next Avengers! I do so hope that it will still be filled with the characters I've already come to love and will not be completely re-casted. <br/><br/>All in All it is a fabulous movie and if you're in to a lot of fighting and action I do recommend you see this movie ASAP!"

But this film ticked all the boxes, it had action right from the get go, things happened which I personally didn't expect and they set up for the future films which gets me real hyped for the future films.<br/><br/>All and All this movie is amazing, for young and old, film nerds or not you can enjoy this movie with the entire family.<br/><br/>Highly recommend."
"Kristian55","7","3","8","25 April 2015"," Wonderful.
","No, i did not see that coming. I'll be honest, i never cared much for the Marvel films. In fact, to me, The Avengers was a huge disappointment. I hated it. But this movie was everything i had hoped for. Its large, and to me the first Avengers looked so...Dull. Boring. But this one had a lot more color. And the characters really blossomed here. In the first film everyone was just sorta there, but here it just feels better. The action was more intense. And i know that story wise this film resembled the first one a lot, but i didn't mind. This film was the first one done right. And then we have the new characters. Scarlet Witch with her witch-esque powers added an interesting dynamic. But my favorite part of the movie has to be Quicksilver. Was the accent cheap? Yes. Was the humor slightly childish? Yes. Did i love every minute of it? YES! I cant help it, but i loved Quicksilver. And then we have Ultron. He took my expectations, laughed at them and exceeded them on every level. He was funny, charismatic and a much more enjoyable villain than teenage rebel Loki. The film was all around in enjoyable. I would have given it an 8 if...If not...:( All of you who saw it-You know what it is."
"tmf084","8","3","8","25 April 2015"," Good entertainment ...
","I like the MCU and what they have achieved on the big and small screen and the latest installment is no exception. The movie is really entertaining, the special effects are top notch, the whole cast is great and besides good dialog and a bit of character development they also find plenty of time to throw out funny one-liners and slap stick in a non-contrived way. However, I was a bit disappointed with the polishing. It's still well rounded, but I left the theater feeling that it wasn't Whedon's best work and that he either kept too many reserves or ran out of them all together. The sub-plots are usually way better embedded in the main story and even if it's an action flick his emotional scenes carry a bit of a bunch. He still tried to do it, but in this area the movie falls short and some of the scenes even feel unnecessary. The characters where still great though, Ultron and the Avengers aren't just black and white but feature a few shades of gray. Still, as I said, good entertainment and a fun movie."
"TheMarcinator12","8","3","8","24 April 2015"," Avengers Re-Assemble
","I saw this movie earlier today as it was released earlier than the US for where I live, and I found myself having a great time at the movies. This sequel brings back the members from the first Avengers film as well as a few new members such as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. Though I enjoyed this movie a lot, I found it to be quite flawed. My biggest complaint being that the movie was way too rushed and didn't give enough effort to be as great as they could have been. The action however, is superb as always and makes up for it. I still enjoyed this film a lot, but it could have been better.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8.5 out of 10"
"akhil-loverboy","9","3","8","24 April 2015"," An impressive piece of work by Director Joss Whedon and the crew of course
","This movie is of course a very reasonable blockbuster. The movie is action packed and even a blink of of the eye can miss you some details for future upcoming movies in MCU. So 142 minutes of the movie is just as very well framed excellently. The new characters introduced are also very good and what to tell about the special effects. They are way more better, which is exciting and also even enthusiastic. The crew's acting,especially the role of Ultron was very good and is justifiable. In MCU, I think this movie is going to be a main benefactor for the continuation of other movies like Ant Man, Captain America Civil War,etc."
"adamcarlton","7","3","8","24 April 2015"," entertaining, but shallow
","Avengers: Age of Ultron had a lot to live up to after the success of Avengers Assemble, Captain America: Winter Soldier and most recently Guardians of the Galaxy. I went into it with high hopes and was super excited after watching the trailers. <br/><br/>In short, i didn't feel it lived up to expectations. I didn't walk out of the movie thinking about any particular scenes or thinking to myself ""that was amazing, i want to see it again"". <br/><br/>I think the problem was the story and the character building. There was so much action etc going on in the majority of the movie that it left a lot to be desired. Prime example is the 'romance' between Bruce Banner and Black Widow, which felt like a forced afterthought, thrown in for the sake of it to try and make us care about them more. The acting sequences in this movie could probably have been wrapped in a week or two, with the rest just being post production and special effects. i didn't see the movie in 3d because i didn't care about these exact things.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the action was decent so it was by all means an entertaining movie and it was cool to see a few new faces with Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. <br/><br/>James Spader did a good job representing a very menacing voice for Ultron and the Vision was pretty cool also; but again i felt like these characters needed more room to develop. <br/><br/>In conclusion the movie felt like it made similar mistakes to Spider-man 3, with so much crammed in and the character relationships and primary plot were very thin. This is worth seeing at the cinema just the once, and I may even buy it on Blu-ray for the sake of completing a collection, but it doesn't come close to the awesome Guardians of the Galaxy which was probably the best Marvel movie so far."
"JazzyGB1","6","3","8","24 April 2015"," Too many ingredients and not enough time to cook!
","Following the first Avengers film was always going to be a very difficult task. That was a really great superhero film which had the major plus of (finally) getting the Hulk 95% right (just need to have him talk like he does in the comics). Sadly there are many problems with the second Avengers film... <br/><br/>1: The story is poor. There is no explaining why the Avengers are back together again, they just suddenly are and attacking a Hydra base. Plus there's a HUGE flaw regarding Ultron and the Internet too. Despite being able to see everything allows he allows Avengers to contact each other still and Iron Man to still use his suits. <br/><br/>2: The villain: He's not menacing enough. There's really no motive to drive him and his acts other than some messed up programming. And his army of Iron Man like robots were not intimidating at all. <br/><br/>3: The CGI. It's not in the same league as the effects in the first movie IMO which were far more convincing. Considering the main villain and his army is ALL CGI, this was VERY important and one of the bigger failings of the film. <br/><br/>4: The Avengers didn't stop him The vision did.<br/><br/>5:Too many characters made everything feel forced and the story seemed incomplete. Like trying to make a 3 course dinner in 20 minutes - you just can't cook that many ingredients in that short a time. <br/><br/>6: The Hulk. The best character in the Avengers (and highlight of the last film) was totally ruined in this movie. He is totally pointless and doesn't do anything of note. They have him move like an ape (which he does not), he only threw TWO punches in the entire film and instead had him grabbing and throwing robots rather than punching and smashing them - HUGE mistake IMO and not faithful to the character at all. Just when you think they have nailed the Hulk, they take him backwards again (sigh).<br/><br/>There's some good humour and lots of action, but you feel like you'd seen it all before in Iron Man 2 and 3 and there's no great standout moments in this movie, where the first was littered with them. Some of the other elements of the sub plots felt forced and were uninteresting and the end...hardly a great climax. Overall really disappointing to be honest. It's not terrible, but it's far from great and a poor show compared to its predecessor."
"Everestto","8","3","8","23 April 2015"," Reacting to Great and Hate
","OK, I made an account only for this because I can't stand the views of both avid fans, semi-fans, and non-fans. I just wanted to point out things that needs to be clarified and I don't want to sound biased so I'll point out each side.<br/><br/>Part I : GREAT<br/><br/>1.) MOVIE'S APPROACH<br/><br/>The movie's approach for me is to let viewers generate a thought where a superhero movie doesn't just need to defeat a villain in order to win.<br/><br/>In this movie, the Avengers are shown that the higher priority is the people. Second is Ultron, where they must stop the nuke that will delete the entire human race.<br/><br/>2.) BACK STORIES<br/><br/>The fears/back stories/visions done by the Scarlet Witch to the Avengers is properly executed and the viewers become more aware on what the Avengers' thoughts are. The movie arranged the film with the knowledge given to viewers about some unsolved mysteries to the characters, best of all to the Black Widow.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron showed that every hero or villain has a reason on why they received that personal state for themselves.<br/><br/>3.) Fight Scenes<br/><br/>The fight scenes are astounding and wonderfully choreographed. They fight for a reason. The best example for this one is the Scarlet Witch's reincarnation as an Avenger rather than a selfish human that seeks out revenge. <br/><br/>Scarlet Witch fights to repent her sins of assisting to the evil side and wishing death to the Avengers, but clearly, she doesn't want to erase humanity. She was driven by rage, but that was erased when the goodness of her heart shined and her selfishness and pride disappeared.<br/><br/>P.S: Effects, CGI etc etc. are godlike<br/><br/>Part II: HATE<br/><br/>1.) The Scarlet Witch Scarlet Witch's execution is good, but the editing when she is casting spells became too fast that lets the viewers's appreciation become less. <br/><br/>The thin,red sheen when she fights (not when mind-controlling or giving someone visions) doesn't put her in a state where she is strong. A few hex bolts were good, but at her crying scene, she just burst out dozens of red sheen in the ground. I expected her to become more berserk and will lead to an opening where the Scarlet Witch's power became more devastating where she discovers her ""Chaos Magic"" etc etc.<br/><br/>2.) Ultron<br/><br/>Ultron was relatively weak at some point the movie. Ultron's entrance is creepy and put viewers to such an extent where expectations that ""this villain is going to be so strong"" or ""I think Ultron can't die"" were thought, but no. In the final battle, 60% of the scenes are the minion-robots, 30% of saving the people, and 20% that involves Ultron.<br/><br/>3.) ""Together."" -Captain America<br/><br/>There is a slight contradiction to that one word statement that CapAm burns Ironman that they will defeat Ultron together. Yes, they defeated Ultron ethically by saving the human race, but they did not entirely defeated Ultron ""Together."". Many of the Avengers did not fight Ultron including Black Widow, and Hawkeye. In the last scene of the Final Battle, I think it will be better that all of them instead of just Thor, Ironman, and Vision contributes to the weakening of Ultron.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron has its ups and downs, don't be imprisoned with one hateful or grateful thought."
"devil_hunter12500","7","3","8","23 April 2015"," An above-average follow-up, but disappointing compared to it's predecessor.
","WARNING: THIS REVIEW WILL CONTAIN SPOILERS!<br/><br/>Whoa, there is a lot to talk to about ""Age of Ultron"". I remember watching ""The Avengers"" at cinema 3 years ago and highly enjoying the film. As a result, it's usually typical that I'm eagerly waiting for the next instalment. I was thrilled to see Ultron as the titular antagonist, I mean, what could go wrong? Watching the film today, I came to think of the film as being just ""good"" and nothing really special emitting from what Joss Whedon could have achieved.<br/><br/>""Age of Ultron"" occurs sometime after Shield is disbanded after the events of ""The Winter Soldier"" (Another great Marvel in the Marvel Cinematic Universe). With the Avengers needing a break in saving the world, Tony Stark decides to join Bruce Banner in jump-starting a Chitauri Computer System known as Ultron. It succeeds, but is too successful as Ultron soon becomes sentient and plots to bring peace to Earth by eradicating humanity. And as usual, the Avengers have to clean up the mess, joined along by mysterious twins Pietro and Wanda Maximoff (Who start off as villains) and another sentient robot known as the Vision.<br/><br/>The Good: Of course, the Avengers are assembled near-flawlessly. Robert Downey Jr. continues to dominate Tony Stark/Iron Man with his quirky, energetic acting, Chris Evans delivers what he has to as Steve Rogers/Captain America and Scarlett Johansson portrays Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow with great flexibility and versatility. I admit not liking Pierto/Quicksilver, but I did enjoy the additions of Elizabeth Olsen's Wanda/Scarlet Witch who came off as interesting and intriguing and Paul Bettany's Vision, who was a brilliant addition to the franchise. Out of the heroes, Jeremy Renner was one who stole the show as Clint Barton/Hawkeye. He had so much development and much of the plot even focused on him and we had a nice touch with his family. Heck, he played a bigger role than ""The Avengers"" and this is where ""Age of Ultron"" holds one of it's strongest points. Ultron was the best character in the entire movie. He was dark, intimidating and downright sadistic, yet displays a very quirky and humorous personality like Tony Stark and I've got to say James Spader definitely nailed it as Ultron. He was WAY better than Loki. My only gripe was to see him battle the Avengers all alone for a longer period of time. Oh, and his final moments were beautifully crafted and a must-watch for the Marvel Fanboys. The visuals are spectacular as always, nothing much said. The soundtrack was well-crafted and Ultron's version of ""I've got no Strings"" is a great version of the original Disney classic song; Dark, gritty and haunting, it fits the film perfectly. Also, the fight scenes are amazing and yeah, it's a must-watch; intense, grand-scaled, exhilarating, it's what you had hoped for. And lastly, the post- credits scene; You HAVE to watch it if you're a real Marvel fanboy...<br/><br/>The Bad: Yep, with many goods to highlight ""Age of Ultron"" there is no doubt there will be some degree of junk thrown into this. Mark Ruffalo still portrays Bruce Banner/The Hulk masterfully, but his role in the film was weaker than I thought and I felt The Hulk was somewhat underwhelming myself. The Hulk's romantic involvement with Black Widow was forced and hammy and I felt it just hampered the storyline. Chris Hemsworth as Thor was kind of at his weakest. His sudden detour in the middle of the film was a mess and although it is a set up for ""Ragnarok"" I couldn't understand what on Earth is going on with his storyline. Aaron Taylor Johnson as Quicksilver just turned out to be meh. Unlike the one in ""Days of Future Past, I found to be bland and uninteresting, unlike Scarlet Witch. Samuel L. Jackson was probably the weakest in terms of main characters. His role as Nick Fury was in my opinion, very limited and stale. His role in the final fight was also kinda meh to me. I mean, come on man, Sam Jackson could do way better than that. The film was also unnecessarily long (Do we really need 2 hours and thirty minutes for this film) and with fight scenes happening in such a short time- space, the film kinda gets boring and the pacing becomes somewhat jarred at times. Also, Ultron may be the film's greatest point, but I felt that he needed to be stronger. I mean, I don't want another villain who depends on an army to reign supreme. The side-characters were somewhat underwhelming and I'm not really sure if they were memorable. Don Cheadle's James Rhodes/War Machine makes an appearance, but so much little of him is actually seen in combat and Anthony Mackie's Sam Wilson/Falcon is downright useless. Really, he only appears for a few minutes and that's it. I'd at least expect a little from him.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'd say ""Age of Ultron"" is a good follow-up to ""The Avengers"". Yes, it was somewhat disappointing compared to the previous one, but I believe there is still hope in this franchise, as marked by the post-credits scene. There was a lot of potential built up into this film. Some sky-rocketed, others just fell out of the scraps. In the end, it was a worthy film, but only if it could have been better...<br/><br/>A final rating of a 7.4 is the best I'd give to this film, whose closest number rounds up to 7. But I am positive there will be spark of light in ""Infinity War"". Only time will tell..."
"callanvass","9","4","13","12 May 2015"," One of the best sequels ever made!
","Most people went to the theaters to see The Avengers. I was one of the few people who waited for DVD. There was so much hype surrounding it, I wanted to wait a little while. It was one of the silliest things I've ever done, because the first movie lived up the hype in a big way. This time around, I didn't make the same mistake. I went to the theater and I'm so glad I did. Joss Whedon did a phenomenal job of getting everything to work almost perfectly in the first movie. How could you possibly top it? He had a daunting task on his hands to say the least. The biggest mistake you can do with a sequel is trying to make it bigger and badder. It often becomes overblown and disappointing. The best thing you can do is do what made the first one so successful and simplify it. This movie is darker than The Avengers. They have more to lose this time around. Their fears are exploited and I felt it made for some riveting storytelling. It's also filled with some wonderful humor that made me laugh out loud on several occasions. Last but not least, the mind-blowing action! I was blown away by the action scenes in the first movie, but I think they outdid themselves here. It provides countless thrills and even some sadness. The performances are top- notch. Downey Jr is fantastic as usual. His portrayal of Tony Stark/Iron Man was a lot of fun to watch. Hemsworth is tremendous as Thor. Chris Evans shines as Captain America. Jeremy Renner is a lot of fun. There is a nice twist to his character that added more drama and emotion to his character. Scarlett Johansson is very good. Her romance with Banner could have been awkward, but they make it work. Ruffalo is solid as The Hulk once again. James Spader is awesome as Ultron. His cynical outlook on life was not only frightening, but it had merit to it as well. Bettany's Vision character isn't explored enough for my liking. They did enough to keep me intrigued to see where his character will go next. The newcomers Taylor-Johnson & Olsen are fantastic. As much as I enjoyed Johnson, it was Olsen who made the biggest impression on me. Her skill is a terrifying one and seeing her transition from bad to good was very well done. It's hard not to fall in love with Scarlett Witch. Jackson doesn't have as much screen time here. He was entertaining though. <br/><br/>Age of Ultron is almost as good as The Avengers. Considering how much I detest a lot of sequels, that's a huge compliment. Everything flows together beautifully and I don't have many complaints. Prepare to be wowed!<br/><br/>9.8/10"

However I want share it structurally, constructively and with valuable arguments (evidence).<br/><br/>1. Storyline / Plot: ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) has a very interesting storyline. Watching this movie from one side very light, from another makes you think about something. I like it and I think most of the general people, and real fans of comics this genre would like it, too. Unfortunately I do not know how storyline close to the comics, so it might be kind thing that some the fans would put my evaluation under a doubt. <br/><br/>2. Casting: Top! Five stars! Great job! During watching this movie you have feeling of good quality. <br/><br/>3. Special effect: If you like Michael Bay's ""Armageddon"" (1998) and ""Transformers"" (2007), you will like this movie, too. For sure! For 120% kids will love this movie!<br/><br/>4. Humor / Funny moments: I liked humor in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) and I think this kind of humor pretty much close to jokes, and funny moments in a comics and cartoons.<br/><br/>5. Is it interesting !? Oh, Yeah! I waited this movie and enjoyed watching it. Storyline did not make me sleep or bored! <br/><br/>6. Characters: ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) has a few new characters which made movie more interesting, wider and fascinating. No Gwyneth Paltrow ""Pepper Potts"" in a movie but it is not so important because it is not ""Iron Man"". Also there is no Natalie Portman ""Jane Foster"" but again it is not so important because it is not ""Thor"". However I was a little bit sad that there is no Tom Hiddleston ""Loki""... ..<br/><br/>7. How close this movie to the comics!? Sorry, unfortunately I am not specialist and real fan of the comics, but according to my small experience and little knowledge about ""Marvel"" and ""DC"" comics, it is close. Of course, for sure not for 100% but pretty much close.<br/><br/>8. Advertisement: I remembered from ""Iron Man"" (2008) and of course ""The Avengers"" (2012) that some people talked about advertisement in a movie and how it is bothers, and disturbs. Well, there is some advertisement but for me personally it is not a big deal.<br/><br/>9. Originality: I think in ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) each character is important, has personal main and second role, unique and intriguing your imagination in actions and decisions. <br/><br/>10. OST: Danny Elfman and Brian Tyler. Same as casting. Top! Five stars! During watching this movie you have feeling of good quality and you do not want sleep or scared! I think they thought about young generation for sure!<br/><br/>In all, I liked this movie and I think this movie successful work, I do not know how accurate this movie for information in comics but in my opinion Joss Whedon did as much as he can. <br/><br/>P.S. #1: I watched this movie on Russian and English languages. Translation on Russian language unbelievably surprised me, it was good and accurate (of course adopted but good!).<br/><br/>P.S. #2: I was very surprised to seen Russian cars (Niva, Lada, etc.) in a movie. Kind of advertisement too =)<br/><br/>P.S. #3: In my opinion conversation between Scarlett Johansson ""Natasha Romanoff / Black Widow"" and Mark Ruffalo ""Bruce Banner / Hulk"" in Jeremy Renner ""Clint Barton / Hawkeye"" house about kids and sterilization (castration; procedure that prevents from reproducing) might be criticized by some parents, journalists or critics."

","I don't write reviews, but for this disappointing movie i had to do it. The story was awful as it was made for an audience rating from 4-12 year olds, you don't have to have explosions every 5s of the movie. The dialog was probably the worst part in this movie REALLY WTF everything they say is a line like they are trying to impress you i mean REALLY the dialog would have been better if they ware all silent for the whole movie.<br/><br/>OK you are going to enjoy this move if mindless carnage and endless destruction is your thing but for me this is just some video of things blowing up. I don't know why they got such high reviews on most sites because i don't know if i watched a more terrible movie in my life.<br/><br/>If you watch this movie i mean watch it you can pretty much see everything that is going to happen in the movie from the first 20min of the film. <br/><br/>-------- Raiting: -------- Story: 1/10 Dialog: -2/10 Effects: 8/10<br/><br/>In conclusion the movie is good if you have children in the house so they can go child #1:"" waaaa"", child #2:""awesome"", child #3:""i want to see it another 128 times"", but if you are looking for something whit a story, something whit a good dialog look elsewhere, this movie is about blowing stuff up and nothing more.<br/><br/>-------- Spoiler: -------- The whole movie talks about them trying to clean there own mess up, and yeee blow up an entire city but no repercussions, i know this is make-believe but come on if you blow up a city are you really a good guy (don't even start, haters it was their fault that the city was flying no mater how you look at it in the eyes of there world they are the bad guys)."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Tony (Robert Downey, Jr.) and Bruce (Mark Ruffalo) are nearing completion of Ultron in hopes of bringing world peace but something goes wrong and soon what seems like an unstoppable force has the Avengers on the brink of ending.<br/><br/>AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON wasn't nearly as good as the first film in the series but there's still plenty to enjoy here as director Joss Whedon manages to keep the action scenes full of energy and there are enough bits of comedy to make the film enjoyable to watch. With that said, I'd be lying if I said the story itself was anything overly special and at times the extended running time seems to be going on for too long.<br/><br/>There's still enough great action here to make the film worth sitting through. This includes the non-stop action scenes all of which seem to get bigger and better than the previous one. The ending is something I won't spoil but it contains quite a bit of imagination and it really comes to life. As I've said before, it's really amazing how far CGI has come over the past decade. Whereas at one time you could always tell what's fake that's not the case any more. The CGI flawlessly blends in with the live action to where it blends perfectly together.<br/><br/>Another major plus for the film is that the casting is simply perfect. By this point in the series you know that Downey is just flawless as Tony Stark/Iron Man but the rounding cast is also terrific. Chris Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L. Jackson, Don Cheadle and Elizabeth Olsen are all very good and certainly help bring these characters to life."

","A repeat of the first, in short, but worse. <br/><br/>It's just all over the place, firing CGI at us like it's all we ever need to make us think it's a good movie. A hero movie is as good as it's villain, and Ultron just fails. It's like in the star wars prequels with the battledroids, all robots is just cannon fodder and Ultron himself against 5,6 even 7 Avengers is just....unevenly matched. You never feel any of the avengers is in any danger. <br/><br/>The twins are....redundant(with bad Russian accents). Who even cares when quicksilver dies? <br/><br/>Why would a AI-robot have a mechanical heart??! And why would it ""hurt"" if you pull it out??!? <br/><br/>And what's with everyone(incl Ultron) cracking jokes every half a second. We have seen all this in the first movie. But it had a better villain, an actual person, and better timing of the jokes.<br/><br/>Hulk/Widow love story is just bad. Nick Fury pops out from nowhere in Hawkeyes shed of all places, i mean this is just bad storytelling.<br/><br/>5/10 with my brain shut down...."
"srepolt","10","3","9","8 November 2015"," Avenging the Avengers
","First off I'd like to say that I think the sequel to the first Avengers definitely lived up to my expectations. Yes the magic of seeing these characters together for the first time wasn't as dramatic but I will say that the team as a whole really functioned like a well oiled machine and everyone knew their role. This movie was flawed in areas and was not perfect but it still delivered as an entertaining Marvel adventure. The scale and scope was much grander in comparison to the first and I loved how they focused a bit more on the other Avengers who are not the main stay trinity of the group i.e.; Cap, Ironman, and Thor. Personally, Vision stole the show. His scenes were really cool and exciting and not to mention hes just awesome to look at. I thought James Spader hit it out of the park by giving Ultron some real gravitas. I also really like how they started to set the stage for Civil War. I believe that the films short comings will be forgiven and made up in Captain America 3. Overall Avengers Age of Ultron was highly entertaining and I don't think it deserves all the hate it has received. If you are a Marvel fan then this movie is for you."
"adamchadwick","2","3","9","15 October 2015"," This movie sucks
","The movie started out with a very theatrical action scene with all of the heroes jumping, rolling, shooting, ""hulking"", and cheesy one- liners. Kind of fun, but mostly made me want to throw up from all the camera movement and jumping around. Don't know why they were there fighting, they just showed up to blow things up I guess.<br/><br/>Either way, the plot was weak, another ""Humans are a disease that must be cleansed"" type of script. Thanks, already saw Independence Day and Will Smith crushed it. Then, they forced a love story out of no where with Hulk and Romanov. The run on joke about Cpt. America and his ""not-so-potty"" mouth was terrible. The new girl, the only cool Olsen sister, had a crazy amount of power but never used it. Just shot red stuff every once in a while. The only good part of the movie was James Spaders' voice. It was chilling and dark, but an AI that had an irrational personality trait, that's bogus. <br/><br/>The movie sucks. It's a complete waste of time."
"cosmo_tiger","6","3","9","1 October 2015"," I will be in the minority of this one but without any type of suspense I wonder how much longer can they keep me interested?
","""Peace in our time, imagine that."" After finally taking control of Loki's staff, Tony Stark (Downey Jr.) begins to run tests on it in hopes of being able to harness it's energy for his personal use. The good news is is that his idea worked. The bad news is is that he accidentally created Ultron (Spader) who wants to save the world by destroying it. Now, with the help of the rest of the Avengers they most stop Ultron from creating total destruction, but in-fighting within the group starts to derail the mission. Once again I will start by saying that I am not a huge fan of this whole Marvel Universe series. One reason is that I was never a huge comic book fan, the other (and main reason) is that because of all the planned movies we have been told about there is no suspense watching these. Other series like X-Men and (depending on how you view it) Batman have killed off major characters. Once one of the major characters dies it gives you a sense of, holy crap what's going to happen now. I'm not saying the movie would be better if Iron Man gets hit with something and dies. I am saying that knowing that in the next few years there will be another Captain America movie (Iron man will be in this one), a new Thor, 2 more Avengers as well as many many more featuring smaller characters in this movie takes away any suspense the movie tries for. The characters in this movie start to fight with each other, but knowing that next year they will all work together again makes that scene seem pointless. These movies are all review proof so nothing I say will change you mind about watching it or not, but I think the total saturation of this genre is starting to get to me and I am fast losing interest in these movies. I will be in the minority of this one but to me this was boring and without any type of suspense I was wondering how much longer can these story lines keep me interested? Overall, another Avengers movie...is there anything else to say? I give this a B-."
"dangerouselement","2","3","9","27 September 2015"," Did Joss Whedon direct this?????
","Warning this review contains spoilers turn back now.<br/><br/>3,2,1! This movie f*ckin' sucks.This doesn't come close to the first one. The first one was almost as good as the Dark knight. This is just loud stupid bullsh*t!! When I was at the midnight party for this movie I knew exactly what was going to happen. It would start with a monlogue from Thanos.<br/><br/>Then, The trailer from pixels was finished then I looked down at my phone and I look back up and there is already an action scene. Yep, looked at my phone for 5 seconds and there was a giant battle in the forest already! This is the exact opposite of Iron Man 2. Iron Man 2 has a great story but hardly any action.<br/><br/>This has NO!!! story but only has action. There are just a couple sequences without action to break it up. All the action scenes look so fake they are all CGI and it felt like was watching f*cking PIXAR! Ultron looks like a cartoon he looks so fake even I could do better than they did and I'm only 17 f*cking years old.<br/><br/>And the comedy is exactly the same as the first one. Which makes it not funny because I've seen the first one like 10 times. Then we get to HULKBUSTER when I saw hulkbuster in the trailer I thought this is gonna be the best movie EVER!!!!!!!!! It just turned into Man of Steel he destroys the cheap set that they used. And he was fighting hulk. Then Hulkbuster got destroyed. More like Hulkbusted.<br/><br/>Then we find out Clint Barton has a wife and a kid. Blah blah blah.<br/><br/>Then we get to one of the worst action scenes I've ever seen and it lasts the rest of the movie which is an HOUR! I couldn't follow what was happening at all. Then more property is damaged and stuff referring to Man of steel which also sucks. I don't even care!!!!<br/><br/>Then shield is back somehow?? Didn't it get destroyed in Captain America Winter Soldier. Well F*CK THAT. Then Thanos is given a one liner then the movie's over. This movie doesn't even matter you could skip this one entirely and you wouldn't be lost at all watching the rest of the movies!!<br/><br/>Yeah, Yeah fanboy. ""But the ending was awesome because of the, action."" ""SHUT UP!!!"""
"XweAponX","10","3","9","23 September 2015"," Faster than a Catholic Rabbit
","That's how fast Ultron multiplies himself, according to one character.<br/><br/>There is one thing to say about these Avengers and Avengers-Related films of late, they are stuffed full of ""Transformers Dark of the Moon"" style creatures and robots attacking large populations. Ie: Huge CGI Sequences showing the utter destruction of various cities, as if Tokyo is everywhere and can be rebuilt quickly.<br/><br/>But in this case, the story closely matches the Comic Books from whence it came. If you watch this without first watching the Iron Man films, the Thor Films, the Captain America films, and even Guardians of the Galaxy, you will be lost in a barren wasteland of references to something called ""The Infinity Stones"".<br/><br/>It is the one thread that connects all of these films, it was introduced in Captain America: The First Avenger, and it showed up in some form in Thor and Thor: The Dark World.<br/><br/>In fact, the one particular Infinity Stone gave Loki his power to brainwash Hawkeye and Dr Selvig. But we didn't know this in the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>The nature of this particular stone is what ultimately causes the creation of one of my favorite Avengers: The Vision. The Vision! I don't know if The Vision's creation follows the way it was done in the books, I never read the Ultron storyline. I suppose they had to change some aspects of it, like they did with the Extremis storyline in Iron Man 3- But even that is related.<br/><br/>I have never read any Marvel comic without having to buy several other titles just to follow a particular story, in was bankrupting me, I had to stop collecting. I'll have to find the Trade Paperback/Graphic Novel of this to compare the story elements.<br/><br/>But I think my disappointment is that people forget that these movies are extensions of those original Comics. They are filmed that way, to look like a comic book, and there is no other way to tell the stories. Every Avengers story eventually includes a huge battle over a city, a planet, in space, etc- This film has several large battle sequences even before the final climactic fight. They get sequentially more complex until the final one, it's not just a fight, there is a city floating in the sky, there are hundreds of Ultron Droids, and there are too many bullets flying around for even Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who plays the exact same kind of guy in Days of Future Past) to avoid. I was totally shocked by Elizabeth Olson, who I did not like much in ""Godzilla"", she totally got the Scarlet Witch, and she gave her to us. The way she is, what she can do, that's straight from the Comics. One worm can that was not toppled was that ""The Twins"" are in fact Magneto's Kids. They don't mention much about the part of Wanda's power that is due to causing freak accidents to happen, she is an ""Improbability Engine"" (It's on the back of one of my X-Men Trading Cards).<br/><br/>One thing that was great was a party on the Avengers NYC Mansion, which we saw at the end of the first Avengers film. But it was crashed by Dr Daniel Jackson of Stargate, oops, by Ultron! I recognized James Spader's voice almost immediately, because it sounded very much like that character from the Stargate movie and the TV shows. Ironically, the actor in the TV versions uses the exact same voice. It was genius casting, gave Ultron a lot of Depth.<br/><br/>What Else? Oh Yah, in the Comics, Hawkeye was married to another Avenger, I think who got killed off. That's one thing that's different with Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye.<br/><br/>But as I watch these Avengers flicks and the other related Marvel Universe films, it appears that not only are The Avengers being Assembled, but the entire Marvel Multiverse! From X-Men to Avengers, from Thor to Iron Man, these franchises are making mine Marvel just like the comic books did when I was younger.<br/><br/>Nuff Said? Nuff Said!"

","So well since i liked the first Avengers movie, id was hoping for this one to be great. Sadly its not, they need to learn that there doesn't have to be a funny comeback or a joke every 5th min, thats something thats just tedious. To much is changed of the original story and when movie makers starts to tamper to much with an already good story you rarely get an good end result. Ultron then one of the most dangerous non heroes there is, sadly not at all in the way he supposed to be. Ultron were really lame and and other villain would have posed the as a bigger threat. These are already taking the turn of the Transformers movies, Action, action, jokes, jokes, action, jokes and no story."
"Vivekmaru45","5","3","9","24 August 2015"," Promising Sequel Ruined By A Weak Plot And Overuse Of C.G.I.
","The first scene after the post credits have rolled in Avengers 2012, presents Loki explaining the failure of their attack on Earth to a mysterious alien, who turns and smiles at the idea of dealing with The Avengers would be ""courting death itself."" That alien is of course the previously rumored Thanos and the reason for the smile is that ""Death"" is actually personified in the Marvel Universe as someone Thanos so desperately wishes to please. <br/><br/>Brief plot: In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers – Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton – raid a Hydra outpost led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They encounter two of Strucker's experiments – twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can manipulate minds and project energy – and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.<br/><br/>Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to complete Stark's ""Ultron"" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. <br/><br/>Watch the film to find out what happens next and don't miss the post credits scene that reveals more of Thanos's agenda.<br/><br/>Verdict: some of the characters do not do justice to their parts at all. They just act for the sake of acting, and getting a hefty paycheck at the end of filming. Samuel L. Jackson has a small role in the film as Nick Fury, and we see Stan Lee making a cameo appearance again as he did in Ant-man(2015). I was very disappointed with the acting of Chris Hemsworth in the role of the Norse God Thor. He is totally unsuitable to play the part. The best Thor I have seen, was Eric Allan Kramer who played the part in The Incredible Hulk Returns(1988). <br/><br/>Regulars Robert Downey Jr.(Iron Man), Chris Evans(Captain America), Scarlett Johansson(Black Widow), Mark Ruffalo(Hulk), Jeremy Renner(Hawkeye) perform their respective duties in their respective roles - but fail to shine. Newcomers Elizabeth Olsen(Scarlet Witch) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson(Quicksilver) make their debut appearance. <br/><br/>Don Cheadle, an Iron Man franchise regular, makes an appearance as War Machine. Anthony Mackie who is a versatile character that has appeared in Captain America: The Winter Soldier and the new Ant-man film.<br/><br/>Veteran actor James Spader(Jack's Back 1988, Stargate 1994, Dream Lover 1994, Critical Care 1997, The Watcher 2000(his best film simply unmissable)) plays the titular character Ultron. He does full justice to his characterization of Ultron, as a single-minded progenitor of mankind's annihilation.<br/><br/>Thank you for reading my review. Live long, prosper."

Is this a prefect film? No, it isn't; but I had so much fun watching everything unfold that I didn't care. Is this professional? It's not, and I don't plan on saying this often, but I don't want to critique a movie like this because I don't want to bring such a entertaining experience down in my memory. The characters are well developed, the overall universe is not afraid of moving on and changing things, people grow and learn, the action scenes are excellent, the villain evil, yet likable, and I could go on and on. Is it better than the first movie? Is some ways it is and in other ways it is not. Overall I definitely think it is a worthy sequel.

"uban-23698","10","3","9","18 May 2015"," Marvel continues to amaze us
","Age of Ultron beautifully captures the essence of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It helps Joss Whedon reiterate why people should watch movies that are a part of the MCU.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is one film where everything comes together. Almost all loose ends from the Phase 2 films are brought together and it is knitted really nicely. Despite all the hate it is receiving from a lot of people about it not being a dark film, I think it's nice that it's not dark. The Avengers are these super-cool heroes with a lot of bonding with each other and coordination. Joss made sure that AoU lived up to that and the CGI he put in to complement that is just MARVELous.<br/><br/>The film gives insight into a lot of the topics that were left unexplored in the previous films and all the subplots do nothing but build on the characters very nicely (as opposed to what the usual reviews say). Obviously we do not get the thrill of seeing these characters get together for the first time ever and the small little differences that it creates and obviously the bar set by The Avengers (2012) was really high, Age of Ultron offers to show us how these characters have grown to like/dislike each other. It explores their deepened chemistry and yes, if not surpassing the bar set by the first film, it does meet it.<br/><br/>With a moral meaning hidden in the movie, with a lot of depth to justify the heroes' actions and kick-ass one-liners which tickled everyone's ribs, Age of Ultron is a masterpiece and I do hope that the follow-up Captain America Civil War lives up to the standards set by this movie."
"renearturo-66715","9","3","9","10 May 2015"," The movie brings exactly what you expect, and more.
","Not only does Avengers: Age of Ultron succeed at being a great follow up to its predecessor, it also manages to improve on the original. Avengers: Age of Ultron is deeper and darker than Marvel's The Avengers, giving more humanity to the main characters while also lacking boredom. This sequel manages to be faster and more evenly distributed than the original in terms of tone. In the first movie, the first half is pure dialog and the second half is just pure action, making the first 45 minutes feel kind of stale. In Age of Ultron, the dialog and action are more consistent throughout, making it more entertaining. Althoguh the motivation and arc of this movie's villain feels rushed, he is still a ton of fun to watch James Spader completely own the role as the evil Ultron. This movie takes the weakest character from the first Avengers film and gives him a heartwarming backstory and makes him one of the film's best characters. Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is just what you wanted plus a little extra."
"crazymonk19","9","3","9","7 May 2015"," Whedon's true mistake: Overestimating his audience.
","Prior to watching the movie this is what I expected based on most review going on at the moment: Full of action, bad storytelling, something weird with Black Widow, and that Ultron was an unsatisfying villain. After watching the movie I can now add that most of what people are complaining about, why people are giving the movie very low scores, is highly over dramatized. <br/><br/>I would say to enjoy Age of Ultron at the level I did you must fill two prerequisites prior to seeing the movie. The first is that you have a decent foundation of the other Marvel MCU movies. You must have some knowledge of what went on in Iron Man 1, the first Avengers, the Winter Soldier, probably Thor 1, and possibly Guardians of the Galaxy. The movie is very quickly paced which I think left lots of viewers feeling lost, knowing these things before hand makes comprehending the plot much easier.<br/><br/>Second, you must be able to fill in the gaps. The movie packs on a ton of characters and weaves together many time-lines, it doesn't have time to explain Black Widow's infamous romance in the movie. It's true it hadn't been talked about before this movie but the writers presumed the audience would figure out that time had passed between Avengers 1 & 2 and actually they offer some lines that make it seem highly plausible. BUT YOU GOT TO PAY ATTENTION!<br/><br/>Other things they complained about: Ultron's inception, explained in plenty of detail. His plan, again explained in detail. Character motives, either alludes to previous movies or are explained. <br/><br/>Bottom line is the critics are mad because they don't understand, and they don't understand because they want to be spoon-fed all this information. Whedon is a clever writer who provided many lines and subplots that should have allowed viewers to understand the movie in better detail. In order to have done what critics wanted, the movie would have to have been much longer and it would have felt drawn out, and they would have hated it for that fact too.<br/><br/>Also another thing about this movie is that it is supposed to serve as a bridge to ""Phase 3"" of the MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe). What happens is it is supposed to leave open endings for the characters who will have later movies, to give them a direction to head in, to ultimately lead towards Infinity Wars. This is roughly the equivalent of the Harry Potter movies leading up to the war against Voldemort. A lot needs to be said and done before it can be made, Age of Ultron definitely sends them off in the direction they need to be. <br/><br/>It's either you catch the small things that were said to make sense of the movie, or you think it is all nonsensical. This turns out to be one that I'm confident critics are wrong about. Go to the movie, pay attention, enjoy the amazing action sequences, and understand its flaws resulted from necessity. 9/10 to combat the hate! :)"
"AliceofX","5","3","9","6 May 2015"," Lower Your Expectations
","So I suppose I should start this with saying that the Avengers movies never clicked with me. It's not that I thought they were bad, I just never saw what made them so huge to others. So I don't think I would have been a fan anyway, but considering previous Marvel movies this one fell short in many ways. The biggest problem is that the movie is all action, little story or character development. <br/><br/>Maybe this would have been better as a 3+ hour monster, with more time, more focus on the characters their decisions would have felt more real. There are two things that bugged me the most:<br/><br/>1) Hulk and Black Widow romance. It just comes completely out of nowhere. If it would have ended with Black Widow and Hulk running away at the end then the plot line would have had some weight, but as it is I think it will all be forgotten in the next movies and made pointless.<br/><br/>2) The Twins turn good moment. I can understand them turning against Ultron. But they spent half of their lives wanting to kill Tony Stark. They tried to tear the Avengers apart, all the damage Hulk did could really be laid at Scarlet Witch's feet. After all that they just easily accept her?<br/><br/>With more character time all these problems could have been solved (perhaps) but as it is the movie feels rushed.<br/><br/>With that said I could still see many people giving it a higher score as it does still have that Marvel humor and plenty of cool scenes to enjoy. For me the negatives drag it down."
"etatec","7","3","9","6 May 2015"," Avengers!! somewhat assembled
","No surprise that this film was one of the most anticipated movies of the year. Coming in at about $191 million US Box Office opening weekend doesn't hurt either. But I can honestly say Age of Ultron lacks the superior storyline and memorable moments of the original Avengers. The action scenes were great and visuals were spot on but they could not top the Hulk smashing Loki scene or even the Hulk transformation right before dispatching the Chitauri worm. My favorite moment would have to be the Iron Man/Hulk fight scene with the Hulkbuster armor. There were some things that bothered me, I didn't really care too much for the romance between the Black Widow and Bruce Banner....c'mon Marvel you can do better than this, that was pointless. The introductions of its new characters felt rushed. The reasoning and creation of Ultron lacked development given that he was evil from the beginning. Ultron is humanized to the point that he felt like just another everyday robot villain. The Vision is unveiled and lacked more screen time, of which he deserved. I understand there is only so much time allotted for this film but these are key characters. Comparing this film to the source material that was the comic books, the changes in this movie were noticeable . And that is just the thing, if I were a 10 year old (or just ignorant to the comic books) I may have liked this movie more, after all that is the market. The plot was not as solid as I would have liked but it still gets tied together at the end of the movie. Overall Age of Ultron is good but not great, especially when compared to the first Avenger film. Joss Whedon was able to balance all these characters to the point that the film comes together despite some obvious time constraints. We can only wait with anticipation and see what the Infinity War films will have in store for us. 3 out of 5 stars."

The story feels like an afterthought and the stakes feel so much lower than they did in the first movie, even though they feel the need to constantly remind you that they ""might not make it out of this one"". Not everything is bad, The action is as good as any other large spectacle action movie and the acting is about as good as it gets for a comic book movie. The writing is hit or miss for most of the movie, and the funny banter between Avengers seems to die down toward the middle of the movie.It also has trouble finding its tone. One minute they want it to feel grounded and real, then the next minute you feel like you are watching a cartoon. The direction was unremarkable and Joss Whedons impact is felt less here than in the first movie. We may be getting spoiled with Guardians of the Galaxy and the second Captain America, but I expected much more from Age of Ultron. Every attempt to add personality to one of the characters that does not have their own separate movie feels forced and slows the movie down to a screeching halt. Finally what is up with the Hulk? First he is a reckless machine of destruction, not safe to be around unless you are basically a god. Then he can be calm and not punch everything he sees. One minute it takes some doing to get him to ""turn green"", but the next he can do it basically on a dime. Its lazy and bugs me to death. The first Avengers movie had problems, but it was awe inspiring to see all of this awesomeness on screen, but the sequel fails to reach that same peak."
"summeriris","7","3","9","5 May 2015"," Good news & bad news.
","The good news is that Joss Whedon's dialogue is just as witty as ever. His characters sparkle with wit and it's fun just sitting there and watching the Avenger's have a good time. Their good time is infectious. The bad news is that there is so many of them. James Spader's Ultron is charismatic and very powerful is another piece of good news, his Minions are not as much fun as Gru's from 'Despicable Me' though. And if like me you find yourself folding your hand bag strap as small as you can and then counting the loops, well think of all those poor boys in the audience who don't even have a handbag strap to fold. I was rather disappointed to tell the truth.<br/><br/>The direction is good, the acting is good, the action is getting very old hat by now. The 3D, well what can you say. I didn't notice anything great about it. When all you are noticing in a film is the fact that Thor's hair could really use a good shampoo and blow dry, the story isn't really holding your attention."
"Raveesh_Kulshrestha","6","3","9","4 May 2015"," Age of Ultron: Avengers gather for an average feast this time!
","Be prepared to cheer for your Superheroes with all of them coming together in a rather elaborate opening scene to invade the Hydra base from the previous installation of Marvel, Captain America: The Winter Solder. Much has been said about this particular scene but frankly speaking it lacks thrill. It is shot in a gloomy hue with very fast paced action sequences, so fast that you actually miss the details of a good fight. Advice: Keep an eye out for Hulks entry, lest you will miss it.<br/><br/>Once they get back to Avengers HQ with Loki's scepter a miscalculation on the part of Banner and Stark gives form to an evolving AI program, Ultron, which goes rogue and leaves on a mission to eliminate human race from earth. How the Avengers embark on this journey to stop him is what the plot is all about.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon did a marvelous job in the first movie by giving each character their due share of screen space and showcased the right amount of camaraderie between the characters. It was backed with friendly banter, good humor and amazing screenplay. In his new attempt he tries recreating all elements to a bigger affect but the outcome is very different – so many characters are brought in the plot from MCU that screen time of the main leads is reduced to a bare minimum and no one gets to shine. Not even Tony Stark! Other two weak elements were the introduction of Hawkeye's family and the romantic angle between Natasha and Banner. Though most of it was relevant to the Marvel comic world, many were uncalled for as a part of this sequel. Editing could have been better. OK so the heroes lacked the punch, but a worthy villain could have saved the day. Unfortunately the movie is at its lowest when Ultron is in the frame. One really misses the sly, manipulative, conniving and unapologetic Loki from the previous one.<br/><br/>The action in this movie is done well but is it different from other franchises from MCU? – no! With the four characters of Avengers having their own franchises running in parallel, the action here should have been four times better but manages to be just OK. Remember, the antics like Hawkeye shooting out an arrow to Loki aboard one of his minions and Loki catching it midair only to be blown up the explosive arrow head, Hulk beating the wits out of Loki, the never ending edge of the seat pursuit of Ironman with his continuous witty conversation with Jarvis, all were missing here. Whedon tries to bring in some of the flavor from his earlier project, but forgets to add freshness to it. Just getting more characters with no space in the plot does not amplify the thrill element. Yes the action is explosive but it is something that we see time and again in other movies as well - there was no differentiator here. Final showdown could have been cut short by at least ten minutes because things started getting seriously repetitive and a drag.<br/><br/>Every movie has its moments and this one sure does too. My favorite is the SmackDown between Ironman's Veronica and Hulk towards the middle of the film. It's outstanding! We wanted many of these in AOU!.<br/><br/>All said, it's not a movie to be missed, not because it's outstanding but because it builds up the tempo for the next movies to come."
"SoundwaveG1","7","3","9","4 May 2015"," Avengers vs Transformers
","I thought this was a good movie but not a great movie compared to the first Avengers movie and Captain America: Winter Soldier. There were some typical mindless action scenes and there were some funny humor scenes like the first movie. I'm a comic book collector and I always thought Ultron would sound like the Daleks from Doctor Who TV series. Ultron sounded like Agent Smith from The Matrix. And what's the deal with Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch's ethnic accent? They're Americans not Europeans. Their father Magneto was a refugee from post WW2 Europe. That's the only thing I found annoying in the movie. Overall, it's a good movie to take your kids or your girlfriend to watch with."
"delweine","9","3","9","3 May 2015"," If Your IQ Is Above Average, You Will See This Film as Superior To First Avengers
","Also, if you have attention deficit disorder, you will like the first Avengers better. However, if you like a deeper and darker story line, and you do not have an attention deficit disorder and have an above average IQ, you will like this film.. Here are the reasons;<br/><br/>1. Better character fleshing - In the fist Avengers, we had characters come together to stop a basically mindless plot by Loki to rule The Earth. Character motivations had little to no fleshing. Here, we have each character's motivation as an Avenger delved into much deeper, and in a much more realistic and human way. (I.E, Banner and Romanov motivation and interaction here, it does make a ton of sense and it's not forced if you understand the character motivation)<br/><br/>2. Better antagonist motivation -- Ultron's motives make sense. In some ways it's not hard to actually agree with his agenda, which makes him a much better and threatening antagonist than Loki, who I found to be a sniveling childish punk in the first film. Ultron has a mission, and as artificial intelligence his point of view is to evolve beyond that of a simple program, and has the freedom to interpret what it means to ""bring peace."" I really liked this angle much better than Loki and his boorish childish ego. In fact, Ultron reminded me very much of the Agent Smith character from The Matrix trilogy; very similar point of view and mindset which to me makes Ultron far more menacing and interesting - it's not a stretch to actually see his point of view and actually agree with it in many ways.<br/><br/>3. Better/deeper dialog -- Do not believe other reviewers when they harp on the cheesy one-liners. They fit in decently here, not out of place like in the last Transformers film for an example. Occasionally, a few do seem forced, but in no way do they subtract from the much more tied-in and serious undertone this film has over its predecessor. Additionally, this film fleshes out Tony Stark in a way only the first Iron Man was able to accomplish. One weakness I did find was the Steve Rogers character taking a small step backwards in this regard. However, Banner, Romanov, Hawkeye and Stark characterizations move forward while Thor remains consistent. <br/><br/>A great new addition is ""The Vision"" (Thor's Vision) who is basically AI come into genetic life, and is a cross between Jarvis and Ultron. (The Vision is ""worthy!"") The end of the film fleshes him out properly where he converses with Ultron and points out the differences between the 2 AI's.<br/><br/>Now, if you want mindless action, which is how I saw the first Avengers as; the kind of mindlessness that does not require you to actually pay attention and enjoy the greater overall depth here, you probably will not like this film, and may even find yourself confused by it. This seems to me to be the tone of the negative reviews for this title.<br/><br/>In my view, this film ties up and transitions the Marvel Universe in a most efficient way, (except for the single mid-credit appearance, which is basically a do-over) which should make the next chapter, ""Captain America, Civil War"" (Ant-man is a separate slice of pie for now) a smooth transition. Note that the first Avengers film did not do that (Thanos end credit, poor continuity into Thor-Dark World.)<br/><br/>Conclusion - If you like a deeper story line with an antagonist who is similar to The Matrix's Agent Smith, (this film has a bit of a Matrix feel) and like your brain fed along with top-notch action, This Avengers film will be a far better experience for you than the first one. However, if you like your Marvel action spoon-fed with little to no thinking required, you may not like this one and certainly will not like it better than the first Avengers - you may even give it a negative review."
"asher-luberto","9","3","9","2 May 2015"," A movie for all Ages
","Avengers Age of Ultron is a surprisingly sophisticated, yet delivers the action and comedy you would expect from a Marvel movie. The movie starts with an incredible action sequence with slow motion kills, explosions, and comedy. This movie delivers laughs from start to finish, which separates this avengers from the last. After a jaw dropping action sequence the avengers find themselves in their new facility (Stark Industry). Where they soon encounter Ultron. Ultron is not your average villain. He is 100% AI, and the avengers are the only thing stopping him from world domination. The way he tries to defeat the avengers is turn them against each other. At this point the movie lacks something. The movie has all the great action sequences and jokes we were hoping for; but whatever that something they were missing was, they found it. The rest of the movie has the perfect combination of character development, action, and comedy that makes this one of the best films of the year."

"nikhils09","5","3","9","26 April 2015"," The Avengers Sequel is not up to mark.
","One word, its a big yawn. Marvel lost all the steam by over doing umpteen sequels to all their superhero movies. Nothing new in the latest film whose prequel released in 2012 was a good entertainer. Overdoing the same sequences and stunts again and again is not enough to keep th audience interested. Thor-2 and Captain America WInter Soldier released last year chocked to stand on their feet meaningful sequels to their prequels. Those were the first signals that Marvel losing grip on their superhero sequels. Its big time Marvel to bring in some story-substance into their superhero films or just windup the franchise."
"Timmons89","7","3","9","26 April 2015"," Copy of the first film
","The story of the film is tightly knotted up with the rest of the Marvel cinematic universe, similar to that of the first Avengers movie the majority of the events that happen within it have major links to many previous films. Guardians of the Galaxy, Thor: The Dark World and of course Avengers Assemble are the most important films.<br/><br/>It is amazing to look at the sheer amount of similarities between the first and second Avengers story, it's like for some parts they've just used the first films as a template. The story first begins to develop from when Ultron is actually created, or at least that is when it first begins to get semi-interesting. Ultron begins to root itself into the Iron Man's Iron Legion army and slowly gains power throughout the film towards the climaxing final action fight at the end. About an hour into the film the tensions start rising in the group as a new supper- villain arises that plays with their minds, almost to the point of the group going their own ways and disbanding, just to be thwarted by the same old 'Our world needs us' speech. Starting to see any similarities yet? It just seems like an exceptionally rigid storyline that is mundane and just been ripped off from another movie.<br/><br/>Action Avengers Assemble was one of the best, if not the best film I have seen for the purposes of action and Age Of Ultron in many cases does not fail to match these standards. The film opens up with my favorite type of shot that was used exquisitely in the first movie, an extremely long action shot showing us teamwork and single abilities alike, it was truly amazing. From long shots of an extremely one sided fight to a long action shot of possibly the best fight sequence I have seen in any Marvel film to-date: Hulk Vs Iron Man's anti-hulk suit thing, which for the record I am very disappointed that this didn't show up again later on in the film.<br/><br/>All of this being said I do feel like many of the action sequences lack the overall awesomeness that the first movie clung to like child to its mother. Thinking it through for a while I finally came to the conclusion that it was due to the lack of team shots/sequences through the film that made the said sequences slightly disappointing. IN many cases such as the final fight scene , the Avengers are split up throughout a town, fighting in their own area and the camera would transition from shot to shot of each one of them fighting their bit. I just found scenes like this very dull and extremely hard to describe to someone, I just could feel the team as much as I could in Assemble.<br/><br/>To round it up I think that Age of Ultron is an extremely good attempt at recreating Avengers Assemble but in many cases it tries to be it's predecessor too much. The action is brilliant throughout but I was disappointed that it did not live up to the standards that Avengers Assemble created. 7/10 Feel free to post about anything that I may have missed or your own personal opinion of the film.

"ishu_somebody","9","3","9","23 April 2015"," Best Marvel movie!
","The new marvel has arrived with a bang and has taken the game to a newer height which seems to have no ends. First ,Marvel surprised us with the brilliance of a dark and gritty environment of ""dare-devil"" which made us knell for more and now a gem of a movie which has surpassed any expectation out of the ground of movie making. The movie is a perfect blend of heroism, with admirable human touch as well as a dark and humorous side which has risen from the ground to take what belongs to them, the rightful owners.<br/><br/>I wont bring out any spoilers in this post but will pass on the excellence of this movie. As everyone knows that the previous movie was a disaster with loopholes that made it look like as if it was created for children age groups. The expectation of this movie was very low while the trailers promised more. The highly expected part of the movie was the fight between Iron man's hulk buster and the green monster, Hulk himself. <br/><br/>The fight has been created in a way that Robert Downey jr , Mr iron man would try to smash the hell out of hulk and vise versa. After watching it like a child, i nearly yelled with happiness as it didn't disappoint but made it even more merrier. Everyone has been given a fair share of cinematic time whilst not separating any cast members of the Mighty avengers. The action seems to have evolved in another dimension ( some of the fights seems to be much computerized) which helps the movie to keep on rising to newer heights and to never stop till the end. The best thing about this movie is it has tried to create a attractive environment all till the end. There are dialogues between the actors but a more humorous side has seized the moment from ruining. The movie is in a ladder paced which doesn't drop at any given instance. The romance between the hulk and black widow seems to have given another chapter to the Avenger universe. From the birth of Ultron as shown in the trailer to the appearance of Vision, from the superb acting of Iron man and Bruce banner, This movie has left its predecessor into dust and has made a new mark in the way.<br/><br/>The most annoying moment of the movie however ,is the death of the character that marvel has promised and yes the ""THE END"" part where there was no credit scene or any other eggs left by the writers. ( or is there?)"
"betafett-176-53500","7","3","9","23 April 2015"," More of the same, really... *mild spoilers*
","Joss Whedon delivers his swan song in the Marvel cinematic universe with more of the same that made the first Avengers fun. Admittedly, although this is supposed to be setting up phase 3 leading to 2018/2019's Avengers: Infinity War parts 1 & 2, it is painted on a decidedly smaller canvas than its predecessor. Aside from a brief jaunt to a metaphysical realm for Thor, almost all of the action is earth bound. No Alien juggernauts or floaty asteroid realms here, folks. No Loki. And it really does feel like more of the same. The hordes of more or less identical Chitauri from the first flick are replaced by hordes of ACTUAL identical robots to serve as the cannon fodder. And fist fodder. And laser fodder, and lightning fodder--you get the idea. Some of the same beats are repeated, too, with the obligatory Avenger vs. Avenger smackdown in the second act. The interplay between the characters is where its heart is at, and is really Whedon's forté. There's a blossoming romance, some nice back and forth banter. The odd one-liner that's worth a chuckle or two. Like I said before: more of the same. My biggest complaint comes into the money shots; Whedon's whirlwind shots of all the Avengers standing together, facing down the faceless robotic hordes left me a little overwhelmed--there was so much happening so fast--debris flying, lasers shooting, lightning, bullets, arrows, people, robots-- it honestly felt for a moment like a Michael Bay Transformers flick overload assaulting my senses. And he's still doing those damn ugly dutch angles just to squeeze all the action into the frame sometimes. But did I enjoy it? Yes mostly. Even if I felt I had seen most of it before in the first flick (also, Superman Returns immediately came to mind when Ultron puts his plan into motion). Ultimately though, I am glad Whedon is handing over the reins, because you can feel that he's not as hungry with his second serving as he was with his first.<br/><br/>Oh, and btw, those rumours of a post-credit cameo for Spider-man were just pie in the sky, so you don't need to stay in the theatre until after the credits have finished rolling."
"isheikher","6","3","9","23 April 2015"," ""Marvel's cinematic universe shows signs of going stale""
","Youtube.com/FilmGob Twitter.com/FilmGob Facebook.com/FilmGob<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>When Tony Stark tries to jumpstart a dormant peacekeeping program, things go horribly wrong and it's up to the Avengers to stop the evil Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.<br/><br/>The opening action scene shows our heroes taking out a HYDRA base to recover Loki's sceptre. The reason i mention this scene is because it sets the style for what's to come. Visually this fast paced cg single shot felt messy and more comparable to a video game cut scene rather than a 250 million dollar Hollywood blockbuster. Later the Hulk and Iron Man's Hulkbuster cause city damage of 9/11 proportions, and not much discussion about the consequences. Also with the camera being so close to the lightning quick action, it was difficult to know what was happening with bodies and debris flying everywhere. The third act is centred around a city ripped from the Earth, with flying battles between Ultron's minions, Iron Man and S.H.I.E.L.D's hellicarrier (don't ask me where that came from after the events of Winter Soldier)<br/><br/>The character development in Age of Ultron feels inconsistent with the rest of the franchise. The events of Iron Man 3 and Winter Soldier seem to have been brushed aside as Tony Stark and Captain America look and sound better than ever, no traces of the doubt and confusion they went through. We spend some time with Ulysses Klaw in South Africa but it's all too short, Newcomers Scarlet Witch and her brother Quicksilver debut with accents and all. The brother's death is certainly emotional but fell flat considering Aaron Taylor- Johnson didn't grab my attention during his screen time. Paul Bettany's Vision is introduced late but to great effect, his power and abilities matching those of his peers.<br/><br/>The more interesting moments of the film was an attempt at giving some emotion and story to characters like Hawkeye and Black Widow, but the latter's romance with the Bruce Banner comes out of nowhere and feels rushed. Some hints at what's to come in Civil War are placed around the film that are absorbing, but aren't fleshed out despite over 2 and a half hours runtime. Any animosity we witness between Stark and Cap is pretty much ignored by the end. <br/><br/>Don't worry there's plenty of quips and explosions for people who came for quips and explosions. Even James Spader's Ultron (at times menacing and intriguing for a robot planning to destroy humanity) is presented as a wisecracking (that's right, wisecracking) sentinel due to being born from Tony Stark's ambitions. Tense scenes are oddly interrupted with typical Whedon humour that's beginning to feel tiresome. The party scene early on is ideal for all that, and i enjoyed the banter among God like superheroes trying to be social. <br/><br/>Now even though i had a good time in a turn-my-brain-off kind of way, and nothing felt horrible or insulting like oh i don't know cough Iron Man 3 cough, the whole experience was more going through the motions rather than the spectacle i hoped for. It's still popcorn fun but predictable. Rather than moving forward, Age of Ultron feels like Marvel saying, ""Nah, i'm OK here, thanks"". With Joss Whedon stepping down due to his self confessed exhaustion and the Russo Brothers taking over for Infinity War, the time is right for change, because Marvel's cinematic universe shows signs of going stale."

","Avenger: Age of Ultron was an entertaining sequel with lots of surprises (only for non comic fan). I'm rating it flat 90 for its incredible effects and well played tag team fights. Let's talk about the three new members. <br/><br/>First are the twins, Quicksilver is different from XDOFP quicksilver. I'm a big fan of x-men and I don't want to be around bias. I prefer the XDOFP Quicksilver, in terms of how they show his power. I was confused how the others can keep up with Pietro as they slow him down showing his power. The effects are kinda weird with white beam of light while he run, I think it's too much for comic counterpart effect. He might be dead but I'm 100% sure he will resurrect for somehow. <br/><br/>Scarlet Witch is the only reason I watch the movie. I was surprise the way the twins speak dye to their funny accent. They made Wanda not that powerful only capable of hypnotizing and projecting telekinesis with her hex bolts. The costume was superb; it's like X- men Evolution costume. Though they treasure her real potential, keeping her real power in the future film. I enjoy her fighting scenes and looking forward to see her probability manipulation in the future. <br/><br/>And finally The Vision, that was the most interesting way on how they introduce him. It blows away my mind. It's pure awesomeness with the use of mind stone to connect in infinity wars. What I enjoy about him is the connection of him and Wanda throughout the end of the film. I'm sensing decimation or M-day if that happens, though it's impossible because only mutants might affect her curse. About the original avengers, they've been used well. Got their separate story and still having a fun way to keep away the seriousness in climax part. <br/><br/>How about the cameo of Ulysses Klau? The Black Panther is on his way to the big screen and I guess it will be an interesting one too. <br/><br/>The mid credit scene is just the beginning of thanks search for infinity stones. Not exciting in my case coz I know it already. I thought it will be Spiderman saying hi to the avengers or the defenders joining same ad ant man. Other than that, I enjoy it. 60% action and 40% conversation which only for hulk and black widow love story made it more romantic."

","No matter how much 'Avengers'/Marvel detractors go out of their way to suggest that those who legitimately like the 'Avengers' films and Marvel's output are wrong and invent ridiculous conspiracy theories without proof, this reviewer loved 'Avengers Assemble' while acknowledging that it wasn't perfect.<br/><br/>'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is a solid sequel, though not as good as 'Assemble' and not without its flaws. There are a few longueurs in the pacing, as a result of a few overlong scenes that don't go very far (as admirable as it was to do more with Hawkeye's character, the farm scene did grind the film to a halt somewhat), parts that were not as developed as one would have liked or didn't add much to the film and some of the many characters are more interesting than others.<br/><br/>While one does admire that more was attempted to be done with Hawkeye, he still felt underwritten and not always necessary. Ultron, despite a cool appearance and chilling voice work from James Spader, is an underdeveloped, not very interesting and one-dimensional villain and doesn't pose enough of a threat. And while most of the comedy is funny and witty, there are moments that jar too much when the scene is serious or intense and it spoils the mood.<br/><br/>However, 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' looks fantastic, very slickly shot and edited with sumptuous and atmospheric set and costume design and quite spectacular special effects. The music avoids being overbearing or over-bombastic, as well as avoiding being too quirky or one-note. Joss Whedon ensures that the fun and tension rarely slips and that a good deal of the characterisation is interesting, visually and stylistically there is nothing to fault here.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film is wittily, cleverly and intelligently scripted with a good deal of the tonal shifts handled well with only some jarring humour disappointing. While not perfect in execution, the story is absorbing, there are plenty of fun moments, thrillingly choreographed and executed action scenes (especially the earth-shattering climax) and while it could have been developed a little more and could have been less forced when introduced Hulk and Black Widow's relationship is given admirably sensitive treatment here.<br/><br/>The film's characters are mostly interesting and engaging, not complex but that wasn't expected. The acting is impeccable, Robert Downey Jnr, Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans really excel in roles tailor made for them, while Scarlett Johansson gives a fearless intensity to Black Widow and Mark Ruffalo is by far the best and most layered live-action Hulk. As said, James Spader is chilling as the voice of Ultron, and one does wish that more was done with the character, Paul Bettany and Samuel L. Jackson are great value and Aaron Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen play the newcomer roles with plenty of fire. Jeremy Renner does what he can.<br/><br/>Overall, a solid sequel if not as good as 'Avengers Assemble'. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

","In the first act of the movie when Ultron is created and they say he is in the internet. Because in this age if a robots has its own mind like humans. Then Ultron can pretty much destroy the whole world because humans are so in electrons and Ultron can do anything with his power to change the internet. I would like that the movie has Ultron taking over the world and mostly destroyed and humanity his on it own for a few years before one of the avengers goes into the past and stop Stark from using Loki's scepter. That would make an interesting movie that the point of the movie is Stark using the scepter. However there would not be any Vision so that would be hard to create him without the research. Anyways this movie has good action scenes, characters are good, and lots of character development with Hawkeye and the Black Widow. There are bits of the movie that made me laugh. However it lack the story logic and pacing like the first avengers is. After watching this film I highly watch ""how it should have ended videos"" of this film because it's worth it."

","As expected this is an action packed spectacle. Entertaining all the way, this installment of the Marvel Universe doesn't disappoint. I like how the series lets the storyline jump between the Avenger series and the characters own Movies. It makes the story bigger than what would be possible to create with a single movie.<br/><br/>However, maybe they have added to many characters this time. It is a difficult task to balance the screen time of that many main characters without compromising the story. And this time the movie struggles with it. A few of the Avengers, like Thor, is absent long stretches (not speaking of the more and more strained explanations for Jane not being with him - if this was the real world I would be very worried for their relationship) and the chemistry between the characters is not as good as in previous installments (that is a part of the story though, but still unfortunate). The dialog, ripe with tongue in cheek jokes, doesn't flow as well as it has. And, surprisingly, I wasn't as impressed with the CGI as I have been. Some scenes, especially the intro, looked more like a computer game than a movie.<br/><br/>Still. It is a entertaining movie. A good pace without being too one dimensional acting. A good cast, with a stellar choice of James Spader as the villain. His voice gives Ultron an unexpected dimension. Small jokes and a quick dialog. It is hard no to like.<br/><br/>7/10"

","I've been quite happily ploughing through Marvel's 'shared cinematic universe.' I've never read a single Marvel comic, so I can't claim to say how faithful each movie is to its source material, but I just enjoy them anyway for what they are – good, popcorn-munching, special effects-fests. The original Avengers film was, in my opinion, about as perfect as it could be – it was the coming together of all the individual superheroes and it did it really well, giving each of them appropriate screen time. Therefore, what I'm trying to say is that I couldn't wait for 'part II.' Now I've watched it, I just feel a bit hollow. I didn't hate it, but it didn't leave half as much of a mark on me as the original. Again, the Earth's finest superheroes come together to fend off a new evil that's threatening to destroy the planet. In the first outing, the villain was Thor's nasty brother, Loki, played brilliantly by Tom Hiddleston. Soon after part II was announced we were informed that James Spader would be voicing the new baddie – the titular 'Ultron.' Now, James Spader is a great actor and more than capable of nailing the role as a comic book villain. However, he's only there in voice. His metal, robot character is completely computer-generated and I just didn't find him threatening enough (in the same way I didn't find 'General Grievous in Star Wars: Revenge of the Sith).<br/><br/>And that was pretty much my main gripe. The Avengers themselves were still pretty cool. There was banter between the central characters and – again – Robert Downey Jr was excellent as Iron Man. Plus there was a pretty awesome fight scene about half way through between two of the characters. So it wasn't all bad. In fact, it wasn't bad at all – just muted. It all felt a bit bland and simply going through the numbers of being an epic blockbuster.<br/><br/>All in all, it's an okay outing. I'm sure kids all over the world will love it and buy all the toys in the sequel's range. For me, the two Avengers films could be summed up by the fact that I could barely look away during the first one, but this one I found my mind wandering and tempted to check my mobile phone enough time."

","I read a couple of negative reviews of this film. It's not bad, it's not bad at all. I'm not even a fan of comic books and comic book heroes but these ""Avenger"" films, I think, are good. Although this film is a little flawed in it's over the toppness it's still a good film. There's plenty of action without a lot of in between dry dialog. We can think Tony Sparks (Robert Downey Jr.) and Ultron (James Spader) for that. Their witty remarks and jokes did add some good humor to this film. If you liked ""The Avengers"" you'll like this one as well. You won't be disappointed. Hopefully they're planning on making a third installment of this film. With the same director and writers going in the same direction as this one it will be a good one as well."

","Okay, so i guess it wasn't exactly what i expected. but how could it be? sure, we all had a perfect movie envisioned in out heads of a perfect Avengers thrill-ride that gave equal screen time to the everyone to flesh out their characters, have Joss Whedon work his magic and make us think ""Wow, that Quicksilver is SO much better than Fox!"", and maybe, just maybe, make us love Hawkeye. Weeellllhe did his best. now, don't think I'm saying this is a bad movie, its great! it just wasn't Winter Soldier, or Guardians. <br/><br/>Now, lets get to the basics. I'm gonna tell you just what you need to know to answer the question; should i see this instead of the latest Pixar tear-jerker?<br/><br/>1: the ACTION. Action scenes are one of the things that set Marvel movies away from the regular shmucks in Hollywood. Opening battle is great. its exciting, and introduces to us our ever-lovin' super humans, one by one. it even showcases the power of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. next one is also enjoyable, as it takes place during an after-party, and the heroes have to fight the Ultron-bots with their suits or weapons(aside from Thor and Cap). it shows us that the guys can handle themselves without the need of weaponry, and gives Agent Hill a good moment or two. after that is the TOTALLY AWESOME HULKBUSTER BATTLE that is just great. just freakin' great! And of course there is the final battle on a floating city. all heroes (bar Hulk and Quicksilver) are given a pretty equal amount of screen-time to show off just how powerful they are.<br/><br/>2: the PLOT & PACING. the over-all plot was pretty good, y'know? well, there were some things i gotta point out. the storyline moves at a good pace at the beginning, and with the intro of new characters, cameos, battles and talking, it goes really well, and you're sitting there in your seat going ""Wow! this is shaping up real good!"" until they reach Hawkeye's home (Yeah. he has a family.). Then, you've got about three or four things happening at once. there's Banner and Romanoff, Cap and Stark, Hawkeye and his wife and then Thor's quest, where he gets nude and climbs into a cave-hot tub. that went by far too quickly, and Erik Selvig was underused by far. The last forty-five minutes is well-paced and really fun. althoughthe one thing that makes the plot so good; you feel like the heroes aren't going to win. the whole time i sat in that cinema i just knew that there was no way Ultron could win. there was no set up for the Avengers to fall apart, come together and win. and that was kinda disappointing.<br/><br/>3: CHARACTER DEVELOPMENT. Lemme keep this one quick. Downy Jr is fantastic and actually manages to flesh out Stark's rarely seen ideals for being a superhero, that end up clashing with Cap's. Evans delivers a grade-A performance as the soldier-out-of-time, and makes some great fist fights. he also tells us just where Cap draws the line with Stark, and how he copes with his morals. Thor feels a little underused, and we finally know just how hard it is for Banner to cope with knowing just what lies within him. hehe. and how he manages to fend off the BLACK WIDOW, who comes on to him three times. damn, son. Quicksilverlets just say Fox did it better.his SPOILER death was pretty sad, but annoying that he wasn't given more time to let us love him like FOX did. and holy Mother they did it well! Scarlet Witch is really enjoyable to watch, and her powers are much different from that of what we've seen so far. Vision is surprisingly great, having been in the film only about thirty minutes. and then we haveHOLY- CRAP-HES-GOOD-NOW HAWKEYE. he has much more screen-time, a backstory, a family, some badass moments and is actually quite funny. there is a part in the movie where we see some of the gangs worst fears, or have dire visions. Turns out Tony is in constant fear of a raging alien army attacking Earth, and that he wound be able to save his friends. Thor has a vision to that of Asgard, and then a bunch of stuff about the Infinity Stones that just sets up Thor:Ragnarok. Black Widow gets a great piece, as we see her origin story, and we also know that Cap really wishes he was back in the 40s. Poor Cap. he never gets a break. And finally, Ultron is a very fun Villain, with a pretty cool plan for destroying mankind. Spader's voice is super sweet, and you really feel like he's more a person than a bunch o wires. <br/><br/>4. THE FUTURE. So, of course, we do want to know what this movie holds for the rest of the MCU. some parts kinda feel like they're teasing Civil War, and there's even a brief fight between Cap and Iron Man. Thor departs at the end of the movie to find out more of the Infinity Stones. Hulk leaves for parts unknown(although is confirmed to appear in Thor 3), Tony retires from Avengers, Hawkeye goes on annual leave to see his family, and Cap introduces the new Avengers; Falcon, War Machine, Scarlet Witch, Vision, Black Widow and himself.<br/><br/>So, Finally, i bring us to an end! overall, it was a great movie that has persuaded me to watch it illegally online five times. great battles, Marvel humour, Tony Stark is not the only star of the show anymore, but characters and pacing could have been better, just saying. In answer to my question ? it was better than Inside Out, but i thing Finding Dory is gonna trump it by a bit."

"boyznick","6","2","5","9 August 2015"," An entertaining popcorn movie
","Age of Ultron is a long waited sequel after the tremendous success of the Avengers in 2012. It is a fun movie to kick start the summer holiday season and I admire Joss Whedon's effort in putting the team back together. Instead of going through what's good about this film, I would like to point out several problems the film suffered from. <br/><br/>Spoiler ahead..<br/><br/>The film started off with the Avengers going after Loki's scepter which was in the Hydra's possession, pretty much where we were left off from Cap 2's post credit scene. We see Iron Man and Iron Legion back in action with little to no explanation as to why, completely ignoring the consequence of Iron Man 3 which was disappointing.. Thor and Hawkeye are just there and the weirdness between the Hulk and Black Widow.. If any of us who watched Cap 2, it would make better sense if it was between Cap and Black Widow.. All the hype built on Strucker but he was defeated by Cap in 10 seconds and killed off-screen..<br/><br/>Skipped right to the party scene where all the supporting characters come together which was great! James Rhodes aka War Machine was there to discuss the threat of Ultron with the rest of the team but that was it.. You don't see him again until the third act where apparently he's Nick Fury's big gun!? Again here, no mentioned why he changed back from Iron Patriot to War Machine and since when the new Shield and US air-force are working together? <br/><br/>We can get to see Ultron Mark 1 built from the scraps of Iron Legion but after a brief battle, it evolved to Ultron Prime right away.. it is disappointing as Ultron is meant to be a robot/ artificial intelligence which is continuously evolving.. <br/><br/>We were then given the back story of Hawkeye as he was pretty much a brainwashed zombie from the first film and with no ever mention where he was in the whole of phase 2.. Thor went off to find out about his hallucination and in the end just to justify the existence of Thor 2, telling us that Aether is one of the infinity stone and making a link with the Guardians of the Galaxy..<br/><br/>The Vision supposedly the all-powerful android is underused in the final act and was just there to save Scarlet Witch from the explosion.. Quicksilver is there so they could kill him off without crossing off any of the core team Finally the Nick Fury shows up with the Helicarrier out of nowhere to evacuate civilians? How could they have hidden this without the knowledge of Hydra (assuming not everyone has watched Agents of Shield)..<br/><br/>In the end, Age of Ultron has its great and bad moment but it is definitely a good popcorn movie. It is a sequel to the 2012 Avengers rather than the sequel to the Phase 2 movies(IM3, Thor 2 and Cap 2) as I previously assumed .."
"precisiontips","7","2","5","4 June 2015"," it's okay, but mediocre compared to the first avengers movie.
","Wasn't really impressed by this age of ultron sequel. first of all, the script doesn't really follow what the marvel universe has put down, Hank Pym created ultron not Tony stark. So if you're a marvel comics lover, you're going to be a tad disappointed. the CGI was okay and the fight scenes were a little bit under part, didn't really see hulk smash enough compared to the first avengers film. to be honest? this sequel had a little bit more drama with black widow catching feelings and stuff. the new characters scarlet witch and quicksilver were grossly underplayed, and at least we should have been given a hint about their origin(well everyone that reads the comics already knows, so I'll let that slip). and one more thing, vision was awful. definitely definitely needs a character revamp."
"ritera1","7","2","5","14 May 2015"," Better than the first
","A strong 7, although it was a bit too esoteric erring on the Christopher Nolan Batman side.<br/><br/>Some very good and strong action vs. the first. A lot less hand-held camera. I could actually see what was going on. The opening was very fluid although the actual characters looked very much animated. Like a video game. I was consistently engaged with the action.<br/><br/>A big film, too which was, at times, juxtaposed with being very small (the finale in the small building and the bridge). Even the farmhouse felt cinematic. The other locations not so much.<br/><br/>But the story was familiar. Bad guy wants to end the world. They were stretching Ultron's lapsed logic from birth but it still worked. Jarvis to Vision was fine. Hulk and Black Widow romance seemed by-the-numbers and familiar. <br/><br/>I know I'm going to be a broken record but Spader stood out. OK acting from everyone else, even Johansson (which is a big improvement for her). <br/><br/>The big problem I had was The Avengers put an end to Hydra's work at the castle. But then they left it completely unguarded. Sure, there was no movie without some place for Ultron to escape to and build his army. But it was impossible to ignore. <br/><br/>Also, it sure seemed that Ultron's army was very poorly constructed. <br/><br/>All in all entertaining due to very high production values. But nothing that captured the imagination. Winter Soldier was a better film.<br/><br/>(But really? Hawkeye? Why? He never runs out of arrows and, well, his weapon is arrows. Arrows?)"
"abhiramreddy48","4","4","14","28 April 2015"," The Avengers again!!!
","This movie is a straight out commercial film without any serious plot and with a lot of one liner jokes. Seems like Marvel is ripping themselves, Age of Ultron is very similar to The Avengers and The Guardians of the Galaxy. The super hero team is divided in the starting only to unite by the end of the film to defeat the antagonist.<br/><br/>From the beginning of the movie we can see that the story will set the plot for the future Marvel movies Civil War, Avengers Infinity Wars part 1 and part 2.<br/><br/>The main antagonist Ultron doesn't seem like a serious guy. Even he has his one liners. I couldn't take Ultron seriously from the beginning of the movie except for his appearance. Ultron is supposed to be a really serious character, impossible to outsmart and difficult to beat.<br/><br/>The locations were really good and the graphics were superb. But the 3d was like any other film. <br/><br/>There was not much seriousness to the characters, all the director cared about was which character gets the last one liner. Iam not really sure why Captain America says ""language"", even after he fought in the world war, he got beaten up on the streets.<br/><br/>Overall I will not be expecting the future Avengers films to outdo this film."

","Avengers Assemble was a brilliant coming together of all Marvel comic book fans' favourite superheroes in the same film, so it was no wonder that there would be a follow up, directed by returning Avengers director and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon. Basically, continuing from the events of Captain America: The Winter Soldier, the Avengers: Iron Man aka Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk aka Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America aka Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Black Widow aka Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye aka Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) fight against the forces of Hydra following the exposure of S.H.I.E.L.D. They capture Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (King Kong's Thomas Kretschmann), who had been experimenting on humans using the sceptre previously wielded by Loki, they encounter two of the experimented humans, twins Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver (Kick-Ass's Aaron Taylor-Johnson), who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, Mary-Kate and Ashley's sister), who can manipulate minds and project energy, but they retrieve the sceptre. Within the sceptre's gem, Stark and Banner discover is an artificial intelligence, and in secret use it to complete Stark's global defence program called ""Ultron"", but Ultron (James Spader) becomes a sentient being and believes that the world will be saved by eradicating humanity. So Ultron begins his plan by eliminating Stark's A.I., Jarvis (Paul Bettany), attacking the Avengers at their headquarters, stealing the sceptre, upgrading his rudimentary body at Strucker's Sokovia base, and building an army of robot drones, he then kills Strucker and recruits the Maximoff twins, they hold Stark responsible for killing their parents with his weaponry, and obtain vibranium from arms dealer Ulysses Klaue (Andy Serkis), they Avengers pursue them, but Wanda stalls the heroes with haunting visions, until stopped by Stark's anti-Hulk armour. Following some destruction and the threat of Wanda's mind manipulation, the Avengers go into hiding at Barton's safe house, Thor goes to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig (Stellan Skarsgård) on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, and meanwhile Romanoff and Banner are finding mutual attraction for each other, but Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) shows up and encourages the Avengers to form a plan to stop Ultron. The team's friend Dr. Helen Cho (Claudia Kim) is forced by Ultron into using her synthetic tissue technology, the vibranium and the sceptre's gem to perfect a new body for him, uploading himself into his new body Wanda is able to read his mind and discovers his plan for human extinction, she and Petro turn on him, Captain America, Black Widow and Hawkeye find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Romanoff is kidnapped. The Avengers are fighting amongst themselves, but Jarvis is found still alive, having been hidden by Ultron in the internet, Stark uploads him into the synthetic body, to become physical being ""Vision"" (Bettany), Thor returns and explains that the gem is one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence, settling their differences the Avengers, along with Vision and the Maximoffs group together to stop Ultron. To cause global extinction Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, he intends to crash it into the ground, Banner rescues Romanoff and becomes the Hulk to fight, the other heroes fight against the may machines, while Fury, Maria Hill (Cobie Smulders), James Rhodes aka War Machine (Don Cheadle) and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents in the Helicarrier evacuate civilians. Pietro is killed, Wanda is enraged and abandons her post to destroy Ultron's body, allowing one of the drones to activate the machine, the city plummets, but the machine is overloaded by Stark and Thor and the landmass is shattered, in the aftermath the Hulk departs, unwilling to be with Romanoff and endanger her, while the Vision confronts and eliminates Ultron's last remaining body. In the end the Avengers have established a new base, run by Fury, Hill, Chpo and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the manipulation of recent events from forces he suspects are coming, Stark and Barton depart, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train and welcome new Avengers: Rhodes, Vision, Sam Wilson aka Falcon (Anthony Mackie) and Wanda. In the mid-credits scene, Thanos (Josh Brolin), seen in Guardians of the Galaxy, is dissatisfied by the failure of those who have tried to conquer the world, he vows to retrieve the Infinity Stones himself. Also starring Idris Elba as Heimdall, Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter, Linda Cardellini as Laura Barton, Julie Delpy as Madame B and Stan Lee cameos as a military veteran who attends the Avengers' bar victory party. The cast still all do very well, Downey Jr. quipping, Evans being the sensible fighter, Ruffalo as the man who turns big and green, Hemsworth as the long-haired warrior, Johansson being the confident female, and Jackson being the guiding head figure. The only tiny problems I have with this sequel is that the story is not as compelling as the previous Avengers film, and the villain being artificial intelligence is not completely menacing, despite a chilling voice by Spader, but you can slip into it enough, and there are no complaints to had about the spectacular set pieces and special effects to create to create all the superhero gadgets and gimmicks and explosive sequences, it is a worthwhile action fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Visual Effects, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Special Visual Effects. Very good!"

","Obviously there will always be 'haters' (I hate that term) but I think you need to be a picky person in order to give this film a bad review. Yes I am a marvel fan, but honestly if I had to say any bad things about the film they would be really petty. For me it was a great addition to the marvel universe and ultron will certainly be iconic... He is a scary balance of humour, sociopathic tendencies and melodramatic evil that you need to have an icon and favourable villain.. James Spader was the perfect choice for the role.<br/><br/>End credits was fine, didn't blow me away, it was kind of expected but there has been so much speculation as to what it would be with the huge roster of films to come that what I could have hoped for would have been unrealistic<br/><br/>Wheaton did well to give more screen time to characters who had possibly been neglected and the new additions added to the spectacle. I'm interested to see how they will develop. However I think once than anything this film just makes me so much more excited for civil war.<br/><br/>Overall, The Avengers: Age of Ultron is more likely to stand the test of time in comparison to its predecessor... It was funnier and it had some moments where, as a marvel fan I was going ""wow"" or laughing in mixed emotions of ecstasy at the various Easter eggs and fan fulfilment. Also, this film has a darker tone in comparison to most marvel films which gives an extra layer to what has admittedly becoming a repetitive formula which was a rather liberating experience."

","This film has everything you would expect from an action film. Lots of explosions, slow- motion scenes, fighting, good vs evil and the old pun to lighten things up. The quality of the film-making such as CGI is good but it should be for a movie with such a big budget. All the big stars give alright acting performances. However, I did not enjoy this film. It was a disappointment. I was irritated throughout by the poor Russia accents used by everyone who plays a Russia character. But the worst thing is the storyline. Boring and dare I say dull. It was also unnecessarily confusing. It is no where near as exciting or interesting as the first film, Avengers Assemble. I had this bought for me on DVD as a present and unfortunately, it will be sitting on my shelf gathering dust. Poor film that rests and relies on the success of the other Marvel films.

"rossini-1868","5","3","10","26 March 2016"," Ruined the Hulk...
","The sad thing about this movie is that though it gets better every time you see it, one particular story element just keeps getting worse. Its when Tony Stark put on that iron fat suit and started throwing the Hulk around like he was made of styrofoam. There is not a true Incredible Hulk fan in the world that is not saddened and disappointed by this.<br/><br/>I used to look at Bruce Banner in this franchise with awe and reverence, now I just look at him with frustration and disillusionment. The idea of Bruce Banner and the Hulk used to mean something. When all else failed, it was what the story, the heroes in the story, and the fans watching the story could all depend on. Joss Whedon captured and delivered that beautifully in the first movie. Everything around the Hulk got its ass kicked by him in the first movie and he did not give a damn. This is the terrifying, and satisfying, essence of the Hulk.<br/><br/>But what Whedon and these money mongering jerks have done is ruined his character for the sake of marketability. Marketing the Hulk as some kind of half assed, green anger-clown to be made fun of and used to create suburban soccer mom-ish bullcrap out of his character is unforgivable. Next, he'll be wearing a tuxedo and holding a wine glass at his own wedding reception with Natasha Romanov. ALL credibility has been stripped from Whedon as a storyteller and from the Hulk's character, if he can be knocked out by a freakin' robot and hauled away in an airplane as Bruce Banner.<br/><br/>How the Hell can the Incredible Hulk go from knocking a building sized flying worm monster down with one punch in the first movie, then get knocked out by a robot his same size with one punch in the second movie? Until Whedon fixes this colossal mistake, this colossal bulls*t, in my opinion, his credibility is ready to be flushed down the nearest toilet. He is NOT the Hulk anymore. He's just some big, green clown that is hardly worth anything more than a yawn and a few laughs. Next, he'll be wearing an iron collar, chained to a leash in a traveling circus.<br/><br/>For what he did to the Incredible Hulk, Joss Whedon makes me sick to my stomach."

It was oddly difficult to track the characters during fight-scenes, them seemingly warping all over the place with minimal continuity, especially toward the end. Ultron was a weak villain, his nonchalant attitude and all-too-human foibles/quirks seeming distinctly at odds with his motive. Also, obligatory 9/11 reference was obligatory, not to mention offencive and in extremely poor taste. Every superhero movie these days seems disturbingly obliged to include scenes in which terrified citizens run from advancing clouds of concrete-dust as seen on 9/11, but this one went one step further by actually collapsing a skyscraper in the 'pancake' method to get that result."

As the villainous Ultron emerges, it is up to The Avengers to stop him from enacting his terrible plans, and soon uneasy alliances and unexpected action pave the way for a global adventure.<br/><br/>I watched the movie my real feeling was ""i need to watch it one more time""my plus points for the movie are following i will try to avoid the spoilers<br/><br/>1.Great team chemistry between the original team .it is highly explored through out the movie.their are still some rough patches major between stark and others <br/><br/>2.For me banner and widow chemistry worked for some it might feel sudden i didn't feel that because Whedon said in a interview he is going treat this movie like empire strike back the team will be together and doing mission for one year so lot might have between this two .<br/><br/>3. Ultron ,its a good thing tony created him they explored it well.Yes like in comics Pym just makes the initial bot ,after that he develop's himself.i like to see him back in some extent .spader just nailed the role .<br/><br/>4.Vision he was easily one of the best things of the movie,Initially i was scared how are they gonna introduce the character the movie is 75% over .i thought they are gonna do the whole transformers 4 Dino-bots thing .but vision clearly stole the show in every scene he is in ,Even though he was created by uploading Jarvis he still has Ultron in him(i am not telling more on that but i will say one thing it will be in connection with his comic book origin) in him but he is different i hope they explore him in any other future movie maybe Thor Ragnarok . <br/><br/>5. Maximoff twins they are done well .Barton puts their characters in simple punks yes they are shown two damage punks .i am pretty their are future plans for both of the character.i assume we will here from one of them more than what we think.<br/><br/>6 Brilliant score from Brian Taylor and Danny Elf-man<br/><br/>i would easily give this movie 9.5 for the above reason but their are still more reason's two love this film yes it has flaws but for me they are negligible and i hate to nitpick.one of the flaw i could say if i want, it tries to dwell a bit on M.C.U it will be a bit confusing to uninitiated but then again it's a cross-over . i recommend this movie for having enjoyable and great time PS: don't watch it in cam print ."

"ryanj15729","4","3","11","29 April 2015"," Good for the wrong reasons
","Joss Whedon promised us a ""darker"" sequel; did he succeed? It would appear yes, but that isn't necessarily a good thing. <br/><br/>What made Age of Ultron a ""must see"" for most is the simple fact that it comprises of characters we've had to watch in separate films. It was just the thrill of seeing Iron Man and Thor, two stars of their own individual films, meet up once again! This was the selling point for the first Avengers, and clearly it has succeeded again. However this may have been ""milked"" as there were clearly some characters that were there just for the sake of it, without any real need or purpose to serve the plot. This could have been time better spent explaining the events that took place between Age of Ultron and the previous Marvel films. The performance of Paul Bettany and James Spader as their Vision and Ultron were absolutely amazing, but not enough to justify the excessive final battle scenes. <br/><br/>After the first Avengers, the individual character story lines about the Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye seemed to compensate for the lack of character depth (seeing as the other Avengers all have their own movies). However, this I felt was again excessive. As a sequel, Age of Ultron avoids the (necessary) burden of having to spend the first half of a movie developing its characters. Without revealing too much, it seems that the movie jumps straight into the plot ""for the sake of it"", just because it can. <br/><br/>In summary : Good cameos, great additions to the cast, but poor development, cliché sideline stories and fight scenes that seem to have lost their charm. Not to mention unanswered questions between the two Avengers movies, as well as the other Phase 2 movies. And to make it matters worse, nothing more than a slightly anti-climatic mid-credit scene."
"bononista","10","3","11","28 April 2015"," Why are so many characters with lines listed as ""uncredited""
","I love the film, and I love the complexity. I think the Agents of SHIELD ep just prior to the film's release needs to be seen before the film. I'm confused as to why on IMDb there are actors and actresses with lines in the film who are in the ""uncredited"" section. I will be watching this film dozens of times to look at ever piece that relates to the previous films, Agents of SHIELD, and upcoming stories. It would be nice if movie theaters would play the lead in (last two SHIELD episodes as a pre-film help or anyone who is lost at the beginning of the film). I'm a bit confused as to why Marvel is tying this film to ones coming out in 2017 and 2019 though,... that's very difficult to keep sorted."

","The visual effects in the film were phenomenal, there was a minute or so at the beginning that felt a little off, but I think that was just me. After that the battle scenes were amazing, in my opinion second to none in comic films, it was as beautiful to watch as the action in say ""Edge Of Tomorrow"". There was some scenes that seem so flawlessly made that they could easily pull off being real life events. Stand out effects for me was the Hulkbuster and Ultron, both were amazing to see, especially Ultron the range of emotions shown by a completely robotic humanoid made the character that extra bit disturbing.<br/><br/>As for the characters and cast, which at this point due to longevity have become one in the same really, by that I mean when I think about the characters I envision them as their live action selves and no longer their comic looks. All the returning cast are as good as they have been in previous instalments, except for Jeremy Renner, he was outstanding in his role as Clint he was really given the freedom to actually show emotion and his range as an actor. Was great to see him able to flex his acting chops, which I will be honest I was not sure he had. The biggest additions to the cast are Paul Bettany as Vision who was brilliant in what he done, but didn't have to do much due to being an emotionless android, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver his acting is as expected personally I find him to be a good actor who is really honing his skills in recent years, while his accent falters at times, it is a hard accent to pull off I find. Then we have Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff/Scarlett Witch, another extremely talented actress in my opinion, she was brilliant in this too, especially in the more emotionally driven scenes then we have James Spader as Ultron the most ominous audible villain I have heard in a LONG time, his voice just oozed evil and dominance I can say I finally understand the hype around his ability.<br/><br/>The action starts at an 11 in this film and only gets better, that's not to say that the story or characters miss out. The film has a solid story to it, but even more so, has some wonderful character development, you get to see sides of some characters we have not yet seen in the MCU. Really shapes up some big moments for the future of the franchise, some great moments, some gut wrenching, all together mashed into a brilliant story and progression to characters we all know and love.<br/><br/>The runtime does seem long beforehand, however, there is enough going on at every turn that you kind of forget how long you have been watching and that is a good thing. It's a 141 minute ride that doesn't feel as long as others that run this time.<br/><br/>Overall, I'd go as far as to say this is the best film in the MCU to date in my opinion, which I never thought I'd say due to my dying love for Avengers and Captain America The Winter Soldier. The film was an emotional ride from start to finish, filled with action, ass kicking, hilarious lines and character development second to none in the current MCU crop. If you are not currently into the whole superhero explosion we have had in recent years, I highly recommend starting with this or Captain America The Winter Soldier they perfectly personify the superhero world but also serve as ""everyday"" films if you will. Very happy to say Mr Joss Whedon goes out with a bang and certainly not a whimper, I'm already longing for the day he returns to the MCU in the future. I had extremely high expectations going into the film, came out with them shattered and then some, roll on Ant-Man!"

","Where do i start? First off, I've been a fan of Marvel since Iron Man in 2008. I wasn't into comics when i was a kid and the only superheros i knew were Superman, Batman, Hulk and Spiderman until Marvel started making movies, then i became a Marvel fanatic.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is Marvel's best movie to date, and one of the best movies that has been released in a long time. I was a bit sceptical of all the bad reviews saying they are too many characters, too much going on, and that the movie doesn't develop the characters that well. I am here to say that those are just lies from people who don't enjoy superhero movies or action movies. Now I'm going to do a bit more in depth about the movie which contain SPOILERS, so if you don't want to know, turn away now.<br/><br/>-------------------------SPOILERS BELOW-----------------------------<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron starts off like an Expendables movie, action everywhere, guns blazing, chaos everywhere and if finishes with a bang. If you enjoyed the avengers fighting each other in the first one(Iron Man vs Thor, Thor vs Hulk), then you'll love this one. We obviously see Iron Man vs Hulk but also we have a brief action scene with Iron Man and Captain America(which sets up the Civil War movie) The movie also develops on Black Widows dark past and also the life of Hawkeye who actually has a wife(pregnant)and 2 kids. <br/><br/>I'm not going to explain the whole movie because I'd literally be writing this for days if i were since the amount of action and awesomeness is in this movie but i can say this. Captain America: Civil War is going to be one hell of a movie. It sets up perfectly with the new avengers by the end of this film(War Machine, Falcon, Vision and Scarlet Witch).<br/><br/>The only bad thing about the movie for me, was the fact that Falcon didn't get any action. Now whether they are specifically keeping him for Civil War, i don't know, but i thought at the end, when they are evacuating people, I thought he would have a bit part like War Machine.<br/><br/>All in all its Marvels best movie to date, and if you're a fan of Marvel, Superheros or action films in general, you have to see this."

"dee.reid","10","2","6","27 May 2016"," The Age Of Ultron
","Joss Whedon returns to write and direct 2015's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" which is not in any way related to the critically acclaimed Marvel Comics comic book series ""Age of Ultron"" by Brian Michael Bendis, Bryan Hitch, Brandon Peterson, and Carlos Pacheco - except, of course, for the title ""Age of ""Ultron."" (As a side-note, I read this series before I ever saw the movie, which has a completely different story-line from Whedon's film.)<br/><br/>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" takes place three years after ""The Avengers"" (2012), in which the Avengers team of super-powered heroes - Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Dr. Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/The Black Widow (Scarlet Johansson), and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) - must Re-Assemble to combat Ultron (voiced by James Spader), a rogue artificial intelligence that was created by Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner in a good-willed, if mistaken, attempt to protect the Earth from all threats, human and extraterrestrial, and to create a world where the Avengers are no longer needed.<br/><br/>Of course, and in what is perhaps Marvel's attempt to one-up the similarly-themed ""Terminator"" franchise, Ultron - Marvel's version of Terminator's Skynet - comes to view humanity as a threat, and that the only way to truly achieve peace is to eliminate all human beings. So the Avengers, with newcomers, and twin mutants - Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and his sister Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) - go to work to try to stop the ego-maniacal and quickly evolving Ultron before it destroys all of humanity. (In another side-note, it is worth mentioning that the pairing of Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen here as siblings is really interesting since just one year before, they played husband and wife in 2014's ""Godzilla."")<br/><br/>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a superior sequel to ""The Avengers."" I've waited a year to see this movie and it didn't disappoint (much). I don't need to talk about the other performers because we've grown so accustomed to them already and we know who they are. And although strong supporting characters such as James Rhodes/War Machine (Don Cheadle) and Sam Wilson/The Falcon (Anthony Mackie) make small appearances here & there, the real star here (and the real reason to see this movie, period), for me, was the truly awesome James Spader as Ultron.<br/><br/>It is well-known that in the original comics, Ultron was actually the creation of Dr. Henry ""Hank"" Pym/Ant-Man/Giant-Man, and the maniacal robot harbored a murderous personal grudge against its creator in a bizarre twist on the so-called ""Oedipus Complex""; but here, he was created by Tony Stark and Dr. Bruce Banner. Ultron is also one of the greatest comic book villains of all time, and one of the few non-human characters to take that mantle. So although Spader himself never appears on-screen, he was quite menacing as Ultron, and with just his distinct voice alone, he was able to make Ultron a truly formidable adversary to the Avengers, with a darkly humorous personality to boot. His portrayal of this psychopathic robot from Hell is one of the better portrayals of superhero-movie villainy in recent years.<br/><br/>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was an exciting and action-packed entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe - which, of course, was one of the principal titles that would set up this year's ""Captain America: Civil War"" (2016).<br/><br/>10/10"
"ScourgetheDarkClaw","10","2","6","16 February 2016"," Love this film so much
","Best movie I've ever seen. The main antagonist is my favorite villain so far in the MCU, and Ultron was made even better by the fact he was voiced by James Spader, an actor who didn't even change his voice for the role. This was a movie that kept you guessing, and not even I could prepare for the climax. No wonder this series keeps moving in the place of where others have failed. Iron Man remains the best Avenger, and Vision, Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch are very welcome additions to the cast of characters. This is a must-see for those wanting a good movie (or one that leaves you on the edge of your seat), and one for those who love comic books."
"classicsoncall","7","2","6","22 January 2016"," ""How is humanity saved if it's not allowed to evolve?""
","Just as I was with ""4:Rise of the Silver Surfer"", it surprised me that the Marvel folks took another page out of the Star Trek play-book with their Avengers story here. In the Fantastic Four flick, the 'destroyer of planets' looked remarkably similar to a huge dust vortex from the TV series episode 'The Doomsday Machine' that was laying waste to entire worlds in it's path. In this film, the directive given Ultron by Tony Stark involves a global peacekeeping initiative, but it's programming strongly resembles a plan to do away with all imperfection. That's exactly what happened in the TV Star Trek episode ""The Changeling"", in which a hokey looking computer named NOMAD became determined to destroy anything that didn't meet squarely with it's self appointed definition of perfection. If Captain Kirk were involved in this story, he might have steered the Avengers to a plan that involved using logic to demonstrate that blowing stuff up was not a perfect solution.<br/><br/>Well if it's mind blowing action and special effects you're looking for you should get your fill here. Movies like this couldn't have been made even a decade ago but the march of time continues to produce effects on a larger and grander scale. I particularly liked Scarlet Witch's (Elizabeth Olsen) neuroelectric interfacing telekinesis, another way of explaining those spectacular red-bursts effectively used against the Ultron robotic army. The Vision character (Paul Bettany) distracted me somewhat; he looked like he might have stepped out of the pages of a Valiant comic and looked out of place here. It's probably just me.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the super-heroes, they performed admirably but somehow none of this seemed very fresh to me. The film got some mileage out of the Thor Hammer business and I had to stop and think about that elevator quip. And Stan Lee always entertains with his ubiquitous cameo, here claiming ""You're all not worthy"" to the core group as he's carried out on an overabundance of Grunhel's fleet liquor. For me, I guess it's the little things that get my attention instead of the mind numbing battle action."
"BoxOfficeKid","5","2","6","8 January 2016"," More into building up MCU rather than telling one story.
","Age of Ultron is many things: Enjoyable, okay, average but mainly, boring. A movie should tell one story, this one felt as it was establishing 3rd phase of the MCU expansion with Civil War, Infinity Wars etc. etc. The movie did not feel invested into telling a strong story, but more as building onto a franchise.<br/><br/>When I first heard about The Avengers (2012), I was very skeptical. multitudes of movies was made to create enough superheroes to assemble. Superheroes had become a mass production to fit into the release date of The Avengers. My gut feeling was wrong. It had memorable interactions, funny meetings and pzaz. It had one important thing AoU did not have: element of surprise.<br/><br/>How do these superheroes interact when met upon each other? How do they deal with each other? Yeah I was totally blown away by how much fun a doomsday superhero movie could be. The movie was big, but based in the very familiar setting of New York and witty interactions between the characters. AoU is in a random Eastern European setting without the wit. It has the burden of not having that element of surprise as the relationship between characters are established and familiar. Between battles, the nature of their relationship seem to be them seen loafing around in an awkward after-party. Which is the essence of this movie, it is just an intermission between greater movies.<br/><br/>With a sequel to a franchise, Whedon has the burden of making a movie that picks up from all the story lines left off after stand alone sequels between The Avengers and this movie. AoU must also be bigger and better than its predecessor and also fit into the future plans of phase 3 of MCU expansion. Then, what can a storyteller do in that setting? What freedom do a storyline have, being a part of this sequel major franchise machinery? With AoU, nothing it seems, as the movie paved way for bigger questions, rather than focusing on concluding AoU... Which makes this movie weak, as it is handled as an in-between movie to greater stories further down the road."
"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","7","2","6","3 October 2015"," Another year, another Marvel film, another Avengers movie.
","This was... entertaining at least, but Age of Ultron features some of the Hollywood toxins that plague several big budget productions today, from pointless comedic quips that add nothing to the story or characters, overuse of CGI that isn't the prettiest thing to look at, and a story so overloaded that it feels empty compared to what came before.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron wasn't Guardians of the Galaxy, certainly wasn't Marvel's Daredevil (the Netflix TV show), and didn't have nearly the same level of excitement as Captain America: The Winter Soldier let-alone the clear James-Bond- esque direction that movie went for. Ultron is its own thing even if that 'own thing' is from self-derived clichés of the genre Marvel has helped make as industry staples.<br/><br/>I do love the superhero genre in film, but Age of Ultron has all the clichés we've come to expect from it and doesn't take nearly as many risks as the first Iron Man film did. There was just no danger, nothing that stood out from what we've already seen in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. <br/><br/>Entertaining, but not substantial as a standalone film for the uninitiated. I'd recommend going onto Netflix and watching Marvel's Daredevil."
"brchthethird","8","2","6","10 September 2015"," A solid second outing for everyone's favorite superhero team
","When crafting a sequel to any movie, the goal is usually to make it bigger while still retaining the qualities that made people fall in love with the first one. On that alone, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON succeeds marvelously. While the action in THE AVENGERS was mostly confined to New York (at least the climax), ULTRON is more of a globe-hopping adventure. The banter between the team members is as funny as ever and, without the need to bring the team together this time, there was more time allotted to character development, particularly Hawkeye and Black Widow, who haven't had so much to do in the Marvel movies up to this point. Of course, with this expansion comes a handful of new characters to add to all the ones we're familiar with (and most of whom at least make a cameo). Chief among these is Ultron, a sneering villain whose personality is directly based on Stark's. There are also the twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who have a particular connection with Stark that sees them initially aligned with Ultron against the Avengers. To sum up all that's good with the film is quite easy: it's frickin' cool. A slightly more polished way to put this is that it delivers on the all of the witty repartee and CGI-enhanced action that we've come to expect from the MCU. However, there are a few points where it doesn't quite live up to its predecessor. First, the novelty of having the team together has worn off a bit. Second, while the increase in locations is appreciated, the narrative is somewhat more splintered and unwieldy than it possibly should have been. A lot of this has to do with some scenes which are setting up future adventures. Another big part of this has to do with the final action set-piece basically being a redux of the Battle of New York from the first AVENGERS. And, while Ultron is great as the villain always ready with a quip, his motivation remained as opaque and vague as Scarlet Witch's powers (summed up as ""weird""). It boils down to not being as streamlined nor as unique as what came before it. Still, none of this really negatively impacted my enjoyment. I was as eager to return to this world as anyone, and Joss Whedon surely didn't disappoint me."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","6","2","6","5 September 2015"," A mostly fun mess.
","Formulaic or not, it's undeniable what cultural impact The Avengers has had on the youngest generation of movie goers. Kids who were born in the Summer of '12 now claim the Avengers to be their favourite thing (source: my girlfriend's 3 year old nephew and his Hulk impersonations). I almost envy them for having such a planned web of movies to be nostalgic about in their teens. The closest thing I have is the long but more contained Harry Potter franchise, though I do pity their parents wallets when it comes to the eventual bulky boxsets. As the Marvel Cinematic Universe gets more and more crowded, so do their movies. Avengers: Age of Ultron has little room to breathe and is more-or-less a big stitched-together mess. A fun mess for the most part, but one that emits a consistent buzz of CGI, action sequences and fan service to the point where it's far too easy to become numb to the stakes as it goes along. <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first Avengers, by about a million times more than any other Marvel movie, but I think the novelty of the group hit its limit there. The most efficient part of Age of Ultron is Robert Downey Jr's sharp witted one-liners, the best his humour's been yet, and one that will almost definitely go over the heads of the film's young fans. I knew the Iron Man series hinged on his charisma, but this film is hanging firmly by that rope now. I don't know what they're going to do when he signs off. Meanwhile, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver are very poor additions to the clan and while I get the ideas behind Ultron, I could never get behind him to take him or his tried-and-tested plan seriously. If Whedon struggles to get enthused about this one, I don't see how I can be either. Easily beats Winter Soldier though. It's like a broken stained glass art with some shards I liked, some shards missing and some shards unpolished.<br/><br/>6/10"
"Wuchakk","8","2","6","2 August 2015"," Quality Superhero team flick, actually better than the first one
","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) is a quality superhero team movie. The first movie (2012) was so over-hyped that it was almost impossible NOT to be let down a little. It started good, but the set-up went on & on and wasn't overly absorbing, plus way too much time was spent on the SHIELD heli-carrier, which created a somewhat one-dimensional vibe; lastly, although Loki was a worthy villain, his army of Chitauri were stereotypically ee-vil, faceless villains who were basically just canon-fodder for the Avengers.<br/><br/>I like this one better because the ""origin"" element is out of the way and the setting isn't one-dimensional. There are numerous locations (England, Seoul, Bangladesh, South Africa and Italy), and additional characters like Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). Ultron (voiced by James Spader) makes a worthy villain and the over-the-top action sequences are balanced out by quality character bits, like the Black Widow/Hulk/Banner relationship. Furthermore, the third act delivers with the requisite earth-threatening crisis.<br/><br/>When I heard Olsen was going to play Scarlet Witch a couple of years ago I was disappointed because she definitely didn't have the curves to pull-off a woman like Scarlet Witch, but she obviously gained weight for the role and looks great. She has a striking face and is quite a convincing actress. Taylor-Johnson is fine as Quicksilver, but I can't help wondering why they didn't use Evan Peters, who played the character in 2014's ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" <br/><br/>There are so many quality superhero movies at this point that a new one is pretty much just more of the same. So ""Avengers 2"" creates a bit of a ""been-there-done-that"" vibe, but it's well done for what it is. What makes me grant it a fairly high rating, besides the positives already noted, are a couple of moving parts, the subplot about Thor's hammer and the revelation of another character in the third act that I wasn't expecting, which elicits a ""Wow"" reaction if you're familiar with the comic and even more so when you observe the tie-in to the aforementioned hammer.<br/><br/>Lastly, there's a lot to take in with ""Avengers 2,"" which makes it worthy of repeat viewings.<br/><br/>The film runs 141 minutes.<br/><br/>GRADE: A-"

And suddenly Hawkeye is out of the picture with a family? And I can't believe Black Widow would be so vulnerable about her feelings, or care that she can't have children. She's tough, it's such a 180. 2. No Loki. The villain Ultron was lame and not a threat. He's just a machine. 3. Less funny from Iron Man, who seems like a douche.

","In my opinion, The Avengers (2012) was one of the best movies ever. If you disagree with me, you are an idiot.<br/><br/>I watched The Avengers (2012) while on a plane and deeply regretted not watching it in a cinema instead, because it was so focking awesome. After landing, I got a digital copy of it (through entirely legal means of course) and watched it about 10 times within a two- week span. I ALSO proceeded to watch ALL the previous MCU movies, none of which came close to being as awesome as The Avengers, although some (such as the very first Iron Man) were very damn good.<br/><br/>I vowed that I would pay to watch ALL sequels to The Avengers in a proper cinema. I also forecast that the series of Avengers movies would be the best/greatest/awesomest trilogy (or quadrilogy) of all time.<br/><br/>So imagine my disappointment when, three years later (i.e. today), I had to sit through 2+ hours of an utterly pedestrian superhero movie. I felt like crying when, after random things blew up and rocks flew around and they went to ""The New Avengers Facility"", I realized the movie was coming to an end. <br/><br/>Because you deeply value my opinion, here are my rankings for the 11 MCU movies released so far (as of May/June 2015):<br/><br/>#1 Avengers 1 A++ One of the best movies ever #2 Iron Man A+ #3 Captain America 2 A #4 Guardians of the Galaxy A #5 Iron Man 2 A (unlike most, I actually liked this) #6 Thor 2 A-<br/><br/>#7-#10 B+ (Run-of-the-mill, predictable superhero movies) The Incredible Hulk Thor 1 Captain America 1 Avengers 2<br/><br/>#11 Iron Man 3 B- Total Scheiβe (compared to most of the other MCU movies).

","Every movie Marvel had put it had been just one tough act to follow again and again, but somehow they always out do themselves! Downey Jr., Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Renner, Johannson are all back for the new installment. It's their great reunited team since 2012's ""The Avengers"". What makes this different from that first ""Avengers"" movie is that when we open up in this one with a bad ass scene is that everyone's strengths and abilities are helpful towards one another. They are an actual team that can work together and fight together. You truly get to see what makes each and every one of them a kick ass superhero! That's right, even Jeremy Renners Hawkeye! Marvel finally gave him some screen time and actual great stuff to do here. As far as other stars we got Aaron Taylor- Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen playing as Maximof twins, trained to be henchmen of Hydra but eventually become under Ultron wing, played by the amazing James Spader. Once James Spader's Ultron starts causing havoc, it's not only The Avengers strongest physical threat, but mentally. Adding the Maximof towns to this story was great because with their powers and wit, they manage to really make The Avengers face and think of their worst fears. Hallucinations and mind control and super speed, that's a hell of a henchmen team. There's a point in the movie when The Avengers have to hideout and not be on Ultrons radar, and for me that scene is when things were kicking off. There's a ton of drama in there and conflicts and still plenty of surprises about The Avengers talk about why they do what they do, and maybe some stuff in there which some of them take a negative feeling to what powers they have or not able to feel completed in life. What I've been hearing a ton lately is that the movie is too jokey in some parts, often too destructive, and just flat out too loud. I'm just gonna say some things to make up for what people have said. Is it jokey? - Why yes of course it is you can have humor so you can balance out the dark stuff that may be in there. Is it too destructive?- The threat is bigger so you'd understand why the spectacle is there, but it never goes the ""Transformers"" route where there is just unnecessary damage and death everywhere. A lot of fans walked into this film with the expectation from its very sad dopey trailer that this was gonna be like ""The Dark Knight"" almost. Is it ""The Dark Knight""? No it shouldn't have to be, it's got everything in place to be where it can be a little dark and fun. It's really not like totally for kids. All the emotional and tense stuff is balanced just right and this what I expected it to be! Also when a scene is tense, it's really tense! You can't always walk into a movie expecting it to be just exactly like the trailer, well on some conditions Maybe you can but overall just go on there with an open mind and enjoy yourself, I don't see how you couldn't, like Ultron says, ""Oh for Gods sake!"" It's ""The Avengers""! It's a punch a minute, a laugh a minute, ugh it's what you want for an ""Avengers"" flick! It's what I mentioned at the beginning, Marvel outdoing their selfs with every film. And yes, Marvel's ""Avengers:Age Of Ultron"" is so far they're best adventure to date, unless July's ""Ant-Man"" can knock it off the top rank. What's funny about that comparison is that I'm serious, it could, Marvel is just THAT good."

","Many people are disliking the movie for the wrong reasons. If you are not a movie elitist who likes to say things such as ""Hollywood is ruining movies"" or ""there are too many superhero movies today"", you will most likely walk away entertained by this movie.<br/><br/>The central cast is yet again great here. Whedon is clearly the man, when it comes to writing and directing an Avengers movie (although I do have high hopes for the Russo brothers). The dialogue and interactions between the main cast is excellent and the actors have great chemistry with each other.<br/><br/>Ultron might be an understandable let down for some, but for me he was an excellent villain. The trailer painted him as a totally menacing and scary robot, but that is not the case here. The best way to describe him is that Ultron, is essentially an evil and robotic version of Tony Stark. He has many one-liners which makes him a very funny villain to watch, but he still does evil things. James Spader was the perfect actor to give voice to this iconic comic book foe. <br/><br/>A common and strange critique against this movie is the romance angle. It takes at most 5 minutes of the total movie length and it raises the question if The Avengers can have normal lives. This did not bother me at all.<br/><br/>The movie did have ACTUAL problems though. One of which was the abundance of action scenes. Don't get me wrong, they were all very well done, but there were too many of them, which left little room for more character interactions like the ones from the previous Avengers movie. Also, Nick Fury should have died in Captain America: Winter Soldier. His presence here was too long and he contributed to a very annoying deus ex-machina moment. There are also many plot holes in the movie, which will lead a lot of people questioning what is going on. Age of Ultron also had too many story lines too jumble, which could bother a lot of people (especially if they are not up to speed with the comics).<br/><br/>Overall Age of Ultron is a solid superhero movie. It is not as good as the first one, but it is not bad either. I watched the movie twice and I did not regret a single euro spent."
"The-Sarkologist","7","2","6","17 May 2015"," Starting to get a little dry
","I must admit that for all of the hype that was leading up to this film I didn't feel that it came out all that great. Maybe it is that I have never really liked superhero movies, though some of the Marvel Universe offerings have been pretty good. However, all I can say is that this one was okay. I guess there is only so many times that you can have a bunch of superheroes get together and start beating up bad guys. Also, when you have a bunch of superheroes collaborating then you must have something pretty bad to send them up against because, well, they are superheroes so they tend to stand out from the crowd anyway, and your typical petty criminal generally can't stand up to them.<br/><br/>I guess Wheldon had a real task in bringing this film together since not only was he trying to bring together a number of strands from the Iron Man, Thor, and Captain America story lines, he is also trying to work with three major characters as well and giving them the screen time that affords their character is difficult at best. Personally, I'm not sure if he managed to do it all that well, though unlike the previous installment, Iron Man wasn't dominating the action this time.<br/><br/>However, while we had Hydra from the Captain America films, and the infinity stones from Thor, the Iron Man story line seemed to dominate. Loki, who had a major part in the first film, does not make an appearance, and Hydra is shut down pretty quickly. Instead we have Iron Man and his buddy Bruce Banner sitting down to create this super artificial intelligence to bring peace to the world. As can be expected with most (okay all) experiments with artificial intelligence in Hollywood films, this one goes off with his own idea as to how he is going to bring peace to the world.<br/><br/>Mind you, I didn't necessarily hate this film, it was just that it didn't really meet my expectations. I probably should have learnt my lesson by now that if I anticipate a film too much then it is going to disappoint me. I probably should also mention that the tie ins with the other films can also be problematic at best, namely because you may need to remember things from the previous films to be able to understand parts of this film. Okay, it does work as a stand-alone, however a part of me feels that unless you have seen the Captain America, Thor, and Iron Man films you may be a little lost, and also a little confused as to why these guys are working together. While it may still be an enjoyable movie if you come in at this late stage in the series, you may need to go back to the beginning to get an idea of what brought them up to this point."
"magdimahgoub","8","2","6","15 May 2015"," An entertaining, if messy, Avenging adventure
","https://freeglader.wordpress.com/2015/05/04/avengers-age-of-ultron/<br/><br/>From the get-go the film throws its viewership straight into the action (where we remain for the most part), weaving through an intensely choreographed fight scene trying as it might to feature each of its heroes in equal measure. There's Captain America throwing his shield, Thor spinning his hammer, Hulk smashing, and so on, typically showing off the team 'on a good day' (climaxing at a particularly exciting slow motion shot of said team leaping into the fray). This high octane pace rarely slows, and though the action sequences often feel very crowded, they still manage to be enjoyable rather than overwhelming, even if it's more difficult to watch the individual heroes doing their thing as in the first Avengers film.<br/><br/>The film is, of course, centered around the titular character – Ultron, derived with some jiggery-pokery from Loki's staff (yep, that old thing), he is an AI gone wrong, unable to tell the difference between destroying humanity and saving it (peace either way, right?). But if you were expecting evil death robot #232 think again, this Ultron isn't so much doom and gloom as hitting off one liners at a similar rate to the protagonists, James Spader masterfully voicing him as another character rather than a malfunctioning droid. Of course, with this it can be argued that he loses much of his menace, being more of a comedy bad guy than a legitimate threat (not helped by the fact he gets bashed around by the protagonists constantly), but considering the amount of emotionless world- ending antagonists we get in robotic form, it's quite refreshing to have one with a personality.<br/><br/>Two other new characters are introduced in the film as well, Wanda and Pietro Maximoff, played by Eizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson respectively. They are known more recognizably as Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver (""He's fast and she's weird"", as it was put in the film), who bring an interesting dynamic as two 'enhanced' (saying mutant is punishable by death, as made clear by multiple contracts between Fox and Marvel) people capable of fighting the Avengers with a more varied set of skills (as fun as a living Iron Man suit big bad robot is), Scarlet Witch using her 'mind control' power to induce a dream state on several of the protagonists, creating a very memorable sequence.<br/><br/>However, Age of Ultron is definitely not without its flaws, these mainly revolving around a somewhat messy and disjointed story. Though it can be felt in some of the more chaotic fight scenes, this lack of cogency is exemplified by a certain section wherein Thor flies off and does something almost totally irrelevant to the main plot, with little to no explanation, resulting in nothing more than sequel baiting while the rest of the film carried on. This contrasts deeply with the first Avengers film, which was focused and clear throughout, while this film feels very much like it has strings attached (whatever Ultron may have you believe), those being the various stories of the Marvel Universe and the overarching build up to the inevitable films that will follow. That said, the small momentum lost by such asides is not overly painful and they are quickly forgotten as soon as the main plot gets back on screen.<br/><br/>Interestingly for a movie that barely stops for breath, some of the slower and less action-packed parts are in fact the highlights, both very funny and offering character development which is usually a rarer find in superhero movies. Aside from the one-liners, Whedon manages to create some interesting character dynamics, be it Robert Downey Jr. and Mark Ruffalo's ""mad scientist"" duo as Tony Stark and Bruce Banner, or perhaps more interestingly Banner and Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) romantic sub-plot, which at times touches on more mature themes than a Marvel film is used to. Yet despite all this, the star of the show in terms of character development may well be the much maligned Hawkeye (played by Jeremy Renner), who spent most of the first movie as a brainwashed zombie type fella, and was otherwise a seemingly superfluous member of the team picking off a few bad guys with a bow and arrow of all things. This time Hawkeye gets a fair bit of screen time and uses it well (even picking up on the absurdity of, not only the plot, but the fact he has a bow), and it seems likely he'll be a fan favourite from here on in.<br/><br/>All in all, Age of Ultron is a huge film. Unlike its predecessor it spans four continents, giving it a truly global feel, and is so jam packed with heroes and villains it almost splits at its seams (the planned extended home release suggests there is even more, if that can be believed). And though it might be 'a bit much' at times, it offers spectacle so far unmatched in Marvel's cinematic outings, and blow for blow probably exceeds the first Avengers film in terms of enjoyment – even if Marvel's future offerings only reach as high as this movie manages, we're still in for a treat."
"tomgillespie2002","7","2","6","8 May 2015"," Riotously entertaining, but Marvel need to change their formula
","With the Marvel Cinematic Universe growing increasingly larger every year, returning director Joss Whedon was faced with an even more monumental task than he did in 2012 with The Avengers, the movie that finally brought together the superhero collection of huge personalities united by one goal, but each wanting to go about it in their own way. Each standalone film has developed key supporting players necessary to the character whose name is on the poster, and with The Avengers' climax allowing its Earthlings to gaze into a wormhole and last year's Guardians of the Galaxy unleashing aliens a-plenty, Marvel's world has truly become a universe.<br/><br/>The last time a director returned for a Marvel sequel, we ended up with Jon Favreau's Iron Man 2 (2010), a messy let-down of a film that lacked invention, to the point that it felt like the guy behind the camera had lost all interest by the end. In a way, Age of Ultron suffers from some of the same problems. Like all Marvel films, it pits it's leads against a 'new threat', climaxing with a battle in the air that features lots of punches, blasts and quips. But for all it's narrative familiarity, Whedon still finds new ways for his heroes to batter their opponents, keeping the jokes fresh and genuinely witty, and ensuring the ragtag, flawed bunch are always eager to be at each other throats (quite literally - I think every character is grabbed by the throat at some point).<br/><br/>Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is still suffering from nightmares and flashbacks of his journey through the wormhole and seeing the threats lurking amongst the stars. He and the Avengers, now led by Captain America (Chris Evans), attack the Hydra outpost of Baron von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), the monocled Nazy glimpsed at the end of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) in possession of Loki's scepter. Von Strucker's defences are useless when faced by the Avengers, but that is until he unleashes the twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen); the former possessing super-speed, and the latter able to enter people's mind and unleashing their darkest fear. When Wanda screws with Stark, he sees his friends dead, powerless to stop it. She is like the ultimate bum acid trip.<br/><br/>After retrieving the scepter, Stark and Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) discover an artificial intelligence hidden inside, and use it to kick-start the Ultron program, an independent-thinking army of robots designed to protect Earth from any threats, allowing the Avengers to retire in the process. But Ultron (wonderfully voiced by James Spader), having consumed huge amounts of data through the internet within seconds of being activate, concludes that the only way to save the planet is to eliminate the one's responsible for slowly destroying it - humanity. Upon discovering what Stark has created, Captain America and Thor (Chris Hemsworth) are furious. And so are the public, who are terrified with the amount of carnage taking place around them as Ultron journeys to Africa in search of vibranium, the near-invincible metal that will allow him to create the ultimate body.<br/><br/>On top of the character's already mentioned, the Avengers also consist of Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner. Add to the mix the returning Don Cheadle, Anthony Mackie, Samuel L. Jackson, Cobie Smulders, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba and Paul Bettany - who appears in the flesh for the first time as the Vision - as well as newcomers Linda Cardellini and Andy Serkis, and you have one hell of a hefty line- up. Whedon has juggled large ensemble's before with the tragically cancelled Firefly and it's follow-up movie Serenity (2005), as well as the first Avengers, but he has a noticeably weaker grip on his cast this time around. It jumps from one action scene to another, slightly smothering the quieter scenes in between, failing to allow them to breathe and flow.<br/><br/>The one exception involves a welcome retreat for the Avengers, who choose to lay-low at Hawkeye's (Renner) humble abode after causing more chaos with Ultron. Clearly feeling guilty at the shoddy deal Hawkeye got last time around, who spent most of the movie controlled by Loki, Whedon has finally made him interesting. He acknowledges his inferiority when compared an unstoppable green monster and the God of Thunder, and even comments on the lunacy of fighting off an army of killer robots with a bow and arrow. His warm relationship with his wife (Cardellini) and his children, as well as his various personal face-off's with Pietro, provide a human connection in the midst of a 90 year-old super soldier and a millionaire playboy genius.<br/><br/>With Marvel's Phase Three almost upon us (once Ant-Man is finally released later this year), Age of Ultron was always in danger of being little more than a stepping-stone to what's to come. Yet although it certainly hints at upcoming characters (the fictional country of Wakanda, home of the Black Panther, is mentioned) and future events (Thor is troubled by his Wanda-induced apocalyptic visions, which are to take place in Thor: Ragnarok (due 2017)), it also moves the story forward and evolves its characters. Marvel certainly needs to change its formula though (the paranoid thriller twist on The Winter Soldier was a stroke of genius); the smash-heavy climaxes have become tired. Ultron is also not really the threat he was set-up to be, but he's utterly electric when on screen, Spader providing a biting wit to his growls. It is far for perfect, and inferior to its predecessor, but riotously entertaining throughout."
"Sebastianostlund","7","2","6","12 May 2015"," Weaker wrap up to the weaker phase 2
","I saw all the movies building up to the long awaited Avengers and i was so hyped to see it and it did not disappoint, it was one of the funniest movie going experience in my life! And then phase 2 happened...<br/><br/>Phase 2 started of with the very very disappointing Iron Man 3... I really hate that movie, it's a mess and it destroyed everything that i love with Iron Man... 2/10<br/><br/>And then came Thor 2... also a very disappointing movie, it was okay but it has one of the worst scenes i have ever seen i a movie ever and i almost walked out from the theater but thankfully it ended and the movie became a little better... 5/10<br/><br/>The third movie in phase 2 was Captain America 2 and finally there was a movie in this phase that was better then it's predecessor and still in my opinion the best movie in phase 2... 9/10<br/><br/>But then came Guardians of the galaxy... i know that a lot of people really liked this movie, but i am not one of them. The movie is okay and i actually really liked the first half of it, but after they escape the prison the movie becomes a bad comedy and i really did not like the ending, it was stupid... 5/10<br/><br/>And now to wrap up phase 2 we got Avengers 2... my expectations for this movie wasn't to high after all the disappointing movies leading up to it , but the movie was actually an okay follow up to the first one but there are somethings that bothered me...<br/><br/>1. In the end of Iron Man 3 Tony Stark destroys all of his Iron Man suits and said he would stop being a hero (or something like that it was a long time since i saw it) but Iron Man is back in action like that never happened (i wish that it never happened) <br/><br/>2. The creation of Ultron... what creation of Ultron? If you blink you miss it, it was really bad... But i liked Ultron as a villain and i liked his motivation for doing what he wanted to do. <br/><br/>3. The romance between Hulk and Black Widow came out of nowhere and that made me not caring about it...<br/><br/>4. Thors ""sidemission"" to build up for Thor 3 did not fit in the movie at all, it felt like it was taken from another movie and just got thrown in there...<br/><br/>5. The twins was to underdeveloped so i did not care about them either... if they had got a movie before this so that we would get to know them, maybe the death of Quicksilver would have been effective but now it did not work for me...<br/><br/>But there was good things in the movie to, the action scenes were awesome! Better then in the first movie in my opinion and seeing the Avengers back together was great. The story was functional and i liked that Hawkeye got more screen time in this one and that we got to know him a little bit more. Captain America now feels like a leader of the group and he had the best action scenes. Even tough they did not explain why Tony Stark is Iron Man again i really liked him in the movie, he is the most interesting character of them all. I liked that Bruce Banner is starting to lose control over his Hulk side, it makes him much more interesting since your all ways on the edge of your seat to see if he will lose his temper and Hulkout. <br/><br/>After all i had a great time in the theater but it wasn't as good as the first one and i feel that i am starting to lose interest in all these superhero movies, sadly... but i will see all the movies in phase 3 as well but i won't see them all in theater... Avengers: Age Of Ultron gets a 7/10"
"scorpiotd","7","2","6","12 May 2015"," This was an awesome movie
","This movie is great. I love the action especially when Iron Man fought Hulk. But seriously, Black Widow and Hulk have nothing in common other than the fact that they work well together. Also, Thor is a jerk.<br/><br/>Stan Lee's cameo was funny but it also didn't make sense. He said ""Excelsior"" just for drinking too much alcohol. <br/><br/>Vision seemed like a show-off when he picked up Thor's hammer for no reason. And for Captain America, in the movie, when the options are fight or flight, he picks flight. He was way cooler in The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>I like that we got to see more of Hawkeye's character in this film. And Black Widow. so yeah great movie"
"jpkwolf","8","2","6","12 May 2015"," Really entertaining sequel with small flaws (Also minor spoilers in the review)
","I might have actually enjoyed this sequel more than the first Avengers film. Somehow it doesn't feel as polished though with Visions sudden appearance at the end being one of the pacing problems. Apparently almost 30 minutes ended up on the cutting room floor to avoid the movie being too long. That sadly slightly shows. Also there's a limit to Whedon style witty banter and I think the limit was reached here. It's fitting for Iron Man but now every character is doing it constantly making the movie almost feel like half comedy. Pacing of the movie also suffers when the movie is forced to set up the next films, Captain America: Civil War and Avengers 3.<br/><br/>The action is spectacular as always, Iron Man vs Hulk being one of the highlights with the final battle. The charismatic actors work well together and there's actually some proper character development. Whedon knows how to give every character enough screen time and scenes. Age of Ultron is a great sequel that lives up to the demands of the audience and the first film, although there are almost too many characters now. The sequels will have really hard time balancing so many characters when there's even more to come."
"oliver_fan","8","2","6","11 May 2015"," Worth to see
","After seeing the film, the first thing I felt was that the it was not only just about the avengers , it also built a way to The Captain America 3, and the next Avengers. The content, which made me nervous and excited all the movie time, was really brilliant. The whole film was divided into several climaxes and the most exciting part, in my opinion, was the ""island in the sky"". Although it was the one of the exciting films I have ever seen, there was still something needed improving. The film was not so coherent as the last one I saw, all I remembered was groups of people fighting with each other. Besides, I thought the BOSS, Ultron, was so vulnerable in my view, but it still took them a very long time to take him down. Anyway,it is a fantastic movie as I thought, and it is worthy of watching."
"simon-21729","7","2","6","10 May 2015"," Familiar...But Still Fun (For Now)
","There are a number of negative stances that one could take against The Avengers: Age of Ultron. You could argue that the film is repetitive and derivative, given that the Marvel factory has been reliably pumping out both tonally and visually similar films for the last half-decade. Any uniqueness that director Joss Whedon brought to the first Avengers installment feels comfortingly familiar rather than fresh and exciting. In particular, the action sequences have a been there, done that vibe to them. Rather than fighting endless waves of anonymous aliens, the Avengers now battle against endless waves of anonymous robots. Eventually there becomes a point of diminishing returns on seeing the heroes smash apart their opponents over and over again.<br/><br/>You could argue that the film feels overstuffed, even more so than its predecessor. In addition to servicing the six returning Avengers, the film also introduces the Maximoff twins (Quickslilver and Scarlet Witch, although never referred to by those aliases), as well as the villainous Ultron. That makes nine characters that have at least a minimal story arc, which could easily the film a bit too thin. In addition, time is also given to the numerous cameos from within the ever-expanding Marvel universe. The more characters and plot points that are touched upon, the more difficult it becomes to muster the energy to care.<br/><br/>Or you could argue that Age of Ultron isn't even really a film at all. Instead, it's merely a $300 million advertisement for future Marvel cinematic efforts. Anyone who pays attention to the endless superhero movie news cycle knows that the entire franchise is building towards the two-part Avengers 3. You could be forgiven in the lead-up to Age of Ultron for considering the film to be somewhat of an afterthought, and simply a prelude to the screen shattering Infinity War storyline that those two films will explore. Even within Age of Ultron it is made clear, through a muddled Thor storyline, that the real threat for the Avengers is yet to come. Understandably, Marvel likes having a five-year plan to ensure that riches continue to flow in. But the focus on the future has been to the detriment of the here and now.<br/><br/>All of the criticisms that are outlined above are hard to ignore. However, Age of Ultron manages to somewhat overcome them, and provide an enjoyable cinematic experience. Despite bringing nothing new to the table, the film still provides the fun that people loved about the first Avengers film. The climactic battle sequence does wear out its welcome eventually, but it is still exciting to see the heroes doing what they do best. The film's many characters are as much an advantage as a disadvantage. By this point everyone knows which Avengers they care about and which they don't. You're bored by the Hulk and Black Widow's blossoming romance? Well, don't worry the film only has time to develop the relationship over a few scenes. You don't care about Hawkeye's back-story and motivation? Well just wait a couple of minutes and we'll get back to the witty banter between Iron Man and Captain America. By having developed most of these characters previously, Age of Ultron can get away with divvying up the screen time almost equally, and not focusing on any character in particular.<br/><br/>The real strength of Age of Ultron, besides its world-class visual effects, is its characters. The reason this film works at all is because almost every actor performs with enough charisma to take over the screen, even when saddled with underwhelming material. Scarlett Johansson has never been particularly challenged by the part of Black Widow, but she makes the character more than simply the token female hero. Chris Evans takes a blander than bland character in Captain America and somehow makes him interesting. Robert Downey Jr. seems to inhabit the Iron Man character too well, to the point where it feels as if he's performing in his sleep. Even with limited screen time Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are able to convincingly bring Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch to life. There are no weak links among the core cast, which helps to cover up many of the film's issues.<br/><br/>For people who love, like, or merely tolerate the Avengers saga, Age of Ultron provides more of the same. Fun character moments are interspersed with exciting action sequences. The trademark Whedon banter is present in full force, and makes many scenes zip along at a quick pace. But the Marvel formula is being stretched to its breaking point, and that is more apparent than ever in this newest film. With Age of Ultron familiarity still brings enjoyment, but unless a shake up is made soon that same familiarity will soon lead to disinterest."
"under-represented","5","2","6","8 May 2015"," How many time can you watch same plot with different one-liners?
","Avengers 2 is same plot in a new movie. It has the same moral of teamwork and same glowing object at its center which is part mystery and part plot-convenience. But of course that's not important because avenger movies are about some awesome fight scenes. The same kind of scenes for which we abhor Michael Bay movies. But if you ask me I can't tell who's director when a giant person fights another giant person in the middle of the city and crush it into rubble . No matter if its color is green or metallic red. I was kind of done with destruction porn somewhere between Man of Steel and watching it again makes me cringe. The single good thing was addition of new superheroes whose powers looked cool for first few use.<br/><br/>If we leave that part aside there is noting to say much. A ""meh"" love story buildup. A simple plot which tries to be complex by hiding behind technicality. Some OK one-liners, that can make you chuckle (they had no power on me) And that's about it.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to know how many times can Marvel work the same formula? How many times people can watch same plot with different one-liners. For me, this was the last time."
"brent_or","6","2","6","7 May 2015"," Enjoyable Spectacle But Messy, Step Down
","My opinion is certainly no more valid than anyone else's but I think that most reviewers, especially the professional critics, have been far too generous towards this film. Like almost any blockbuster it is a lot of fun as pure spectacle, and like any Marvel Studios film it is full of details to delight fans. But as a film, it is a step down from the first Avengers and one of the weaker films in the series so far.<br/><br/>The overall feeling is one of a rough draft. The visual effects in the opening sequence displayed some of the worst CGI integration that I have seen in a long time in a Marvel film, at least in 2D. Did they need more time to render the graphics? The dialogue could also have used a few more rounds of revision, as the jokes that landed in the previous film often failed to do so in this one. In a couple of instances, they were even in poor taste, very uncharacteristic. Prima Nocta? Really?<br/><br/>It is easy to complain about too many characters, but really the issue here is too many stories. One can see all of the different angles, but a tighter focus and better editing could have improved the flow of the film as a whole. It sounds as though there was a lot of arguing between the director and the studio over what to include in the theatrical cut, and it shows in the end result.<br/><br/>The single big letdown, however, is the villain Ultron. Long story short, the intense, chilling character in the advance trailers is not really present in the film. Instead, we get a poorly-realized villain throwing around witty one-liners like everyone else. This tonal approach undermines the effectiveness of the character. Age of Ultron needed to focus tightly on its titular antagonist, to make him an iconic foil. Ultimately, this film becomes another battle against a generic and faceless army. And there goes the chance to improve upon the first Avengers film. Very disappointing.<br/><br/>All of that being said, this film is certainly worth the money to spend a couple of hours escaping into the world of these superheroes. The cast is once again excellent (aside from Jeremy Renner, who I have never connected with as Hawkeye) and the new characters are a lot of fun and bring a freshness that this franchise desperately needed. There is plenty of eye candy in terms of costumes and technology, and the Hulkbuster fight is truly fantastic.<br/><br/>It will be interesting to see the rumored extended cut of this film. It may be quite a bit better than the theatrical version of this film, but I think that the latter could have been much better without any additional running time. This film, fun as it is, bears the hallmarks of a troubled production with a divided creative vision. It seems that the Marvel machine still has some kinks to work out. Recommended, but not as glowingly as one would hope to be able to."
"jonmacdonald81","7","2","6","7 May 2015"," Good action movie for new audiences, not for the Marvel Fanboy..
","I was very conflicted with my opinion of this movie. The plot was well done, the existing stellar Avengers cast with addition top James Spader providing the perfect voice for Ultron performed nicely as to be expected, the CGI was phenomenal, the movie was packed with good action/ fight scenes, and I didn't find myself losing interest once during a film exceeding 2 hours.<br/><br/>The above states my reason for the 7/10 rating, the below are is my critique to Joss and Marvel in defence to all the Fanboys whom have been saying ""Make mine Marvel"" for generations.<br/><br/>As a fan of the Marvel comic book, witch may only be a portion of the audience of these Big screen films, but witch is the core fan base who's support has kept Marvel in Business since for over 50 years which there would be no Avengers or Marvel franchises period without it really bugs me when writers and directors feel the need to change major parts of the Marvel universes such as character origins. If film creators want full creative control they should stick to original content films. I really wish Marvel would keep stricter control and consistency on this stuff. A few examples, Ultron was created by Ant-man not Iron Man. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver have powers because they are the Mutant children of Magneto not because of some experimentation with a mystical gem by some Hydra mad scientist.. Which is inconsistent with the real Quicksilver we were recently introduced to in X-Men: DOFP. Quicksilver a loved character of Avengers and X-Men title fans for generations was killed off in his debut appearance on the Avengers team...<br/><br/>Also, with so many characters there wasn't time for character development outside of Hawk-eye and slightly with Black Widow. They started a love interest between Bruce Banner and Black Widow but didn't have enough time to properly do anything with. We got introduced to 3 well casts interesting characters in the twins and I'll get to Vision but didn't see enough from them or any development other then going from the villain to hero side with the flip of a switch, and if they had to make the mistake of killing Quicksilver why didn't we see more of his sister coping with it in the final aftermath scenes. We just didn't get to know a thing about vision outside him being a cyborg that flies and can hold Thor's Hammer. Why even pop in falcon for a 1 second appearance at the end.. Also I don't mind some humour and 1 liners in the heat of battle which is the Marvel way but this movie was overloaded with it especially coming from the supposedly cold evil robot main villain, Ultron should of been darker."

","That's really the easiest and best way to put it. This is certainly not the worst MCU film, but it is far from the best and not the avengers sequel most were hoping for. First off, so much care and attention has gone into releasing this films in an intricate timeline, yet plays as just a sequel to avengers caring very little for the various stand alone films and the TV show. Between avengers 1 & 2, iron man, thor, & cap USA have had there own movies and 40+ episodes of AOS, yet very little is mentioned about these things. We don't see how chummy Cap and widow have become, or a mention of starks PTSD. Better example: for 10 + episodes AOS have been building up InHumans and Baron Strucker ""testing"" certain people (the twins) yet you don't use this incredible already developed back story to further both this film, AOS, or the future InHuman movie. Despite the fact that you've already tied this movie into the last 2 eps of AOS s2.<br/><br/>It comes as no surprise to now hear of Whedon's displeasure with studio notes and interference. Whether you live or hate the movie, it is clear that this just doesn't feel like Whedon, it feels like someone telling Whedon to make a Whedon film. 2 of Whedon's trademarks are his dialogue and jokes, both of which are clunky in this film. Jokes you can tell Whedon wouldn't think are funny are somehow in the movie. The most obvious examples are the Thor pool scene and Hawkeyes home, which should have been omitted and extended respectfully. Behind the scenes a combination of (whedon) being burnt out and studio notes have obviously made this film suffer unnecessarily. <br/><br/>But the biggest problem of all is Ultron himself. Always Whedon's Achilles heel has been his inability to build formidable and believable villains, but Ultron is possibly his worst attempt, which is a shame considering how dangerous and formidable he was in the books and should've been on film. No time is devoted to developing him at all, it's literally, he's born and then there's hundreds of him, seemingly out of nowhere, with maybe 30 seconds devoted to building his army. For God's sake he's the smartest most sophisticated A I ever conceived (save for Jarvis) and his evil plan involves a meteor and not something nuclear connected to a mainframe? That's nonsensical. In avengers 1 we get an alien army complete with giant metal worms led by Loki that took all 6 avengers to stop. Here we get an army of ultron, from nowhere, when let's be honest, vision and scarlet witch could have easily defeated all the ultron robots by themselves. In addition not enough time is spent on the twins either, made even worse by their AOS tie in that should've been.<br/><br/>All that said, I still found this movie entertaining and rewatchable (I've watched twice before writing this), but as a popcorn flick, which sucks sense the MCU, for the most part is more than just good popcorn flicks. But to be fair it would be hard for any film to live up to not only the hype, but the incredibly high bar set by previous MCU installments. To the studio... wise up, you've already interconnected these installments very intricately use it. To Whedon... go home, rest and count your $$, you've earned it but it has clearly taken its toll.<br/><br/>7.0 (avengers 1 is 8.9)"
"Likes_Ninjas90","5","2","6","5 May 2015"," If the formula is already starting to wane for them, what will it be like once the third Avengers film, in two parts no less, arrives?
","Comic book films and superhero movies are bound by acts of duty. It's been the policy of Marvel Studios, among other companies, to mass produce these films at least once a year under a Ford-like model of precision that offers little variation or surprise. Marvel's production line is intent on servicing a dedicated fanbase that has, till now, shown little fatigue of derivative movie formulas involving action and comedy. But the loyalty to the superhero template also raises questions about Marvel's inflexibility: they're one of the most powerful and financially successful studios in Hollywood but how much personal imprint can a director achieve when instructed to follow a blueprint rather than testing cinema's boundaries? A modern pop comparison to Marvel's success but equally their creative limits is within the gaming industry. The video game publisher Activision produces yearly editions of the Call of Duty franchise, which are financially successful products but criticised for their lack of innovation. Similar to Marvel, they reflect how fandom and yearly service invites complacency and pop culture banality.<br/><br/>As predictable as an annual Marvel release is the company's commitment to Christian themes and similar political rhetoric. While less tonally serious than the Nolan Batman films, the Marvel features are no less political than The Dark Knight's impressions of vigilantism and terrorism. They're concerned almost singularly with American values, particularly restoring the family unit and the redemptive arc of mostly White males, whose physical strength characterises them as Aryan- like figures of authority. The first Avengers movie, directed by Joss Whedon, brought multiple Marvel superhero characters together to form a family-like unit, and so did Guardians of the Galaxy where the bond of a group of misfits empowered them to protect the Earth. Returning as the director, Whedon (most famous for Firefly, Serenity and Buffy) has compared this Avengers sequel to Westerns like Rio Bravo (1959) where groups of people defend their town from outsiders. Comparatively, Age of Ultron is a Western about military service: it's a call to arms to protect American values like the family and the home from Russians and electronic threats to security systems. The film's view of external threats is at once old fashioned and contemporary.<br/><br/>Prior to discovering a sense of duty, Age of Ultron draws on a worn trope of the superhero genre: the thought of retirement. In this edition Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) is hoping he and his fellow heroes including Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) will be able to hang up their boots. Stark tries developing a security system which will independently defend the Earth. After a party, the group is attacked by a rogue computer system called Ultron (voiced by James Spader), who destroys Jarvis (Paul Bettany) and is determined to cleanse the Earth and the Avengers. Ultron takes on a robotic form for his powers and pairs up with Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). They are Russian twins whose parents were killed by Stark weaponry. She has special powers for putting people into a trance with strange dreams and Quicksilver moves at hyper speed. The dreams are a disorientating and strange edition to the formula, but I couldn't understand why she doesn't kill the heroes if she's standing close enough to hypnotise them. Meanwhile, Bruce Banner is balancing the dangers of his Hulk persona with a potential romance with Black Widow, one of the few who can peacefully subdue him. Where did this come from and is it paying homage to King Kong? Whedon said at one point the film was cut back from being several hours long, which is evident from the way the dreams and the romantic subplot lead nowhere, Thor's confusing detour halfway through the movie and how good actors including Julie Delpy, Anthony Mackie and Stellan Skarsgard are reduced to cameos roles. Arguably, the African American actors like Mackie, Don Cheadle, Idris Elba and Samuel L. Jackson are only given walk-in parts and gag scenes.<br/><br/>The dialogue in Whedon's own script is one aspect with his own personal stamp. There are a handful of genuinely funny quips which cut straight through the pretensions of this genre: ""He's fast and she's weird"", says a character explaining the powers of the twins. But Whedon's fight to make the characters deeper and complex is pitched against Marvel's stonewall formula. The characters are vocal, asking whether they're the real monsters and also have thoughts about retiring from their duty as superheroes, which is welcome. But the pit stops where the film presents light touches of humour and what some are calling character moments aren't adding to the narrative or plot. They put the brakes on the movie, which slows the pacing down and lowers the energy levels. Some of it is also silly, like a stoppage at a farm house where Tony Stark is implausibly seen chopping wood. They're merely delaying the fact that this film's primary focus is action rather than a strong theme or conflict between the characters. There's no dilemma about the characters early retirement given these films rely on extravagant but tiresome set pieces. The battles take place in snowy woodlands, in an aerial battle and in a cityscape but there's nothing very distinctive about them or a lot of tension or danger. James Spader's eerie voice is one of the few memorable things about the antagonist Ultron, who is merely another villain trying to destroy the world by developing a robot army of clones. At a packed screening last week, it felt like the audience was less involved with the movie or less surprised than they were with Guardians last year."

","I hadn't seen the first Avengers, but I'd heard good things about it. So, it would be intriguing to see whether the inevitable sequel would live up to its predecessor. Unfortunately, the end result is a whole lot of 'meh', a polished slice of mediocrity that fails at everything it tries to do. <br/><br/>We find the Avengers fighting in a forest. They seek to find a Scepter of sorts. (I'm not too familiar with the Marvel Universe nor have I seen the first Avengers, so cut me some slack.) Tony Stark finds a peacekeeping program or something and sees it as a way of keeping the Earth safe from alien invasions. This would allow the Avengers to safely retire. The program's AI (Ultron), however, goes rogue, inhabits a robot body and forms a robot army to oppose the Avengers. His philosophy is a distorted version of Stark's—keeping the world safe. Ultron figures that this entails mankind's extinction. The Avengers must now not only fight Ultron, but also themselves as doubt enters their ranks, rooted in Stark keeping the program a secret.<br/><br/>This might all sound very interesting, but it mostly isn't. Although the concept of the rogue AI has been interesting since 2001: A Space Odyssey, here it just feels like 'been there, done that'. There're a few scenes where they try to force the HAL 9000 comparisons by having Ultron sing, but there's only one problem: Ultron doesn't hold a candle to HAL. The character development is also lackluster. The only noteworthy thing taking place is the blossoming romance between the Hulk and Black Widow but even that feels forced and unnatural. The script feels less like a script and more like a collection of one-liners. Someone should check if there's a record for the amount of one-liners in a film, because I think Age of Ultron has a serious chance of breaking it. Seriously though, what's with all these one-liners? At worst, they're not funny and ruin any tension, since a character making a wise-crack implicitly tells you a) he's not taking things seriously and therefore neither should you and b) that the good guys will win in the end, thereby ruining any tension a scene might have generated.<br/><br/>The whole story is just so basic. The film tries to make you feel like the Avengers are actually in danger of losing due to internal strife which of course doesn't happen. There's also the mandatory scene where they discuss the prospect they might die during the final battle which of course doesn't happen. (spoiler) Yeah, there's a scene towards the end where one minor superhero dies much to another's great grief, replete with melancholy choral music and reduced sounds effects and voices, but it's so melodramatic and overwrought you're beyond caring. I sometimes truly wonder if the filmmakers expect anyone to shed a tear during these scenes.<br/><br/>By the way, you gotta love the morality play going on towards the end when Ultron raises a chunk of city to the sky and the Avengers simultaneously fight Ultron's robot army and escort civilians to safety. The message is that the Avengers don't just fight evil, they protect the innocent and so on. But if that's true, what about the midway fight scene between Iron Man and the Hulk where they tear half a city apart? Only several minutes in does Iron Man try to lure him out of the city before failing after which the fight goes on. And why doesn't he just flee from the Hulk? The Hulk is obviously chasing him, so why not take the fight to some wasteland? For God's sake, even Dragon Ball Z had this figured out.<br/><br/>The actionis what it is. The filmmakers thankfully avoid throwing things at you/the camera and the cinematography and choreography occasionally provide some cool imagery, but a) the 3D looks terrible and b) the visual effects are terrible. Full stop. It all looks just a bit too blurry to be believable, you know.<br/><br/>I've read a few comments defending Whedon by saying that the inevitable third Avengers film is the more important one in the bigger scheme of things, but those are just excuses. Bad directing and bad scripts are what they are: bad. You either make a worthwhile film or you don't. Despite the 2,5 hour length, Age of Ultron is still quite entertaining, but I definitely left the theater with an overwhelming feeling of indifference."

","Age of Ultron was always going to be in the shadow of the first Avengers film. The first film gave us THAT moment, when all of these heroes united on screen for the first time, and it felt epic. Topping that was never going to be easy for AoU, and it doesn't quite hit that mark.<br/><br/>There are some unresolved questions. At the very start of the film the Avengers are together again, apparently going around the world, taking down Hydra bases. When did they start doing this? How did they get in touch with Thor to rope him into it? We're left with the gang all together and we're meant to take it as read that this is how it is. That said, it was impressive to see them all as a functioning unit, a team (even the Hulk is on-side), taking out wave after wave of bad guys.<br/><br/>We're introduced to two new characters (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) but I can't help but feel they needed a film of their own to flesh them out - there's too much going on in AoU to cram in much back story or give them the time they deserve, however much they try.<br/><br/>Ultron is great. He isn't perhaps as fearsome as the trailers suggest, but he can go pound-for-pound against Thor, which should serve as a mark of his strength. He believes humanity needs to go - they have had their time and the world needs to move on. He isn't necessarily acting out of pure evil - he just sees humans as too chaotic to survive.<br/><br/>James Spader is quite dry and witty in this role - it's hard to imagine anyone else doing it.<br/><br/>The film is peppered with some nice moments and good one-liners but it could have benefited from a slightly more serious tone, and Ultron needed to be a touch more dangerous - he was painted as the villain to seriously test the Avengers, and he doesn't really come across as THAT dangerous - it sort of feels like AoU is teeing up Phase 3 rather than concluding Phase 2 - it's a good film, that they tried to do too much with, and so got a little muddled. That didn't stop me from enjoying it though!"

","The question from the beginning was whether one could make a sequel, as good as the original. The Marvel specializes in successful sequel, either continuing the successful story, adding to tension, characters and plot, following the overall grand design of the company (e.g. Cpt. America: The Winter Soldier), or invest deliberately in their origin source i.e. the world of comics, which are the American version of mythology (e.g. Thor: The Dark World). The Greeks had Hercules, Americans have Superman, or Vision, the Cpt. Marvel etc., since we're referring to this particular company. Whedon, the man behind hits of modern American cinema (both artistic and commercial) having also credit for the screenplay, and without holding the position e.g. of Brad Bird, as the smoothest of narrators in an action movie, has a visible attribute that lends self-sarcastic humor in all his films, thus mitigating the possibility to be criticized by his accusers, for all the script excesses implied. This sense of humor has made his movies treasured by the two sexes. Because of this humor a grown man can easily enjoy a female, or a child movie (much a do about nothing, Toy Story), and a woman finds herself getting the ""pulse"" of an immature boyish movie(Avengers, Cabin In The Woods). All are in their positions, giving their best and giving moviegoers one more fine action movie to watch and cinema critics an action flick they can watch and praise without any remorse. This movie also gives to a comic buffer one more reason to feel proud for their childhood or teenage love, that was once mocked by some, but now is the biggest trend setter on the planet. With the small exception of the variation of the original comic story for obvious reasons (for the same reason that Marvel chose the Ant Man not to be Hank Pym or Captain Marvel to be a woman), serving Marvel's scheme a)to pass into eternity through cinema and b) to pass on to the younger generations who only read through tablets and therefore do not know the original material and are ready to accept anything. To that end the comic buffer stands alone as the largest and most strict judge. If he agrees with the whole effort, he will not grumble about the mind stone used to create the Vision, contrary to what has been written in comic books, nor that the Ultron, is the effective commander of Iron Legion and is essentially a fascist bastard, exact copy of his megalomaniac creator (which is implied and not explicitly mentioned in the film) and not an artificial intelligence that gets accidentally life from the same stone .. A huge festival special effects well shot and arranged unlike rather tedious action efforts (as eg was the 2nd episode of Star Wars), making good for its genre serving equally good the plot and the action, certainly well written, with interpretations as convincing as possible. In particular we must stand to the flirtacious Banner / Hulk - Romanov / Black Widow, who could give a comic buffer reasons to complaint, but serves the needs of the film and its promotion (must have female audience as well) and eventually do not harm the film,since both interpretations of Marc Ruffalo, and the (Goddess!!)Scarlett Johanson, is convincing and well placed within the mind blowing action sequences and the impending global threat. Now, it is time for the Gauntlet of Infinity (the last 2 films of Phase 3 of the Marvel Universe)..The 8/10 goes because it is sipmply impossible to outscore the first Avengers Movie.."

","Age of Ultron is an extremely well executed comic-movie; This movie basically picks up where the first Avengers movie left off.

All of the avengers know each other and they work together extremely well. <br/><br/>The movie also has character moments and each of the characters in this movie have their own movies to shine. <br/><br/>Ultron is effective but in the end dull. Ultron has some good moments, his purpose and intentions are clear but, in the end Ultron is just easily disposed off like every other villain (what hare you really surprised). <br/><br/>I thought the action scenes where very boring. I've seen the Avengers fight together before; this time there are no real stakes and the action movies in a fast pace.<br/><br/>This movie just really sets up Infinity Wars (I will except that for a comic-book movie.<br/><br/>In the end, I had fun with Avengers: Age of Ultron. All of the characters where fun but, the action scenes where boring. Every character in the movie had their moment to shine but in the end, I feel like Ultron got the short end of the stick (Ultron was perfectly executed throughout the movie though.<br/><br/>Watch this movie if you love fun comic-book Avengers adventure, however, if you don't then watch The Dark Knight for some really serious drama.

","Another shot for what has become the most successful franchise series of all time. The dollars are rolling in for the Marvel universe, and so time to milk another in this series.<br/><br/>The first Avengers was great, but this one does not have the comfort of the first which was introducing characters to write the story. Instead this adds more characters and it doesn't half become bloated. The story isn't a million miles from the standard super hero comic book, so no need to elaborate on that.<br/><br/>Anyhow, the action from the get go is full on and only a few lulls to fill in emotional storyline to make us empathise with our heroes.<br/><br/>Special effects are great and so forth,and acting is great as the actors have more than filled in the shoes of their characters.<br/><br/>The problem is that this is not bringing anything new to the table. If anything it's standard stuff, and so despite the heavy and long fight scenes, I was losing attention and interest. Seen it all before and done better elsewhere, and the villain was little interesting and should been fleshed out more.<br/><br/>With so many characters and cameos to fit in, it gets baggy and can't focus or develop. The Black Widow and Hulk relationship really wasn't working either when the only time in minutes that could be devoted to it could be counted in single digits.<br/><br/>Maybe this was missing someone of the quality of Loki/Tom Hiddlestone, who really stole the show in the Thor films and first Avengers film.<br/><br/>It's a fine Saturday night cinema blockbuster but after some great graphic novel adaptions of late, this is a disappointment for me. Not bad but not one I'll likely return to."

","*potential minor spoilers mentioned!*<br/><br/>To think that it has been three years since we last saw the Avengers assembled in the midst of battle is quite something. Now in 2015, we have been treated with the follow-up Age Of Ultron, in which the team have to overcome an intimidating threat in the formidable foe Ultron, a creation of Tony Stark, in order to prevent or rather at least minimise any threat. However, something goes wrong and instead Ultron is created and aims to impose vengeance on the team. James Spader does a splendid job as the villain, using his own voice to really capture that sense of Ultron being something with life, and not just any simple,lifeless robot. However, as the film moves on from his introduction and other plots are looked at (which I cannot mention without necessarily spoiling), I personally lost interest in him and wanted to see the development of the other arcs. In doing so, I guess you could say it is leading on to future films and to be fair the film has got me excited for next years Captain America Civil War, but at some points it felt like too much was going on and being crammed in for the sole purpose of the development of future plots.<br/><br/>One small aspect of the film that I didn't quite like is that it starts off with the whole team in battle, fighting together, which seems to entirely forget previous character arcs in other films such as Tony Stark's retirement in Iron Man 3, but regardless it was a great action packed opening. Speaking the action, the crew seemed to have upped the ante and each character has their stand out moments, which is definitely something director Joss Whedon set out to do, after some fans anger regarding the way in which Hawkeye was used in The Avengers. Don't worry, this time he has plenty of screen time to show off his bow and arrow skills! <br/><br/>Overall, the film retains it's franchise now trademark sense of humour, epic action and all- round-fun. The dynamic interaction between the heroes is fantastic and if anything has just got me excited to see how the Justice League team are portrayed together. Now, in terms of where I would put it on my list of the best Marvel films, I would consider it to be below The Winter Soldier and below The Avengers, but that's expected because TWS is a film devoted to one of the heroes and the Avengers was the first time we saw the characters fighting together. My personal gripe is that for me, Marvel have yet to create a villain on the big screen that really stands out and is developed well, like some of the DC villains we have seen and I would still argue that we haven't seen that yet. Something like the Kingpin from the exceptional Marvel TV show, Daredevil is what they need. I guess that's what we'll being seeing as the Avengers face Thanos in upcoming the Infinity War films. Bring it on is all I say."

","No one would really blame you if you approached Avengers: Age of Ultron with a bit of weariness. The Marvel Cinematic Universe is now in its seventh year, and each release is a massive tentpole event, the size of which is usually reserved for The Super Bowl or The World Series. Yet, if you're the type of person who doesn't live and breathe the comic book world you often find that most of these movies come with a nice candy coating but nothing special inside – the effort is there, but the result is nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>I'm happy to report that Avengers: Age of Ultron is worth its hype. Being this far into a series we might feel that it has started to spin it's wheels, but this is the first of these films since Iron Man that breaks away from the inevitability of CG action sequences and makes us feel for the characters. In other words, somebody gave a rip about the people involved. Here is a movie that actually takes time out to give us characters rather than iconic stand-ins. Sure, Iron Man and Captain America and Thor and Hulk have had their stories told in separate movies, but giving them character details in a movie that's essentially suppose to be a montobulous summer action picture is really quite a surprise.<br/><br/>The plot is exactly what we expect. The movie opens with our sextet of superheroes storming the castle of the monocled Baron von Strucker to retrieve Loki's staff and unleashing a pair of mixed-up kids – The Maximoff twins, Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who can run fast, and goth-chick Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) who can scramble your brain. Or as Maria Hill puts it ""Ones fast and the other's weird."" That mission accomplished, the crew appears to be ready for a little downtime, but a problem presents itself when one of Stark's inventions – a robot program called Ultron who has been designed to prevent future attacks like the one in New York – begins to think, and then consider, and then decide that the Earth would be much better if human beings weren't around. He wants the world to be remade in his image, but there's all those pesky insignificant humans to deal with first. Naturally, that leads to the inevitable city-wide Battle Royale with buildings crashing and human life at stake – Director Joss Whedon allows the human toll to be part of the concern, in effect commenting on the way that it was callously mishandled in Man of Steel.<br/><br/>The action part of the movie we can fairly predict and it might have been easy to write this one off if the movie had just stayed on that track. But what was surprising is that the movie takes time out to give us details about the characters. No, this is not a character study, but it gives us extras bits and pieces about these characters that we don't expect.<br/><br/>We spend some boozy downtime with The Avengers as they waste away their time trying to pick up Thor's Hammer (they can't). And then there's a trip out to a remote ranch house where we learn a whole lot about Hawkeye that we never knew before (which I won't spoil). Scarlett Witch has the power to get inside a person's mind, and we get to see the team's deep-seeded fears and desires.<br/><br/>The human element is what we don't expect. There's a lot of anger boiling under Stark's skin about this monstrosity that his hubris has unleashed upon the world. He's protective of his massive ego and what comes of that is one of the best performances that Robert Downey Jr, has given in quite a while. But it doesn't stop there, there's also a sweet Beauty and the Beast dynamic going on between Bruce Banner and Black Widow. Her lullaby to turn him from green to pink is really kind of sweet.<br/><br/>Even the villain gets a human dimension. Ultron is a great creation, a blend of computer animation and a voice that brings him happily to life. That voice, of course, comes from James Spader who gives Ultron a lot of dimension through a cocky, slippery demeanor that seems weary from reminding mankind of the inevitability of its demise. He fancies himself a deity. ""When the universe starts to settle,"" he says, ""God throws a stone at it."" But, to our surprise, Ultron is not all that we think he is. There's a certain vulnerability to him. He's learning but we sense that he hasn't learned enough. Even in his final scene, you kind of feel a smidgeon of pity for him.<br/><br/>It is clear that writer/director Joss Whedon cares about what he's putting on screen. Many of these massive action movies of late have been just amalgamations of things that are popular at the moment, but Whedon clearly wants to give Avengers: Age of Ultron something more than just the bottom line. We like these people. We like their adventures. And he's given them a human dimension, and we like that too."
"grayremnant1","7","2","6","1 May 2015"," Avengers Age of Ultron: My Thoughts
","I want to start this review by saying that if you liked The Avengers, or just Marvel films in general, then I highly doubt you're going to dislike this film. It's not a departure, a change from the norm, or anything of that nature. Having said that, there are distinctions between Age of Ultron and its predecessor that make this a slightly different viewing experience.<br/><br/>In The Avengers there were never any introductions. We were thrust into the plot of the film almost immediately. This is because The Avengers was a sort of culmination-sequel of films that had already been made. We'd already seen Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Bruce Banner, Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Nick Fury from their respective franchises. We'd even met the main villain (Loki) before, which left no burden of introductions upon Joss Whedon's shoulders.<br/><br/>This form of freedom allowed the Avengers to get straight to the point and clip along very fluidly and efficiently. The result was one of the best comic book movies of all time. This time around, however, there were introductions. We saw four new main characters in Age of Ultron, all of which we'd never seen before (save for a cameo appearance by the Maximoff twins in Winter Soldier).<br/><br/>Unlike The Avengers, that began without a prologue and without delay, there's a fairly lengthy prologue in Age of Ultron. It is here that the plot is set up, and three of the new characters are introduced. There's a fairly lengthy scene in this portion of the film that drags noticeably. It's a much slower-paced intro to the one we experienced back in 2012.<br/><br/>Again, in the film's second act, we encounter another slow-paced, longer than necessary scene that leaves the viewer hanging. It is these interruptions in the plot that both ruin the fluidity that we saw in The Avengers, and contributes to Age of Ultron's 141 minute run time. Instead of the tasty nugget we savored in The Avengers, we now have something far more chewy, which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br/><br/>The upside of this is that the plot is far more developed and more intricate than the first film. There are a lot more twists and turns and a lot more questions asked and answered. This is the thing I really like about Age of Ultron; I was far more intrigued and absorbed by the plot than I was in the original.<br/><br/>But plot isn't everything; there are also character interactions and character arcs that need to be weighed in. In The Avengers I felt like the character interactions were perfect. It was far more entertaining and interesting to see the Avengers fight and engage in banter with each other, than it was to see the arbitrary 'Avengers vs Chitauri' battle sequences (don't get me wrong, I loved the last battle scene).<br/><br/>Here in Age of Ultron, however, it's mostly just the Avengers vs Ultron. There's a grand total of two scenes where the Avengers fight amongst each other, and it's very toned down and civil compared to its predecessor. There's still no shortage of one-liners and comical dialogue, however. Less than The Avengers, but still plentiful as ever.<br/><br/>The acting was solid, even from Aaron Taylor-Johnson. I have to say, I was worried about him, given his history in film, but even he was decent in this. Elizabeth Olsen was awesome as Scarlet Witch. That's all I'll say about that.<br/><br/>And then we have Ultron. James Spader was obviously the perfect choice for the role, but honestly he played it much differently than I thought he would. Ultron is about as nutty as can be. He's not the coherent mastermind we're used to seeing, but rather a raving, muttering lunatic with an incredibly twisted ideology. That said, he's probably my favorite Marvel villain to date.<br/><br/>Of course, with all Marvel films, it all comes down to the final battle sequence. Age of Ultron winds down in epic fashion. In comparison to the final battle in The Avengers, I have to say I liked this one a bit more. Not because it was epic, but rather because the imminence of Earth's demise was much more prominent. The Chitauri just didn't feel like a match for the Avengers, but Ultron's master plan seems quite insurmountable and quite threatening in comparison.<br/><br/>Overall, I left my theater satisfied. I didn't expect Age of Ultron to exceed its predecessors, and it didn't. But, nonetheless, it was a worthy sequel and one that I enjoyed immensely. It had just enough humor and just enough darkness to balance out in the end, and I would see it twice just for the thrill."

","Well, First let me state that I am not a comic fan boy, but Iam a huge Whedon fan. I went into this with high expectations, and the action, scope, visuals, sound, and writing (maybe one too many one-liners) fulfilled all expectations. I was bummed by three things that are the caused of my below excellent rating. The performances aren't knocked out of the park, and are kind of distant. No one really struggled to act. I think the actor giving the best performance was Spader and his character is all CGI. Probably think with Guardains being so praised last year, this movie was edited to work on that pace, which works great for James Gunn. But I welcome more development with Whedon written characters and sets. so when these people stand in a room, its not filled rhetoric, there ought to be great ideas and explanations. Thirdly (not a spoiler because these appearances were listed in credits) there were so many secondary characters from other films that appear but are hardly used that I just go, stop it already. But ya know. Whedon and along with Nolan, Wright, and Tarantino seem tapped into not just what movies are today but where they are going. <br/><br/>And its hard to see the trailer for Ant-Man before it and not be bummed that Edgar Wright left the project"

","I just saw it on theaters this morning. It was great! It starts with the action right away. This movie made me more excited for future Marvel movies and I know I'm not alone.<br/><br/>There are parts in the movie that bothered me like when the huge rock from the city actually floated, it looked cartoon-ish. The characters of Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were under developed. And the part where Quicksilver died. Well I guess it's not that bad. I can say a lot for this movie. The post credits scene made me excited for Avengers Infinity War. It shows Thanos taking his gauntlet (without the infinity stones) then saying ""I'll do it myself.""<br/><br/>In conclusion, Avengers Age Of Ultron is awesome! Way better than the first Avengers movie."
"diac228","7","2","6","30 April 2015"," The train of joy coming from the MCU continues to deliver, but its starting to run out of steam
","I'd hate to spoil the party, but the Marvel Cinematic Universe is starting to run out of trick cards.<br/><br/>Criticizing Avengers: Age of Ultron is the equivalent of being one of those prick judges on Cutthroat Kitchen, insulting a cook for making a mediocre pasta when all they had was marinara sauce and expired noodles. Joss Whedon and friends pulled out all the necessary mayhem, entertainment, and joy of your usual MCU flick, so let's mention this before this turns into a massive review of disappointment. However it's becoming a bit more apparent that the intangibles holding back Marvel and Disney's potential is hindering the quality of the movies. It hurts to point out the elephant in the room, but after seeing the final scene you can't help but realize that clearly Hollywood and the Copyright shenanigans is hampering the franchise as a whole.<br/><br/>For those not truly knowledgeable of the subject, Marvel and Disney are restricted on who they can show (and for how long) and who can get their own spin-off movie. As of now, the true-true Avengers team assembling on screen is literally impossible. Fox, Sony, and Universal own cinematic Marvel properties and unless every film studio in California decide to drop the competition and hold hands, Whedon will be restricted on his vision of the Avengers and the current Marvel universe. He even has to change the origin stories of some of the characters because certain words can't even be used in this franchise of movies. Like a production version of mineweeper, you can avoid mines for only so long before you notice you're running out of space.<br/><br/>The production value, writing, acting, humor, action, and attention to each of the characters has been spot-on lately, and Avengers: Age of Ultron is no exception. All the characters are back, and they remain just as entertaining and engaging as the original Avengers movie that overwhelmed audiences back in 2012. Iron Man and Hawkeye have all the great lines, Hulk and Thor has all the awesome kinetic energy, and Captain America remains our lovable heroic leader. Of course, a few other characters make nice cameo appearances, and others...well, we didn't really need them (one hero in particular was bizarrely underwhelming). Lastly, Ultron was quite a formidable foe, perfectly portrayed by James Spader.<br/><br/>But.....<br/><br/>There are no stakes to be raised. We all know the upcoming Marvel lineup for the next several years. We all know of their limited amount of cinematic resources. So with that we are presented with less surprises, less suspense, and less of the unpredictability factor that had been a major source of fun during the first phase of Marvel movies. The movie took off immediately without any sort of build-up because it knows why we are there: entertainment of the highest summer degree. But with sequel after sequel planned, the audience pretty much knows who is going to make it. What would keep us engaged would be if we saw any major left field surprises or unexpected turns. Because of the restrictions and because of the required schedule, there honestly was very little to be shocked at. It didn't have the ballsy shakeup of The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>No movie built to predate upcoming chapters has ever felt complete (Dead Man's Chest anyone?). Avengers: Age of Ultron tries its best to disguise this but the inevitable is clear: punches were held back because they need to be saved for later installments. Marvel has to keep whatever remaining limited cards it has on its deck. Unlike DC which pretty much has all its eggs on the same basket, Marvel has to make incredible omelets using less eggs. And although you will enjoy this satisfying meal of comic book action, you'll notice the kitchen staff starting to sweat."
"abisio","7","2","6","30 April 2015"," Great actors, great production, lots of actions but ...
","In terms of production and CGI I can say this movie is better than the first AVENGER; however in terms of story; there is not much there. The first AVENGER was all about egos colliding and it really work. In fact the best thing was Loky and the constant fighting between them When at the end decided to fight together the movie lost lots of steam. The second installment find them together so Joss Whedon had to find a way to divide them and create conflict. His excuse is the madness of over egocentric Tony Stark by creating an AI based on the scepter of the first movie. Sadly from that on the story does not hold very well. As the conflict is not so believable than the first time; he basically creates a lot of one-liners for each characters that at least keep the humor on a good level.<br/><br/>I admire that Whedon gives a balanced moments for everybody to shine. Exception is Captain America with a character so stiff that seems to be wanting to be in another movie. The concept of Captain America been the leader (as being America the leader of the world) is somewhat uncomfortable and not quite proved here; specially when all the big thinking and planning comes from all the others. It is a pity because Chris Evans is not a bad actor but is unable to outshine his colleagues here. Downey as ever makes you cry and laugh without even putting a lot of effort. Hemwsworth THOR is quite sympathetic and can be funny and deep when is needed. Renner is an excellent actor and he really deserves a hit. As a family man, he creates a lot of suspense by the end just with the look on his face. Ruffalo is also OK; but this time he is a little to depressive. His hint a romance with Black Widow is like a fresh air in the movie; but is she who creates the sexual tension. Scarlett is as always too good for any movie. She is the only action hero that can be feminine ever during the fights and also we a desirable woman. Taylor-Johnson is fine; but I would like his character to be bigger. Olsen is really terrifying as Scarlett Witch with almost no talking. In my opinion she was as good as Johansson even with less screen time. On the action department; again Whedon is not that good. Relying to much on CGI is not longer interesting. There are spectacular scenes on the beginning and the end that never transmit a sense of real danger. Perhaps; the fight between Iron Man and Hulk is the best and funniest action set in the whole movie. In brief; it is not a boring movie; lots of action but the best are the character interacting between them. Let's hope somebody find a way on the third Avenger to make something different because this will not hold for a third time."
"adam-whelan0","7","2","6","25 April 2015"," Not as good as the first
","SPOILERS.. I don't usually write reviews but i felt i had to for Avengers Age of Ultron. Unfurtanly for me anyway this film has not lived up to the first film, some of the plot elements seem to carry over from the first Avengers main baddie leads an army against the Avengers, it could have been done differently or I'd like to see a baddie test the might of the Avengers and not have an army to do their dirty work.<br/><br/>And Ultron himself was a bit of a joke, for someone who wants to destroy humanity he seems really cheerful, cracking some jokes and humming Pinocchio songs. Trailers made him out to be a menace,he still was threatening tho but like some Marvel villains they seem to getting turned into some sort of joke(Mandrian in IM3). Now the Black Widow Hulk romance was just plain weird, out of the blue and forced upon you and poor Hulk barley has any screen time.<br/><br/>I like to laugh as much as the next guy but the comedy was over done especially towards the end with happy little one liners from everyone even tho there's a major battle happening. Some of the gags from the first film were also carried over like the 'sucker punch' this time from Iron Man, but other than that everything else was superb.<br/><br/>The special effects were top notch, action was amazing and the Iron man v Hulk fight... wow. The cast were excellent as per usually and James Spader done an excellent job as Ultron. The overall story and concept was very good and the more in dept background information on Hawkeye and Widow was very interesting, so overall AoU is defiantly a must see for anyone apart from its flaws"

","This movie completely lived up to my expectations. There was some pretty bad ass action scenes that literally gave me goosebumps. Although there wasn't any major flaw in the movie, I still feel they could have had explained Vision's character a bit better. The Hulk's battle with the Hulk Buster was awesome just as expected or maybe even better. Ultron was shown to be a very powerful enemy who was finished off a bit easily than expected. The death of Quicksilver was a huge shock and I almost broke down into tears. I also liked the fact that in the end they started training other super humans n vision to be a part of the avengers initiative. The post-credit scene showing Thanos holding the Infinity Gautlet was kick-ass, it would have been great if they showed Spidey as well. In conclusion Avengers: Age of Ulrton is a must watch, and it more than lives up to the expectations!"
"karritiku","6","2","6","24 April 2015"," Not as great as its predecessor
","I have been waiting since last summer for an movie which can be satisfactory. But after watching AOU, the wait continues. This movie has humor. The action sequences in the first half satisfies an adrenaline junkie but the climax fight is a huge letdown. The romantic angle seems forced. Overall a disappointing affair. You should watch it once for the epic battle between IRON MAN and the HULK. Captain America had a decent role while hawkeye's character gets explored. Thor seems to have developed humor which is enjoyable. Director Joss Whedon seems to have not developed the climax. A pretty engaging first half. Slow in the middle. Picks up towards the big end and falters at the big end."
"ryan-craven-528-410093","5","2","6","24 April 2015"," With sweeping emotion and more of that joyous banter, Joss Whedon defies expectations.
","Although it was perhaps never in doubt that 2012's The Avengers would be big, most didn't expect it's balancing act of character moments, fist-pumping action and incredible one- liners would be as joyously fun as it was. Joss Whedon, the genius behind Buffy and Firefly, had pulled off a major feat, one that will stand as a benchmark for Marvel for years to come. Therein lies the scale of the task Whedon had with Age of Ultron. How do you improve on a film as good as that?<br/><br/>Somehow, he and the brilliant cast have pulled it off. It's not without it's stumbles. In a film of this size, and with a mammoth cast, there are times when the numerous stands over- reach and become a little hard to follow. A particular sub-plot detour feels very unnecessary, and in a melting pot of emotion and motivations, there are a few characters (Thor and Quicksilver) that feel a little short-changed. This is, however, missing the point completely. Whilst Loki is most likely unmatched in the MCU for villainy, Ultron is a marvelous creation; one that feels like a step forward for the Studio's approach in 'Phase Three'. Created by Tony Stark as an 'end game'; the ultimate peace-keeper that would put the Avengers out of the Avenging business for good, Ultron represents the failings of humanity as a race, whilst also planting the seeds for Cap and Iron Man's ideological differences in Captain America: Civil War. His arc is effectively played as a tragedy; he is only what Stark and Banner intended him to be, twisted and ruined by the violence of the past, hellbent on securing an 'evolution'. The tone here is one that walks a tight-rope between sombre and the usual light, witty banter. Whedon's skill is in the perfect balance he strikes; we feel the stakes and feel the emotion, but the banter between the group is at it's fan-serving best here. So much so I would be content if we had a 2 hour couch session with these brilliantly defined, effortlessly genuine characters. <br/><br/>Wasted in Assemble, Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is given surprisingly heartfelt screen time, with Whedon thoughtfully casting him as the solid anchor of the group. Scarlett Johannson continues her great work, bringing a vulnerability to Black Widow that belies her troubled past. Her romance with Mark Ruffalo's Hulk provides the majority of the heart-wrenching emotion, a beautiful gut-punch that undercuts the action and brings even more humanity to all the geeky, joyous action on display. Downey Jr., Evans and Hemsworth bristle with chemistry and charisma, and we see a more developed, empathetic Stark here; his being responsible for Ultron, and the subsequent guilt he feels, is a driving force behind the story. As a whole, this cast is dynamite, and in a fantastic early scene, provide hilarious moments. Ultimately, however, we want to see them kick ass, and Whedon brings a plethora of thrilling, nerd-gasmic set-pieces that more than match that magnificent tracking shot in Assemble. More than ever, we see the Avengers as a working battle force, using each others' abilities in ingenious, hugely entertaining ways. Plus, this time out there's the Hulkbuster.<br/><br/>Unsurprisingly, time is spent inevitably setting up future movies, but whilst unnecessary, the easter eggs don't distract from the narrative of the film too much. New additions are also immensely successful. Whilst Elizabeth Olsen is impressive as Scarlet Witch, Paul Bettany's Vision steals the film, and bags many of the film's best moments. He has always been a terrific actor, but here he exudes class and charisma, providing an at once cold, but wise and naive character whose existence in the MCU is nothing but exciting. Marvel continue to build and progress, but without losing the charm and aching humanity that has defined their best. Avengers: Age of Ultron finds this sweetspot effortlessly."
"anupapu8","8","2","6","24 April 2015"," Entertainment but with Tried and Tasted method
","AVENGERS: AGE of ULTRON- Expectations were high to the limits and why wouldn't that be , The Avenger(first sequel) was such a entertaining flick. Everybody liked it , and it became the third highest grossing movie of all time only after Avatar and Titanic. So the first question is that is Age of Ultron is better then The Avenger for me the answer is 'NO' . 2nd Question can arise that is Age of Ultron is worth of spending money then my answer will be 'Hell YES'. The thing is that The First Avenger was first of its kind , before it we haven't seen such a grand super hero flick with so many super heroes (except in X Men which doesn't have famous super heroes individually). But the same formula cant be used twice. They should have done something new , but they haven't done that. The same tried and tasted formula has been used which although force you to get glued to your seat for the running time of the movie but will not force enough to remember it for a long time or to try repeat viewing. So the plot is simple - it starts with a fight , some celebration of wining , an experiment get wrong , a new A.I. villain takes birth who thinks the only way to brought piece is to extinct the humans and start it from a beginning. The villain tries to rip apart the avenger team , tension was created , some inspirational speech from Fury(Samuel L Jackson) and also from Hawkeye , the team is now united again and here comes the grand climax fight. What! Does it sounds familiar , of coarse it is , because Marvel overused this formula before. So why the movie is still good enough to watch on big screen spending extra money on 3d. So here's the truth is , very few people are there who expect depth and intelligence in story and screenplay of super hero movies for example like Batman series and Man Of Steel which DC comics is providing(because of which i am predicting that Justice League movies will be better then Avengers) and even X Men first class from Marvels was great. But most of the people just expect Great Action Sequences and chicky comic lines which Age of Ultron provides in a full amount. U will laugh a lot , Action pieces will make you saying WAOWWWW(still i think The Avenger and Man Of steel have better action sequences in their climax). Some interesting stuffs has been added to the movie like three new character - Javrish who is a good A.I. in the avenger's side doesn't get much to do this time but will be very important in the third sequel of Avenger i.e., Infinity of War, Second one is QuickSilver who runs really fast and his twin sister Scarlet witch. Scarlet has the power to born the fear in the mind of the thing any person is most afraid of(makes you remember Harry Potter movies). But the fears shown individually of the heroes are not so interesting. Hawkeye was the most uninteresting character from The Avenger , but gets the important job of reuniting the team in this sequel as showing why a normal human being without any extraordinary power is needed in the team. There was also some awkward romance in the film which will be good to see if i don't mention the characters. Joss Whedon is an entertaining director , but he didn't tried anything new , only tried to use the same old formula to make it a commercial success which it will definitely get. But the question is how long can the Marvel world can use the same formula. ? Is earning money is the sole target to them ? We will see it. 7.3/10 . By ANuP APu KuMaR"

","A must watch movie for all marvel fans. Age of Ultron has great action, mind blowing visual effects, awesome 3D effects, comedic yet serious and an excellent cast. The movie is well directed and all the scenes are breath-taking. The movie has a good pace; it is not at all boring. The story is also well-linked with other marvel movies.<br/><br/>(Warning! Spoilers ahead. Don't proceed if you hate spoilers.) Though the main story or theme is well known that ultron is the villain and he is defeated in the end, yet the movie has a story-line. As you expect, there are no twists or suspense in the movie but the plot is well set and it is interesting to watch. The various characters and their actions are shown well, and it is mainly because of the variety of the cast; the movie is great. The concepts of Loki's scepter,ultron's artificial intelligence, vibranium, vision, infinity gems, the twins, SHIELD all are mixed well. Some interesting facts about the movie are: 1) Ultron is just like a program. He doesn't exist in one body alone. Initially he is in a damaged suit, Thor simply destroys it. Then he kind of upgrades into a better suit but still Iron Man destroys it. Even 'cap' can keep him occupied. Finally he upgrades to vibranium which is almost indestructible. 2) Vision has an infinity stone: the mind gem. He damages ultron pretty bad. Scarlet witch tear out ultron's 'heart' or 'brain' whatever it is. Vision also destroys the last drone of ultron. 3) The twins are with ultron initially but finally they become avengers. Quick silver dies saving Hawkeye. 4) Scarlet witch messes up with everyone's mind except hawkeye. He has quicker reflexes. 5) Hawkeye is given a much greater importance! His home and family is shown in the movie. There are lots of scenes with hawkeye this time. 6) There is a Thor vs Ultron scene in the climax, but it is quite short. I wish it was longer as it would be a great fight for two powerful guys. I also would love to have a Hulk vs Ultron fight in the climax. An angry hulk vs a vibranium robot. Enormous strength and rage vs indestructible metal. The climax is good, but it could have been better. 7) Vision is too much powerful! He can lift Thor's hammer. Maybe he is worthy! 8) The comedic scenes and dialogues are quite funny. 9) The Hulkbuster suit is great and the action is awesome. 10) Finally, it also has a great city-destruction scene which is absolutely necessary!"

","First of all because it's AWESOME.! The 142mins of the movie is not only packed with some great metal-bashing action scenes, its also gives a deeper view of personalities of our heroes. The inner-conflicts,self-realizations and the mind play that the Avengers suffer from,those wrong decisions made gets us to know them as Humans, than Gods. Coming back, the fighting scenes will make you clap so hard and shout (in excitement) so loud, that you'll never forget the experience ever.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon, You're the MAN.<br/><br/>Secondly,Avengers 2 has introduced a few new characters that will surely play a crucial role in the sequels to come. P.S.- These ones are so cool, you might end up replacing your favorites.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the movie gives a glimpse of the power of the Infinity Stones and will answer many questions that were raised in the previous films.<br/><br/>Fourthly, the new bonding between our avengers, there team play against the enemy they created. The fights and the new found love chemistry will keep you staring at the screen. P.S.- If you don't want to regret the rest of your life, go and watch the movie in 3D. Cause a flat screen is not much for Hulk and Hulk-Buster together.<br/><br/>Finally, the drama. The movie is all about the sacrifices our heroes go through. You might not like the way it ends,but hey,sometimes the god bleed too.<br/><br/>Conclusion: After you watch it, you 'll watch it again and again and again and again..."

","Joss Wheden returns to helm the second Avengers film within the cinematic universe. As I said in my review for The Avengers, you always know what you are going to get from Wheden and he very rarely fails to deliver. Once again as director (and writer), he delivers a top-notch action film with an ensemble cast of hero's and weaves everything together masterfully.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron opens to the Avengers fighting off waves of Hydra forces on route to a secret research base (which we saw in The winter Soldier) and where the Maximoff twins are located. This is also (as we know from Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.) where Hydra have been keeping Loki's sceptre and using it to conduct experiments on volunteers in order to try and replicate the abilities that the Inhumans possess to further goal for world domination and to finish the Avengers.<br/><br/>Strucker, one of the new heads of Hydra wishes to use the twins abilities to defend the facility but others are not so sure they are ready. Once inside Stark gets to downloading information from Hydra's computer systems but Wanda (well played from Olsen) manages to warp his mind (in a first proper glimpse into her powers) which gives him visions of the Avengers all dead in a pile on a futuristic battlefield. With Strucker and the twins escaping the Avengers return with the sceptre for further anylysis before Thor finds a safe haven for the weapon.<br/><br/>We then discover that Stark is planning on building a shield around the Earth (Ultron) and after studying the sceptre with Banner (an excellent Ruffalo again) believes the power of the crystal within the sceptre can be harnassed and starts to try to integrate Jarvis with it in order to create the ultimate protection system for the planet. Unfortunately for Stark (and everyone else) this leads to a rather unexpected result.<br/><br/>This unexpected result forms the basis for the film which could quite easily have been split into two films if they decided to go down that route and follow the comic stroyline more closely. As it is we only really get a glimpse of what went on there and instead Ultron feels rather largely wasted. They could have done so much more with the character then ultimately just end up having him as the token bad guy within a standard films run-time. Regardless, he is well done and Spader must be credited with bringing him to life and giving him some degree of personality.<br/><br/>To the rest of the film, I guess we should start with the maximoff twins. We finally get our real first look at Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) and what unique powers they have along with a little more back story for them both. Unfortunately what isn't clear is exactly how and where they came from. This is due to immeasurable red tape regarding licensing and Fox having the right for the X-Men (for anyone who does not know the real back-story then the internet is your friend). There are numerous hints and clues dropped though that their powers did not come from the sceptre and experiments alone and they they may in fact have been dormant within them.<br/><br/>Hopefully we now have the possibility (now Disney have aquired Fox and got the x-men franchise back) that Marvel can blend the two back-stories together and we will get some their father within the MCU (as well as others) so one can only hope there. I'm certain Kevin Feige can do it better than Fox could have ever dreamed of. Regardless, Elizibeth Olsen (thankfully the decent normal, non crazy sister) is excellent in the role and I also think has the looks to pull off the characters birth heritage. A lot was made of not casting an Eastern European for the role and I feel Marvel got this just right with Olsen as she is an excellent choice to play Wanda.<br/><br/>As for action scenes, we're talking Whedon's Avengers, so epic destruction on a truly epic scale wherever they go is the order of the day. The special effects at the beginning looked a little off but from then on they are excellent. Ending action/fight scene is truly stunning and far better than in the first Avengers film. ILM did a fantastic job here as they usually do when given a big budget and everything (barring the start as said) looks like it should be there and not digitally thrown in. Top marks indeed to all involved in that side of the production.<br/><br/>Direction is also excellent (as one would expect from Whedon) and the script also on point and very well written. This one doesn't contain quite the amount of himour and one-liners as seen in previous films, but hat there is, is very well written and acted and spoken by the cast. The Captain's hero speech is excellent and has lots of feels and Clint's to Wanda is also very well done. And the whole scene with Stan Lee's obligatory cameo has to be his best yet and is a absolute delight. We also get some lovely moments between The Hulk and Black Widow as we get to see more of their developing relationship.<br/><br/>For the rest of the cast, everyone is excellent once again. It's great to finally see Paul Bettany (Jarvis) rather than just hear him and we again get small cameo's from Samuel Jackson as Fury, Mackie as Falcon, Smulder as Maria Hill along with a minor appearance from Atwell as Agent Peggy Carter. Don Cheadle represies his character as Rhodes with War Machine though he doesn't have a great deal of screen time this time around but it does keep a nice continuation of characters that keep appearing.<br/><br/>We also get to learn and see a lot more regarding Clint Barton's character and that whole segment adds a nice feel to a movie that at the time needs to just reflect. We also get some more insight into Natasha's background also to show us how she became the person she is. And last but not least (in a film that tends to throw a litte of everything at you) we get to learn and see some more infinity stone goodness along with a little more Josh Brolin for good measure to lead us into future events. An all round excellent film that just falls short in my opinion of the first Avengers movie but that is head and shoulders above the rest of the Marvel offerings. As they say, everything is better with friends.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The Sage's Rating: 8/10"

","This is probably not the film fans were expecting, including myself. Whedon had an idea of what he wanted to include, but it sounds like he struggled to create the film he wanted with execs. This wasn't a straight forward sequel and when you consider phase 2 overall, this doesn't deliver. I enjoyed the film, but it's bloated and Ultron doesn't have a real impact. Whedon was maybe ambitious with the film, and this resulted in him leaving the series. There's some interesting idea's here, but it feels like a step to the next Avengers film, much like Iron Man 2 was to the first Avengers."

","What makes this movie interesting is the main villain. Ultron(James Spader) is a fanatic created by Stark in an attempt to be a peace keeper. Unfortunately Ultron sees eradication of the human race as the only way to achieve peace and recruits 2 mutants to help him. They're the Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver. It's up to the Avengers to clean up Stark's mess.<br/><br/>There's not much else to say other than the action, acting, effects and dialogue are awesome. When you see Ultron you really feel that he's there. The fight scene with him and Captain America is pretty cool and there're scenes like that. The villian's I interesting in that he thinks his cause is for the good of humanity when it's quite the opposite.<br/><br/>I can't describe enough how awesome this movie is. I highly recommend you check this one out. It's a wild ride."
"donegalcat","4","1","2","12 May 2019"," Incomprehensible Mess
","The weakest of the Avengers films that I have seen. It is an absolute mess. The plot is all over the place and impossible to follow. Action scenes roll into endless action scenes. Too many characters are thrown in and discarded again almost immediately. Characters change motivations with almost no explanation. All this combined to make the film a boring chore to watch as I struggled through it.
The fact that this film made so much money and was universally loved says much about the gullibility of most Marvel fans who will swallow anything as long as all the characters are in it."

","The Good: Avengers: Age of Ultron balances lots, introducing a new villain which is probably the best villain in the MCU so far. beginning the Infinity War plot line (which was very interesting) and introducing new characters, (which were quite likeable) but it never gets dizzying, it all fits together perfectly.
Action scenes are awesome and jokes are funny! Also Hawkeye stole the show!<br/><br/>The Bad: Some bad CGI here and there, and Tony Stark got aggravating in this one.<br/><br/>Overall, Age of Ultron was an awesome entry in the MCU (the best since the first Captain America) A must see!"
"iguth","8","1","2","28 April 2019"," More development? Yeah okay
","Age of Ultron is a great sequel to the original Avengers but not quite better than it. It fits very nicely with the other phase two MCU films in that it serves to not only introduce new and complex characters, but to also allow for growth. This movie very clearly teaches the Avengers as a group that they must work together and be honest with each other in order to have the best chance of succeeding. The villain, while not terribly clever, does run with a plan and has morals that make sense. It is always good to have a villain that believes what they are doing is right. The stakes, while not alien level of dangerous, still feel impactful and provide tension. This movie also features maybe the best scene in the MCU when we get to clearly see the cast as friends instead of just heroes.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: I find it amazing that this movie manages to introduce us to a new character, turn him to the good side, and then kill him off all in one movie. I would expect the death to feel less impactful because of those reasons, but it definitely isn't."

But if we talk about storytelling and deepness of event and new characters, especially after watching Avengers: Infinity War I can't say amazing things.

We are also introduced to new Avengers. The film ends with it being open to a sequel which will result in them battling an even greater force.<br/><br/>As always the action is long. The film develops the Hulk/Black Widow romance and Captain America uses a swear word or two. There is some humorous banter as you would expect, but not at the level it was in past films. Gwyneth Paltrow is not in the film. Look for Stan Lee.

There really isn't too much to say now in a review of a film of this calibre, as the previous comments stand. The action is hard-hitting, well-choreographed, and breathless, with the huge budget being put to great use in the depiction of colossal events. Mark Ruffalo is the most valuable player, as usual, with Scarlet Johansson close behind, although my personal favourite is newcomer Elizabeth Olsen who has a storm as Scarlet Witch. AGE OF ULTRON is the typical summer blockbuster, a film that virtually demands you switch off your brain and just sit back and enjoy."

","The whole Antagonist bent on world destruction/domination is becoming a very tired story(Attn Hollywood). At no point in the whole movie was it believable that the Ultron alone challenged the combined power of the avengers. A comic book movie is only as good as its main antagonist relationship to the hero. When the antagonist can challenge a heroes moral code and force them into difficult choices we see their true character revealed. Ultron had potential to be action driven as well as an intellectually compelling story, unfortunately due to poor writing and voice overs the latter never came to fruition. I am personally more interested in seeing a story about morality, which the dark knight does so well. Unfortunately original story telling has taken a back seat to corporate greed in the entertainment industry. Now all we are left with is recycled material, lots of explosion and a watered down villain which is supposed to appeal to mass audience's? Some people are perfectly happy with that structure. I implore fans to demand more..."
"dragonslayer-87950","3","1","2","8 August 2016"," Avengers Age Of JOKETron.....
","Warning Possible Spoilers: <br/><br/>Here are my personal reasons why I don't like it as much as the first.<br/><br/>1= The opening prolong is a little confusing spectrally for those of us have either forgotten or have not seen or have stopped watching, the Agents Of Shield TV Show all together. But still really cool. 2= Compared to the first film The Avengers not only functions as a team but they also and feel look like a real team as to apposed to a punch of men and one woman teaming up for one common case. For just one cause. Not only that you could feel and see that their team work as improved compared to the first film. <br/><br/>3= The humor has not lessened over the previous films. <br/><br/>4= Ultron's Voice really sucks; he doesn't even sound or try to sound terrifying at all. The design of Ultron could have been better. Also the reveal of Ultron could d have been better, because as of how they did is really poorly done, it's like 'You humans are so weak and pathetic I well crush you al like the ants that you are. Remember my name Ultron Mahahahahahahaha.....' In this movie I find that Ultron talks too much. He just never shouts up, not even Loki talks that much in any Avengers films at least he doesn't seem to be. I feel like this Ultron's threat level is nonexistent at all. I fell like this Ultron is like 'Hay look at me I'm doing bad things and I have an evil cliché goal in mind hay look at me hay... Mahhahahaha....' Come on guys that's not the way to show Ultron. You know better than that juts look at the way you always present Loki. If I were to classify or compare Ultron to someone it would be G1 Team Rocket (Pokemon) in the show on every episode they always get blown up, electrocuted and or humiliated in some other way. That's how terrible of a villain I think Ultron is. 5= This Quick Silver is not as good as the 'X Men Days Of Future Past' for a start. I find this Quick Silver really flat, not only this Quick Silver is incredibly flat character wise, but also unlike the ""Days Of Future Past' for once this Quick Silver does not feel like The Flash to truth I'm on the fence about that. It's like the actor who played Quick Silver had a contract which states that he has to say this one line in every scene that he's in that one line is ""What? Too Quick For Ya?"" (or something along those lines.) So in other words one liner. And unfortunately I don't recall him having very many lines during the move, and for some reason his accent really bugs me it almost sounds faked. In addition it always seems like he is talking out of breath and that is way before he used his powers. To me I just don't know why it just does. They should re name this Avengers Age Of JOKETron.<br/><br/>6= On the bright side The Hulk Buster in this is the coolest Hulk Buster ever. It's just unfortunate it wasn't mentioned by name. And speaking of I think the Hulk Buster V Hulk fight is one of the coolest parts of the film, but that's just me. <br/><br/>7= The Natasha/Bruce Banner one on one moments are also one of the coolest moments of the film. You could actually see their friendship grow, that's all I could say without ruining it for you, and besides I want you to witness it yourself its well worth it. <br/><br/>8= Another coolest parts of the film is Vision himself, I just don't like the way they wrote the origins of his name Vision. The origins of his name is basely having his name being mentioned a half a million times in the same scene that he was reborn. He deserves a much better name origin then that. <br/><br/>9= Both the climax and the plot itself both feels like a giant hot mess to me, and to a certain extent kind of pointless. Te me. Don't get me wrong there are a lot of good moments but I still wouldn't call it a master piece, spectrally compeered to the first Avengers film. But don't get wrong still a good own none the less. At least it's not one of those 'turn off your brain' kinds of films. <br/><br/>10= I think my favorite line in the entire film is, Nick Fury's ""Hope For The Best....."" line I just loved that line.<br/><br/>CS= The cool things? It's like Ironman 3 did not happened it has been erased. I'm sorry I just enjoy that movie very much. The only reason that I watch it is to recapture the experience and the memory of the first day of my Oasis Of The Seas Cruse. In the Opal Theater. Another bit of good news is that it's still good enough that you don't even noticed the 2hr 21min run time. And finally a far Warning: DON'T expect an END credits scene like in the previous Marvel films because you would be disappointed like I was. Unfortunately, but there's still a Mid credits scene which was pretty cool. <br/><br/>So in conclusion: Do I hate this film? No. Do I love this film? Not as much as the first Avengers film to be honest. It's a mixed bag."

Ultron was extremely powerful with unique abilities that would make him one of the avengers dangerous threats. The beginning was fantastic with the movie setting the plot and then ending with tons of action and excitement leaving me with wanting to see more. Scarlet Witch and QuickSilver were amazing, each having formidable abilities and a tragic story.

","As the third phase begins in the billion dollar Marvel Cinematic universe, there was always the feeling that the sequel to 'The Avengers' would be a let down. The dream movie of 2012 was the ultimate superhero experience, bringing together a collection of superheroes who had been so brilliantly built up over the previous four years. What could the sequel do to add to that experience? The answer is a lot and much of it unexpected, managing to exceed expectations and bring the Marvel world into a new era. This movie sees the superheroes once again battling an enemy so powerful that their own weaknesses become apparent and the introduction of new members to the elite force make the mix even more compelling. The cast were as great as ever and so familiar in their respective outfits and persona's but it's the additional superheroes that add flavour to this epic sequel. The inclusion of another female superhero, with the brilliant Elizabeth Olsen playing 'Scarlet Witch' seemed to steal the show and bring some much needed darkness to the Marvel world.

"Mr_Sherrinford","9","3","12","27 April 2015"," Maybe some, including myself, just suffer the ""First Viewing"" Effect (Movie is really awesome though)
","(This is the first time that I wrote a review for a movie here in IMDb. Maybe I have to share this because I think I suffered the ""first viewing"" effect and I admit that I doubt that it was a good movie after I left the cinema the first time I have watched it. However, I think my disappointment resulted from my own fault. This, maybe, happened to some. Maybe not. I wrote this also because I find that the movie doesn't deserve so much hate that it tend to affect negatively those who haven't watched the movie yet.)<br/><br/>After watching it again, I have told myself, ""It is awesome after all. Why have I hated it before?""<br/><br/>I have realized some possible reasons: 1. EXPECTATIONS.I am a cinephile. I also love Marvel Movies. I am waiting for this movie for a long time. Whenever I became aware of a possible good movie, I am researching the possible plots and possible characters. I am very hyped. This happened to me before this movie came to theaters. MAYBE I HAVE CREATED MY OWN VERSION of what would happen in the movie (Like Ultron will be like the DC's Joker-Type Villain) and when my expectations did not happen, I became kind of disappointed.And honestly, I cared less at some point in the movie. 2. SPOILERS. Some of the best scenes were already everywhere so those scenes had less impact for me the moment I was watching. 3. LACK OF FOCUS. While watching, the thought of ""It was not what I've expected"" was bothering me even if the movie was far from the climax. Some scenes that seems ""new"" to me gave me the ""want"" to chat with my friend so my attention is not 90-100% in the movie. Thus, I have missed some scenes and important dialogs that made me say to myself that ""the next scenes we're irrelevant even though they really are relevant after all."" <br/><br/>Just an honest opinion here. As a cinephile (Yes, I'm not just fond of Marvel but I really like watching different genre of movies), this ""First Viewing"" effect happens to me often. Maybe this also happened to some. Maybe not. (One of my friend suggest that this also happened to her because a movie's story is sometimes new to her so she would watch again and the second time of watching really fixed everything and helped her find the movie an awesome one which is the real thing).<br/><br/>For those who are still planning to watch the movie for the first time, ""Don't bring the negative feeling that could come from the negative comments you've already read. It's better you don't expect so much. And just Enjoy the movie. After all, this movie, like any other movies, is a treat for yourself. A thing to enjoy ,therefore, releasing some stress. Don't be that one who is like making a school project where you must prepare a critic paper by finding the movie's weaknesses). Watch it with 100% attention to the the movie. <br/><br/>For those who have already watched it (especially those who suffered this ""first viewing effect""), Why not give the movie another shot? Maybe not in cinema again. Maybe some will change his/her view on the movie. And maybe, some will Not. <br/><br/>Thank you for reading this review. (Sorry for some grammatical errors.)"

Only saving grace is some witty one-liners. And 3d induces just headache, adds nothing to the film.

"hksduhksdu","10","2","7","2 May 2016"," Best But Not Perfect
","I don't really have complaints but it is funny that they forced to give some responsibilities to Hawkeye where I never saw his values in all Marvel movies since Avengers. Then in this movie, they made him like managing this team, in which he actually played nothing other than giving more trouble to the team to take care of. I laughed when he said ""yeah, they are my mess"". I meant no disrespect to the actor of it, but just that I see much more values played as widow than this Hawkeye. I tried to watch Avengers and Avengers 2 over and over again but I still could not find his value. I actually think Agent Colson had more values than Hawkeye but then again I have no complaints to Marvel movies so far, just my 2 cents though."
"brando647","7","2","7","27 March 2016"," Fell a Bit Short of My Expectations, but It's a Decent Sequel
","I am an unabashed fan of THE AVENGERS. I understand it has its flaws, particularly in the pacing, but I paid my money for a geek spectacle and that's exactly what was delivered. I count it as one of the best comic book movies, up there with THE DARK KNIGHT. Now that we've gotten a sequel, I expected more. I held AGE OF ULTRON to a higher standard. We've already had the big action bonanza but watching Iron Man, Captain America, and the rest of the crew together on the big screen has been done and it's not enough to carry my interest this time around. The promotional materials made it out to be the darker, edgier sequel with repercussions to the heroes' actions and, though it might be clichéd, an EMPIRE STRIKES BACK vibe. Well, it came close but fell short. I still enjoyed AGE OF ULTRON but I walked out of the theater with a resigned shrug, muttering ""It was all right."" As the film opens, the Avengers are well established and in the midst of an assault on a Hydra base in the country of Slokovia. We're introduced to ""the twins"", Hydra's genetically-enhanced ace up its sleeve: Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda (Elizabeth Olsen) Maximoff. Or, as comic fans know them, Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch. Following their success in Slokovia and the reacquisition of Loki's scepter, Tony Stark gets the wild idea to incorporate the scepter's alien ""programming"" into his proposed artificial intelligence program, Ultron, in hopes of creating an automated Earth defense. It works too well, and Ultron becomes sentient with plans of protecting the Earth in the most efficient means possible: eradicating its pesky human infestation.<br/><br/>Once again, the Avengers biggest opponent is pacing. At nearly 2.5 hours, this is a big movie, packed to the brim with action and plot. The main issue I see is that since half of the characters aren't getting standalone movies (Black Widow, Hawkeye, and the Hulk) we're trying to cram their personal story elements into a movie that should be focused on the whole ""sentient robot intent on destroy human life"" bit. Whereas the first movie ground to a halt following the assault on the Hellicarrier so the characters could mourn their loss and regroup for the final climactic battle, AGE OF ULTRON does the same with a stint at a ""safe house"" where we show the human side to being part of a hero team. Interesting concept to be explored in a superhero film, but probably not the best time right now. You want to give a romantic subplot to Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff? Fine. Do it in a Hulk and/or Black Widow movie. Iron Man, Captain America, and Thor each have their own film series to get the minutiae out of the way so that, when we get the band back together for a big show, we can incorporate elements of their individual struggles without stopping the main story thread to build on them further. When you've got this amount of bigger than life characters (and cast) sharing the screen, we need to be economical in how we spend that 2.5 hours. I mean, AGE OF ULTRON feels like it's equally part Hawkeye/Jeremy Renner apology for turning him into a mind-controlled zombie in the first film. We're treated to extra backstory for the character and he gets some extra time in the spotlight for action and zingers.<br/><br/>I'm also a little tired of the big action spectacle finale. It was awesome in THE AVENGERS because it was our first time seeing all these major characters fighting side-by-side on the big screen. So sure, whatever, give me a half hour final battle with the Avengers wiping out an invasion of faceless alien enemies. In the sequel, I expect a little more creativity. And what did we get? A half hour final battle with the Avengers wiping out an invasion of faceless robot enemies. Look, I love watching the Avengers crush the villain and their faceless CG army as much as the next fan but I wouldn't mind changing things up a bit. These guys are more than fists. Let's get a problem for the Avengers that isn't easily resolved by smashing wave after wave of baddies. I absolutely loved the first half of this movie, where the Avengers are faced with an enemy they aren't prepared to encounter. Not Ultron (as much as I loved the character) but the Scarlet Witch. She gets into their heads and uses their fears and concerns against them, attacking them on an emotional level and sending them to whimper in the corner. Or, if you're the Hulk, rampaging through an unsuspecting downtown metropolis. Wanda/Scarlet Witch was an awesome addition to the character roster for the Marvel Cinematic Universe. Olsen does a phenomenal job giving her a physicality to her ""spell-casting"" and an innocence to counter her brother's angry freedom-fighter persona. I'm not 100% sold on her eastern European accent yet, but it's not distracting. Johnson's Quicksilver doesn't steal the spotlight as Evan Peters did in Fox's DAYS OF FUTURE PAST but he does a fine job with minimal material. Really, I think Quicksilver is only here because they wanted to bring in Scarlet Witch and figured it was a package deal. Another excellent addition is the Vision, who's involvement in the film is pretty important to the plot so I won't go into the how's and why's but I will say I was most excited to see him brought to the franchise. Very, very cool to bring in the Vision.<br/><br/>AGE OF ULTRON isn't a bad movie but it doesn't rise above and beyond THE AVENGERS as I hoped it would. It's got some excellent material in there and some obvious fan service to get us cheering. It loses steam once we hit the safe house but you can tell they were trying to go bigger this time around. They still just working out the kinks."
"ohad-84719","10","2","7","12 March 2016"," Avengers: Age of Ultron
","Let's just start in that ""Marvel's Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is truly the biggest Marvel movie sequel to date. It has lots of excellent action sequences ,battles and more ,But most of all was the titular Ultron, He is actually an evil rogue robot android and he is totally funny villain ,In his terrifying and eccentric performance ,James Spader give us what Tom Hiddleston's partly-dumb villain Loki in the previous film didn't gave us and it is fun and a real scheme. Ultron's scheme is definitely to eradicate human race and replace them with his robotic army and then to take over the Earth ,as all comic book villain does. However, Loki wanted to rule over Earth and humanity in order to become a king ,what he didn't got in the first ""Thor"" in 2011. AOU also has a great cast job not only by the original Avengers from the first film ,and not only by Samuel L Jackson's SHIELD Director Nick Fury ,but also Aaron Taylor Johnson who already starred as a superhero in the two ""Kick-Ass"" films ,this time ,he returns as a real superhero ,alongside the beautiful Elizabeth Olsen ,and then we have the excellent Paul Betanny who gave us voice acting for JARVIS in the three Iron Man films and in the previous film of the Avengers ,but this time ,JARVIS becomes Vision ,a powerful android created by our funny movie antagonist ,and he gives us not also worthy to the Asgardian mighty big bodied blonde Avenger's Mjolnir hammer but also shows us an android with sympathy and human features. The fantastic film music by the excellent Brian Tyler and by Danny Elfman ,who composed already two Marvel films (""Spider- Man"" and ""Spider-Man 2"") ,shows us what the great Alan Silvestri didn't succeeded to renew ,and the duo are doing it in so equal and epic way. For ending ,Avengers: AOU is definitely the biggest and excellent Marvel movie to date maybe more than its first proceedor ,and maybe more than the other MCU films that we saw years prior. Rating: 10/10 - It is an epic superhero movie about unity ,team work and back-to-back help when the things turn wrong."
"FallenEye","7","2","7","22 December 2015"," An AWESOME Disappointment
","This movie was meant to be the biggest movie, not only of 2015, but of all time thus far; however, it buckled under all that weight. But that's the thing about this movie, that, it is sooo big, that even under all that pressure, and under the awesome wielding of Whedon, a failure (in comparison to what it was meant to be) still managed to be the best blockbuster of 2015, outright and hands down.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon, like Christopher Nolan, is one hell of an intelligent director, and you sense it in his rendition. Age of Ultron didn't live up to it's potential fine; some scenes felt rushed or short lived, some fight sequences left you wanting, but, the story was fluent, the acting - quality, and the effects, stunning. Ben Davis, again was amazing, and overall, I love how enormous, this movie was. This is what you do, with a budget upwards of $250 Million Dollars.<br/><br/>The comedic aspect was over done, and it's obvious why; it is Marvel's modus operandi, not Whedons... Like how The Wachowski's fell into that trap with Jupiter Ascending. Whedon is a dark, and in-depth story teller, and I wish they would've let him be that.<br/><br/>Furious 7 and Jurassic World do not deserve a higher grossing than this marvelous Whedon work, but, it is what it is.<br/><br/>I want to give Age of Ultron 8/10, but it was meant to be 9.5/10, so, I'll give 7.9/10. Well done Whedon and team."
"alex_j-573-361716","7","2","7","19 November 2015"," Not BAD..Just disappointing.
","As the title to my review suggests, Age of Ultron is not a terribe movie, but the consensus I'm hearing the most is that it could not realistically live up to the hype and quality of the first avengers. I agree with this but I do believe it could have been better than it was. First off, there was little to no dramatic tension in my opinion,(I've indicated a spoiler warning) the death of quick silver in my opinion did not do anything to push forward the plot of the movie or help in the least bit in establishing a darker tone. It followed too closely the same formula as the first film and even had a more likable, interesting and entertaining villain. Ultron felt too much like a generic evil robot, and I personally find he had no personality, and was not menacing, instead he reminded me more of a twisted version of tony stark with a lot of the same sarcastic charm and wit, but again with an evil twist. Other than the action scene with ironman facing the hulk, many of the other moments felt a bit sloppy especially the last act with bullets explosions and metal flying all over the place. It simply wasn't engaging and was a bit frustrating to follow, some more emphasis was given to other characters that didn't get their time to shine from the last film, this was not well complimented with side plots that felt needless and unnecessary. Some new character introductions notably vision were quite sweet, as well as other easter eggs like mentioning wakanda, and a Ulysses klaw cameo were also pleasant, the film itself felt a bit too much like a set up for future events and lacked focus. My last comment, turning a small city into, pretty much a meteor...I guess clever but uuhh...no. Overall not a bad movie, the characters were fine and again the easter eggs and references were pleasant and it did have a great stand out fight scene as mentioned earlier, So it gets a 7 in my books."
"andrewnmiller","10","2","7","25 October 2015"," A purely awesome film.
","After seeing the first Avengers and having loved it, I couldn't wait to see Avengers: Age of Ultron and upon seeing the teaser trailer, my expectations for this film shot through the roof and when I sat down to watch the movie in the theater with a few friends, it surpassed most of my expectations while there were a few things that could have been done better.<br/><br/>The film opens with The Avengers engaged with Hydra forces lead by Wolfgang von Strucker. While attacking the base, the team encounters two of von Strucker's test subjects, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff and arrest von Strucker, while Tony Stark recovers Loki's scepter. Stark and Bruce Banner discover an A.I. within the scepter and use it to finish Tony's world protection plan called ""Ultron"". Unfortunately, once Ultron is created, he comes to believe that the human race must be wiped off the face of the earth in order to save it. He then attacks the Avengers at their base and escapes with the scepter, begins to build an army of drones and recruits the Miximoff twins. Now, it's up to the Avengers to stop Ultron before he can fulfill his plan.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon had a lot to live up to with this movie and he managed to pack an awful lot into a two and a half hour film and juggles the humor, action and drama very well. Not a single moment in the movie felt wasted and every scene adds to the overall film. The characters also seem much more developed and Joss does a fantastic job digging deeper into each hero's psyche and making each one relatable. Whedon also keeps the tone dark yet the movie does have some light moments and it gave me exactly what I wanted from a superhero movie.<br/><br/>Right from the start, the film chucks the team right into some deafening action, pulling us into a whirlwind of dangerous and visually unstoppable action scenes that allow every smash, punch, flash of light and battle to essentially become near-incredible forms of eye-crushing sights and it's when our heroes go into combat that the movie overwhelms our famished eyes and maintains complete control over the viewer's interest, allowing the impressed viewers to follow the visual spectacle as it reaches beyond the audience's mind. I could go on and on about the battle between Iron Man in the Hulk Buster suit and a rampaging Hulk because it's just so damn awesome and the final showdown between The Avengers and Ultron's army almost tops the battle in the first film. The visual effects are great and serve a huge purpose when the action is taking place. The musical score by Danny Elfman and Brian Taylor fits the film perfectly and gives it life.<br/><br/>As with the first film, the way the characters interact and play off one another works very well here and not one word of dialog didn't work. The humor couldn't have been better and I found myself laughing my ass off more than once during the course of this movie. The acting is also top-notch with each actor bringing their A game when playing these characters.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. never fails to astonish me as Iron Man/Tony Stark in these movies. From his intelligence and skill to his billionaire playboy personality and humor, Downey has perfected the role and made it his own. Chris Evans once again shires as Steve Rogers/Captain America, bringing a real sense of morality and bravery to the role and the argument between Rogers and Stark sows the seeds for Captain America: Civil War. Scarlett Johansson once again is awesome as Black Widow and keeps on proving that women are just as capable of kicking ass as guys are and it was great to see a little of her back-story in the movie. Chris Hemsworth is awesome as Thor, throwing out some really funny lines throughout the movie as well as being a total bad ass in the battle scenes. Mark Ruffalo rocks it again as Bruce Banner/The Incredible Hulk, juggling the nerdy scientist and the raging green monster extremely well and still manages to be quite humorous at times. One complaint that I had with the first Avengers film was Hawkeye not getting enough time on screen, but thankfully, there's more of him here; Jeremy Renner is terrific in the role, gets a chance to develop the character more and is a total boss in the action scenes. To overlook the new characters in AOU, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision, would be unjust because all three play their roles very well. Aaron Taylor-Johnson is good as Quicksilver, capturing the arrogance of the Quicksilver from the comics perfectly, but while I did like Johnson; Evan Peters is and will always be the definitive Quicksilver. Elisabeth Olsen plays the role of Scarlet Witch very well and really comes into her own in the final battle. Paul Bettany is great as Vision. Sam Jackson kills it again as Nick Fury. Anthony Mackie shows up as Falcon and kicks plenty of ass as does Don Cheadle as War Machine. James Spader was born to voice the character of Ultron by being crafty, hilarious, and menacing and portrays both sides of Ultron to perfection.<br/><br/>Now, this film isn't entirely perfect, Ultron is extremely underdeveloped and comes across as a whiny villain and not a major threat to the Avengers. The Black Widow-Hulk romance felt out of place and serve no purpose to the overall story and the set-ups for Black Panther and Thor: Ragnarok felt shoehorned in and didn't add anything to the movie.<br/><br/>Yet, I still enjoyed this movie, it's action-packed, has some strong emotional moments, the score is great, the actors all give top-notch performances, and the post-credits stinger sets up the rest of the MCU nicely. So, do yourself a favor and watch Avengers: Age of Ultron, you'll have a blast watching it."
"p-jonsson","7","2","7","20 October 2015"," A good action / special effects / super-hero movie.
","This is another one of those movies that you watch primarily for the special effects with you favourite super heroes slugging it out. It is a classical Hollywood product where the story is mostly there just as a vehicle for allowing the special effects team to do their business. As such it is a success.<br/><br/>The movie starts of with a display of action and the afore mentioned special effects with an attack by the Avengers on a bad guy stronghold. Not surprisingly the events sows the seeds for things to come.<br/><br/>The movie starts off with quite an interesting story idea with the activation of Ultron. However, once he materializes as a physical entity, it became a bit of seen that, been there and done that. Ultron just turns into yet another ""standard"" comic book villain a' la Megatron running around trying to look intimidating while implementing his diabolical scheme. Okay, there was a bit of originality here and there but with the good start I kind of expected a wee bit more.<br/><br/>Having said that, the movie does indeed fulfil its purpose of showing off a bunch of super heroes slugging it out in a flurry of special effects and, although the story idea was perhaps not used as intelligently as I had hoped, it is not bad (for this kind of movie of course) and hangs together pretty okay. Sure, it is somewhat contrived and the means by which Ultron tries to exterminate humanity is overly complicated but it is still a decent story.<br/><br/>Overall the movie was entertaining and provided the necessary special effects and super hero fix for those who are inclined to enjoy those kind of movies. I certainly am and, not surprisingly, the kids liked it as well."
"dinalt10","5","2","7","23 September 2015"," Mediocre at best
","Sad to say this film was a massive disappointment.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed all the Marvel adaptations to date. Even those I felt were weak (Iron Man 2&3 and Thor:Dark World) were watchable.<br/><br/>And I've enjoyed Josh Whedons shows and films for years, so it feels really bad giving this film a bad rating.<br/><br/>But Age Of Ultron should be renamed as Age Of Boring. Coming after the excellent 'Avengers Assemble' and the near perfect 'Captain America: Winter Soldier', this film really fails to satisfy.<br/><br/>Reading online, it seems there were some artistic differences between studio and director. And that's a shame, as it's created a 250 million dollar turd.<br/><br/>Yes, bang for buck you get a lot of on screen action. But that doesn't excuse a film with no heart and no real substance. If I wanted that, I'd watch any of the Transformer films.<br/><br/>The 'love story' between Widow and Hulk??? Really??? Where the hell did that come from ? Felt forced and look forced.<br/><br/>The story's disjointed, and the biggest budget in the world can't disguise that. Although the characters get screen time, they feel underused. Maybe it's trying to give them all equal time, but they don't feel like a team.<br/><br/>A weak villain, who's basically defeated with a single punch from Hulk at the end, and an army of robots who are so weak it's embarrassing.<br/><br/>I'm glad I only rented this online, as I usually buy the DVD when it's released. This was like the film version of elevator music, and I found myself doing other things while the film was running. <br/><br/>Possibly the worst thing was the ending. A new lineup of Avengers which look like the end of the line for the Avengers. Dull characters, but probably cheaper to employ than the current lineup.<br/><br/>Avoid unless you're watching to kill time."
"leonblackwood","7","2","7","21 September 2015"," Brilliant action but I preferred the first Avengers movie. 7/10
","Review: I'm really in two minds about this films because I liked epic action scenes and banter between the characters but none of them have really moved on from the first movie. I did prefer the action in the first Avengers and the introduction of the Hulk was brilliant but he was hardly in this movie. Anyway, the movies is about the Avengers taking on the evil Ultron who says that he wants to save the world but he really wants to destroy it. I think that's about it really! There's loads of technical jargon throughout the movie, which really went over my head but there are some other great elements like the introduction of 3 new characters, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Vision. The attention to detail was spot on and I was on the edge of my seat throughout the whole movie but I still preferred the first film, mainly because of the shock factor. The fight between the Hulk and Ironman was one of the greatest scenes in the film and I enjoyed the scene when everyone was trying to pick up Thors mallet but I think my expectations were a bit too high. Anyway, it's definitely one to watch but I won't rate it as highly as the first movie! Enjoyable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: This franchise has definitely become the biggest of all time by taking the 4th and 6th place in the worldwide gross chart. Robert Downey Jr. also became the highest paid actor in 2014 with a massive $75million with Dwayne Johnson coming second with $52million. At 50 years old, Robert Downey Jr. has really turned his life around after being addicted to drugs and getting a lot of negative press. His career started in 1970 in a small movie called Pound and he hasn't turned back since. He was nominated for an Oscar in 1993 for his fantastic role as Chaplin but he lost out to Al Pacino in Scent of a Woman. He also was nominated for an Oscar for the best Supporting role in the extremely funny Tropic Thunder in 2009 which he also lost to the late Heath Ledger for his interpretation as the Joker in the Dark Knight.  I've always loved his acting and his unique screen charisma and he was still able to pull out great performances while he was under the influence. With another Sherlock Holmes movie in the pipeline along with Captain America: Civil War and Pinocchio, I'm glad to see that he has turned his life around to become one of the biggest stars in the world. With that aside, this movie was directed by Joss Whedon who wrote the original Toy Story, Alien Resurrection, Titan A.E., Atlantis, Serenity and both Avengers movies. He also directed the Avengers movies along with Serenity and he has definitely changed cinema with his fantastic action scenes and detailed story lines. <br/><br/>Budget: $250million Worldwide Gross: $1.4billion<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into the Marvel Avengers franchise were the superheroes fight against evil to save the world. 7/10"

"joshuadrake-91275","9","2","7","14 September 2015"," Successful sequel to the first Avengers
","This is a movie review for the 2015 sequel to the critically-acclaimed 2012 film, THE AVENGERS. This is the sequel, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, which is once again written and directed by Joss Whedon. After the success of the THE AVENGERS, another sequel was planned for a release of summer 2015, with the writer and director Joss Whedon returning and the entire cast retuning.<br/><br/>With S.H.I.E.L.D. destroying (after the events of the previous film) and the Avengers needing a hiatus from stopping threats, Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, Ultron: a self-aware, self-teaching, artificial intelligence. However, his plan backfires when Ultron decides that humans are the main enemy and sets out to eradicate them from Earth, leaving it up to Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, along with support from Nick Fury and Maria Hill, to stop him from destroying all life on Earth.<br/><br/>Along the way the Avengers encounter the powerful twins, Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch, who joins them in their fight becomes Avengers as well. They also encounter the familiar Vision.<br/><br/>I love the story of the sequel. I think I have to give credit to writer and director and creator of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon because he wrote the hell out of a script and directed this film wonderfully and he does let the story run through without feeling like a montage and 141 minutes --- 2 hours and 21 minutes long --- It is really okay and amazing because I have long waited for this movie because this one of my top 10 highly-anticipated movies of 2015 and this is really cool and Marvel does an incredible job with this film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. once again steals the show as Tony Stark / Iron Man and he shines in this film and he does a fantastic job this time around. Chris Hemsworth once again plays the role of Thor after playing him in the first two Thor movies, the first Avengers movie and he played James Hunt in the Ron Howard biography film RUSH and he does incredible, too. Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner return in their roles as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, Steve Rogers / Captain America and Clint Barton / Hawkeye and they all do an amazing job.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff once again and she is great, but a lot of things had to be done because during the production of this film, she was pregnant with her second or first child, I don't know. Don Cheadle returns as Colonel James Rhodes and it is great to see him once again as Iron Patriot. Paul Bettany plays Vision and J.A.R.V.I.S. and he does great as both of them.<br/><br/>Now, we have the new characters: Aaron Taylor Johnson plays the role of Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and it is really good to see him play a superhero again after playing in GODZILLA and the superhero films KICK-ASS and KICK-ASS 2 and he does really great and amazing as Quicksilver.<br/><br/>We finally get to Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and she is really cool and she is so HOT as Scarlet Witch and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen would be really proud once they see there sister in the film. The performance from her is really great and she screams so loudly and she did a great job with the scream for her character and she is so awesome.<br/><br/>Finally, James Spader plays the title role and villain Ultron and he is simply amazing. Nothing else to say about him, he should win an Oscar for playing a villain, but it's not really going to happen.<br/><br/>The action is just amazing and when stuff goes down, stuff in the action sequences is going down and this is really amazing and fantastic for the film and I really do like the way the action is presented in 3D and IMAX 3D and this film is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format.<br/><br/>The trailers were the reason that I liked this movie and because everyone comes back for this sequel and they introduce new characters and they really done this really great. The music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman is really great and amazing. The cinematography, production design, editing, costume design, sound design and visual effects are all amazing, especially with the battle between the heroes and the Ultron drones and it was really cool.<br/><br/>Overall, I love AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is really amazing and fantastic. This movie does not have any major flaws at all and I really think this deserve a lot of praise because this movie is just simply great. My rating is exactly a 9 out of 10. This is a superhero movie that I don't think gets enough critical attention and praise. I can't wait for the two-part sequel to this film, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, which PART 1 will be released in May of 2018 and PART 2 to be released in May of 2019. The stakes will be raised up for the next two AVENGERS movies and it will be really cool."
"mukherjeesubham93","7","2","7","7 September 2015"," Good, but....
","I had huge expectations from avengers AOU, and the good things first, unlike my fellow reviewers, whose reactions have been pretty negative, I would like to state clearly, it is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, if you are willing to have some fun, but nothing beyond that... Now the problem is it is nothing beyond a good old formulaic superhero movie. It began with a bang, and it is not a understatement when I say it is one of the most electrifying starts to a movie I have ever seen. The story after that however is not so great. The film is basically about ultron trying to destroy the world and our heroes trying to stop them...nothing more. Numerous characters appear from the marvel universe...new characters quicksilver played by Aaron Taylor Johnson and scarlet witch played by Elizabeth Olsen are introduced. Vision comes to life in the film....there is so much happening in the movie, that the movie might feel a bit rushed at times. Don't expect character development in case of Thor, iron man and captain, but hawk eye, scarlet and quicksilver are given quite some screen time this time....also there is romance between banner and romanoff. In the performances there is little to choose from but Jeremy runner as hawk eye is a surprise package, James spader does well as ultron he did sound menacing. The movie is technically topnotch...it has a lot of action and it is a good thing because they look great. Now coming to the movie's biggest problem, humour. I did not like iron man 3 for the same reason and here too, there is excessive humour, which robs the film of some much needed intensity. The climactic fight was so great in avengers, because it had that dramatic tension. But here however even there, everyone is cracking jokes...why rob a scene of its dramatic merit. The film would have been so much more impactive without humour in some otherwise intense scenes. It is true, it is a superhero movie, should be fun but still some of the jokes in the movie are very ill placed. Overall, avengers AOU is a very entertaining watch but it is just another superhero movie with a bigger budget and better action sequences. The pity is it could have been so much more without its comical tone..the movie ends with thanos announcing his arrival. The infinity wars begin in the new film...hopefully new directors Antony and Joe Russo and reestablish the drama the first one had....and they certainly have it in them, we all saw captain America 2. So here's hoping for a better future!"
"monkeyminion","7","2","7","7 July 2015"," Amazing movie but not as good as first!
","This movie had a touch of everything; Comedy, Action, Suspense, Drama, and Romance. The advertising went way too overboard, might as well release the whole movie marvel if you want to release 25 5 minute trailers. For some reason this movie did not give me the goosebumps of the hair raising excitement as the first spontaneous Avengers. I believe after watching all of the trailers and sneak peaks I ran out of excitement and I knew what was going to happen in every scene. What really made me angry was the mid-credit scene, why use Thanos in the second avengers movie when we have to watch 5 more marvel movies to see him. Heres a hint marvel, save Thanos for civil war and give us a peek of Spiderman so we don't have to watch him being bit by a spider for the millionth time."
"masongibbard","10","2","7","10 June 2015"," Top Film
","This action packed thrill ride hit the cinemas on the 2nd May 2015, and has been a blockbuster ever since, and is the sequel to the Marvel hit The Avengers. The film is full of action from beginning to end, making any other action classic look minuscule. This blockbuster tops the original Avengers, as it has a better storyline. Unlike the original this film begins with a action scene, as the other one took around 30 minutes to get going. Tony Stark and his group of superhero buddies, face a upheaval and face the daunting task of defeating their own creation of Ultron. This mega mind seeks to destroy the Avengers and create world peace but has the wrong idea on how to create it.<br/><br/>In The Avengers 2 : Age of Ultron we are faced with 2 new characters that join the team. The two are twins and are a social experiment. Who have a vendetta against one of the Avenging gang, but later face the harsh reality of being on the wrong side, Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver both fight for good but are both caught on the wrong side. The two children of Hydra face difficult challenges thorough the epic, and one faces a life changing event that will change their view and aspect on the world for ever. The Avengers 2 : Age of Ultron is a very good film, filled with action and romance from 2 unsuspected characters. Marvel as a world-wide company have exceeded all expectations of the film and made it better than the original."
"luccomix","10","2","7","31 May 2015"," On a par with the original
","Tony Stark enlists Bruce Banner to create the ultimate AI to secure world peace. It does not end well. Or does it? The MCU keeps on providing top-notch material, and this movie is no exception. The previous installment on the Avengers franchise is a tough act to follow, even more now that we are used to see all the big guns together in the same movie. Taking this into account, I'd say this sequel is on a par with the original. Each scene segues seamlessly into the next and there's the perfect mixture of humor, drama and eye-popping adventure. We are not only treated with the usual top- quality eye candy (in this case, a peek inside the Avengers Mansion, the Hulkbuster armor and the Scarlet Witch-induced nightmares, just to name a few) but also great dialog and relationships. Yes, relationships are the core strength of this movie, as seen on the scene where they just relax sipping a drink and bet about who is worthy enough to lift Mjölnir, or when Cap gives love advice to Bruce. We even get a glimpse of Hawkeye's family life! The cast is excellent, but the highlights of this entry are the franchise newcomers: James Spader is spot-on as Ultron and Paul Bettany excels as the Vision. Joss Whedon's swan song is a real winner."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","10","2","7","13 May 2015"," Wow This Film was Great!. This is My Favorite Movie of 2015.
","This Film was Badass and Adrenaline pumping and very exciting!. Avengeres Age of Ultron was Action Packed from beginning to End and I Loved the film. The Film is a definite Must See,It starts with a Bang and Ends with a Bang.The cast was great the acting was good and the special effects were top notch. I must say The Ultron Robot was very strong and there were times where he was quite creepy. I have to admit I was not a fan of Ultrons Jokes though.I preferred it when He was serious because he was more intimidating then.James Spader Voiced Ultron very well.The story of how the Ultron Robot came to be was interesting and the story overall was interesting and the movie was full of great Action scenes and good effects.This film blew me away and I thought it was better than the First Avengers.
This is probably the most Action Packed Film out of all the Marvel Films and the Darkest too. The Ultron Robot put up a very good fight and he was Fun to watch and so we're the Avengers and I liked most of their jokes I thought their jokes lightened the mood of the film a bit. Thor was probably the funniest out of the group especially during the scenes he's telling the Avengers they can Not lift his Hammer,he really cracked me up in those scenes.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the character development of the Avengers in this film too and I thought there were some nice emotional scenes between them especially between Hulk and Black Widow. Some people say it felt forced But I Disagree I thought it was convincing and emotional especially when the hulk tells black widow he thinks he's too dangerous and he does not want to hurt her or anyone else. I thought that was a nice character moment and I also liked how each of the Avengers Helped each other Fight so when one was in trouble another one would step in and help them.<br/><br/>I will Admit there were a couple of things that bugged me one of them was The Twins, from the start of the movie their motivation is unclear and I was a bit confused it seemed as if they could not decide what side they were on Ultrons side or the Avengers side. Also I did not care about Scarlet witches Visions I thought they were weird and they took me out of the movie a bit.Also I did not like it when she controlled the Avengers and made them fight each other.I preferred it when they all worked together as a team to fight Ultron. I never cared much for the twins in the first place to be honest maybe its because I knew nothing about them. Quicksilver had a few cool moments and Scarlet witch kicked some Ass but to be honest I liked the Avengers More than the Twins. Thor and Captain America are my two Favourites and they kicked a lot of Ass too.
I liked how the Avengers all worked together and beat up dozens of Robots I thought that was very Fun to watch.I also thought the vision was an interesting character and I liked how he Helped the Avengers Fight.<br/><br/>Just a friendly warning the Action in this Film is VERY over the top there are a lot of explosions and Shootings and a lot of destruction but that's exactly what I saw the film for and I'm glad I watched it I thought it was Epic. You don't go and see a film like this and Not expect to see Over the top Action that's exactly what you should expect and I Loved every minute of it.it truly was mesmerising Sci-Fi Action.I also enjoyed the music in the film.I Highly recommend the film I thought it was Brilliant!."
"jbcardar","10","2","7","12 May 2015"," Probably the best film of the year
","I honestly don't understand why this film got such underwhelming reviews. I know some people haven't entirely caught up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but I think some people are just haters or DC fanboys.<br/><br/>I think this film is probably going to be the best film of the year. It wasn't perfect, but no Marvel film has been. Even Guardians wasn't perfect. This film was much better than the first film. It's got better action, a better villain, (Loki wasn't entirely established until Thor 2, but he's still almost as good in the first film) much more humor, and a cast of well acted characters that knocks Avengers out of the park. <br/><br/>Some people claimed that the story was weak, but all marvel story's are a platform for the action. This one was no different. And the final battle was no more ridiculous than the last 5 marvel films. Vision was by far the best part of the film, and he completely stole the show. Ultron gave a great performance with much more personality and humor than I expected, and stands as the MCU's 2nd best villain. Some people thought he was too soft, but I thought he would have been boring if they made him a stone cold killer. Hawkeye's performance was also much better, and he ranked as my 3rd favorite character in this film. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were also great, and as for the other characters, they were no worse than in the first film (except Thor)<br/><br/>My only real nitpicks are minor, and the only thing that took away any enjoyment were the jumpscares. Some of the characters didn't improve much, HYDRA was wasted (even though the opening sequence was awesome), death didn't play much of a theme at all, despite what Whedon said, so I felt like I was lied too, and the Black Widow/Hulk romance, while interesting felt incomplete. The ending and mid credits scene also fell flat.<br/><br/>Don't pay attention to the metascore when you go to see this movie (because I know you will) and don't lower your expectations. I didn't, and I wasn't disappointed."
"cocobrazier74","9","2","7","11 May 2015"," Great time! But not quite there...
","While the Age of Ultron does feel similar to the previous films in the Marvel cinematic universe the personalities of the full team of Avengers contributes to the enjoyment of this film. The chemistry of the actors provides for many humorous moments and allows for entertaining breaks between the awesome fight scenes. I'm interested to see a villain like Thanos who has had more build up for future films. Ultron was the best villain of Marvel phase 2 but his creation and character could have been fleshed out more and that would have added to this film. Marvel has yet to present a villain that meets the coolness of the good guys. Batman has the Joker, Superman has Lex Luther but Marvel seems to be struggling to find a villain that will last against their awesome heroes. Lets hope Thanos doesn't turn out to be lame."

","Some spoilers:Let me say this to everyone who will read this review:I loved the first Avengers movie.Its my 4th favorite movie of all time.This sequel I love as well.Everything I loved in the first one was in this sequel with some new additions.The Hulkbuster scene stole the show with its total destruction with Iron man Punching Hulk in the face over and over.It was very funny with a lot of heart and humanity.Scarlet Witch,Quicksilver,and Vision were nice additions to the film.I loved James Spader as Ultron his voice alone was intriguing and very intimidating.The action scenes were amazing with top notch visual effects and the ending was highly enjoyable.I love this movie with a burning passion and I love the characters in it.All the actors did superb work and made one of the most entertaining sequels i have ever seen.10 out of 10 the best film of 2015 for me."

The film starts off with a battle that is not explained the first 10mins use more CGI that in the entire first avengers outing, the plot is basic ultron tries to end the world and avengers try stop it but the way the storytelling is told, makes it very dull for large parts of the film there is too many jokes in the film and unlike the first avengers film this one you wont want to watch again, it truly is a painful disappointment after all the hype and stuff i was saying on my radio show i now have to go bk on air and say i was wrong. lets hope the next film is not as bad as this one or marvel will start to lose credibility"
"blakiepeterson","7","2","7","4 May 2015"," An Explosive Sequel To A Seemingly Unbeatable Cultural Phenomenon
","The superhero movie has become a cultural juggernaut blown way out of proportion. Since ""Iron Man"" debuted in 2008, our days, months, and years have thrived off of an anticipatory thirst for the latest action-packed face-off. In the space of seven years, we've been consumed by eleven different ""Avengers"" blockbusters, some introductions, some sequels, some forgettable, all fun. For such silly movies, they have been blessed to have been directed by some of Hollywood's most brilliant minds (Joss Whedon, Kenneth Branagh, Shane Black, Jon Favreau), in the process piecing together an array of junk foods that inexplicably taste healthy. It's a wonder that a feeling of repetition is not the first thing on everyone's mind – how many times can clever supers defeat a seemingly unbeatable foe? – but then again, it's a wonder that the majority of superhero movies, ones of the last decade, that is, have been so, so, so ... pardon my generality, good. Blast ""Iron Man 2"" for its flatness, insult ""Thor: The Dark World"" for its monotonous action (I did neither, by the way); fact is, there has not been a straight-up dud in this apparently never ending franchise. <br/><br/>""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is further evidence of a billion-dollar machine that won't be breaking down any time soon. Surely, nothing will top its world-stopping predecessor or 2014's impeccably enthralling ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", but the infectious high that comes along with our favorite superheroes getting together for a quasi-madcap hoedown is unlike any other. Take for instance, a scene in which the heroes are chilling over drinks at Tony Stark's (Robert Downey Jr.) maximalist pad, all attempting to lift Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) hammer with bloated confidence. It's a moment of comedic delight that melts our faces off. It's too much. We've learned to love these characters over the years, and by now, they're the fictional BFFs we never knew we'd have. The creators of these films, especially Whedon, have crafted a near perfect balance between witty repartee and mind-blowing action sequences (sound effect and all).<br/><br/>""AOU"", though, takes a turn hardly felt by these epics. It makes the characters – I can't believe I'm writing this cringe-worthy line – more *** human *** than ever. It gives Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) a wife (Linda Cardellinli) and kids. Delves into Black Widow's (Scarlett Johansson) psychologically scarring childhood. Taps into Captain America (Chris Evans) and Thor's longing for a past when things weren't so vastly deterred by city/state/country/world destroying masterminds. And, not to mention, ""AOU"" spends much of its length showing them defeated, distraught over the titular villain's nearly indestructible prowess. As usual, we know that our favorite good guys will eventually win the fight against our new favorite bad guy (apologies to villainous staple Loki) – but ""AOU"" works so well because its figures aren't going through the motions like they normally do. They're more insecure and tired than ever. They'll be back for more adventures, but remaining their energetic young selves might start to become an unavoidable obstacle course of willingness.<br/><br/>This time around, The Avengers are back to take down an extremely personal baddie. Personal because he's the result of Tony Stark's attempt to bring artificial intelligence to life. Personal because this A.I., also known as Ultron (voiced by a slippery James Spader), was programmed to protect humanity but believes that salvation comes in the form of extinction and rebirth. Long story short, Ultron, with silky braininess to back himself up, wants to destroy the world. He views destruction as a scientific phenomenon that needs to occur for the sake of evolution, explaining his plans like a level-headed chemist instead of a robot that, robot voiced, must ... destroy ... human ... race. He manipulates a pair of Russian twins with fantastical powers as his sidekicks, the lightning fast Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) and the telekinetically charged Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). In comparison to the mighty Ultron, Loki and his posse seem like featherweights; Ultron's strategically strong actions, paired with Quicksilver's ability to literally beat enemies to the punch and Scarlet Witch's talent to influence the minds of her opponents, nearly knocks The Avengers down, both physically and mentally.<br/><br/>The best thing about ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is that it doesn't much feel like a sequel, rather a continuation of the series of films we've all, admittedly, watched more than once. There's no need to explain motives, the current situation, or, really, any background information – the film knows that we're aware of what's at stake, and so it goes right into the meat, skipping slimming appetizers altogether. It begins with a bombastic action sequence and never slows down. There are more moments of reflection and quiet than ever, making ""AOU"" the most thoughtful ""Avengers"" movie yet, but even then, power radiates from its writing, acting, and directing. It's more than professionally executed action; it's quality entertainment. These characters could easily be in a drama where there are no Shakespearian villains to defeat, and they would remain interesting. By tapping into what really makes them tick, ""AOU"" is, by far, the most personal two-and-a-half hours in any of these characters' on-screen lives.<br/><br/>But don't expect things to slow down. The climax, which sees a city lifted up hundreds of feet into the air by Ultron, is hugely exciting, and the brawls, work and play, are bigger and better. If ""AOU"" was released years ago, it might have read as being ridiculously refreshing. Nearly a decade later, it's just another spectacular addition to a culturally significant series.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com"
"Joxerlives","7","2","7","3 May 2015"," Joss should really go back to TV
","Went to see it, liked it better than the first one, some great touches like Thor's little double take when Cap America is able to move his hammer by about a millimetre. Quite surreal as my train to work takes me past Hendon Police College in London and you can see the tower blocks and other buildings they used for the Russian town. I'm not sure what Sir Robert Peel would have thought about his statue was transformed into Lenin for the length of the filming? It lacked the magic of Joss' TV shows though but I couldn't help but think that the Vision's line could have easily have been said by Giles'.<br/><br/>Some good stuff and there's no denying that. The Vision's 'I was born yesterday' line was classic Joss and no mistake. It was very interesting to see the Avenger's greatest fears, especially Captain America's. I always though Cap's worst fear would be the Nazis goose-stepping along Pennsylvania Avenue or being a irrelevant nothing during WW2. But instead what he really fears is an end to war, he justified everything to himself by the moral conflict but with it gone what is there for him to do? (don't worry Cap, we'll never run short of wars). Black Widow's horrific memory of being sterilized in order to make her the perfect assassin is just beyond disgusting.<br/><br/>And the ending? Well am I the only one who thinks that the figure is going to be inevitably Galactus?"
"sanjidparvez","7","2","7","2 May 2015"," A fairly decent sequel.
","For any comic book/super hero movie lover it's somewhat like another DARK KNIGHT RISES(!)...there were rush & too many things going around but you're still going to love it as it packed with your favorite characters, plenty of awesome, eye catching action sequences and good dose of humor. Considering superbly well balanced storyline & characters of its predecessor ""THE AVENGERS (2012)"" which is one of the best superhero films ever made, AGE OF ULTRON is a fairly decent sequel, IMO. I think the super siblings, Ultron and even to some extent the ""surprise"" addition to the team 'The Vision' needed some more time to develop finely or may be it'd be better if they gradually introduced & developed this characters through some earlier other Marvel films like Loki for The Avengers (2012)...the audience already more or less knew about him through THOR (2011) and easily get cope with his motivations & schemes. And not only Loki, there weren't actually any new or fresh characters in 2012 Avengers Assembles who needed some time & space in character development area but this time there were one too many of them. Moreover, the plot was way simpler & more entertaining in first outing of the Avengers. Anyway, overall it won't be fair to say I'm disappointed with AOU but yeah...definitely could have been better."
"OlieRendch","9","2","7","2 May 2015"," Entertaining enough for your Marvel fan. Average viewer may need homework.
","So after a very successful first film in what is a very popular franchise Avengers: Age of Ultron brings the team back together for another world-saving event. This time, instead of Tom Hiddleston's power-hungry Loki, it's the menacing A.I. robot played brilliantly by James Spader. And that's what is a really great addition to the film; Spader is such a good bad guy, his voice didn't go through any filters, he did motion-capture for the face so you get all his mannerisms and in an 8-foot robot, that is very effective. The other two new cast members I enjoyed more than I expected too, they did a great job as the enhanced twins and their powers were very enjoyable to watch on screen. Of course our main heroes are always brilliant in their roles and it's great to see them all interact both while battling and in casual situations.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, it's a very different film from the first, the Avengers are known-all over the world so it's interesting to see what various countries think of them and what they do which they play on well; it also shows that they're not always that invincible, the team gets hit hard in this film more than they have done before and we get to see how they overcome that. All-in-all I really enjoyed the story.<br/><br/>The only negative things I have to say about the film is that the opening segment lasted a bit long and the final battle didn't quite seem as good as the first film but other than that this is a another fantastic Marvel movie; there are some exciting easter eggs of what's to come and Paul Bettany's Vision is a fascinating addition to the franchise who I am very much looking forward to seeing more of."
"regula1","8","2","7","1 May 2015"," A whirlwind of action that ties in all of the separate franchises, but a bit hectic
","It began with a simple premise, conjured up in the mind of our favorite genius billionaire playboy philanthropist, Tony Stark: artificial intelligence. ""Peace in our time"", Tony says is the stated goal.<br/><br/>The end result is anything but.<br/><br/>Ultron is born out of good intentions, and so begins the Avengers' greatest challenge since, well, since the last movie. It is undeniable that this film is the best overall Marvel movie yet, as it successfully and not in an in- your-face manner, ties together all of the separate franchises and their characters (notably, Idris Ebla shows up as Heimdall and Hayley Atwell as Peggy Carter makes an appearance as well).<br/><br/>However, before the tempest over throwing down the 'undeniable' word grows too strong, let's point out some of this films more prominent weaknesses. Some of the best action is in the very beginning, but you end up missing some of the best parts because the film dives into it from the very first frame and you have to play catch-up to figure out what's happening (however, regular Agents of SHIELD viewers will be able to transition much easier).<br/><br/>Also, for those who are not fluent, or even slightly versed in Marvel lore, there will be many segments where characters are introduced where you just say 'who?' Finally, for those who are fans of the other films of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, this film will bring in some of your favorite supporting characters and then relegate them to bit parts (Falcon gets it the worst, he's in one scene in the beginning and a virtual flash frame in the end. Really?)<br/><br/>However, if you go into this movie with the strengths and weaknesses in mind, you will be hard pressed to argue with the assertion that this is Summer 2015's can't-miss movie."

","Since i expected same type of presentation,I have got dissatisfied by the outcome but this could have been told by me may be for any other film. It's the Avengers and it showed up the same way I expected, we can clearly see the distaste of the filmmaker when it comes to successfully injection action into the movie with out disappointing one of the super hero fans and to make audiences to come to the vacuum they trim tried to fit another two characters which left hulk and iron man to get Least part to play which may disappoint the fans of those two and trying to make sure of utilizing the time for each character is rather underwhelming so it's Quite not an interesting plot and the same old punch lines as you might have expected and a bit crowded by the superheroes leaving them little less time to even establish or connect through the fans"

"joshuadrake-39480","9","2","7","27 April 2015"," Successful sequel to the first Avengers.
","This is an early movie review for the 2015 sequel to the critically-acclaimed 2012 film, THE AVENGERS. This is the sequel, AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON, which is once again written and directed by Joss Whedon. After the success of the THE AVENGERS, another sequel was planned for a release of summer 2015, with the writer and director Joss Whedon returning and the entire cast retuning.<br/><br/>With S.H.I.E.L.D. destroying (after the events of the previous film) and the Avengers needing a hiatus from stopping threats, Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, Ultron: a self-aware, self-teaching, artificial intelligence. However, his plan backfires when Ultron decides that humans are the main enemy and sets out to eradicate them from Earth, leaving it up to Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, along with support from Nick Fury and Maria Hill, to stop him from destroying all life on Earth.<br/><br/>Along the way the Avengers encounter the powerful twins, Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch, who joins them in their fight becomes Avengers as well. They also encounter the familiar Vision.<br/><br/>I love the story of the sequel. I think I have to give credit to writer and director and creator of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., Angel and Buffy the Vampire Slayer creator Joss Whedon because he wrote the hell out of a script and directed this film wonderfully and he does let the story run through without feeling like a montage and 141 minutes --- 2 hours and 21 minutes long --- It is really okay and amazing because I have long waited for this movie because this one of my top 10 highly-anticipated movies of 2015 and this is really cool and Marvel does an incredible job with this film.<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr. once again steals the show as Tony Stark / Iron Man and he shines in this film and he does a fantastic job this time around. Chris Hemsworth once again plays the role of Thor after playing him in the first two Thor movies, the first Avengers movie and he played James Hunt in the Ron Howard biography film RUSH and he does incredible, too. Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans and Jeremy Renner return in their roles as Bruce Banner / The Hulk, Steve Rogers / Captain America and Clint Barton / Hawkeye and they all do an amazing job.<br/><br/>Scarlett Johannson plays Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff once again and she is great, but a lot of things had to be done because during the production of this film, she was pregnant with her second or first child, I don't know. Don Cheadle returns as Colonel James Rhodes and it is great to see him once again as Iron Patriot. Paul Bettany plays Vision and J.A.R.V.I.S. and he does great as both of them.<br/><br/>Now, we have the new characters: Aaron Taylor Johnson plays the role of Pietro Maximoff / Quicksilver and it is really good to see him play a superhero again after playing in GODZILLA and the superhero films KICK-ASS and KICK-ASS 2 and he does really great and amazing as Quicksilver.<br/><br/>We finally get to Elizabeth Olsen as Wanda Maximoff / Scarlet Witch and she is really cool and she is so HOT as Scarlet Witch and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen would be really proud once they see there sister in the film. The performance from her is really great and she screams so loudly and she did a great job with the scream for her character and she is so awesome.<br/><br/>Finally, James Spader plays the title role and villain Ultron and he is simply amazing. Nothing else to say about him, he should win an Oscar for playing a villain, but it's not really going to happen.<br/><br/>The action is just amazing and when stuff goes down, stuff in the action sequences is going down and this is really amazing and fantastic for the film and I really do like the way the action is presented in 3D and IMAX 3D and this film is presented in a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format.<br/><br/>The trailers were the reason that I liked this movie and because everyone comes back for this sequel and they introduce new characters and they really done this really great. The music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman is really great and amazing. The cinematography, production design, editing, costume design, sound design and visual effects are all amazing, especially with the battle between the heroes and the Ultron drones and it was really cool.<br/><br/>Overall, I love AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON is really amazing and fantastic. This movie does not have any major flaws at all and I really think this deserve a lot of praise because this movie is just simply great. My rating is exactly a 9 out of 10. This is a superhero movie that I don't think gets enough critical attention and praise. I can't wait for the two-part sequel to this film, AVENGERS: INFINITY WAR, which PART 1 will be released in May of 2018 and PART 2 to be released in May of 2019. The stakes will be raised up for the next two AVENGERS movies and it will be really cool."
"MiscEtc","6","2","7","26 April 2015"," A Letdown
","With all the hype buzzing around for the sequel, I was hoping it to be good, but it was a letdown. The writers of the film seem to only had Marvel fans in mind, new characters were not introduced properly, and many questions left unanswered. <br/><br/>Maybe only 30% of movie-goers were Marvel fans, and knew what were going on. But for the majority of us, it felt like we had to google to understand what was going on. The movie started with no explanation, and the love interest started from nowhere (although we know that Black Widow would get together with Hulk eventually), it felt empty.<br/><br/>Besides all of that, I would give an applause for every single character had their own screen time, and not all the glory goes to Robert Downey Jr. a.k.a Tony Stark a.k.a The Iron Man. It was a fine balance that they managed to execute well."
"eylambartal","9","2","7","26 April 2015"," Age of the first true ""Avengers"" villain
","The first thought that popped into my head when I left the theater was: ""I've got to watch this movie again"". This film, much like its predecessor, serves as a junction for the paths paved in all previous Marvel films- therefore, the great detail and simultaneous procedures on screen reach a ""Game of Thrones"" -esc crumminess but, it works! The amazing thing in my opinion, is each character's presence felt just prominent enough in this feature. Iron Man- Tony Stark is back big time with his endless sense of humor, as friction between him and his fellow Avengers reach a critical point in ""Age of Ultron"". Although his most interesting relationship by far in this film is with the titular main villain. Captain America- feels like the WWII super soldier has outgrown his cardboard superhero roots and delves further into his interesting and reflective sides, already seen in ""Captain America: the winter soldier"". Thor- Personably, I love him! but it is notable that alongside his friends he looks like a last minute reinforcement, both action and story-wise. Yet he does manage to give this film its strongest emphasis of being a part of a well developed universe with to come. Hulk- As a hero who got just one solo film portrayal in the shared universe so far, Age of Ultron gives Bruce Banner and his monstrous alter ego, a well deserved emphasis over his more well established buddies. His Character also corresponds well with the movie's main theme of losing control over one's creations. Black widow- Super-spy Natasha Romanoff, Despite lacking any solo film yet (and maybe because) seems to own this film a little more. It explores her dark origins as the team's ""other monster"", hence creating an intriguing and promising bond between her and The Hulk, with The good old Hulk's 90's animated show feel to it. Hawkeye- Also in lack of a solo feature, fills the role of the only ""normal"" Avenger, but rather as a fact that makes him both interesting and unique among his monstrous and neurotic teammates. A few more familiar faces come back from past films such as Agent Maria Hill, War Machine, Falcon, Baron Von Strucker and Nick Fury- most of them get just enough good screen performance to leave you wanting more. Also, ""The Vision"", a newcomer, gets a small but significant role and it is undoubtedly a pleasure to see Paul Bettany displaying his full acting abilities for once in the Marvel films. The twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff- the new dominant super powered pair, I take care not to call them ""Heroes"" since during much of the film they are loyal only to themselves rather than side with good or evil. It is quite intriguing to witness characters which go against the common super hero genre dichotomy. Wanda and her mysteriously unpredictable powers, is more interesting than her super fast brother Pietro, who is a pale version compared to his wonderful portrayal in last year's ""X-men: Days of Future Past"". And the best is saved for last, Ultron- in a single sentence ""He's like a classic James Bond villain who watched all the previous Bond films"" (""I'd like to take this time to elaborate my evil plan"" *stops speaking, starts blasting*) that rogue A.I. is masterfully portrayed by James Spader. Ultron is a villain that fits the Avengers like a puzzle piece, Challenging each one of them at their own fields of play. I always liked how he tries to constantly display his differentiation and superiority over human beings in the comics, only to prove how strongly the human DNA of his creators stuck in him. That theme is up-played in the film, for the first time Ultron is portrayed with fully expression able face, his voice, despite a light metallic echo, his voice is humanly warm and emotional and his black sense of humor serves as a (rightful) competitor to Iron Man's. The filmmakers set themselves a goal with Ultron, to engage Marvel's cinematic universe's lack of charismatic and memorable villains. Ultron faithfully reaches that goal and I personally hope his villainous successors down the line would manage to fill the very large shoes left by the dreaded droid (Lookin' at you Thanos!). My sole complaint of Ultron is that Spader didn't manage to give him enough separate identity from his famous portrayal of the smart and slick crook Red Reddington from ""The Blacklist"". <br/><br/>The film is filled with quality action, the special effects department has truly outdone itself, despite working on smaller, more personal combat in comparison with the all out war in the first Avengers. But the true point of interest in Marvel's ensemble movies is the dynamics between characters and this film delivers plenty of that. Maybe that is one of the reasons why the action set pieces are so tiresomely detailed, due to taking less time- that is especially true for the trailer's well publicized battle between Iron Man and The Hulk as well as the final showdown, though they are tremendously satisfying. The film's opening action sequence also succeeds in sucking you right into the experience. But as said before, so many things happen at once, I just have to see the Movie again to see what I surely missed.<br/><br/>""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a marvel movie with the strongest emphasis on internal strife to date, unlike the physical conflicts that dominated past installments, the dangers and evils fought by the Avengers here are entirely of their own creation, results of their fears from future dangers. Many people mention ""The next wave"", ""God's next planned mass extinction event"" and it makes us all wonder weather Ultron is right to say that ""everyone makes the things they fear..."" In this movie, fear is revealed to be a terrible foe, in the next ""Avengers"" and the solo films leading to it along the next 3 years, we shall see who is the great enemy that scared the Avengers into creating Ultron."

","When you introduce THE ULTRON, in an avatar half as powerful than the one we had known from the yesteryears' comics....you had already made the job half way easy for the Avengers! With a cherry on top you put a candy voice of James Spader for the poor Robot and make his character look more miserable (An absolute antonym of Tom Hardy's Bane)..... And of course our Bruce Banner HAD to say it in a sophistically tensed/ surprised voice....""Artificial Intelligence!!!!!"" Come on Marvel!

That probably explains why the 'Age of Ultron' is at its core a very different movie from the first 'Avengers', not just because of how our superheroes evolve in the face of imminent destruction precipitated by one of their own but also because of the complex psychological themes that Whedon explores here. His ambition is certainly admirable, but it is inevitable that those looking for the same straightforward thrills as its predecessor will be at least slightly disappointed. That said, this is still an outstanding feat by any measure, a riveting blend of intimate character moments and grand action spectacle that remains quite simply, Marvel-Lois. and cameos a plenty to explain my 9.5/10 for this film this film hasn't got the epic battle of new York in this film but this has an epic story of 10 characters and the inner fears so this gives my story 10 out of ten action is 9/ because there is smaller battles going on so not on the epic scale we have seen but still amazing so 9/10 and 3d is 10 so at 9out of ten I think I got this score rite bring on phase 3"
"TheBatteryHuman","6","2","7","25 April 2015"," Disappointing
","**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Taken as a whole AOU is a really enjoyable blockbuster film, but it is way below expectations for the MCU. I think Joss just had a breakdown trying to fit all the characters in, sometimes less is more. Lots of elements seem very forced and the whole movie is very hap hazard. Don't get me wrong it's thoroughly enjoying and the set pieces are amazing, but the character development is terrible and doesn't even seem to relate to what these characters were doing in the previous films. Black Widows' romance with Bruce is understandable and I could have excepted it if she hadn't been flirting and hinting at more with Hawkeye in Avengers and Captain America in the Winter Soldier, it just makes her look really bad, it's terrible writing for such a great character. <br/><br/>Lots of little bits of ""quick give this Avenger 10 minutes of screen time just because they're on the poster"" is more damaging than just not having them in the film. Look at poor Thor, just hanging around with his hammer.<br/><br/>But the biggest unforgivable disaster is deviating so very far from comic book Hawkeye and giving him this daft unbelievable family, wife, kids, isolated farmhouse, wtf? Totally shoehorned in there for smulchy reasons. Totally out of character, just plain awful and forced. This will enrage fandom in an epic scale. Joss what were you thinking? Thank god you're not doing any more. No idea how the Russo's will pull this one back. <br/><br/>Also where's the foundation for Civil War? Cap and Tony were best buddies at the end of the film. Will all the universe building for this be turned over to Agents of SHIELD? Seems a dangerous game to play.<br/><br/>The other minor points could be forgiven for the grandiose and excitingly choreographed fighting and even the amazing performance from Ultron, but they have successfully ruined the characters of Hawkeye and Black Widow, total character assassination. And when they seemed to think that this film would give both more airtime to develop them more, so wrong, very wrong.<br/><br/>I'm just not sure where they go from here. I really did expect so much more from Joss after the brilliant first film, I mean I gave that one 10/10, but simply for the ruination of Hawkeye AOU just get's a 7/10. So many instantly obvious flaws, just disappointing and disjointed. Maybe if you go into the film with lesser expectations or don't really care about the minor characters than you'll enjoy it a lot more. I loved it while watching it but rumination lead to ruination. I'll try again when it comes out on DVD but not sure my missus (who loves Hawkeye) will never forgive Joss."

","The Avengers Age of Ultron<br/><br/>So clearly Avengers isn't extremely aiming for political here. plenty of rebirth — from metal to metal — happens at a church. As Nick Fury scoffs, the robots square measure ""breeding like Catholic rabbits"". Well, to place it gently, they are. Somehow, somewhere, within the thick of exploding cities, and therefore the same Sokovia ""where things square measure terribly bad"", robots with a assemblage of AI square measure springing out of assembly lines and jumping straight into war.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron Trailer<br/><br/>These robotic troops by ""Ultron"", cast from a mix of the other-wordy scepter and Stark's terribly own programme Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany). the things of sci-fi from yore involves pass once more once world messes with things it barely understands, significantly once that world essentially suggests that Tony Stark (Downey Jr). Ultron, whom he's hoping to make because the harbinger of peace, has his own ideas on however that peace is caused, resulting in world annihilation typically left to the forms of aliens.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron Deaths<br/><br/>There's no Norse deity here from the primary Avengers. however the team of Stark/Iron Man, Steve/Captain America (Evans), Bruce/The Hulk (Ruffalo), Natasha/Black Widow (Johansson), Thor (Hemsworth) and Barton/Hawkeye (Runner) have their hands full with Ultron (voiced by Spader) and a combine of ""Enhanced"" twins. The latter 2 have special powers which permit the boy (Taylor-Johnson) to maneuver like wind, and therefore the lady (Olsen) to govern minds. Avengers takes barely a disruption between its numerous supernatural clashes, together with a very long one between Iron Man and therefore the Hulk, and its collapsing buildings, vehicles, roads and tracks. So, whereas meaning any break is welcome, Whedon extremely adds zing once he will.However, at its heart, Whedon, UN agency co-wrote and directed Age of Ultron as he did the previous Avengers, is attempting too arduous and failing to create his film regarding the hazards in man taking part in god. nearly always, that story ends just one manner Age of Ultron Cancelled."
"drmnc1","7","2","7","24 April 2015"," A decent film that unfortunately grew tired towards the end
","I went into the cinema with high expectations, and though I didn't walk out completely blown away, I wasn't completely disappointed by what I saw either, and if you are thinking about watching Avengers: Age of Ultron, then it is certainly worth a watch. For those dubious about how interesting or fresh a rogue AI out to destroy humanity (done countless times before) can be, the wheel has certainly been re-invented on this one.<br/><br/>The new additions to the Avengers cast are arguably the strongest. As expected, James Spader is stunning as Ultron, a very complex and charismatic character with a very generous dose of snarky humour that gives the Avengers' jokes and one-liners a run for their money. From Ultron's very first moments, we can already see hurt and a confusion completely atypical of the usual generic robotic villains that have been churned out of Hollywood in the past. And who isn't envious of the mesmerising (and completely natural) voice of James Spader? I could listen to him talk all day.<br/><br/>Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) were also strong additions. Quicksilver sparks life into some of the otherwise vacuous action scenes and The Scarlet Witch works her magic on the Avengers, pathing the way for some interesting scenes as her psychic powers are put into play.<br/><br/>Then we have our Avengers (Robert Downey Jr., Scarlet Johansson, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner) doing their usual Avengers stuff. Charming and humorous performances all round, and great chemistry together carried forward from the first film that plays out nicely and keeps the film engaging.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron also gives us plenty of food for thought, with there being plenty of moral questionability that sparks internal conflicts between our heroes. This leads to a more interesting and dynamic film much different from the typical superhero movies where all the in- between is just filler for the next explosive setpiece. Ironically, it is some of the action scenes that lack substance, not the rest, in which the character development and subplots were executed very well.<br/><br/>Indeed, the first two-thirds of the film were superb, however towards the end in what was supposed to be the climax, the film felt repetitive, predictable, boring. I mean, there are only so many ways Hawkeye can shoot arrows at robots, Captain America can throw his shield at robots, Hulk smashing robots to pieces - it only made what was probably supposed to be a breathtaking complex seem a bit tedious and agonising to watch, which was a real shame.<br/><br/>I've already heard claims that Age of Ultron is simply filler for the next phase Infinity War, however, I don't believe this is the case. Age of Ultron offers more dimensions than just a generic ""Superhero must stop Supervillain"" that is expected, though coming with the cost of some bland, repetitive action scenes. Credit to Avengers: Age of Ultron that this isn't your typical mindless shot of adrenaline here. Worth a watch."
"VanillaChief","7","2","7","24 April 2015"," Avengers: Age of clichè
","Sadly the main villain, Ultron, is a very bad cliché of an AI, which saw a bunch of photos of Hitler and an atomic bomb and then decided to kill all humans. His character is saved by the voice- acting of James Spader, who gives him his typic witt and humor. Diametric to the thin plot stands the magnificent fighting scenes. The first five minutes are an absolute fun ride, followed by the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster sequence and triumphed in the Team-Up fight in the finale. They made an good decision to focus more on Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, the three film-less Avengers. The MCU-Quicksilver is different from the X-Men Quicksilver, a lot darker but not without humor. They created their own version which is fine. Humor in general is the main feature of this film. It distinguishes the MCU from the DC-CInematic- Universe and makes the former by far better."

","what do you do when you have a big story to tell and a short window. You cut to the chase and start with a BANG. That's exactly what you'll get when you put on the 3D glasses and start watching the Avengers: Age of Ultron. It's a bit darker than it's predecessor yet the amount of humor in it is sure to keep the mood light. The movie gives up close and personal look inside the lives of the Earth's Mightiest Heros. Less talk more action. So, what does 9 superheros in one screen fighting together look like ? Let me put it like this, I've never, ever seen action this intense in any movie. But it's not lengthy nor is it repetitive. The first two fights go on like the first 3 gears in bike, then when it turns to the finale - it reaches top gear with utmost urgency and keeps on gaining pace. It has so much and more that it makes the fight scenes in the first avengers look like a long trailer. The only thing I didn't like was that Ultron wasn't as intimidating as he should have been. One than once his reactions seems humane. And how in the hell did he get tele kinetic powers ??? A definite summer blockbuster. Age of Ultron is supposed to tie up lots of loose ends between the first movie and Infinity Wars and it shows. The plot has too much content in one go. Introduction of quicksilver and Scarlet witch, creation of Ultron and vision, the mind stone, mentions of wakanda and Claw(relating to Black Panther), last but not least Thanos acquiring the infinite gauntlet. #sigh #NERDgasm A war is never without causalities and I praise the movie for being realistic. Although the sciences mumbo-jumbo stuff is also present to patch up the unexplainable glitches but that obviously comes with comic book movies. Last time they tried to teach us real science through a movie, science ended up getting his butt kicked into a wormhole and dropped in a bookshelf and again in a black-hole and ...aaaah it still creeps me out. So that's it from me. Go on and enjoy the movie. i hope I haven't given out much spoilers.<br/><br/>P.S. #spoiler Black Widow didn't try to pick Thor's hammer up and Cap made it budge. But actually there is no semi worthiness to just make the hammer budge. You either can or you cant and going by the facial expression of cap I think he understood that he can but still choose to hide it from everyone. In the comic Both black widow and cap had wield to power of Mjölnir."

","As Marvel continues to dominate the movie industry and box office, their latest outing 'Avengers: Age of Ultron' certainly one-ups its 2012 predecessor with new heroes, allies, and a formidable foe that makes previous villain Loki look like a tamed kitten. Since this movie marks the end of Joss Whedon's directorial position for Marvel, he pulled off such an amazing move by making the original film's light-hearted moments turn a little darker, but never straying completely away from character development and nothing short of more screen time for each. It's like, Whedon wasn't trying to make everything from the last movie better with more destruction or mayhem, along with the appearance of new characters without proper explanation (he's not Michael Bay), instead he balanced those out evenly with better depth story-wise.<br/><br/>When a rogue AI known as Ultron (voiced by Blacklist's James Spader) declares extinction on humanity in order to bring peace to the world, the Avengers must reunite to stop this new threat as it threatens other parts of the world, along the way fighting their own battles inside and out.<br/><br/>I was blown away with the original Avengers movie, and its sequel doesn't disappoint as I was literally at the edge of my seat. Unlike the previous film, this now gives Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye even more development into what he can really do on screen, complete with clever one-liners and stylized action sequences alongside his fellow co-stars. Scarlet Johansson's Black Widow had some light shed onto her backstory, which doesn't distract from the business at hand, only an insight into emotional depth (including her fellow allies). Robert Downey Jr. still has his wits portraying Tony Stark/Iron Man when mingling with anyone around him, while new faces Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch proved to be quite the brother-sister team (done strikingly well by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth 'Liz' Olsen respectively). Now as for the titular character himself Ultron, James Spader basically shaped the character with an ominous, cunning tone crossed with wittiness that could make anyone shake in fear or have a tendency to laugh when in his presence. Which is kind of rare in past Marvel villains. The accompanying underscore of both Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman - in place of original composer Alan Silvestri - made the action sequences and scenarios look and sound more suspenseful, breathtaking, and epic to every degree. In the end, each hero that fought admirably left behind amazing twists and tragedies I did not see coming (though I won't spoil it there). In fact, I feel the need to watch it again for some reason.<br/><br/>My thoughts: Admittedly, a few loose ends needed to be cleared up since it causes the main story to feel pretty vague to understand when connecting them with a few notable subplots, but for a second round of Marvel movie crossover, Joss Whedon assembled what appears to be yet another superb entry into the Marvel Cinematic Universe."
"randreww","3","3","13","12 March 2016"," I Hate Flashbacks...
","This film is a mess of convoluted narratives, uncoordinated action, & protracted character development for far too many characters.<br/><br/>A film should tell one story. But amongst all the technological prattle we have several story details which breaks up the movie into sections which no one single audience bracket can appreciate.<br/><br/>This film has all the aspects I hate in bad writing. An enemy you can't see, an enemy with psychic powers (Batman & Robin pheromone dust?) which breaks up the film's momentum, flashbacks, good guys fighting each other, taking the heroes weapons away, the forced love affair, meeting the cool guy's pregnant wife & kids, girl power, a villain that keeps regenerating, & a new hero that overshadows the rest.<br/><br/>The action is so disconnected. Take the fight with Thor at the end. They start fighting, you want to see this fight AND.... Cut to another scene. It takes about 4 minutes during the finalé to come back to this scene. And the Hulk you forget is there! The first avengers were all working together, & you got a real sense of timely continuity during the battle.<br/><br/>You want to see the heroes face a new enemy, gear up with new tools, & show this bad guy who's boss! That's what the story needed to be! But you're hardly rooting for them to save the day at the end because apart from the fact you're so bored by then, you've lost all belief in them. They squabble all the way through, they let mere memories defeat them, & you never feel a desire for these cookie cutter robots to get destroyed by them. It's like those droids from the Star Wars Prequels all over.<br/><br/>The Avengers were assembled to protect mankind. This worked in the first film. In this film? Humanity just gets in the way of their CGI Battles. They ppss everyone off, destroy everything, not a peep out of the government, & kill all the robots that they themselves were responsible for creating.. Yay.. erm.. Hooray? What a mess this film is.<br/><br/>Creativity needs freedom. I guess the writer was stifled were creativity was concerned."
"cosmicfish14","5","3","13","11 February 2016"," A Disappointing Sequel
","With Deadpool being released tomorrow, I decided to review one of the most disappointing movies Marvel has made in a while. Not bad, just disappointing. This same movie also being one of most hyped up sequels since The Force Awakens.<br/><br/>Now I can't review this properly without spoiling it, so right here I'm putting a spoiler alert. First off, let me just say I did enjoy the first Avengers movie, it wasn't anything amazing but it was entertaining. Also I usually enjoy most movies that Marvel has produced, but this one was surprisingly lacking. Also this might be a pretty long review. <br/><br/>First lets talk about the story. The story isn't really the most important thing in a comic book movie, but there are still some major aspects of the story in this one. The story (even for a comic book movie) is really messy and has many moments that are rushed. They also had to set up other Marvel films coming out later, since thats a thing that Marvel does. The thing is that they had so many movies that they wanted to set up as many films as possible, to the point where it almost overshadowed the plot. For example, there's a part where the group is hit with something that makes them remember past memories, and this branched out into other sub plots that were going on while the main story kinda took a backseat for a little while. Also there was a really forced sorta romance, and this wasn't developed in the first movie so it pretty much came out of nowhere. Another thing is that I thought the new characters were pretty underwhelming. Quick Silver was really distracting since I know he was in X-Men, but is Russian in this. Also the characters have no personality, especially Quick Silver, who also dies, so he was completely pointless. I think probably one of the worst things is that the villain, Ultron, is not really unique in anyway. He's just a regular, lets destroy the world, type villain. Also I thought it was funny how Ultron hated the world after being on the internet for one minute.<br/><br/>Another thing that this movie didn't do all that well was the effects. In the first scene the effects looked awful, they looked rubbery, and wasn't helping that the action scene going on wasn't all that interesting. The effects do improve a little as the film goes on, but I still can't help feeling like almost every scene was filmed on a green screen set. Also the action scenes were.. alright. There wasn't anything notable, they were just.. alright. The battle at the end is cool for the first two minutes and then it just feels like im watching some one play a version of Dynasty Warriors where every enemy looks like the same generic robot. Except without the fun of Dynasty Warriors.<br/><br/>There wasn't anything all that special about this movie. I just felt like another generic comic book movie. Thats the problem with this movie, its very generic. There wasn't any cool cinematography, no great characters, no amazing effects, no memorable moments. And its funny since this was planned to be one of the best sequels ever, but instead of falling flat on it's face, its just very bland. I feel sorry for Joss Whedon since he had to make a movie to satisfy fan's unbelievable requests and also set up like ten more marvel movies. I think he does deserve the break since this seemed to be a lot of ridiculous stress on him.<br/><br/>So in the end, its no terrible, but it had a lot more potential than it delivered, and I think thats the disappointing thing about Age Of Ultron.<br/><br/>Final Score: 5/10"

Tony uses JARVIS to create another AI which results in Vision. Together, the new and old Avengers join to battle Ultron.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon's jokey style commences right from the start. It would have been more exciting to start with a less jokey action sequence. I like most of the movie. I like the banter. Ultron could be given more time to develop his character. I actually like Hawkeye's farm. Thor's visions could be more compelling. I like Blackwidow and Hulk's relationship. I love the HulkBuster. I like almost everything but the final act doesn't have the excitement. The action gets a little boring. It's a lot of robotic fodder getting punched.

","In the Eastern European country of Sokovia, the Avengers – Tony Stark, Steve Rogers, Thor, Bruce Banner (Hulk), Natasha Romanoff, and Clint Barton – raid a Hydra outpost led by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker, who has been experimenting on humans using the scepter previously wielded by Loki. They encounter two of Strucker's experiments – twins Pietro, who has superhuman speed, and Wanda Maximoff, who can manipulate minds and project energy – and apprehend Strucker, while Stark retrieves Loki's scepter.<br/><br/>Stark and Banner discover an artificial intelligence within the scepter's gem, and secretly use it to complete Stark's ""Ultron"" global defense program. The unexpectedly sentient Ultron, believing he must eradicate humanity to save Earth, eliminates Stark's A.I., J.A.R.V.I.S., and attacks the Avengers at their headquarters. Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his weapons. Together, they go to the base of arms dealer Ulysses Klaue in an African shipyard to obtain Wakandan vibranium. The Avengers pursue them, but Wanda subdues the Avengers with haunting visions, causing the Hulk to rampage until Stark stops him with his anti-Hulk armor.2<br/><br/>A worldwide backlash over the resulting destruction, and the fears Wanda's hallucinations incited, send the team into hiding at Barton's safehouse. Thor departs to consult with Dr. Erik Selvig on the meaning of the apocalyptic future he saw in his hallucination, while Romanoff and Banner plan to flee together after realizing a mutual attraction. However, Nick Fury arrives and encourages the team to form a plan to stop Ultron. In Seoul, Ultron forces the team's friend Dr. Helen Cho to use her synthetic-tissue technology, together with vibranium and the scepter's gem, to perfect a new body for him. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn on Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.<br/><br/>The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S. – who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet – into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow – one of the six Infinity Stones, the most powerful objects in existence – was part of his vision. This ""Vision"" and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction. Banner rescues Romanoff, who awakens the Hulk for the battle. The Avengers fight Ultron's army while Fury arrives in a Helicarrier with Maria Hill, James Rhodes and S.H.I.E.L.D. agents to evacuate civilians. Pietro dies when he shields Barton from gunfire, and a vengeful Wanda abandons her post to destroy Ultron's primary body, which allows one of his drones to activate the machine. The city plummets, but Stark and Thor overload the machine and shatter the landmass. In the aftermath, the Hulk, unwilling to endanger Romanoff by being with her, departs in a Quinjet, while the Vision confronts Ultron's last remaining body.<br/><br/>Later, with the Avengers having established a new base run by Fury, Hill, Cho, and Selvig, Thor returns to Asgard to learn more about the forces he suspects have manipulated recent events. As Stark and Barton also leave, Rogers and Romanoff prepare to train new Avengers: Rhodes, the Vision, Sam Wilson, and Wanda.<br/><br/>In a mid-credits scene, Thanos, dissatisfied by the failures of his pawns, dons a gauntlet3 and vows to personally retrieve the Infinity Stones."

The characters don't have to be introduced this time and get time to develop and go through new challenges. THe movie explores Black Widow's traumatic past, Hulk's dangerousness, Hawkeyes family life and many others. The action is a bit shaky but I quite enjoyed it and the settings are very interesting. I won't spoil them but it was a fun ride overall. THe story pacing is a bit odd and the main villain's big plan doesn't make a whole lot of sense but that's the kind of stuff I can forgive in a comic book movie.

","""Age of Ultron"" descends upon its audience, hitting the ground running with guns blazing. Makes sense; after all, ""in media res"" is probably the best way to start such a thing. But that action . . . it doesn't really stop. Just moves from one huge setpiece to the next, destroying city blocks (sometimes actual cities) in its wake. This movie is so intent on giving us non-stop action and introducing new characters and setting up MCU Phase 3 and pounding our senses that the subtle pieces of character from the first one are all but gone. The relationship between Bruce and Natasha was nice, and they did give Hawkeye some nice personality this time around, but that's about it. And Ultron was a lackluster bad guy, enhanced a bit by Darth Spader, but only just. There was just so much infrastructure here, so much to take in, that you just want some space to breathe. The pieces are all well-machined - a move here, a stunt there, new toys from from Tony Stark - but it's not as satisfying a whole. <br/><br/>It does its job at beating you about the face with CGI battle scenes, that much you can't even question. But if this is the MCU's trajectory, then . . . stop the ride, I want to get off.<br/><br/>5/10"

","**SPOILER FREE** .<br/><br/>AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON .<br/><br/>Directed by Joss Whedon .<br/><br/>Don't worry, if you haven't seen it, you're safe here. No spoilers. I don't believe in spoilers. You can trust me. So opening night I got to see one of my most anticipated movies of the year, in a packed theater, in 3D, with a Monster energy drink to get my heart racing for this spectacle. After the 73% on RottenTomatoes, and everything I've heard.....I tried to keep expectations low.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>So you guys already know the plot. So short version: Tony Stark creates Ultron for good. For an AI protector of our world. The next step in evolution. Plan backfires...Age of Ultron. After everything I heard, I wasn't expecting it to live up to the first, and I was fine with that. Well it hooked me from the very beginning this time, we start out with the Avengers right in action, IN THE SNOW! Finally got out of New York and had a change of scenery. That's something I've been wanting to see and it was awesome. Throughout the amazing looking action the jokes were there, and I believe this one might be funnier than the first. Especially with a certain joke about 'cursing' that goes on throughout the movie. Its like an Avengers inside joke and every time it gets brought back up its even more hilarious.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Now the addition of Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver I was nervous about. Mainly with Quicksilver because I'm not the biggest Aaron Taylor-Johnson fan, and I think he was the sore-point of Godzilla. Now while he doesn't come close to the awesomeness that was Evan Peters's Quicksilver from Days of Future Past, to my surprise I did like him. I really liked Scarlett Witch. Yes, the Russian accents were a bit weird, but only for a moment then you're okay with it. What Scarlett Witch did, how she uses her mind control, and taps into people's minds and we get some psychological traumatic scenes for some of our characters. She was a great addition to this movie. There's more characters in this than any Marvel movie ever, and they are juggled perfectly. That's one of the things I didn't like about the first one. Some characters led the show while others faded into the background. I didn't care a bit for Hawkeye in the first movie cause he got zero character time. In Age of Ultron, I can say Hawkeye was my favorite character in the whole movie and I would say was given the most character time. Not only do we find out more about him, but we learn about his personal life. That's was phenomenal for this movie. It was the perfect blend of Action, Comedy, and Drama. We spent more time with the Avengers OUT of their costumes than ever. My favorite scene in the whole movie was a party at Stark Tower with all them just hanging out and conversating.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>In closing, YES. Hulk vs Hulk Buster was one of the most beautiful fights I've ever witnessed in a theater. ULTRON, great villain. Menacing, evil, and very funny. He's a likable villain and you just wanna hear him talk cause his voice is awesome and he is awesome. Out of him and Loki, I might like Loki a tad bit better....but just a bit. Vision, I wish he was a surprise and not spoiled in the trailer....but without saying much and avoiding spoil-age, Vision is greatness. Originally Age of Ultron was 3hrs31mins and got shortened to 2hrs22mins, and I feel like we needed some of that. I think Ultron needed more of an origin story because he was just sort of* poof!* I'm hear to destroy. I wished he had more reasoning explained in his origin. My only other gripe is that the Hulk/Black Widow romance felt a bit, rushed and not believable and I just feel it could've been done more natural instead of so sudden and in your face.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Now here's the thing, I was actually planning to be hard on this movie. I didn't want my inner fanboyism to effect my grade, so it won't. There were those two things that I feel would've been better in the original 3hr31min cut. Nonetheless, the theater experience was incredible and it was the most fun I had watching a film in theaters in YEARS. It surpassed my expectations by a mile and just completely blew me away. Not only will I say that I liked this one more than the first, but it might just be my favorite Marvel film yet.<br/><br/>.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron gets an: A .<br/><br/>Follow me on Instagram @Killfillm for more Movie Reviews!"

","Might contain spoilers. <br/><br/>Have to agree with a lot of the other low score reviews here. Just don't know why source material can't be followed a little more closely. Why didn't banner mention Betty one time, thought this was the same hulk from the Edward Norton movie cause he mentioned what he did to Harlem in first avengers movie. What was with all the religious talk from ultron, aliens exist, they fought them, so shouldn't that go away. The fight between hulk and hulk buster was disappointing to me and ended the wrong way. Would like to have seen more hulk on the screen but doubt that will ever happen, will have to stick to the animated movies for that."
"MarkyMarkus","6","2","8","4 May 2015"," I just didn't have much fun with this movie.
","I really wanted to like this movie, but it just felt so bland. The jokes for me fell flat more often than not. The only one that got a chuckle out of me was the running gag with Cap and bad words. I just can't stand the constant barrage of jokes, there is a time and place for humor, but not during intense struggles against a deadly villain. Why should I care about the danger when the characters clearly don't. To be fair, I thought Guardians was pretty great because it was so funny, but maybe its because the jokes were actually funny. <br/><br/>The pacing was just horrible, I was bored for a good chunk of the movie. The movie would slow down for no reason at all and it really tried its hardest to justify the weird and out of nowhere love between Black Widow and Hulk. It also touched on the subject of Hawkeye maybe being too sub par to keep up with the avengers, but what about Black Widow? As far as the MCU has shown, black widow is not exactly superhuman, at least no more than Hawkeye, so why is that needed? The movie would try to touch on more serious subjects, but it would just forget about it in seconds because the jokes needed to start again. Ugh."
"lecterrkr","4","2","8","4 May 2015"," Just a movie for children.
","Nothing superb or extraordinary, it's just a superhero movie for children, generic plot, generic action, one line jokes all the movie. Don't expect to see another Wolverine, or Batman movie, or even the first Iron Man movie. Not a fan of this one.<br/><br/>Oh! one big problem that I have is: the action is too fast, they don't give you time to see anything at all, they throw too much CGI at you that they take it out of screen before you see the effects they use. There are some scenes that I would like to see at least 4 seconds, but no, 2-3 seconds and then the next shoot, or camera moves, or everything shakes!. No, they don't want you to notice something, and I think it's they use cheap CGI effects."
"LoganWeasel","5","2","8","4 May 2015"," I was pretty disappointed
","As a long time marvel fan I went into the theater excited and walked out thinking ""what happened"",Anyway let me explain why First of all there was a lack of a plot (Ultron wants to destroy everyone OH NO!) they could have had a plot that stuck to the comic books a little more loosely but NO! this is a movie we just want your money because you love marvel and just can't resist our movies secondly do we really need a love interest? C'mon do we really give a rats ass about who has the hots for who? NO! we want some goddamn action! also do we really need all of the jokes,I swear they removed all of the plot with jokes and an over abundance of characters did we need all of the characters it had in it? we also know little to none about Ultron THE MAIN ENEMY! I just know mindless numbskulls will go see this and not even care about the comics with the excuse of ""Its 2015 who needs the comics?"" anyway this film was a let down that could have been a a great movie with an even higher box office cash in I can not believe they decided to make this it was the biggest marvel let down since Iron Man 2 for me honestly."
"JoeB131","9","2","8","3 May 2015"," Gods and Monsters
","One of Josh Whedon's talents is his ability to manage a story with multiple characters and giving those characters something interesting to do.<br/><br/>This film takes the original 6 Avengers and adds three new ones. Yet I had no problem following the story and what was going on. Tony Stark attempts to create an artificial intelligence in order to combat all the alien threats to Earth, and creates Ultron, a robot who figures out the best way to protect humanity is to exterminate it.<br/><br/>Not an original idea, and fans of Marvel Comics know these characters. Still, they manage to take a kind of hokey character and make him interesting. Heck, he was even able to make Hawkeye interesting as he conscience of the team.<br/><br/>Also kudoes for the way they handled massive violence. Unlike other Superhero movies that quickly turn into Disaster Porn, these heroes remember their primary goal is to protect innocent life. Well done.<br/><br/>Definitely worth watching."

","I get that even with the greatest movies like Star Wars, Dark Knight and Avenger, that not everyone is going to love it. People will have different opinions or some plot holes will be more annoying to others, but oh my god; what is with all the hate for this movie? I'd be okay with '7's' or 6's but i've been seeing a lot of 1's and thats upsetting to me. At first i thought these were just trolling haters or snooty critics that think superheroes are nothing more than children entertainment, but after reading some of these reviews and seeing the numbers tallying up i know these are legitimate fans upset with this movie. And all I can say is, Im sorry. <br/><br/>I don't mean that in a sarcastic way like, ""Oh sorry you have bad taste in movies."" No I mean sorry as in, ""Im sorry we couldn't see the same movie."" I loved the action, I loved the comedy, I loved the characters, I loved the villains...design and facial expressions (Yes they give Ultron facial expressions It's really neat). The only thing that bothered me a little was the Bruce and Natasha romance. Not because, ""Oh it wasn't in the comics"" but... I don't know I didn't love it and I didn't hate it. <br/><br/>All I can say is Im upset all the marvel fans couldn't enjoy this movie together, but maybe thats a good thing. I guess its better people gave their honest opinion and not like it just because its Marvel."
"shaunhenesy","9","2","8","2 May 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron wages war against the close minded.
","Let me begin this review by stating that, if you're sick of the ""typical Superhero story formula"", then this movie is absolutely not for you. The people that are going to get the most enjoyment out of this movie are those that have enjoyed previous Marvel films. With that being said, let me get to the key points of what made this movie a success through my eyes. <br/><br/>The absolute most important thing for these movies to accomplish, is bringing comic book characters to life, to the point that you forget that you're watching someone portray a character, and simply are viewing the character in their natural form. For that, I'll give this movie an A+. The cast is the same as the previous films, but never before has each character seemed so comfortable within their roles, and their relationships to one another. <br/><br/>Ultron, as a Villain, is one of the best that the Marvel Universe has created. If I had to fault this movie for anything as it pertains to Ultron, I'd fault them for not involving his character enough. The screen time that this character receives is far less than he deserves, and I absolutely hope that's made up for with the directors cut once it's released. Ultron is convincing, funny, maniacal, and really just bizarre. Ultron, as plenty of great villains do, believes that he is the good guy throughout the film. He's not evil for the sake of being evil. He's good in his own mind, and that belief actually caused me as the viewer to almost feel bad for him, before remembering that he's a machine. He'll very likely be my favorite villain in the entire Marvel Universe after a few more viewings, and that's saying something, with how fond I was of ""The Winter Soldier"" as a Villain. <br/><br/>The ""typical Superhero story formula"" is definitely present throughout this film, but if you can keep your mind open, and look at everything else that's going on, you'll come out of this film satisfied. The character development, humor, and even storyline are so prominent and well done that it outweighs, by far, the ""I've seen this before"" thought process, because a lot of it, you really *haven't* seen before. I'm not going to say ""Ignore the critics"", but I will say simply, see this movie for yourself. Form your own opinion. Judge it based on what it is, not what you'd like it to be. If you walk into the theater, or turn on your TV, with an open mind, then you'll likely be as impressed with this movie as I am."
"peefyn","7","2","8","28 April 2015"," The fine line between spectacle and spectacular
","In my opinion, ""too much"" is never a problem if it is handled right. Everything can be on the line and happen at once, as long as it is presented by someone who can craft a story. With the Avengers-franchise, it has to be big, it has to be everything, but this also increases the difficulty of presentation. For, if done wrong, this movie could have easily become a transformers movie. The (cast and) crew deserves kudos for managing to make it bigger without losing their heads, and without losing the audience. The movie manages to present, update and focus on each of the many characters the Marvel Cinematic Universe as accumulated so far, in addition to managing to introduce new ones.<br/><br/>The major exception to this is maybe the Vision-characters. I am not familiar with this character in the comics, but I had a hard time understanding how powerful this character is, and just what he can do. At one point he seems like a Dr. Manhattan-esque guy, but at other points it's just another avenger-like hero. This will probably be more clear in the later movies, but that's not good enough.<br/><br/>Another problem this movie had was that ultron's army was as boring as any other stormtrooper-like characters from other movies like this. While the avengers did work together like a team, it seemed like many of them were at points reduced to fly-swatters. Maybe it's hard to avoid, but it's not really that fun to watch. The movie also had some good one-on-one fights (that were way more interesting).<br/><br/>Something I missed in this movie, but I guess will be more important onwards (with the next Captain America-movie in particular) is the relationship between the world society and the avengers. It was only briefly touched upon, but I guess a movie can't do everything.<br/><br/>As many others, I much preferred the first avengers-movie, because of a more interesting villain, and more memorable moments. This movie was also funny, though. Thor in particular. And the Hulk.<br/><br/>This is another one of those movies that you can't really miss if you are following the franchise, and you probably won't pursue if you haven't followed it. It's good, not great, and it doesn't disappoint, but at the same time it does not exceed my expectations."
"kharesanniv","5","2","8","28 April 2015"," Lack of Justifications
","Yesterday I watched this long awaited movie, I was having great expectations after looking at first teaser and then the trailer, In fact starting 10 mins of movie lived up my expectations and it kinda grew more when Stark confronts his fear imposed by Witch.<br/><br/>But suddenly it came into the same old track of any usual sci-fi story with lack of justifications throughout the movie, it was kinda watching few separate pieces of videos, somehow continuity lacked, and I could never find the big moment of movie even during the climax also. <br/><br/>Of-course there is no doubt that CGI was fantastic and eye pleasing, but mind couldn't sync with the movie at all. I think movie required much more depth in creating its villains complexity and finding more logical ways to get it destroyed by our loving Avengers, rather it went on flat simple version where Avengers just got busy fighting physically rather than planning and then destroying villain.<br/><br/>Kids will enjoy the movie very much as my cousins do :), but fans like me may get disappointed."
"dimbost","5","2","8","28 April 2015"," this is Marvel's answer to the never ending runway
","First of this is actually a fun movie to watch!!<br/><br/>From the start of the film we get thrown into amazing battles and catchy dialog. There is a big joke every 5 Min's or so, there are actions scenes that equate to nearly half of the film. The CGI for most part is awesome. Although Ultron could have been done better. But this movie lacks logic, reasoning and reality. The suspense of disbelief is non-existent. And yes I know that this is a Marvel Superhero movie, but that didn't stop the first Iron man, Thor, Captain America to be made within our world.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil anything for any one, so to put it bluntly if you enjoyed films like Transformers, Pacific Rim, Fast and Furious then you will love this.<br/><br/>I gave this film 5/10 because we can no longer give a free pass to film, just because that film doesn't take it seriously, Just because a movie can make fun of its self, doesn't mean that it is a good movie. Compare this to Goodfellas, Godfather, Lord of the Rings, Shawshank or even all the way down the list of Iron Man 1, this movie doesn't equal them"
"jacobhunt6","7","2","8","25 April 2015"," A fantastic sequel to a fantastic film
","What a great way to continue the Marvel story. This is a humorous, chilling, emotional, action-packed film that deepens the plot of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe. Ultron is certainly a worthy and formidable foe, and Whedon does a fantastic job of crafting the theatrical version of the renowned comic-book villain. We are introduced to Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Vision (Paul Bettany) in a dramatic manner, and all three are played remarkably by three very talented actors. It is almost with pleasure that Whedon creates tension within the Avengers team, strengthening our connection to both the existing Avengers and the ones we've just met. The audience are kept captivated throughout the whole film. Once again, Marvel has delivered a fantastic superhero movie to enjoy."
"jasperjfcs","8","2","8","24 April 2015"," An Enjoyable Movie
","I went into this movie with high expectations. I've been beyond excited for this movie for months and I finally saw it last night and I have quite a few mixed thoughts on it. I found the cutting of the scenes quite flimsy most of the time, the lighting and CGI looked very half assed at some points, the dialogue was way to monotone and quick for me to understand which left me asking my friends many questions about the movie, the title reveal was awfully placed and way too quick. We saw the word 'Avengers' for pretty much two seconds until 'Age of Ultron' appeared and I was very disappointed with that. A lot of the film felt rushed and I spotted many plot holes. What I did enjoy was the action, the technology, the basic story (when I managed to understand it) and some of the humour. Overall this was a fun movie. It has some flaws but I cannot wait to watch it again. Maybe it'll make more sense to me then."
"skyminster","4","3","15","3 February 2016"," Stick with the first film.
","I liked the first Avengers. It was fun, had a whole load of action and some good acting, a decent story and such forth. However, after watching Age of Ultron for the first time yesterday, I can safely say it's not as good. No. I'm not gonna hold this back to the end, actually. It isn't very good at all. Maybe that's why everyone's forgotten about?<br/><br/>Following on, sort of, from Captain America: Winter Soldier and the first Avengers, you're thrown straight into the action, where the Avengers duke it out with what remains of Hydra, to snatch the sceptre – you know, the one Loki used in the first film. Nonetheless, there isn't really much fighting back, and the Avengers easily take the sceptre after a relatively boring action sequence, which both goes on for too long and is so easy for the Avengers that it's not actually that easy to watch. It's not silly action. It's not very exciting, it's just watching the Avengers beating up some goons, in a repetitive manner. The underwhelming action along with a substandard script, flat acting and total lack of atmosphere or inventive cinematography makes for an uninspiring first 20 or so minutes.<br/><br/>However, the intro for the first Avengers film wasn't all that much better, so I guess it got better then?  Eventually, I guess.<br/><br/>Well, the script didn't change, for one thing. Filled with brilliant things ranging from rubbish one-liners (not fun, Scharzenegger one- liners, that is; just Tony Stark annoying one-liners) to bad comedy. The story, on the other hand, isn't anything special either. Actually, it's a bit crap. Stuff blows up, they have a party, then some annoying robot guy turns up. Then everything goes a bit pair- shaped, and — oh! Did I ever mention the twins? They suck ass. I mean, they properly suck ass. Portrayed by Elizabeth Olsen and good ol' Aaron Taylor Johnson (the stars of Godzilla!), are the twins who I didn't care about. Vaguely European, they put on terrible accents and act without any expression or personality whatsoever. Sure, they have pretty cool powers, but that doesn't mean they're good characters. They ruin the film, no less. They just complicate things and make the film longer than it needed to be. Furthermore, the girl, whatever her name is, she does this telepathic stuff. It doesn't lead to anything other than a stupid fight between Iron Man and Hulk, which I didn't care about. I was thinking for a lot it: ""Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!"" Tony Stark, that is.<br/><br/>The film's length is a big issue, actually. What little content they had, they decided to stretch it out to over 2 hours. Simply put, over 2 hours is too long for a super hero film. They're all about silly action and cool characters, not soppiness and too much talking. The length and lack of substantial content for it makes for dragging out of scenes that weren't that interesting anyway, and, frankly, a first hour that's a bit boring — reminded of Godzilla, anyone? In some ways, I think this film is worse than Godzilla. Wait! I was supposed to leave that till the end! Oh well. Anywho, there's also way too much linking to the Marvel universe, with the telepathic twin at fault again. I don't want Thor walking around saying stuff, whilst ripping his shirt off in Thor, so I definitely don't want it in Avengers. None of the side plots added anything. Especially Tony Stark and Hulk's stupid fight.<br/><br/>Back to the acting. Robert Downey Junior. Eh. Didn't have much of a script to work on. I think his Iron Man is wearing thin, though, anyway. Scarlett Johansonn. The same as ever. Chris Hemsworth. Not helped by the script at all, his Thor isn't a friend with bad jokes. For some reason they decided for him to get involved in them. Alright. I'm gonna stop now. There isn't a special performance anywhere in this, and though the cast is the victim of a substandard screenplay, they don't do a good job of making the most of what they've got, as most of the performances are bland and without any change for the better from past performances — though Chris Evans is decent as Captain America, as per usual.<br/><br/>I haven't actually said anything positive yet, really. Well, maybe it's not quite as bad as you might have interpreted so far. Sure, the first hour is, but as the film gets further the action and entertainment gets a lot better, and the plot kicks in as there's actually some great action, in an exciting climax. It's great fun, and the score kicks in as well, so there's finally some atmosphere. The last 50 minutes or so are good, actually, as all the pointless talking and soppiness has more or less ended, the film finally finds a faster pace. Nevertheless, it's not all that good, as you may have guessed.<br/><br/>Verdict:<br/><br/>Uninspired on every level, Avengers: Age of Ultron, until the 1:20 mark, is rubbish. The last 50 minutes are quite a lot better, though, with great action and excitement on display. Nonetheless, the flaws found all over the first hour 20 are still found in this portion of the film; ranging from a bad script, to an uninteresting story, ponderous acting and pointless branching to the wider Marvel universe — with the film's length far too long. It's not completely rubbish, but<br/><br/>Just stick with Avengers Assemble.<br/><br/>""In some ways, I think this film is worse than Godzilla.""<br/><br/>54/100."
"bifties","Null","6","42","30 April 2015"," Not as good as the first
","I only Score 10 or 1, so this film gets 1. It's obviously not that bad (it's certainly no Bad Boy Bubby).<br/><br/>I loved the first - love most Marvel films (I'm 37 years old and I still get goose bumps when the comic pages start to flick at the beginning of any movie).<br/><br/>For me, this sequel lacked the humour of the first; struggles like any other 2nd of a trilogy to stand on its own (simply being the middle film dictates that you need no introduction, and can have no ultimate conclusion until the 3rd movie); and was missing some of the characters I expect to see (no real spoilers here, but don't expect to see Coulson, Potts or Foster - plus there is very little Fury, Falcon or Rhodes).<br/><br/>I didn't like the new additions - and I didn't like the inevitable Super Hero struggling with their inner demons that any 2nd film also requires.<br/><br/>With all that said, while for me the 2nd Lord of the Rings film is the worst stand alone, it is perhaps the best film when watching all 3 together. So perhaps this will be my favourite once I have the 3rd, but for now, I am really disappointed."

","No more, please. The last 'Avendure' installment was enough of a stretch...this one is completely beyond pointless. I will say that Ironman and certain other crew members are outstanding individually, but group-violence against multi-mega villains, is certainly getting ridiculous and old. A lack of storyline is my biggest gripe. It seems to have become the weakest links in movie now-a- days. People and things keep popping in and out of nowhere, with no reason. Granted, if watching movies similar to this one, defines your life, than maybe you can explain the reason and origins of the twins. I personally don't care, but some people really need to know. What I say to those in such sheltered existences is, 'yippee for you, now get a life and please don't vote - reality is way out of your mind's grasp'. I personally don't care what poignant action took place in the last episode I suffered through, I am just proud I made it through the stupid thing. What I gather from the dialogue at the end, this should be the very last one with the old gang in it. I guess there is a new group, ready and eager to usher in new flops...but gone will be 'Ironman, Hulk, Arrow...and others. Good idea...should have done it earlier. But can't pass-up a payday I guess.

","AVENGERS AGE OF ULTRON review of Mike Smith <br/><br/>When Tony Stark and Bruce Banner try to jump-start a dormant peacekeeping program, things go to hell and it's up to the Avengers to stop the villainous Ultron from enacting his terrible plans.<br/><br/>The first Avengers movie was awesome! Guardians of the Galaxy was amazing! So how do you top those two juggernaut movies? You make the film a little darker, make it a bit more mature, add more comedy and funny banter between the cast and amp up the action to 11.<br/><br/>By now it's no surprise that the cinematography was stunning and the action scenes are amazing. You are going to want to re watch this film a couple of times, the action is so overwhelming and fun, your going to miss a lot. One thing I love about Avengers Age Of Ultron is the banter that goes on with the cast. It keeps you smiling throughout the film and the one liners stick with you for days.<br/><br/>As you know the cast is amazing and work spectacularly together so let's talk about the four new members. Aaron Taylor-Johnson who plays Quicksilver is funny and a bad ass while Elizabeth Olsen who is Scarlet Witch is more mysterious and spooky. These two work really well together as a brother sister team and balance each other really well and makes you want to see more of them. Paul Bettany who voices Jarvis finally makes his physical daybue as Vision. We don't get to see much of him but as with the rest of the cast he's funny, bad ass and we want to see more of Vision. Last but not least is Ultron, voiced by James Spader. I was thinking he was going to be more of a dark and scary villain. It turns out he's funny and lovable in a bad guy way. It makes sense because he is made from Tony Stark and as the movie goes on Ultron loses his charming self and turns into a evil mad man. This blend leaves you wanting more. I really enjoyed that Avengers Age Of Ultron focuses a bit more on the other Avengers like Hawkeye, Black Widow and Hulk, it really rounds out the universe and gave these characters a chance to shine.<br/><br/>Marvel Disney hit it out of the park once again and I kind of underestimated this film because of the first Avengers and Guardians of the Galaxy. I didn't think they could top those films, well Joss Whedon proved me wrong and is making it harder for me to write these Marvel reviews. From start to finish this film is a fun ride and doesn't feel like a 2 and a half hour long movie. Keep your eyes peeled for Stan Lee and SPOILER ALERT there is no end cutscene.

"zardoz-13","10","2","9","17 May 2015"," Whedon Triumphs Again With Avengers!!!
","Watching ""Serenity"" director Joss Whedon's ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is like riding on a runaway roller-coaster. As he did with the initial ""Avengers"" extravaganza, Whedon orchestrates several larger-than-life, gravity-defying, high-octane action scenes that grow exponentially bigger and bigger. Not content to dawdle, Whedon opens this PG-13 film with an exciting assault on a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe. Ultimately, he never allows this outlandish, CGI-laden, 141 minute blockbuster with its non-stop shenanigans to wax anticlimactic. Occasionally, ""Avengers 2,"" as I shall refer to it from here on, pauses only to let the heroes and villains deliver important expository information that lets us know about their impending strategy. Whedon relies frequently on rapid, ginsu-knife style editing to depict simultaneous close-quarters combat in different spots among the various super-heroes as they spar with their adversaries and recover from body blows no ordinary mortal could survive. One of my favorites occurs when Thor slams his hammer named Mjölnir against Captain America's shield and sends it hurtling like a giant Frisbee to topple more than a few baddies. Comparatively, not only for its number of narrative surprises but also for its revelations about certain characters, ""Avengers 2"" surpasses its 2012 predecessor. Whedon discloses far more about Scarlett Johansson's Black Widow than previous Marvel movies, and we find out about Hawkeye's private family life. As it turns out, Hawkeye enjoys home renovation and brings the subject up in the middle of an explosive firefight. During this helter-skelter cliffhanger, Whedon brings in three fresh characters: the obnoxious A.I. robot villain Ultron along with the brother and sister duo Pietro and Wanda Maximoff. Actually, if you saw 20th Century Fox's epic ""X-Men: Days of Future Past,"" you've seen the same character with a slightly different moniker. In the ""X-Men"" opus, Pietro was called Peter, and he shared the same ability to move so fast that most of what you saw was a blur. Another new character crops up in this ambitious sequel, but I'll leave you to learn about him on your own. Die-hard Marvel fans should enjoy this big, boisterous, slam-bang saga as much if not more than the original. Of course, anybody who read the original comic book will howl at the departures. Many of the Marvel characters are owned by different film studios, so fidelity to the source material in this cinematic adaptation was impossible without copyright infringement.<br/><br/>Inevitably, this charismatic new nemesis infuriates our heroes with its dreams of global Armageddon. ""Blacklist"" star James Spader furnishes the villain's voice. Listening to Spader indulge in his penchant for loquacity is always a joy, and he savors every line of dialogue for maximum effect. Spader plays the eponymous, sentient robotic villain Ultron, and he is more than a match for Iron Man, Thor, Captain America, Hawkeye, Black Widow, and Nick Fury. Visually, Ultron amounts to an imposing dastard, and he displays no qualms about exterminating mankind on the grandest of scales. He clones an entire robot army to perform his perfidious deeds. Interestingly, he can teleport from one android to another without exposing himself. Naturally, our heroes can never tell if Ultron is the actual robot that they are trying to smash to smithereens. Meanwhile, Pietro and Wanda prove to be challenging adversaries when they tangle with our resilient heroes. Indeed, as Ultron's chief lieutenants, they could easily have defeated the Avengers. Unfortunately, drastic things happen about an hour into the action that makes them alter their allegiance. For the record, the ABC-TV Marvel series ""Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D."" set the events into motion in ""Avengers 2's"" first scene. Agent Coulson (Clark Gregg of ""Iron Man"") had infiltrated the impregnable Hydra headquarters of Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann of ""Valkyrie"") and located Loki's powerful scepter. The Avengers were dispatched to retrieve the scepter. The ensuing fracas resembles something from a World War II battle spectacle. Naturally, the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) demolishes bunkers, while Captain America careens around on his motorcycle. Thor wields Mjölnir with pugnacious abandon. Amid this chaos, Whedon trots twins Pietro (Aaron Taylor-Johnson of ""Savages"") and Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen of ""Oldboy"") who have voluntarily participated in the Baron's experiments. Pietro can scurry in a hurry like ""The Flash,"" while Wanda can alter minds and heave flaming spheres of energy. Against Strucker's orders, the twins take part in the mêlée, but they aren't around long enough to turn the tide. Later, Ultron exploits them to the utmost. Wanda monkeys with the minds of our heroes, and the Avengers come close to splitting up because they don't trust each other. The delusions that Wanda's skullduggery have forged in Tony Stark's mind as well as Thor's are apocalyptic. At one point, Thor abandons the group to delve deeper into his Armageddon nightmare. None of the heroes are really slighted, but Captain America, Iron Man, and Black Widow claim the lion's share of the warfare. Nevertheless, Thor, Hawkeye, and Hulk get in their licks, too.<br/><br/>Several spectators have complained that ""Avengers 2"" suffers from fatigue-inducing, marathon-length, combat encounters that last for an eternity. What else would you expect from an outrageous, sci-fi, super-hero saga drawn from a comic book about a unit of costume-clad superheroes? Keep in mind, ""Avengers 2"" is NOT ""Downtown Abbey."" Whedon slows down the hurtling, headlong pace just long enough for our heroes to reflect on their horrendous predicament and then they regroup to thwart the villains. All of this is achieved with the brand of humor characteristic of a Disney franchise. Compare 20th Century Fox's Marvel movies, such as ""X-Men,"" ""Daredevil,"" and ""The Fantastic Four,"" that you'll see that they are just a mite more serious about their mayhem than Disney. Having said such, you'll be happy to know that Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Don Cheadle, and Samuel L. Jackson all return for this revelry. ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" qualifies as a terrific movie, and it looks fantastic in 3-D."

","I do not see why many critics and people out there are giving this movie a bad rating or said was disappointed with the film. I believe this movie received those reviews because of the high expectations for this movie to be the most memorable movie for years. I loved this movie. I thought it was much better than the first one, although I thought the first one was awesome as well. Ultron is an awesome villain who is well voice acted by James Spader and Hawkeye plays a much bigger role in this film than in the first. When the Avengers were not focused and were traumatized from Scarlet Witch's mind powers, he took them to his home and introduced his wife and kids. The action in this movie is much better than the first, and Captain America kicks much more ass than he did in the first Avengers. I believe everyone did a fantastic job in this movie, and I did not expect Vision to be in the film for as long as he was. Paul Bettany does a wonderful job voicing him as well by the way. If you're a huge Marvel fan or you enjoyed the first film, you should definitely watch this. It's definitely my top Marvel film of all time. Can't wait for Infinite War and Civil War."
"rmarsh225","10","2","9","3 May 2015"," Almost an Action Chick Flick
","There are reviewers that completely did not get it. This was more than an action movie which apparently some of these people wanted or like others wanting to laugh. Well this was not a comedy and when they mix too much comedy into it you get George Clooney as Batmsn. This was a well scripted and plotted story with great interactions with characters and maybe a little too much Hawkman back story but the squeaky wheel does still get the grease in Hollywod though it may just needed to grease him like Loki. I like the fact that they took it a bit dark and showed the weakness of humanity and sometimes your Heros and Gods fail to live up to your expectations. The only true Hero lays in the hearts of peaceful humanity. This movie had everything a mature person would love and they have been gearing these films More to a crowd who have imaginations and like a good ride. Age of Ultron should not disappoint and if it has you really need to open your mind and absorb the character building and plots if you choose to continue to watch these franchises and TV adaptations or you will truly become lost as did Ultron. Just don't let it destroy you with your hating."

"cuntraj","10","2","9","1 May 2015"," Age Of Ultron
","You have to remember that almost each Avenger had their own sequel or was included in one, so this is like the climax of phase 2 of the MCU, but it wasn't like the last Hobbit film where is was all fighting. The movie about 3/5 of the time goes pretty fast, maybe a little too fast to collect your thoughts. Ultron is (Tiny spoiler) made almost 15 minutes into the movie. He is an awesome smart villain that didn't get the screen time he deserved. There is a lot of action, which is pretty overwhelming. But during the fast paced moments, the plot and character development is done pretty well. And Ultron is pretty well introduced. Now with the pros.The action is very well done. Hawkeye got the screen time and story he deserves. And personally I thought the Banner/Natasha relationship was fine. The Avengers get equal screen time. And the Vision and the twins were a great addition. And the Marvel human is there. All in all Age of Ultron is a great closing/climax to Phase 2 that does have a great villain that had it's injustices, a good and solid story that does move a little fast, Marvel surprises, humor, and fantastic characters."
"thejus44","10","2","9","27 April 2015"," Exciting sequel that proves that Wheadon is the master of balancing characters.
","This is a spoiler free review. <br/><br/>First off, let me begin by saying that this sequel has exceeded my expectations by a great amount. I was blown away by the sheer amount of spectacle and work Wheadon has put into making this sequel. <br/><br/>Well, in terms of comparing it with the the first Avengers movie, it would be high impossible to impact pop culture in such a way the previous one did. Wheadon recognizes this, and hence the movie feels fresh because it takes a new path, a painful path for the heroes. It feels more personal, more on what it takes to be a hero and and how being a hero means having no place in society. It's definitely fresh, and avoids the mistake most sequels do by aiming to go bigger and more of everything.<br/><br/>Avengers 2 isn't a mass event like it's predecessor, but instead a much better movie that chooses to focus on character arcs and most importantly, the story.<br/><br/>Ultron played by James Spader is a great villain. He's just like a human trapped in robot's body. He behaves like a spurned son of Tony Stark, and hates his father more than anything. He also has twisted views on how to achieve peace, since he was ""born"" very recently, and so sees nothing wrong with genocide because he isn't human. Unlike other Villains of Marvel, he doesn't just make a joke now and then, and in only scene is he humorous, simply because he is naive. <br/><br/>In shot, he is a very, VERY unique villain that I've never seen before, and really hope that he returns.<br/><br/>However, the thing I admired more about the movie was how Wheadon manages to for around 16 MAIN characters in the movie, give convincing origins for Quicksilver, Scarlrt Witch and Ultron, enough to symphatize with them throughout the movie. He does it skillfully and artfully and it is integrated seamlessly into the movie.<br/><br/>Some of the so called critics have complained that the movie feels very fast and some scenes have to be deleted. However, I can honestly say that it is not so. Yes, there's a lot going on in the movie. But no, it isn't overstuffed. It simply means that you can enjoy this movie more and more every time you watch it. This is a movie that gets better with repeat viewings, because you absorb something new every time, whether it be something you missed or a fancy easter egg.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a fantastic addition to the MCU, and possibly the best superhero movie of all time.<br/><br/>9.5 out of 10"

","Being a huge fan of marvel films i was slightly worried whether age of Ultron would live up to my massive expectations and it did. Joss Whedon I have to hand it to you, you managed to create a truly incredible film which does not disappoint. The action sequences were breath taking; the dialog both funny and witty; the special effects were stunning; and the story line was amazing. There were emotional parts, action packed elements and just like in the first film some excellent comedy. I adored the character of Ultron- he was evil and cunning. There are certain scenes that if you are a marvel fan, they will make you want to scream out in the cinema from amazement- the ending (the very end is just such an amazing moment) and the fight between hulk and iron man are some of these scenes- among others. The relationship between the avengers is explored so much more in this film and only adds to the film- their comedy bounces off one another and they really work and stick as team despite everything that comes to light in this film. I seriously suggest you go to watch this film so you too can marvel (see what i did there) at the incredible (hulk) work Joss Whedon, Stan Lee and Jack Kirby have created. Thank you."

","The movie is by all means not original but it is an okay pop corn movie. The action scenes is the only element the sells most pf the film. Captain America: The Winter Soldier beats Age of Ultron by far. Thus is not a must watch movie. You can really wait till it comes out on DVD. The film has too much going on and too short although there are 6 main characters. There is no character depth. Each character gets about 30 minutes of screen time at least except for Tony Stark. The film should be called Tony Stark and his followers. Quik Silver was wasted in this film. The best scenes are from Thor and War Machine. Thor is shown too be the mighty God of Thunder but at the same time he is downplayed with his powers. Don Cheadle delivers his lines extraordinarily well. This isn't a must see film."

The storyline was coherent and made sense, the villain was mediocre but way better than Thanos, and at least Marvel was trying at this point.<br/><br/>Having recently seen both endgame and Spider-Man far from home I no longer have hope that Marvel can pull through and be that company that created such great movies like Iron Man, Ant-Man, Guardians of the Galaxy, and even the original Thor. All of those movies were amazing, they were well written they were exciting and brought a sense of magic that is completely devoid and gone from these new movies. They may as well be made for TV movies, it's like Marvel has devolved back to the Lou Ferrigno Incredible Hulk TV series, which honestly and episode of that is better than Spider-Man far from home. Marvel has just become this pathetic, PC company that no longer cares about quality over quantity."
"paulclaassen","7","1","3","8 June 2019"," Incredible action, and more depth.
","I didn't like 'The Avengers' but nevertheless decided to give 'Age of Ultron' the benefit of the doubt and watch it. I'm glad I did.<br/><br/>I must be honest, after the opening - which made the film look more like a video game than a live action movie - I had little hope of enjoying it. Thankfully the film vastly improved after the opening scene. Some of the visuals were overdone, but for most part the visuals were spectacular. The slow motion photography with stuff happening all over the screen was incredible. Hollywood's inclination to destroy as much as possible in these movies never cease, do they, but I admit it really was actually fun in this movie.<br/><br/>This was the most I've enjoyed the Tony Stark character since 2008's 'Iron Man'. In fact, I enjoyed ALL the characters so much more than in 'The Avengers'. They had more flesh to them (uhm, figuratively speaking, off course). The plot and characters had more depth, and I enjoyed the chemistry between Black Widow and Hulk. It was subtle and sincere.<br/><br/>'Age of Ultron' was wonderful entertainment from beginning to end. The attack on the city during the finale was sensational!! This honestly was a lot of fun!"

"elshikh4","5","1","3","25 August 2017"," Excessiveness is no virtue !
","Simply, it's The Avengers (2010) on steroids, red bull, and LSD! We have the same heroes, yet with additional ones, an army of CG shots, too much action it's going to make you sick, and the hugest amount of twaddle, prattle, and babble you'll ever experience. Well, dear writer / director Joss Whedon, excessiveness is no virtue!<br/><br/>The action sequences run so snappily as if The Flash directed them. It's like riding a loose roller-coaster, I was shouting ""Please, make it slower!"". Whether somebody pressed the Fast-Forward button while Play is on, or it has the most irrational editing of 2015 (Here's a challenge for you: Try to find Julie Delpy in this movie!).<br/><br/>Once the action is over, the dialogue is endless to the extent where you feel, rather live the fact, that this is a talk show more than an action movie. Bore was a superhero in this movie, and he killed it. When I recall that 15 minutes sequence in the movie's middle, where they go to the safe house, I fall asleep instantly. GOD! It's where The Avengers meets Little House on the Prairie!!<br/><br/>There was some relief, scary one. The tragedy is that the comic one-liners were horrible, and delivered horribly as well. No actor cared to be a bit funny while performing them. They're all in rush, forgetting to give an iota of ""feeling"" along the way. Actually, the performance got robotic sometimes, look at Captain America, Thor and Stark while their talk right before the ending, they were phoning in their lines in incredible frigidity!<br/><br/>Like the first movie, the evil guy's soldiers are still alike, and so easy to kill. Speaking of continuous downsides from the first movie, I'm still asking: What Hawkeye and Black Widow have to do with The Avengers in the first place?! THEY'RE NOT SUPER ANYTHING FOR GOD'S SAKE! And for a new downside, that maybe will continue in next movies; They made Captain America curse!!<br/><br/>And then we get to the LSD issue. Yes, I mean the character of ""Vision"". Who is that guy? And how he's even born? So Stark is capable of CREATING people now??!!<br/><br/>As for any pros, the CGI and all of the imaginative details were excellent and enjoyable.<br/><br/>Sadly, Whedon had a lust for too much speaking, too fast action, producing heavy exhaustion in a form of a movie. I was shocked when knew that the first Avengers movie ran for 2 hours and 23 minutes, and this one ran for 2 hours and 21 minutes. The shock wasn't that this one is shorter; it was that it feels like 3 days already! To tell you the bitter truth, I slept in front if it 3 times. THREE TIMES!! It didn't happen with any other movie, not to mention a supposedly entertaining blockbuster. So I had to re-watch it, while fighting sleep, to write these words.<br/><br/>The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron mixed Marvel's lead characters, and good action sequences, with DC's grittiness, and serious drama mambo jambo, and the result is unbearable fat movie. If I went to watch it for a third time, I believe my computer would cry entreating for help, or at least shutdown itself out of fatigue!"

","The Avengers: Age of Ultron is the highly expected sequel to the cultural impactful classic of 2012's The Avengers. within Age of Ultron, you can feel the burden of all this heavy lifting threatening to crush writer-director Joss Whedon, who, by comparison, had it easy the first time out, in The Avengers. His task this time: Show the Avengers, Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) to be working together as a team; drive a wedge between them through Stark's creation of a peacekeeping AI called Ultron (voiced by James Spader) that turns against them; develop a romance between Natasha and Banner; flesh out Hawkeye, the regular Joe and, to this point, the most under-developed member of the group; introduce new characters, such as the twins Pietro Maximoff/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda Maximoff/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen). This already can seem like a lot, where as the plot is somewhat sort of messy. It is still entertaining but when comparing Age of Ultron to the original, everything about the original has this film beat.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is a good watch but it's hard to ignore certain boring or forced scenes. As many have said, this film being disappointing only lifts up expectations for the next Avengers film in the franchise. And we all know, the hype level and expectations for the third film will be quite high.
=====
As a rewatch (05/05/18') Age of Ultron is a decent watch but at time overwhelming and parts of certain boring. With many uninteresting subplots, action is there but some parts remain not as great. Opinions and voting remain same after a year of second viwing."

","Long story short--way too much destruction that was often difficult to follow at times. And who ends up paying for all that destruction? Stark? The government? Or both? Without question, the cast was awesome as usual, including the voice of Ultron, James Spader. The slow-mo scenes of everyone fighting was very cool for sure. But the scene where the Hulk goes berserk was way too long. I would have cut the time in half on that part. I was getting somewhat bored after a while.<br/><br/>The characters were great; the story was good and I loved the state-of-the-art technology. Enjoyed seeing Paul Bettany (Jarvis), and now that he's an Avenger, hopefully, we'll see more of him. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen were wonderful additions to the cast. Too bad Pietro gets killed but at least Wanda was spared.<br/><br/>The trance scene with Thor, that is, the background scene, was too vague, too quick. The camera shots on the whole, in my opinion, were spotty. It was hard trying to make out some of the scenes--on the whole it was a bit too busy! Sorry! Special effects were great, though.<br/><br/>I have ambivalent feelings about this movie. The whole movie seemed a bit choppy to me. I'm rating it 6 stars."

A bunch of minions fighting the Avengers led by a big mastermind? Where have we seen that before? Banal might be too strong of a word (that was just for the sake of alliteration) but it sure approaches it. The character development is obviously lacking, and so is depth. Humor is a bit cheesy, and while I did laugh along with the audience it just doesn't fit. There is not a sense of seriousness to the fight, which is why I tend to prefer DC movies.<br/><br/>Verdict: I did enjoy the movie. Not saying I didn't. But it is just not gripping at all.

"jonbreaks","7","1","3","5 May 2016"," Avengers Age of Ultron (contains mild spoilers)
","Age of Ultron is a worthy follow up to the first Avengers, though it ultimately is bogged down, ever so slightly, by its inconsistent tone and muddled stakes.<br/><br/>Marvel movies have become almost their own genre at this point. They all follow a similar rhythm, yet somehow still seem to retain their own voice. It seems to me that the best, thus far, have been the original Avengers and the 2nd Captain America, both of which are considerably better than this. Though Ultron offers somewhat compelling moral philosophy and the usual excellent choreography, the tone of Ultron as a villain is ultimately too comical to succeed. Furthermore, though the elimination of humanity is certainly high stakes, this movie inexplicably takes place in a small, out of the way Eastern European country that we don't care about, partially because it doesn't exist. Beyond this, given Tony Stark's seemingly endless resources, we are left to wonder what actually matters.<br/><br/>What works here, though, is the usual stuff that works for Marvel. The interplay between the Avengers. The fight choreography is top notch as always. Jess Whedon directs clear and concise battles; it is always evident who is fighting who, and how much progress is being made. James Spader mostly works as Ultron; the man is a natural talent. His voice is haunting, and his talent possesses a tangible texture that is miles ahead of the other actors here. To be fair, James Spader is miles ahead of MOST actors. The hero aptly named Vision is another standout, as are the twins Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, though, even if this is less than you wanted from an Avengers sequel, it's still a quite good movie. It's still extremely palatable, even if it does go down a little easier than you'd like. More significantly, it's still miles better than anything DC has done with Superman or Batman. <br/><br/>7 out of 10."
"amartinez2001","10","2","10","2 May 2015"," Must have seen a different movie
","It sounds like most of the people who reviewed this movie didn't care much for it. I don't know if I'm abnormally easy to please (I certainly don't think so) but I loved this movie. I thought it was fantastic. I thought the humor that was present throughout the movie was true to the characters and added some personality to what could have been a very dark & dreary movie. I thought that there were some great small moments of character development (let's be honest, we can't be expecting every one of the dozen main characters on screen to undergo a dramatic personal growth in this type of ensemble effort) and there is just enough of a story (not a complicated one) to bring the impressive action sequences together nicely. In fact I think one of the strengths of the movie was the character interactions/dialog. I'm admittedly a fan of the way Joss does that in just about all of his projects (I know some are not) but the little hints (some subtle, some not) & moments of reading in between the lines does a lot more character development than some want to give credit for. If I were to judge by the theater's reaction, everyone seemed to come out of auditorium thoroughly impressed. There was laughter, gasps, oohs and ahhs all throughout the movie I'm sure there are some folks who genuinely didn't like parts of this movie, but it seems that at least some of these bad reviews are coming from kids who are just too cool for school. I thought Joss did a great job and that in many ways Age of Ultron was the equal to and in some moments surpassed the first movie. I had read some of the reviews before seeing the film and was resigning myself to maybe being disappointed or the movie not living up to my own expectations. I ended up loving every second of it. I felt like a kid in a candy shop for 2.5 hours and couldn't find a bad thing to say. I guess everyone has a different take on it, had different expectations for what sort of movie it would be or what the characters would be doing... but I for one, couldn't recommend this movie any higher."
"The_paranoid_android","10","2","10","1 May 2015"," Age of Ultron manages an impressive feat - being even better than The Avengers
","Avengers: Age of Ultron already assumes that the audience is familiar with superheroes, who they are, and what they can do. After all, a film with a genetic beast, spies, a billionaire vigilante, a God, and a super soldier kinda already demands you assume this is a universe of the fantastic.<br/><br/>After raiding the last of the evil Hydra's headquarters, the Avengers stumble on the last remnants of secret technology that Stark uses to create artificial intelligence, Ultron, in order to protect the world from future conflicts that the Avengers could not face alone. Unfortunately, after gaining sentience in Stark's rush to exploit the tech before being whisked away to Thor's home world of Asgard (land of Norse Gods), Ultron commences an attack on the Avengers, which slowly starts looking more like an attack on mankind after he starts gaining more perspective on life, though his real motivations remain mysterious for the majority of the film. Tagging along are Pietro and Wanda Maximoff - experimented twins who team with Ultron who have a personal vendetta against the Avengers. It's up to the Avengers in a globe sprawling adventure to stop Ultron before his plans come to fruition.<br/><br/>First, I have to say that the first Avengers is a mad feat of complexity as an ensemble film - giving enough time and personal arcs for each character to make a cohesive whole from everyone's story. With Age of Ultron, things are ratcheted up to 11 as character stories seamlessly flow in-and-out of a labyrinth of a narrative. I feel like this movie will become even better with repeat showings as character beats and story revelations will become more enriched with hindsight of where they lead to.<br/><br/>Characters who got the short end of the stick in the last film in terms of screen-time, like Romanov and Barton, are given particularly more story to enjoy as most of the other characters deal with one form or another of the choices they've made and where they choose to proceed in terms of the world they want to leave behind. Never in my life would I think that a superhero film would more ponderous about the impermanence of life, the concept of immortality, and moral pragmatism than Age of Ultron. In a film that could have been so easily tempted to streamline story elements, writer/director Joss Whedon crafts a story that demands an attentive mind to examine every piece of dialog, story beat, and (yes) even joke to bring a holistic view of a grand superhero story. It's mature without falling into being lethargically dour, grandiose without being just an empty light-show, and uplifting without being simple-minded about it. Great acting, snappy dialog, deep thematic content, and terrific action scenes make Age of Ultron the gold to which not only every superhero film will be judged by, but every film that identifies itself as a blockbuster. It's not merely a stopping point for a dull viewer to enjoy as they wait for the sequel, but a fascinating perspective on humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>The Avengers show the world (and the audience) that at the end of the day, their job (or responsibility depending on who you ask) is to protect people, and while there will always be disagreements as to how to accomplish it, there's no question that these people with the ability to change the world will always answer the call."

","This movie is very entertaining. Kudos for that. I never felt bored. But entertainment doesn't always equal quality. All the characters behave very much like characters you see in every other Hollywood superhero action movie. The avengers are super cool, look super good, are super funny and blah blah blah (Robert Downey Jr. is supposed to VERY funny - he isn't) and the bad guys are super evil, bad and ugly. Nothing new there. <br/><br/>And the story? Bad guys wanna kill everyone, Avengers kick their asses.<br/><br/>The romance stuff between Hulk and Scarlett Johansson's character is just lame and feels very forced. But I do think that the Hulk is the best character of them all, mainly because it's a lot fun watching him smash things. And people. But it's a shame that we actually don't get to see very much of that.<br/><br/>So yeah, quite entertaining but apart from that - nothing. I've already forgotten large parts of the movie because nothing really made its mark."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is an outstanding movie with a very well developed plot and a superb cast. I know that many people will probably disagree with me, but I feel like this movie did everything right in terms of serving as a sequel to the original Avengers, it took the characters in to darker, more severe territories, which was a wise choice. Joss Whedon knew what he was doing and did not go the same route as many sequels do, by playing it safe and using many elements merely because they worked out well in the first movie. The cast are all still in good form, Robert Downey Jr. is of course the star of the show once again as Tony Stark, I also loved the new characters who are played very well by Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Paul Bettany. James Spader is terrifying as Ultron, a terrific villain who felt necessary for this sequel, as he is a step up from Loki, a great warm up before the Avengers: Infinity War. It's well written, the cast are all in great form and it kept me at the edge of my seat throughout, I would recommend Avengers: Age of Ultron to all moviegoers, particularly Marvel fans, you will certainly be impressed. <br/><br/>After a machine built by Stark and Banner to help the Avengers protect the world turns villainous, it is up to the Avengers to save the world from a robot powerful enough to destroy them all. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Robert Downey Jr."

","It's a killer folks.
Poor wee superhero's all fall out with each and get all sad about being superhero's
It's a wee shame for them. Nobody to talk too, they get awfully upset, then it leads to depression.
This film really highlights the tragedy of being a superhero. And we wouldn't wish that pain on anyone who isn't a superhero.
For I can only imagine how tough it must be to be able to fly, or lift up a heavy hammer or pretty much be invincible.
Oh it's cool actually, they made up with each other, and there all fighting together. Oh that's magic so it is! Good for them. And they've learned something too I'll bet. Something about teamwork and pulling together to defeat the enemy.
I hope they remember this learning curve for the other Avengers films. Maybe write it on the noticeboard or send a group WhatsApp.

"educallejero","5","1","4","12 April 2019"," Broken characters. Broken pace. Broken villain. Broken, but big.
","This one doesn't work. It has a lot of potentially awesome things. Ultron could've been an amazing villain with a philosophy (post-humanism, something that X-Men Apocalypse attempted to do as well), a team broken by their worst nightmares (thanks to Scarlett's powers), and the evolution of the team after their ""first mission"" together.
But it just didn't reach the potential.<br/><br/>The (a bit) darker story didn't match the light Joss Whedon tone, where everybody speaks with one-liners and witty dialogue (which also sucks, because it makes all the characters pretty much the same thing and it gets old fast).<br/><br/>The nightmares were great, but instead of sticking with them, they only helped to break the pace with a bunch of boring angsty scenes that amounted nothing, because the consequences from them were non-existing. Nobody grew from them. Tony's fears made him to commit the same mistake than before (not trusting anybody); Bruce Banner was again weak and even if morally against it, he didn't stop Tony; Hawkeye presented his family, and now we know who he cheated with Black Widow?; Black Widow considered herself a monster because she remembered that she couldn't have kids (what? That makes her the Hulk? What?); Captain America disliked Tony's attitude... again.
Whatever. Ultron was the worst part. He believed in post-humanism (he was that), and yet, the scenes with him were all used to showcase a ""What if Tony Stark were a villain?"" instead. Funny to some, I guess, but terrible for a villain.<br/><br/>Another thing that changed too fast? Scarlet and Quicksilver going from villains to heroes. Weak.<br/><br/>Having said that, the humor works at times, of course, the action is fun even if the stakes low, and the movie goes fast (other than the halt in the middle)."

I did not like Ultron at all, he was acting to formal in many situations, often comical without need, the CGI used on him was too much and somehow he lacked an identity for me. On the other hand, Vision looked weird, but I guess that is what he looks like according to the comics, but acted nicely, kept his promise when the world needed those kind of words the most, altho he was also a bit to much formal at times.

"Horst_In_Translation","4","1","4","11 November 2017"," Quantity over quality all along
","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a 2015 superhero movie and the first sequel to the super successful ""The Avengers"". Joss Whedon directs again and he is also among the writing team. The cast includes all the familiar faces like Downey, Johansson, Evans, Hemsworth, Ruffalo, Evans, Jackson, Renner... but they added some okay names too like Elizabeth Olsen or Sam Taylor-Johnson. The latter 2 play enemies early on, but when they realize what Ultron has really in mind, they quickly change sites. The danger is Avenger-made this time as it's Stark (and Banner) who created this mess that endangers all civilization now. Their intentions may have been noble, but shame that Ultron is not really capable of making a difference between good and evil and between cause of and reaction to violence. So he quickly becomes the Avengers' biggest nightmare. I personally was a bit surprised that Fury did not really teach the two culprits a lesson for what they secretly did. Honestly, everybody except Iron Man who was the initiator would have gotten their fair share of confrontation and criticism.<br/><br/>As for the overall quality of this film, I was pretty disappointed I must admit. The film runs for over 2 hours and 20 minutes and while it did not drag too hard admittedly, it all felt so generic and uninspired. It's actually pretty difficult to say what was the weakest about this one. Maybe the constantly desperate attempts at funny one-liners that make even a great actor like SLJ look weak. Then again Nick Fury is definitely not his best role, just his most known perhaps. Or was it how weak the villain felt. They had such an extraordinary actor like James Spader at their disposal and he felt almost completely wasted. I really never felt as if Ultron was menacing enough that they needed everybody to take care of him. And that this would not be enough even. The references about the Avengers with their bond fighting Ultron who had many soldiers, but zero strings felt desperately rushed in to give the fight scenes some deeper meaning. It all felt pseudo and for the sake of it all to me. This was a very bloated movie for sure, delivering from the technical perspective, but only there. Slightly memorable scenes like Hawkeye's family stayed the exception. It was all very shallow and very superficial.<br/><br/>And what's even worse, the quantity-over-quality component is in danger of becoming even more crucial as they keep adding more and more characters to the franchise. The result is that forgettable new characters have zero impact almost (did you cry when Quicksilver died? I was closer to cringing to be honest) and the old ones are not showing anything new at all or if they do like the romance part between 2 Avengers here, then it feels somewhat unauthentic to be honest. Besides why is always Renner's character the one getting wounded? Because he's the only one not trained in close combat? Please. Another disappointing repetitive aspect and his joke on mind control did not change things for the better. Hell, even Stan Lee's cameo was nothing extraordinary this time and it felt for the sake of it all like the rest of the film. It was not a failure, but it was a movie where you could comfortably switch off your brain before the start as it won't challenge you whatsoever. Or have you care. And that's one of the worst statements you could make. I will soon see the new Thor movie and I hope they managed to step things up there again. And that they really improve with the upcoming Avengers film that will be released in 6 months or so. If they don't improve, then best would be to discontinue, which they obviously won't do as these films are hits financially as big as it gets. But that obviously doesn't mean their quality is convincing, let alone memorable. This one here is the best example for that. Don't watch."

And it's glorious, a wonder to behold but it's missing one thing. The Film sees earth's mightiest heroes assemble again as Tony Stark creates a peace-keeping program known as Ultron that eventually turns on him believing that the only way to save mankind is to destroy it. Now the assembled team must stop the out of control robot in order to save mankind. We also see the return of some of other favorite side characters such as Maria Hill, Falcon, War Machine, Heimdall, Eric Selvig and some new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlett witch. James Spader he was born to play Ultron, he owns this role. The relationship between Bruce Banner and Black Widow is by far a great edition that hope continues for the next time we see these two characters on screen together. Giving them traits in common, explores Black Widow's past and giving them a romance that is incredibly believable. Hawkeye has a much larger part of this film and that is my favorite thing about this movie because he is my favorite Avenger and I hope I see him in Infinity Wars. Everyone has talked to death about the casts chemistry from the first film and that same chemistry is still here, there's no need for me talk about it. I love the new characters of Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver and I'm glad they got these two actors to portray them, they would have been my first choices. The only down side to this movie is that their were a lot of things cut from this movie but it still manages to be one of the best superhero films I have ever seen. It will never beat Spider-Man 2 though. Also the Iron Man situation with him quitting by the end of the third film was quite possibly one of the many things cut from the film but, like in the first film that be rectified in dialogue with him creating the peace keeping program so he doesn't have to be Iron Man. All in all people keep saying Guardians of The Galaxy is the best film from this universe which while I do think its great I don't think it's better then all of the others except Iron Man 3 and 2. This sequel manages to still have great depth, action, humor, and characters to make it great fun. I'm giving Avengers: Age of Ultron a five out of five."

","""Ultron"" comes and delivers most of what the trailers promised: a darker, more complex vision of what the superheroes must confront in order to keep this planet going.

If you care to make it more complicated, we can a bit of disfunctionality and the issue of artificial intelligence overriding the intent of its creators.<br/><br/>""Ultron"" is more of what we got the last time out, but it might be a little more than we should have. There are big explosions, close calls, sacrifices, and the development of some very interesting relationships between humans, Gods, and machines. The fluidity of how can transform into another is one of the film's highlights, and rarely we get to see the flaws in these beings, and we see plenty here.<br/><br/>Of course, we see monumental displays of technological destruction, and Ultron is one of the best villains we have seen in a while, beautifully rendered by the latest wonders of CGI and perfectly brought to life by James Spader who can make wonders happen with in the unlikeliest of characters. He makes us admire and hate Ultron. He's after fighting for what humans want: a perfect life, and if this requires the destruction of those flawed humans, well, let it be.<br/><br/>I have seen a few negative comments here, and that might be because once again, we have been given food for thought, and that's a bit of task for those who just want to see mindless fun (another 2015 blockbuster) come to mind. There's plenty of admiration for Science Fiction/Fantasy that explores issues and situations which have a foothold in reality. I keep thinking about those communicators in ""Star Trek"", the allusions to soul, life, and artificial intelligence explored in ""TNG"". <br/><br/>Go and have a little fun, and dare to ponder along the way."

","I'm writing a review about Avengers: Age of Ultron because it is one of the best superhero movies I've watched. Let started with how the movie was started.After the movie started, this was a fight scene already to get everyone pumped up for this movie. The fight scene was well made and all the character were introduced.I also love the plot twist in this movie because you'll never know want going to happen next.The story is getting more interesting from one second to another.<br/><br/>Now, let move on to how I thought about this movie. My favorite character is Hulk because has incredible power and strength and able to solve any problem by smashing everything.Hulk feels like one of my friends because when he goes mad, he smash everything.My favorite scene in the movie is when Hulk buster fights with Hulk.When I saw it in the trailer, I know it's going to be great and when I watched in the movie, it's even better.There is also a story about Hawkeye since he didn't have a movie. This movie makes me feel intense because you'll never know when there a fight scene and someone could have die at any moment. There are a few parts that I don't like about this movie.First off, there are too many jokes. They also tell jokes in the middle in the fight scene which make it less interesting. Second, Ultron appears out of nowhere and he goes destroy everything. Also, how can he have a facial expression since he an AI.Everything else except these two is great.<br/><br/>Finally, I think this is a well make movie and I would recommended to all of the superhero fans out there.If you like explosion,epic fight scene superhero, robot, you are going to love it. I rate this 8/10."

","When it was confirmed that a sequel to The Avengers was in the pipeline for Marvel Studios, the question that surrounds the film was' Will it overthrow its first film?' and by golly it does with amazing results. Avengers: Age of Ultron is not only one of those anticipated films that have expectations from every Marvel fan but it does tick the boxes for what the general audience wants to see. Just weeks after the release of Fast & Furious 7, AOU will have its chance to become a hit with fans and the box-office.<br/><br/>AOU takes place after the events of the previous films (Iron Man 3, Thor 2, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier) with The Avengers fighting the baddies that plot to dominate the world, but without the assistance of S.H.I.E.L.D with being destroyed (see Winter Solider to further explain this). Wanting to help the battle for peace further, Tony Stark and Bruce Banner develop a program/A.I. tech that will protect and serve the world but a particular source used causes a birth of a villain in the form of a robot and artificial technology named Ultron. This places the heroes not only in a battle to stop him, but they will encounter threats not only from him but from allies and future events.<br/><br/>Firstly, the storyline itself goes into bigger, darker and epic depths than what the previous film had and the location settings make it redeemable that they fight not only for one country but for the world the heroes live in. In terms of 'darkness' we are shown some dark pasts and future events, a villain who is hell-bent on exterminating the human race and perhaps confrontations between the heroes themselves on who is right, true and loyal to the code. Casting here is in top shape with the likes of Downey Jr., Evans, Hemsworth, Johansson, Renner and its supporting cast all providing great back-up to the character development and on-screen chemistry.<br/><br/>The visual effects are much like the amazing quality of not only from the first Avengers film but the previous MCU films that made them so acclaimed. The design of Ultron in particular was great, it made me believe that character was a threat and his personality is both dark and ruthless which makes him a best Marvel villain to appear in the MCU to date. The action set pieces are all choreographed to great detail, ranging from invading a castle of HYDRA operatives, an epic street fight between Hulk and Iron Man in the streets of Johannesburg city and the climatic stand-stand between good and bad make it all entertaining for action fans and comic book enthusiasts.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is indeed bigger, better, darker and more spectacular than its first film but without losing its trademark style of humor, storytelling and characters. It indeed places a spot on my Best Films list for 2015 and even now I wish that the 3rd Phase would kick off as I want to see how further it can go if it sticks to its cinematic formula.<br/><br/>4/5 – Nick & Jay"

","The main complaint about this film in all of it's negative reviews is that it isn't ""dark enough"". I was actually pleasantly surprised to find out that this movie blended humor and fun with the darker elements because I was turned off by the teaser trailer. I don't want the new Marvel superhero movies to try to be edgier than everyone else. I thought the darker and lighter elements blended well in the movie. With the exclusion of Quicksilver I liked the new additions. I didn't dislike Quicksilver though, but I did prefer the X-Men version over this one. I thought Ultron was a pretty great villain. He was not as good as Loki or the Ultron marketed in the trailers, but he was still a good enough villain. The movie did seem a bit rushed and Thor's side quest was kind of dumb, but over all I was satisfied with this movie."

The ending of course is literally out of this world as the Avengers have to contend with a falling Sokovia plummeting Earth as well as Ultron and his countless robot minions.<br/><br/>Hawkeye gets some character development introducing the audience to his family living in a remote cabin in the woods (get it). Banner and Black widow have a few scenes opening up to each other filling, some emotional depth of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie however does have a few plot holes that were left unexplained. At the end of Iron Man3 Tony Stark decides to quit being Iron Man, yet here he is in all his glory. A few jokes could have also been left out as it desensitized any tension or suspense.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon does an admirable job in making a consistent summer blockbuster. Cool CGI, fun one-liners, good performances and average plot is become somewhat of a template that most Hollywood movies seem to follow. I feel that Marvel should have tried to do something different as I was left wanting something a bit more. Age of Ultron is still an enjoyable film and will definitely entertain those who are just in for a good time."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","4","23 July 2015"," Good second part
","The Avengers return together in the second installment of the Avengers film trilogy. Once again all the characters have to work together to overcome an enemy that threatens the whole word and once again we tie together all the individual plot lines from the solitary films.<br/><br/>And once again it works. It really works. I especially like how director Joss Whedon has had the courage and common sense to allow the characters to evolve. The team has already been built so it's a great time to focus on their camaraderie. And that's the heart and soul of this movie. It's fantastic to see all these great characters working together and even just hanging around. In fact they have a party near the beginning of the movie and it's easily one of the best scenes in the whole film.<br/><br/>The actors are still at the top of their game with Chris Evans and Robert Downey Jr. once again earning a special mention. They're the two personalities who define the franchise and I cannot wait for Captain America: Civil War for a chance to see them together once again. Furthermore, the special effects are still state of the art, the action scenes are exciting and the villain is also one of the best we've yet had, which is great because interesting villains have been the one thing that Phase Two movies have mostly lacked.<br/><br/>But yeah, it's not a perfect movie or as good as the first Avengers. Most of the areas that work, work as well as in the previous film, but there are a couple of things that are a bit rough around the edges. Like the side plot they give to Black Widow and Hulk. It's interesting, but it comes straight out of nowhere and thus we don't really have a chance to connect with it. I'm not against the idea itself, but the execution needs some work. Secondly, by this point the plot formula is starting to become somewhat transparent. And I like the formula, but I would like it to be tweaked just a bit more so that I couldn't predict the story so accurately from the first few minutes.<br/><br/>Ultimately what this means is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is a good film, but it doesn't come close to being the best we've yet seen. And truthfully, it was pretty unlikely that it was going to be. Second parts are hard to do because you still have to save something for the finale, yet you've already established the characters and all that. Nevertheless, Age of Ultron is more than worth a watch or two if you've like the franchise so far. Have no fear. It's good, great even."

","Comparisons to Spider-Man 3 are a bad sign. <br/><br/>Sam Raimi's legendary mess set the standard for how bloated studio superhero films could easily become if not carefully curtailed. The genre was henceforth faced with a challenge: rise to the ""MORE! BIGGER! DIFFERENT AND BETTER!"" demand of increasing returns in a steadily oversaturated market without buckling under the condemnation of ""WHOA! TOO MUCH!"" – no easy task. <br/><br/>Or is it? For years, Marvel Studios held the golden ticket, keeping their action driven by humour and character beats, and remembering to have fun. Audiences, it seems, were not as keen on ""BIGGER! MORE!"" as on fresh, funny, and human – qualities nerd God Joss Whedon's 2012 Avengers delivered in spades. <br/><br/>Whedon announced that his Avengers sequel would be smaller, darker, and more personal. You can guess which two he succeeded at. <br/><br/>If anything, Age of Ultron will likely surpass Spider-Man 3 as genre benchmark for exhaustingly busy - a cautionary tale of pressures superhero blockbusters should not cave to if they want to remain relevant. The consolation: even at his worst (sadly) and most studio- bridled, Whedon remains incapable of making a work without moments of passion, joy, and gleeful inventiveness. Ultimately, most of Age of Ultron is very good; the main concern is that there is simply so much that it feels too exhausting to pack the same triumphant punch and clockwork (dare I say it) assembly of its predecessor. Whedon's TV background is apt, as Age of Ultron feels more like a miniseries - tons of worthwhile, memorable moments, but too much to watch in one go. <br/><br/>Thankfully, Whedon keeps the kernel of the story simple amidst its thousands of locations and often unnecessary subplots (sorry overlong farm scene and Thor's mystery exposition cave). The worst redundancy is namedropping the Infinity Stones – aka, MacGuffin of most of Marvel Phase 1 & 2, and the catalyst of the upcoming the two-part Infinity Wa– oh, you knew that already? So did everyone else, thanks to Benicio Del Toro and his wacky hair in Guardians of the Galaxy. Generic climaxes or not, Marvel's biggest pitfall is now wasting precious screen time 'world-building' instead of trusting that its already established audiences know how to google. <br/><br/>The film's action is lively, inventive, and constantly moving – the opening raid on Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann)'s Hydra safehouse alone contains more mayhem (and likely budget) than all 13 hours of the Marvel Netflix Daredevil series combined, complete with a long take tracking shot giving each character their smashing in the spotlight cleverly recalling its predecessor in Avengers' climactic showdown. This constantly zippy combat does wear a touch thin after the next several fights are similarly bouncy, and you begin to wish that at least one fight – particularly the long awaited Hulkbuster pugilistics (still awesome) – would stay still, and each blow count and resonate more. Instead, the CGI clanging becomes increasingly consequence-free, making it resoundingly less exciting over time. <br/><br/>Whedon's ultimate boon is his uncanny ability to give each of his massive cast moments of character development amidst the mayhem (take note, Peter Jackson and his '12 hours into The Hobbit and most of the dwarfs still haven't spoken'). All of the returning Avengers feel fresh and believable, even evidencing interesting character growth. Robert Downey Jr's Stark gets as many laughs as ever, but drifts into unsympathetic, self-described 'mad-scientist' terrain, doggedly rekindling Jurassic Park's creation debate for the smart phone age of instant technological gratification. His clashes with Captain ""language!"" America (Chris Evans, wearing the role like a comfortable leather combat glove) foreground the upcoming Civil War ideological conflict in the one piece of 'world-building' that feels natural and thrilling. <br/><br/>It is odd to yearn for more Ultron in a film named after him, but James Spader's performance- captured supervillain is a thrilling, fantastically believable creation. Interpreting Ultron as a furiously resentful adolescent gives Spader's silky baritone the chance to spout out as many exquisitely sulky ""Leave me ALONE!""s as eloquent zingers. Of equal fascination is his brainchild - Paul ""JARVIS"" Bettany's Vision. Scarlet with a golden cape, the '60s antique Vision is a hard sell, but Bettany's deftly ethereal performance makes his inclusion a high point (complete with a priceless sight-gag I won't ruin here). Likewise, in what should be an extraneous subplot, Andy Serkis' South African Ulysses Klaue damn near walks away with the show with his stupendously fun scene-chomping. The prospect of Serkis' return in 2018's Black Panther is mouth-watering.<br/><br/>Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and (especially) Elizabeth Olson both impress as the ""fast and weird"" Maximoff twins, wobbly accents notwithstanding, and their unique abilities help keep the smashing fresh and interesting. Chris Hemsworth's Thor steals most of the best laughs and lines, alongside Don Cheadle, who should really just get his own War Machine movie (miniseries?) already. Even Jeremy Renner's notoriously maligned Hawkeye picks up his share of character beats and laughs, mining the ""everyman surrounded by gods"" trope for all it's worth. <br/><br/>The cataclysmically weak point: the execrable Beauty and the Beast pastiche (wasn't Pinocchio enough?) Black Widow/Hulk romance. Their pairing never even remotely rings true, coming dangerously close to The Hobbit-levels of distracting, almost-tanking-the-show romance. If anything, the film is sure to play brilliantly on Blu-Ray, if only for the ability to fast-forward through these asinine 'BruTasha' interludes. <br/><br/>Ultimately, Age of Ultron is a generally solid maelstrom of superhero fun, but somewhat too incohensive, too much, to sit well in a single sitting. The incorrigible excess would be enough to crave the smallness (ha) of Marvel's next release, Ant-Man, if it didn't look even more soulless since the departure of spark-of-life Edgar Wright. As it stands, as a more grounded antidote, Netflix's Daredevil is rather fantastic. Plus, it has a good zinger about cat videos. Whedon would be proud. <br/><br/>-7/10"
"HotlineSF","7","1","4","10 June 2015"," a bit bloated, but good action movie
","in a vacuum, this is a pretty good action movie, but being a sequel to ""the avengers"" means it will always invite comparisons to the original and be judged at a higher standard. Unfortunately, ""age of ultron"" doesn't live up to it's predecessor. The action and humor is still there. Joss Whedon excels at crafting these fluid elaborate action scenes where the camera pans between multiple characters kicking ass in their own way and then occasional teaming up to take down some bad guys. It's pretty impressive to see considering the size of the Avengers roster and the extreme differences in each superhero's powers. Humor-wise, we have typical Whedon jokes, but I'd argue that there's a bit too many going around in the midst of all the fighting this time. Some jokes felt forced, with characters spewing one-liners every time they got any screen time during an action scene.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the writing is less focused than the first one. There's a scene where Thor goes into a cave somewhere, submerges himself in water, and starts having dream-like visions of the future, and this doesn't make much sense or seem necessary. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are woefully underdeveloped, with a boring backstory and bad clichéd Eastern European accents. With all the details packed into this film, it seems like Marvel's trying too hard to connect the dots between all their properties and set things up for the future, and this comes at the expense of the movie as a whole.<br/><br/>One of the bright spots is James Spader's portrayal of Ultron. Instead of being this stereotypical cold, calculated, terminator-like villain, his personality is that of a spoiled, petulant, mischievous child, and it works pretty well."
"brandoncarlk","8","1","4","10 June 2015"," There are some strings that hold it down
","I feel people are being unnecessarily harsh with this movie. While it's not perfect, it still has everything a summer blockbuster movies should have, sadly with a little extra baggage.<br/><br/>The story and setup is simple enough to follow along and has some ideas and themes that are fun to think about. It's nothing really deep, but it adds some meat whereas another blockbuster franchise, Transformers, has nothing like it. Every action sequence was fun, and they all felt as though they belonged and didn't feel too random or out of place. <br/><br/>Most of the characters are still just as great, and Hawkeye was developed even more since he got the short end in the first movie. The only major stumbling blocks are the romance between the Hulk and Black Widow, and Thor's side-quest. The former felt unearned and it was confusing since she had more chemistry with other characters. The latter felt like padding. Ultron was actually snide and funny, which is different than the solely-menacing villain in the trailers. That's not a bad thing but it was unexpected and he still was quite menacing. <br/><br/>The humor was mostly spot on, and I think that helps because with a character that looks like the Vision, this film should not take itself too seriously. There are two running gags that start at the beginning and get funnier as the film goes on, both ending with a good pay-off. <br/><br/>This isn't as good as the first, but it's still well-worth watching. This is what audiences really want when they're only looking for a simple story, engaging characters, fun action and spectacle. It's pure escapism and entertainment.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS** **SPOILERS** **SPOILERS**<br/><br/>Another thing that really bugged me was there was a character who was mostly introduced in this film, and he dies at the end. Sure he's given opportunities to be heroic, but his brief appearance hindered the impact. It feels like a waste. <br/><br/>**END SPOILERS**"
"secretzfan","8","1","4","29 May 2015"," Good but.....ehhhh.. still has flaws- End of superhero age?
","Note I still gave this a 8/10. Why it doesn't live up to the hype it still a fun movie. This is not a bad film as it has a lot of strong moments in it, but there is still work to be done. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon is a god among men and knows characters well, but that doesn't translate when you have as many as this does and it is not a series. And that is just the issue here Whedon. If this was a TV show it be the best show ever, but it isn't so writing it like one makes it feel so cramped. <br/><br/>The story in this not to different from the first Avengers movie. It is still simplistic. Ultron wants to blow up the world, the Avengers try to stop him. That's all the audience ever really knows about this story. Same as how The Avengers wanted to fight Loki and defeat him. <br/><br/>As I said Joss Whedon needs to go back to TV. The character development was so packed in with this film. It is like you were trapped in a box you couldn't get out of. And while some moments were great between the characters not all of them were as fleshed out. The romance was stale and random, and didn't feel authentic. It just became a plot device<br/><br/>That being said the character development is were the movie shines. I came out this movie liking every Avenger. Thor, Black Widow, Hulk, Captian America, Iron Man, Hawkeye, Scarlet Witch,and Quicksilver all were developed to the point were you could love each and every one of them. Compare that to the last Avenger movie were Iron Man and the Hulk took all the glory and came out being the only ones we cared about. <br/><br/>Sadly we all have to look at the box office and reception this movie got and as a nerd realize this may be the end of another superhero age or the beginning of it. Marvel has failed the non comic book readers and made them feel alienated. It has a cinematic universe idea which at first was brilliant has instead begun to fall and that hurts. I want people to love comic book movies and I would love it even more if these comic book movies could help people wanna go out a read a comic book, but this seems like a movement to a dark age. If Marvel doesn't change, ad if Kevin Feige doesn't make a decision to find a balance between the lightheartedness and the darker scenes we will see a day when the comic book era would have to be rebooted again."

","Age of Ultron is probably the most freshest movies we have seen in a while. Its awesome special effects, plot, and superheroes make this one truly worth the money. I was also impressed with how they added a wider variety of heroes to the roster. Ultron himself also was impressive, with his own fair share of humor in the mix.<br/><br/>That was probably why I liked the movie. It just didn't feel good about how quick the introduction all went and how the whole Ultron thing went. I didn't understand Ultron to be honest, I knew he was this evil robot, but I didn't get the whole origin of his AI type of thing came into place. Its a quicksilver shift to phase 3 and the humor and action doesn't mask any of it. I firmly believe that if this continues to happen in the movies, them I'm going to have to give them a 6 or 7 from now on."
"SugarandIce","8","1","4","27 May 2015"," It's no game changer, but it's worth your attention.
","I can't love Age of Ultron like I loved the first film. Some of the appeal of seeing our heroes together for the first time has left. The jump cut action is a bit unsatisfactory this time around. The narrative has lost its streamlined perfection and yet feels incomplete. This film is filled with misfires in characterization, tone, action, and storytelling. And yet while a flawed film, it is worth a ticket price. Age of Ultron still has plenty to offer. It gives us several new characters like Ultron and Scarlet Witch that add new life to the cinematic universe, and Josh Whedon continues to avoid overwhelming the audience with his massive assemble. In the end, this is a fun, big action film with plenty of likable characters and moments. However, it also suffers heavily from unevenness of the execution. As such the sequel failed to outdo the much slicker original film."
"Darkhorse_Knight","7","1","4","20 May 2015"," DHKR: Age of Ultron- ""The Age of...Hawkeye?""
","Age of Ultron isn't a worthy successor to The Avengers. It's not worthy of succeeding Guardians of The Galaxy. It doesn't even come close to succeeding The Winter Soldier, the best of the Marvel movies in my opinion. It doesn't live to the hype, and it certainly disappoints many die-hard fans. <br/><br/>But, that doesn't mean the film is bad. It's not bad in the slightest, if anything, it's bloody terrific. It's just not all that it's hyped up to be, and if I could just leave my review as that then by God I'll just end it as is. However, there's simply too much to talk about. So short version, it's good, go see it and you'll enjoy it.<br/><br/>The rest of this will just be writing out the nitpicks and flaws while praising where praise given, but I assure you Age of Ultron is well worth your time. OK? OK.<br/><br/>The bulk of the film's action takes place at the very beginning in a vaguely Eastern European country holding the current Baron Von Strucker and a small paramilitary force of Neo-Hydra troopers. While the clash is going on, drones in the form of Iron Man hold back the angry population of countrymen, taking heavy abuse and unintentionally crafting the form of our Ultron puppet we see later in the film. Also, the Maximoffs come out to fight in support of Hydra, doing a great deal of damage.<br/><br/>Strucker is captured, and Tony Stark takes the scepter of Loki which the Baron had stolen prior. Wanda Maximoff, aka The Scarlet Witch, soon kick starts the ""Age of Ultron"" by using her powers of fear to show Stark what will happen if said initiative doesn't go as planned. <br/><br/>Later, Ultron is created, and he soon takes the form of a puppet-like android made up of scrap metal from disfigured robots. The ""Suit of Armor"" has grown sentience and now will eradicate the earth of human life, where only machines rule the world. <br/><br/>Ultron's supposed ""evolution"" requires a human-like form, which is, of course, thwarted in the third act with the birth of ""Vision"", who now has JARVIS' AI. The final part is upon a floating city, destined to destroy the Earth like the meteor that destroys the dinosaurs. The Avengers fight off a horde of Ultron drones, the city is destroyed, and the day is saved. And Quicksilver dies in a hail of bullets. Sad.<br/><br/>What really made the film less fun then the original was mostly falling upon the villain himself. Ultron's voice may be menacing, but everything else about him is mediocre at best, and degrading at worst, especially considering his origins and reputation. He lacks the kind of malevolent power and presence that make you want to hate him, like how Loki from the first film had. Never once did I look at Ultron and say ""I want you to be stopped"". If anything, I wasn't feeling any kind of emotion. Ultron was just a villain, meant to be stopped to save the world. Unlike Loki, who you've built up to hate so much that you feel great when you do see him get his just deserts, Ultron is just an evil robot with a slick tongue spewing out Bible verses because...the Bible is evil? I guess? It's just a missed opportunity. <br/><br/>In contrast, most of the other villains are far more interesting but given far less screen time than Ultron himself, understandably. Strucker from before is like Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes if he was put as a present day Authorotorian military CO, but unfortunately gets axed off by Ultron. Another entertaining villain, Ulysses Klaw(The obligatory pseudo-racist para militarist corporate WASP, and the enemy of Black Panther, naturally), is given a few scenes deemed entertaining, mostly involving Quicksilver and a couple bullets. The joke is cut short when our main Antagonist slices the hand off Klaw, leading into a shootout between the mercenaries and the Avengers<br/><br/>Most of the development is given more to the heroes this time around, many working to an advantage versus how it worked to them versus the villains. Thor has grown more of a sense of humor, Stark and Banner's scientific sides shine brightly while trying to craft Ultron and Vision, we even get a little insight into the past of Black Widow when she was starting to become a weapon for the Soviet Union. <br/><br/>However, the largest development of character given is undeniably to Hawkeye. Who was once considered a running joke in the MCU and outside to the fan base, Hawkeye is given time to show off his life when he isn't forced to shoot robots and Nazis with a bow. He's a family man, a conservative, a blue collar outdoorsman and a patriarch. In a movie series that's known for breaking boundaries, this recall to what a hero from the 50s was like is a breath of fresh air, and it still manages to work as a great comic book movie. In fact, I'd honestly would like to see a movie based solely on him or his origins<br/><br/>Whatever I say or not will change your minds on Age of Ultron. You probably have already seen it, MCU fan or not. What I have to say is that while a flawed film, Age of Ultron is a great movie to see. You'll enjoy this one, so check it out if you haven't.<br/><br/>4-Stars- A-Ranking"
"Robert_duder","8","1","4","19 May 2015"," Marvel continues its legacy
","Every time I see a Marvel film I feel like I'm writing the same review. I don't mean that in a bad way. Marvel has created this incredibly epic world that they just keep building and building and building and while I stand by the fact that eventually they are going to collapse and over-saturate the market, so far they are doing it right. The super-hero films they have created range from good to truly great and the first Avengers film was truly great. It was a non-stop thrill ride and the definition of a great summer Blockbuster. Since then we have the second phase of films (Thor 2, Captain America 2 etc) that served to build even more complexity to this intense world they have created. Sometimes I have to wonder if they are getting too smart for their own good. Avengers: Age of Ultron doesn't even cap any of the story. It actually is yet another middle ground in this Universe but it certainly serves to bring together Earth's mightiest heroes and further their story. The first Avengers film was amazing because it was the first step we saw all these amazing heroes on one screen together and director Joss Whedon did an incredible job of balancing everyone. Age of Ultron still balances everyone pretty well but gives far more attention and depth to characters that have been secondary up until now. The film started out just a little shaky for me but by the end I was as thrilled as I always am with a Marvel flick.<br/><br/>One of the best things Marvel did was casting. The cast is amazing, always has been and everyone is so perfectly suited for their roles. We know these heroes so well from their own films so Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth and Chris Evans fit back into their roles perfectly. I sort of liked that this Avengers film didn't beat us over the head with these characters in particular because we do get so much of them already. They are there and they are everything we love about them but its not too much. Mark Ruffalo actually turned out to be a terrific Hulk. Sure he never had his own film but in only a few scenes he always manages to steal the show and as an actor he manages to really convey the emotional torture of Bruce Banner in only a few scenes each film. Scarlett Johansson and Jeremy Renner return as Black Widow and Hawkeye and are the best they have ever been. The film gives them some serious back story and detail to their characters for the first time. I've never been a huge fan of Renner or Hawkeye but he stands out this time around. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen join the cast as Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and both are good. Olsen is actually excellent and Taylor-Johnson is very underused and underdeveloped but still good. James Spader is the voice of the villainous Ultron and he is superb. His voice and personality is just absolutely dead on for Ulton. The rest of the cast is as good as they've ever been and you'll see all the familiar faces like Samuel L Jackson, Paul Bettany (who we get to see in person for the first time), Don Cheadle and Anthony Mackie.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon will forever be known as the man who managed to bring the Avengers to life. He says this is it for him in this Universe but his legacy will live on. In the first part of the film, which drops you squarely into the action, I was a little hesitant about where it was going. The CGI seemed a bit rough some of the trademark Avengers humour felt forced. But, thank goodness, the film finds its footing and the special effects are very good and the CGI is not overwhelmingly in your face. I felt like it did lack a truly epic moment like the first film had but it still gives you everything you could want. There are two or three battles that are outstanding and one truly epic moment that is Iron Man VS Hulk and I would literally see the movie again for that battle alone. In short, Avengers: Age of Ultron is not as good as the original but it does amazing things for the storyline and Marvel Universe and is outright entertaining. 8.5/10"

","I saw this Thursday night before May 1st in a jam packed IMAX theater with some of my friends and it was honestly one of the best movie theater going experiences I've ever had! That being said, the film itself has essentially the same overall plot as the first film but what we got was pretty cool. The action was very, very well done and the cinematography is up there with The Dark Knight films and Man of Steel (those having the best film work out of the superhero films, imo). The script was amazing and the dialogue was perfect, encompassing who these characters are at heart.<br/><br/>Where this film faults is its very thin narrative and pacing. The nearly two and a half hour film flies by without notice and there is literally never a boring moment BUT there are many subplots that aren't fully developed (which will more than likely be solved in the bluray extended release).<br/><br/>Overall, while extremely enjoyable, the film suffers from the same exact problems the first film had. You know exactly how it will end and the narrative really just isn't that interesting.<br/><br/>That opening tracking shot though...the ticket is worth the price just for that scene alone! 7.5/10"
"KiltsMcGee","6","1","4","17 May 2015"," Pacey Comedy
","My viewing of Age of Ultron came directly after watching the first Avengers film along with the second Captain America film. Needless to say both those films remain hugely enjoyable. What is interesting is the multitude of references to these films within Age of Ultron. Falcon shows up and talks about his and Steve's on- going search for Buck Barnes and Don Cheadle turns up and is incredible. Don Cheadle isn't involved in the other films but he is so unforgettably hilarious that I cannot help but mention him.<br/><br/>Tony Stark finds this crazy computer contraption inside Loki's sceptre and decides that the correct course of action is to create an artificial intelligence, an idea that never goes wrong. Everything goes wrong.<br/><br/>In the same vein as Cheadle's impressive use of screen time, the entire film turned out to be majorly a comedy as opposed to the DC-esque, Gothic films that the trailers somewhat make it out to be. I am in no way annoyed by that. I feel that Marvel films understand their purpose far more than DC does. It would be unwise for you to mention Man of Steel to me because you will invoke my unstoppable rage and perish immediately. The mood that the film set was utterly opposite to the whimsical, borderline comedic destruction of Metropolis. Marvel Studios films understand that they should (and do) aim to entertain the audience and they succeed. The film does this by just making the film hugely funny. The jokes were constantly present and connecting making the film something that I would actually like to watch, a feat Man of Steel was clearly unable to reach.<br/><br/>This flow of humour sadly meant that the atmosphere of the film was unstoppably flipping between whimsical happiness and psychological terror. It's as if the film wants to entertain but also to be taken seriously. Each moment is successful in achieving what they are aiming for but when stitched together, the tone is more unpredictable than a caffeine filled boy with Tourette's.<br/><br/>Along with this, the film felt far too dense to me. They were trying to cram so much into an admittedly long film. Andy Serkis turns up for a bit and there are three new characters need to be introduced. Far more than the zero introductions made in the first. This paired with the tonal shifts made the film feel slightly shambolic.<br/><br/>I am happy to report that while there are a lot of new characters they are all pretty damn cool except for Ultron. Hawkeye is the marquee example of that. I have been waiting since the first Thor film for Hawkeye to be an interesting character and his backstory is delved into a little in this film. The other characters: Vision, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch are basic but that base was pretty decent. On a more negative note, the titular villain, Ultron, didn't nearly get the screen time that he needed.<br/><br/>All that needs to be said is that he isn't exactly Loki, something that can be said referring to the other Marvel villains of the recent films.<br/><br/>Marvel Studios has been on excellent form for the past four or five years and Age of Ultron maintained the comedy and pace of Guardians of Galaxy. The film certainly does have flaws but there was only one point at which when I wasn't loving it and that point was Mark Ruffalo wearing Beats headphones, maybe the worst product placements I have ever seen. Besides this, I would conclude that Age of Ultron is on par with the first Avengers film. BOOM"

","Ever since the coming of Marvel's Avengers, the world has not been the same. In the real world, the film set the gold standard for how to pull off the cinematic-universe model of filmmaking, and it did so with such iconic status that it'll remain a landmark for generations young and old. Within the universe Marvel created, the Avengers opened up the Earth to staggering possibilities of war with god-like entities from other worlds. Since then, the events of Iron Man 3, Thor: The Dark World, and Captain America: The Winter Soldier would cut the strings off of the Avengers team and force them to face a new challenge on their own.<br/><br/>The film immediately kicks off with a destructive brawl in Sokovia, where the Avengers come pre-assembled to pummel the hell out of a Hydra base. In the process, they run across more superpowered villains, and a stark vision of a dismal future. This leads to the rise of Ultron, a new breed of villain that actively splits the team apart from the inside out. The Avengers fight themselves, quite literally in a few scenes, including a chaotic sequence between the Hulk and Iron Man. They come together in the end for one lengthy climax that pits them against a whole army of machines, while the fate of the world hangs in the balance. With all of this going on, it goes without saying that there's definitely loads of superpowered action to behold. At the same time, the film is careful to keep things lightweight with bursts of witty banter and humor.<br/><br/>The story strikes me as being a grade more mature than the last Avengers film, which was little more than an alien invasion that prompted heroes to band together. Now, it's a robotpocalypse that threatens to tear the team apart; in spite of that, the characters are explored a little more in-depth, often with surprising insights into each characters' strengths and weaknesses. Not every viewer will enjoy the sudden relationship between Bruce Banner and Natasha Romanoff (and I agree that it's rather weird; she was practically afraid of the guy in the first film). Also, not every viewer will find Ultron a striking villain - he is not necessarily menacing like Ronan or a ""bad guy we love to hate"" the way Loki is - but I found him interesting and nuanced, especially as a ""child"" of Tony Stark who inherits some of his same traits, which gives him a twisted sense of purpose. Through Ultron and his motivations, the film unearths strong themes of evolution and the progress of mankind; themes that were common in the X-Men, but were rather implicit in the other Marvel films up to now. Parallels are blatantly drawn between Ultron and Pinocchio, but I couldn't help but to compare Ultron to V'Ger from Star Trek: The Motion Picture - they are both ""child-like"" intelligences that threaten mankind and strive for evolution, but while V'Ger meant no harm in the end, Ultron exudes hostility and angst beneath his playful sarcasm, and I think that makes him more remarkable. In spite of these insights, I thought the film's story was quite intriguing. Ultron's diabolical plot gives the Avengers team a twisty mystery and a larger-than-life spectacle, which might strain logic in a few places, but it also leads the characters into different directions by the end.<br/><br/>The film boasts pretty good photography. It tends to be very choppy and shaky in the action scenes, much unlike the first film, which felt much more smooth and solid. However, this film does have some good-looking shots. Color schemes are notably darker and more drab. Editing can be rather choppy. Acting is fine for what it is: Chris Evans, Robert Downey Jr., Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, and Samuel L. Jackson are as enjoyable to watch as ever. James Spader breathes life into Ultron superbly. Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are pretty good in their roles, and there are a few welcome cameos by Don Cheadle, Ibris Elba, Stellan Skarsgard, and Anthony Mackie. Writing is pretty decent. This production spares no expense on the sets, props, costumes, and special effects; it all looks a grade more polished and more real than the first film. The music score by Bryan Tyler and Danny Elfman reprises the same themes that Alan Silvestri introduced, but also contributes some strong compositions throughout the picture.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron delivers bigger action, with an intriguing story that gives the titular team a more desperate fight. I don't think it's quite as breezy as the first film, and I find the first film's action scenes easier on the eyes. If you're following the Marvel movies, however, this is the apex of Phase 2, and it's worth the time.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Good | Content: Very Good | Film: Good)"

They don't always get along, and all of the scenes with them assembled are not amazing, but this is more of what you expect with a team. Some of the scenes I enjoyed the most were scenes where they resembled normal folk. Scenes where they are partying or hanging out, or even in an old farmhouse with Hawkeye's (Renner) family; moments that focused on their humanity. Because for the most part, there isn't a lot of humanity shown otherwise. Part of the problem with superhero movies is finding an adequate challenge, and putting the main character in danger. In many popular comic book movies, ""Iron Man"", ""Wolverine"", and ""Thor"", all of these characters are stripped of the powers and they have to figure things out as a somewhat normal individual. In Avengers 2, there is no imminent threat felt, even though it is implied. While it's not a bad movie by any means, the Avengers seem to be overstaying their welcome at the moment. It's up to the Russo brothers (Captain America 2, and currently directing Captain America 3, and then both Avengers sequels) to get things back on track. Russo brothers, assemble."

","Adrenaline is on dope. Started out with the first one, on a high amped note and it simply pervades throughout. Avengers: Age of Ultron literally breathes on Kabooms and Kapows. The action is sheer beauty! So exquisite you have to go back in time to watch minute movements, or.or go watch it again (no need to thank) to relive the eternal divine thrashing.<br/><br/>Catchphrases are snappy and witty just the way Marvel likes it. Editing is superb considering the incessant violent upbeat theme of the movie. Drama bits are framed quite great. Nat and Bruce's chemistry brilliantly shot! Ultron is downright ravishing. Spader's voice gives the character a brilliant gravity. He sways in pizazz with a unique confidence that he bears throughout the flick. There are destructive fight sequences in the movie that would make you jump off your seat. There is music in the rubbles and that is such a big turn on! SPOILERS AHEAD: Sceptre has seen places. Long lost from Loki's palms, we had seen it being captured by S.H.I.E.L.D in the prequel. The movie begins with Avengers fighting to take back the mysterious weapon from the hands of Hydra. As the frames begin, we are subjected to orgasmic takedowns and swift kills as the assembled combatants show a visually breathtaking pleasing sight of non-stop action. It is then when characters like Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver come into picture. Stark's horrifying perception of the world with Avengers' dead bodies piled up in failure, as shown to him by Wanda forces his change of heart, and he proceeds with his Ultron plan that goes kaput. In comes the badass villain as a party pooper with a tasteful yet melting voice that reeks of perversion. The adventure begins thereon and we feast our eyes to a mind numbing plot that Ultron bringeth.<br/><br/>Andy Serkis gives a phenomenal cameo as Klaw. His introduction to the storyline was subtle with clawed imprints on his neck (wink intended). When are we having a Black Panther movie? The Introduction of Vision to the Marvel tale is entrancing too. The way he catches hold of himself to see his reflection and contemplates about beauty is marvelously captured. Bettany imparts Vision a profound charm and makes you love the character almost instantly.<br/><br/>One of the most top-notch badass scenes from the movie is when Hulk goes rogue, and Iron Man has to call Veronica to shut him down. The action sequence that follows is an eye-popping visual feast. Two of the most daring action blows are delivered by Cap and Iron Man when they get their shots on Ultron at two different places. Both make the most of it! It is a delight to watch Cap, a mere mortal, without a suit, go head on with the big badass Ultron. Cap and Thor's teaming up, the Vibranium wonder and Mjolnir's punch, hands down out of the world. We see a lot of Hawkeye this time. The underrated hero breathes the screen with a thoughtful charisma and hatches a surprise for everybody.<br/><br/>With Marvel's roots deep in comics, we are aware that the dark bits aren't supposed to be bluntly manifested. Gore is never properly shown. Nobody in the background of the tale actually dies. With that spirit in mind, Marvel continues to open its doors for all. To show every crucial character in a limited time is a daunting task. That is what happens here as we witness a stuffed up window with every superheroes' face on it. Forget these downsides and the movie is nothing but a constant rhythm of adrenaline war.<br/><br/>You can't miss it for the world. Go today!"
"Psy33","7","1","4","12 May 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron (CAUTION SOME SPOILERS AHEAD)
","What's good: (1) the pace - the movie moves at a fast pace, but not too fast; (2) the characters -there are so many characters that most fans will likely see (at least a cameo of) their favorite Avengers (3) the casting is good; (4) their is diversity in casting; (5) this movie introduces many of the characters who will be Avengers in future films.<br/><br/>What is not so good: (A) The tone: it is too comedic -too much comedy; the overall comedic tone is not appropriate when our superheroes have to do serious things i.e. save the planet; it's OK to have jokes, even a lot of jokes, but the whole movie should not be a joke when our heroes have to put their lives on the line; (B) The story: the story did not make sense entirely; it was a little difficult to follow at times; there was an over- reliance on the MacGuffin theatrical device (our heroes go searching for something with little or no explanation as to why the object being sought is important ); someone needed to go over the script carefully and just make sure that it would make sense to the audience; (C) Serious deviations from source material -i.e. in the comic books the Scarlet Witch has no telepathic ability, no mind control powers, but in this movie she does have these powers; (D) Unnecessary death:- one of the important characters dies. In the comic books which, have been in existence for 60 years this character is still alive (or he lives for several decades after the ""Age of Ultron""). The death seems almost pointless. Due to the comedic tone of the movie, it is almost impossible to feel the emotional impact of this death. What a waste of a good character.<br/><br/>And like I said, the tone of the movie is such that no one will feel sad, or shed a tear, when this character dies."
"homdeb1058","8","1","4","12 May 2015"," Pretty much as Good as The First
","I'm not sure what all the whining is about. It's true the opening CGI scenes were pretty awful (like in almost stop-motion unrealistic), and I was like ""Aw, Man!"", but once past that it shaped up pretty nicely. I've also heard complaints about too much comedy and one liners--which there were quite a few, but frankly I thought they were pretty funny and not over done. The main thing the first Avengers had over this one is that the first was ""surprisingly"" good and the second is good but we've already had the surprisingly. It would have had to have been something really special to out-do the first. Considering what a disaster a lot of sequels are--we should be grateful. My only other complaint was that the CGI fight scenes suffered from Transformerization--where they apparently run the action really fast so they don't have to do a lot of really time consuming, realistic detail. Maybe they could just make them shorter, slower and more clear. Huh? Anyway I recommend it with 8 stars."

","The only thing I can I think of that's funny for the review of the grand opener of the grand sequel of a grand movie series is Chris Evans, which is ironic because he was literally the worst part of this movie (for being painfully un-funny) other than Ultron. This movie, for all intensive purposes, was better than the first. To put it simply, the first movie basically said ""look at all this neat stuff we can do with CGI and all the plot holes, lopsided character development and underdeveloped back story we can fill in with said CGI. The Avengers is always worth seeing, I ""enjoyed"" the first one and the second more so. Thor, our favorite demi-god is the best character. Seeing his face of pure shock when the Cap budged his iconic hammer was priceless. Ultron; bad villain, Vision; pretty neat, Captain Patriotism; meh, Irod Bad; entertaining, Black Widow; good and I wouldn't kick her out of bed for eating crackers, Green Arrow or Hawkeye or Link or whatever; I don't want your pathos or your gosh-forsaken back story, but you did make fun of yourself, Scarlett Witch; I like you, largely unexplored power and background, show her boobs every 196 frames, make a movie on her with Johnny Depp and Helene Carter-John Bonham whatever and directed by Tim Burton! YAY! Quicksilver; disposable because he was too invincible at the start, not very interesting, but I rather have seen Eagle-eye die to develop his character and possible another Marvel movie. Did I miss anyone? I'm almost over my time limit for writing this review. The movie itself, darker, scaled back a bit and less of the heli-carrier. Much needed development via the Scarlett Witch's power, which was pretty neat. Do more of that. What movie goer doesn't love seeing the subconscious of a boring character in a somewhat ""Sharingan"" from Naruto like mental power. Ultron! Love your voice! You sound like Max Headroom (look him up!) but your ideal went from cool to screw his garbage, kill everyone. No more running jokes, better villain (get like Benedict Cumberbatch or someone of use) and better characters. The Beyonder? Please? He's better than Thanos (pronounced Thane-ow-s) and he's got a million dollar smile and style for miles.<br/><br/>The Avengers, Age of Ideals, 6.8/10"

","***** this review contains lots of spoilers read at your own risk***<br/><br/>I've seen avengers twice now and waited awhile to write this so I've really soaked it in. While I did enjoy it,and maybe the hype is to blame but I was a bit disappointed. It's a great movie,just not quite what I was expecting. I will say I enjoyed it much more on the 2nd viewing.<br/><br/>I was really disappointed with killing Quicksilver off and while I don't think he will stay dead,I feel that there were characters that would have had more of an emotional impact,plus I really enjoyed the twins and wanted to see both of them becoming avengers.<br/><br/>Clint being married felt out of a left field.<br/><br/>The Bruce/Natasha thing felt really forced and awkward. If they had some buildup it would have been different but the way it was handled was badly written.<br/><br/>There was next to no Steve/Natasha friendship,I loved how they became friends in TWS and yet we barley see it here.<br/><br/>Some things felt really rushed,Thor going and discovering about the gems,it was blink and you miss it. If you know nothing about the infinity stones I would not blame you if you were totally confused.<br/><br/>I really wish there had been more Rodeny and Falcon.<br/><br/>There were lots of things I enjoyed too.<br/><br/>I loved the setup for Civil War. Scarlet Witch was awesome. When Vision actually lifted Mjölnir. My theater clapped. Really getting to know Clint. The tech guy from TWS who almost got shot was in it,which was a neat little nod.<br/><br/>Vision was awesome,I thought he looked great too. I very much enjoyed him.<br/><br/>James Spader did a great job as Ultron,I loved how he was a bit funny and sarcastic.<br/><br/>I did find Ultron going from confused ""what am I?"" to ""need to destroy the world"" a bit quick. That being said I read that the original cut was over 3 hours so maybe some things got cut between that. Can't wait to see the deleted scenes. I hope there are more stuff with the twins.<br/><br/>My favourite part was the party especially with trying to lift Mjölnir. Gotta give huge props to Chris Hemsworth on his face when Steve moves it a little. He looks so worried and tries to look like he was not worried lol.<br/><br/>It's nowhere as good as the first avengers,guardians of the galaxy or the winter solider but it's a pretty solid film and worth the price to go see it."

Professor 'X' will be back in 2016 as the X-Men fight another battle for survival. <br/><br/>To top it all, we will see the return of Hans Solo, Luke Skywalker in the Star Wars VII- The force awakens, a continuation of the saga created by George Lucas set thirty years after Star Wars: Episode VI - Return of the Jedi (1983). <br/><br/>Ethan Hunt (Tom Cruise) and team take on their most impossible mission yet, eradicating the Syndicate - an International rogue organization as highly skilled as they are, committed to destroying the IMF, as MI-5 returns for one final blast. <br/><br/>If there is action, can our good old Terminator (Arnold Schwarzenegger) be left behind as, After finding himself in a new time-line, Kyle Reese teams up with John Connor's mother Sarah and an aging terminator to try and stop the one thing that the future fears, ""Judgment Day"" so in a new plot wee see the genesis of the Terminator. <br/><br/>If there is Science fiction, there are superhuman abilities, so the fantastic four make an appearance.

After 22 years with fresh faces and better technology with a rejuvenated plot, he returns again with Jurassic World making us look into the belly of the beast once again. <br/><br/>Horror movies have always literally been a hair-raising experience, so return the Conjuring -2 and insidious chapter 3 to make us go sleepless into the night. <br/><br/>So are we all set for a entertaining and captivating 8 months. <br/><br/>By Aditya"
"imightbesomeone","6","1","4","5 May 2015"," In a word, Underwhelming (HEAVY SPOILERS AHEAD)
","So here we are. This is what all the build up was about, another build up. And that's exactly what this is, another build up to the infinity wars and/or civil war which are going to be ""the best movies eva"". I am only going to focus on the negatives because most people are shouting the few positives this movie has from rooftops already. 1)another absolutely wasted villain. I could reference everything back to ""well,in the comic book......"", but that would be much too tedious and unfair. So i'll reference the trailer which got me very excited. A marvel movie with an actually threatening villain who doesn't just spout one liners? Blasphemy. Alas,10 minutes into his ""creation"", you have a stand up comic on your hand. Funnily enough most people seem to enjoy that. I cant judge them for it but for me its yet another villain of the week with no substance.<br/><br/>2)vision - completely wasted and obviously used just to set up the next movie<br/><br/>3)the love story out of nowhere. And it seemed so forced and rushed. Its almost like this wasn't part of the original script but was added on later for the drama. It also gave hulk a sad mini goodbye so he'll be conveniently absent from the next movie.yayyyy subpoint - i actually liked hawkeye's story line and the fact that we were baited into thinking that he'll die but didn't. That was actually well executed.<br/><br/>4)inconsistencies and plot conveniences. Look, i understand that its an comic book action movie. So i'll not nit pick every time ""someone should have died because of that"" or ""how did he/she survive that"". But seriously? scarlet witch literally reads all of the avenger's minds and cant figure out once what their motives were, cant read ultron's mind because he's obviously not alive but can read vision's mind and knows instantly that he's being made for world destruction. How? why? How does stark convince banner TWICE(in under a minute) to do something so stupid without telling anyone? Those two are geniuses,right? And then the worst part, the CONFLICT or the complete lack of between cap and stark, which is built up in less than one minute while vision was being made, obviously to set up....sigh....the next movie. And the hydra base? They actually left it completely unguarded?Even after stark had seen what was inside?Because......its time for a party...and jokes.<br/><br/>5)The ""bad guys were hurt but not killed"".Because we only kill cosplay robots and disposable alien armies that aren't actually alive. Yipppeeee I actually blame Disney for this. When banner asks thor about the damage he caused and thor changes his answer to *paraphrasing*- injured but not killed, who is assumed to be an idiot,us or banner? Can we please grow up that in a film of this magnitude people are going to die, both bad and good. Maybe purposefully or as collateral damage. <br/><br/>IN the end, this movie just treats its audience like kids and maybe that was the purpose all along. Not for me,though."
"caseynicholson","6","1","4","6 May 2015"," Earth's Mightiest Heroes Struggle to Save This Script
","Before I saw ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"", I had read somewhere that Joss Whedon's first cut of the film was over three hours long, and that it had been pared down to the 2:21 release that is in theaters now. It shows. <br/><br/>This is a movie that sacrifices good story telling for action, and comes very close to being an epic fail for the Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. My main beef with the film is that the plot is poorly scripted. At its core, movie making is storytelling. A good story can be ruined if it isn't told properly, and that's what happened with ""Age of Ultron"". The plot of the movie is just fine--indeed, it's a creative way to introduce some new characters and lead up to the battle with Ultron, the film's main antagonist.<br/><br/>But the problem is that the entire first half of the film is severely underdeveloped in terms of how the plot is conveyed. The audience is made to leap right into the plot with very little in the way of development of new characters, or even of Ultron himself. Would this film have called for a full on ""2001"" HAL-esque treatment of the character so that his evil intent is only revealed halfway through the film? No. But in ""Age of Ultron"", we go from the character being conceived, to being brought online, to being the embodiment of evil all in a brief five minutes of the film. (Not to mention that the cinematography there conjured up images of the most egregious of terrible scenes from the LOTR/Hobbit movies).<br/><br/>Another beef I had with the film was the treatment of the Scarlet Witch, a.k.a. Wanda Maximoff. Wanda's telekinetic ability to produce delusions in her opponents plays a very large role in the early half of the film. Two things about that: my memory of Scarlet Witch from my time reading Avengers as a youth would suggest that this was never a prominent part of her arsenal of powers, so it was strange to see that ability given such a large amount of attention in the film. Second, the way that it was done was just odd in terms of cinematography. The warped delusions of human characters mixed with the oddball scene of Ultron coming online made the first half of the film very hard to watch for me.<br/><br/>That said, the movie did improve as the two-plus hours went along--which was a good thing. Some movies make you bite your nails because you're wondering what will happen next. This movie made me bite my nails because I was hoping it would get better and not be a complete and utter failure.<br/><br/>And it did. The second half of the film is notably better than the first, which would suggest that most of the editorial changes that Whedon made may have come from the first half of the movie. Some commentators are arguing that he was indeed forced to trim the large chunk of time out of the movie. If that's the case then it's a pity, as twenty more minutes of back story would have made this movie much more enjoyable, and forty minutes could have filled in the gaps enough that it would have been on par with the rest of the MCU films. <br/><br/>Whatever the case, the film finishes stronger than it begins. But it still suffers overall. To once again make the comparison to storytelling, a story that ends well and with great excitement but forgets to share much at all about its main characters on the front end will inevitably cause the audience not to be emotionally invested in the story overall. <br/><br/>Perhaps Marvel thought that with so many of its characters having already been introduced at this point that they could get a free pass on the background information on the front end of the film--and if that was the rationale, then they would be right on that point. Captain America, Thor, the Hulk, these characters didn't need any further explanation of who they are. But Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, Ultron, etc. did. And the plot at large did, as well, rather than just throwing the audience into a mess of a film that even Earth's Mightiest Heroes struggle to save.<br/><br/>Oh--and now that I think about it, the whole gist of the Vision's character was poorly communicated as well. Just bad storytelling all the way around on this one, even if the story itself was good.<br/><br/>A last note--I'm not someone to get upset over profanity, but Marvel has taken a strange approach as its film franchise has continued to grow. This film, like so many like it from the latter half of the MCU, tries to make itself both kid friendly and humorous, and yet also pepper in a dozen or so cuss words throughout the film. That just makes for a strange movie-going experience all the way around. I get that Marvel's main target audience is teens and adults, but they're also very clearly marketing their films to children. The language thing is a real issue now, for all the MCU films, and if I had young children I'm not sure I would feel at all good about letting them see them. And the fact that this issue is lampooned in ""Age of Ultron"" makes the problem all the more real.<br/><br/>All that said....this movie was better than ""Iron Man 3"". And better than DC's ""Man of Steel"". Probably not as good as ""Green Lantern"", though (a brilliant comic book movie that was largely rejected by the general population). I'm giving it 6/10 stars simply because the ending of the film caused it to not fall flat on its face, but this movie certainly represents a devolution for MCU properties--which is truly sad considering that this was Marvel's flagship franchise around which everything else is supposed to be built."
"nathanjonesrs","6","1","4","4 May 2015"," A Visual feast-nothing more
","All those here who are bothering to examine every detail of this film are really wasting their time. It's perfectly clear by now that these Super-hero films are just a visual feast which provide entertainment for a couple of hours and then are soon forgotten. The cinematic equivalent of junk-food. The CGI in this film is breath-taking, the fight scenes go on endlessly and it all sweeps along at a (mostly) frantic pace. That's all there is to it. The plot has so many holes that several sky-carriers could fit through, the actors know they are NOT performing Shakespeare, and the producers are too busy counting the money that's coming in to bother anyway. And there you go. Those who love this kind of thing will probably be happy-those that hate it will hate this too. To properly enjoy it you must dis-engage your brain and let it wash over you. And that's exactly what it does.<br/><br/>Just as a comparison-in the 1950s audiences flocked to see pulp sci-fi flicks, such as ""Them!""(about giant spiders), ""The Blob"" (about a giant blob!) and many others. They were a distraction, to take people's minds off the serious things that were happening in the world. And they were meant to be viewed on that level. There were, admittedly, a few gems along the way, such as, ""The day the earth stood still"", ""War of the worlds"", ""Forbidden Planet"" and ""invasion of the body-snatchers"". These films had a fair amount of intelligence to them-but they were more the exception really. It was just about entertainment. Today's equivalent are these Superhero films. Anyone watching them knows exactly what to expect, or should do by now considering there have been 3 Iron Man films, 2 Thor and 2 Captain America films. This film is hardly going to deviate from those by being an intimate study in human relationships! No -it's big, loud and meant to be viewed in good weather! So enjoy it for what it is, just don't expect anything more. For those that do then this film is really not for you and you should go and watch something else."

"landingwiz","8","1","4","23 April 2015"," Phew! Not as Bad as The Avengers...
","I saw it on the opening day, and may I say that just for the Vision (Paul Bettany) alone, I might even decide to watch Age of Ultron a second time :)<br/><br/>Now here's the thing:<br/><br/>I'm so glad Whedon chose to give this movie a much ""darker"" tone compared to the first movie, which to me was full of roll-eye moments and basically, a joke of a movie.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron, on the other hand, actually has some heart and soul to connect with the audience on a deeper level. Why do I say this? The answer is simple.<br/><br/>In the first movie, all the good guys were pretty much overpowered and so you didn't feel the ""need"" to root for them. What's worse, the movie was so full of ""Look at me, I'm so f***king cool!!!"" moments, that the effect it had turned out quite the opposite - A big Yawn.<br/><br/>However, in Age of Ultron, the superheroes were made to suffer greater physically and psychologically (for example, due to Scarlet's haunting mind games). They were portrayed to be a lot more vulnerable, hence the ""darker"" tone of the movie. But that's also why I could, and perhaps you will, get more emotionally involved with the characters, which is why I enjoyed this movie much more than the first.<br/><br/>It's not even close.<br/><br/>The action? It's mind-blowingly awesome. Seriously. In fact, it would probably take multiple viewings just to fully appreciate some of those sequences and moments (like when Thor hammer-struck the city into dust). It was OMG... so good.<br/><br/>If there are any flaws to Age of Ultron, I would say it's mostly in the subpar dialogue and over-use of cheesy one-liners. But I guess that was to expected.<br/><br/>Overall, I highly recommend watching this movie because unlike the first, this actually has heart. Plus CRAZY good action aside, you might even decide to watch this movie again like I'm going to if you can't get enough of certain characters.<br/><br/>Heck, the Vision was, by far, the best part of the movie."

","This is a great movie in my opinion. I looked at reviews last night after watching this movie, and I was surprised to see how many people were posting negative reviews of this movie. While this movie may have similarities to the first movie that some are complaining about there is also a lot that changed also. The saying that goes something like ""If it isn't broken, don't fix it"" can apply to some parts of this movie which is a good thing. To the people are saying that its the same ol' type of action movie and are disappointed, I think you are looking too deep into and expect too much. Not every sequel has to be completely different then the first movie of any series. I feel that people are also giving it bad reviews because they are the close minded type who always think the first of any series is the best and no sequel is better. I think people should be open minded when they see this to truly see how good it is. In fact I am going to most likely watch it a second time in theaters!"

That's not entirely accurate, but for the most part that's what it is. Now it's not bad for a movie to have an unoriginal plot, and in this case it was alright. Some of the ideas surrounding the new-found technology were interesting. Unfortunately the movie was so focused on action that it forgot to develop the plot further then it's base idea, which was a little disappointing. <br/><br/>The characters are, once again, nothing special. Their personalities revolve almost solely on their sense of humor, which for everyone is pretty much the exact same. So all the jokes are at least in character (for the most part) but they rarely go deeper than that. <br/><br/>Something that really bothered me was Quiksilver and Scarlet Witch. There were two things about them: 1: Neither of their names are ever said. The only reason why I knew who Quiksilver was was because he ran quickly, and the 'Quik' part of his nickname is obviously referring to the word 'quick'. Scarlet Witch, however, was never mentioned by name. At least not to my memory. They were never really introduced, just thrown in. 2: Like I just said, they were just thrown in. Whatever their role was with the baddies was never very well developed, and they just came and went as they pleased. They never felt like real characters and more just as existences that you knew were there but didn't really even want to be. They were just a waste of space, and the movie would have been almost identical without them. <br/><br/>The action is more entertaining than it was in the first movie, which is good, considering that's all that these movies revolve around anyways. It's certainly far from the best action I've ever seen, but it made it a least a little better. <br/><br/>Overall Avengers: Age of Ultron is just okay. Some forced or weak characters, along with a cool but poorly developed plot and decent action make it at least entertaining. Unfortunately, it's far from great, or even good. If you've already lost hope in Marvel then don't bother with this one, it (probably) won't restore your faith in them. In the end I wouldn't recommend this movie unless you were a die- hard, easily impressed Marvel fanboy (or fangirl)."

","Everything about Avengers: Age of Ultron feels indulgent. Watching the film is like plugging through a TV box set in a single sitting. That's meant as a compliment, and if it sounds like a criticism, you're probably yet to experience the supreme contentedness that comes with bingen on five Game of Thrones episodes back-to-back. <br/><br/>Joss Whedon's film gives you that same pop-culture sugar rush, stacking characters, conflicts, subplots and background treats like tiers of wedding cake – far more than you'd think you could possibly cram into a little under two and a half hours without the whole thing crumbling under the weight of its own calorie count. But the structure holds, and the film flies past at speed. Among its other attributes, it's the first long blockbuster in years to feel short. <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron rounds off the second two-year phase of Marvel Studios' ongoing superhero serial, just as the fun but messier Avengers Assemble, also directed by Whedon, did the same thing for phase one in 2012. <br/><br/>It literally hits the ground running, with a three-minute, digitally crocheted tracking shot of the whole gang – Iron Man/Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Captain America (Chris Evans), The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) – hurtling through a frozen forest. Their destination is a Colditz-like castle where the terrorist group Hydra have in their clutches a crystal of (literally) Earth-shattering importance."

","On the 29th of April 2015, my brother and I went to see this highly anticipated movie. I would give it an 8.2-8.5 out of 10. Those who say that this movie didn't live up to the hype are idiots. It is witty with its one liners, it is jaw-dropping with its visuals and action sequences and is awesome because we get to see new Avengers (Vision, Scarlet Witch, Quicksilver etc.), Hulk vs. Hulkbuster, a villain who is just as good as Loki and a team fighting together with no boring bits or overrated scenes, like in the first Avengers movie. Those who disagree with me are spoiled fan boy haters who cannot see greatness in front of them. It is tied with the first Avengers movie as my favorite MCU movie and tied as my favorite movie of 2015 with Mad Max: Fury Road. I disagree with IMDb and believe that this movie is at least 8.2/10. Those fan boy haters are tied in their own strings of hate and impossible anticipations. There are no strings on me."

","The movie was pretty much like the first one, except that in this one they didn't destroy all of New York City and that is a plus for the second one. But being honest almost everything but the last final slow-mo fight scene was pretty bad, but let's face it that last fight almost make the movie worth watching it and it's in slow-mo which makes it even better. The worst thing this movie has, and the first one had it two, is that the Hulk could control itself and decide who he wanted to kill or beat. Just like I said before this movie doesn't destroy New York completed which is a good thing but destroy all of a city which name I can't remember. The two new characters the add to the cast aren't so bad, Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are also something noteworthy and the death of Quicksilver is very heroic so that's pretty cool two. The movie is a little long and not a good one but it's watchable."

","After reading so many negative reviews and actually watching the movie in theaters the second week it came out, I cant say I don't agree with them.. but I cant also say they're completely right. While this movie disappoints on some aspects, (like it having a different vibe than the movie we expected from watching the trailer) there are some redeemable stuff from AoU.<br/><br/>The good: Id have to say the action. The action was pretty good, we got more from hulk, Ultron has his moments, I'll get more into that in a bit, Iron Man gets a new suit and the Hulkbuster scene was probably the greatest battle in the movie. Also it was great to see how Quicksilver and Wanda's powers played out, Paul Bettany's the Vision was great and the original cast was great this time around.<br/><br/>The Bad: Like I said the trailer showed us the different vibe than what we saw in the trailer. Ultron wasn't as menacing (the only thing that saved him was having being voiced by James Spader) but he kind of took tension off of the movie thanks to also having a sarcastic humor. The heroes also took tension off from the final battle. When you face the villain's plan in wiping out all of humanity taking place you don't just start cracking jokes .. you just don't. Like how would X-men's DoFP played out if the final battle with the sentinels killing off our heroes one by one consisted of the surviving mutants cracking jokes. you get the idea. Moving on.. the plot feels a little overstuffed with characters adding Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and The Vision into the mix. On that note, Quicksilver was very underused (and you will find out why, since I decided to keep this review spoiler free).<br/><br/>All in all, despite the flaws, go watch it. Still a worthy sequel panning out the road for Civil War next summer."

However, I wasn't that much invested in the two others,especially quicksilver who I think was more of weak point in the movie,in addition to some little plot holes like the first appearance of nick fury and the way the avengers have defeated ultron ... overall, I think that this movie is the perfect continuation of the MCU, and an amazing mixture of fun,humour with some solid action and great characters development.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","Marvel has made many great movies since 2008, and is continuing to make them for the foreseeable future. Marvel's past movies are The Hulk, Iron Man, The Incredible Hulk, Iron Man 2, Thor, Captain America the First Avenger, The Avengers is the highest grossing comic book adapted movie ever, Iron Man 3, Thor The Dark World, Captain America The Winter Soldier, Guardians of the Galaxy, then the latest Avengers Age of Ultron. Avengers Age of Ultron has an all-star cast, Robert Downey JR. (Sherlock Holmes), Chris Evans, Scarlett Johannsson (Lucy), Mark Ruffalo (Now You See Me), Chris Hemsworth (Rush), Jeremy Renner (Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol, Rouge Nation, Bourne Legacy), Samuel L. Jackson, and James Spader (The Backlist) as the voice of Ultron. James Spader in my opinion has one of the best voices in the world. The length is over 2 hours, and consists of many action scenes. The opening scene is The Avengers taking down the last Hydra base after the events of Captain America the Winter Soldier. The camera angles are used magnificently to show all of the Avengers taking down the Hydra forces, then there is a shot of all the Avengers lined up as they jump across a ditch. Also as usual there is an after credit scene to leave spoilers for the future movies. This scene is of Thanos putting on the Infinity gauntlet with empty Infinity stone spots and he says ""FINE I'LL DO IT MYSELF"". He said that because all of the other people he hired to retrieve the Infinity stones have failed, such as Ronan from Guardians of the Galaxy, The leader of the Tutari Army from the Avengers and Malekieth the dark elf from Thor the Dark World."

","Avengers: Age of Ultron was not a bad movie overall but there were disadvantages and advantages that I either liked about the movie or just did not like. Before reading more there are spoilers, so be cautious... The advantages that I enjoyed about this movie is that it defiantly started off good to me, it had good action and everything came together well. I rather much enjoyed watching scarlet witch and quicksilver. I also LOVED the fight between Hulk and iron man in the hulk hater suit, while watching it I did not want it to end... Adding the vision character in the MCU was interesting and cool to see, and I think the ending was awesome, but I really wanted it to be a lot longer because I enjoyed it so much. These are basically the parts in the movie that I liked. Some negatives things I hated about the movie was they did not explain how iron man got back into the avengers or even get all his suits back after iron man 3, there was a huge part in the movie that was extremely slow and boring and some of it was just dragged out. I feel like Ultron wasn't really that strong or did not really do much in the movie, they killed him so easily he didn't really fight or do much of anything other than looking cool. Last thing I did not like about this movie is they ended the fight between hulk and iron man in the hulk buster suit to fast, it just like ended by iron man knocking out the hulk, they could have easily put on at least 5 more minutes, but these are my likes and dislike for Avengers: Age of Ultron."

Avengers: Age of Ultron does not disappoint for that matter, lol i saw earlier some review that said this movie was bland........you're kidding me right?! Action packed right out of the gate, and keeping it fresh with the new villain Ultron, and other new characters. The thing that I personally like about AoU over Avengers 1 is it didn't feel slow like the first 2/3rds of the first film, now talking about the epic ending battles... I think the final battle of New York was just a tad better, just a tad, because lets face it when Bruce went hulk and put his stop sign of a fist to the giant chitauri carrier, everybody in the world was like...this is a dream come true! And Age of Ultron gives me that feeling, but I don't know thats how hard it is to decide, but mark my words the battle against Ultron is not going to disappoint what so ever!! As for my final point: the acting! Robert Downey Jr. Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo, Jeremy Renner, Chris Hemsworth all get their equal share in this movie and all are as great as usual! Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are very good as the siblings of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, and the fans i think will really enjoy Paul Bettany as the Vision...but the stand out of this film is James Spader as Ultron, sinister yet the humor is there for a great combination to an awesome and next to Tom Hiddleston maybe the best Marvel villain on film ever! Overall I give Avengers: Age of Ultron a 9/10 as a spectacular sequel i cannot wait for blu-ray, and cannot wait to see whats in store for the Infinity wars, hope this helps people!"
"Prismark10","5","1","5","25 June 2015"," Avengers return
","The first Avengers film was a fun popcorn film, it helped that it had a fiendishly fun villain in Loki.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron begins in the middle of an action sequence with all the Avengers assembled and it is the first of several prolonged action scenes in the film. It reminded me of Man of Steel, a lot of wanton destruction in one film which just becomes dull after a while.<br/><br/>The plot, Tony Stark uses Loki's sceptre to kick-start an artificial intelligence peacekeeping programme that he has tried to develop for some time. Even though Bruce Banner warns him several times not to mess around with the power of the sceptre, Banner then goes on to help Stark. The end result is the formation of Ultron who decides that it is the human race that needs to be destroyed and kick-start a new earth that would be peaceful.<br/><br/>So in between the wisecracks including an ill judged Latin gag it is Iron Man's recklessness that causes the chaos. Captain America is still an overgrown boy scout, there is a bolt out of the blue growing love affair between the Black Widow and Bruce Banner which comes across as unconvincing as the scenes where they tried to hide Scarlett Johansson's bump as she was pregnant in real life at the time of the shooting, hence why she is the bar woman for the night in that party scene.<br/><br/>It is Hawkeye who is more fleshed out in this film and delivers a more human dimension to the plot.<br/><br/>Of course along with the main plot we have a whole host of subplots thrown into the mix including more superheroes and villains. So we have the Falcon dropping by, Quicksilver, the Scarlet Witch and the formation of a new Avengers team by the end of it.<br/><br/>The film tries to do too much and looks like a film made by committee and lacks the personal vision which elevated Captain America: The Winter Soldier last year."

","AVENGERS: THE AGE OF ULTRON is plenty mediocre all by itself. But, seeing it within a couple of days of MAD MAX: FURY ROAD made it look even more like a dull retread.<br/><br/>Right from the first scene, the ""exciting battle"" is full of the kind of cartoonish CGI that is such an anathema to those with any sense of realism or proportion (which George Miller destroys with his real world stunts). And, really, what the @#$# is it with the Avengers spinning and twirling when they fight villains? Does doing a somersault in mid-air really confuse their enemies? And, why do Black Widow and Hawkeye have the seeming ability of flight even though they are supposed to be the 'down to earth' Avengers without magical powers? I know, I know. You're not supposed to ask such mundane questions and just ""check your brain at the box office and enjoy it"". But, after all these superhero flicks, not to mention the enormous resources devoted to them, isn't it about time that Marvel ups their game, and not resort to their characters just strutting, posing and tossing out quips? If Joss Whedon never makes a genre movie again, it wouldn't be a great loss.<br/><br/>As to the ""plot"", it's pretty standard issue stuff, which boils down to the Avengers having to set aside their issues and join together to save humanity - again. For a little while, it looks like ULTRON will spend a few precious moments to develop a COLOSSUS: THE FORBIN PROJECT-like theme of creating opposing World Defense superstructures. But, it's tossed aside way too quickly in order to have more posing, strutting and uttering of ""witty"" banter. And, did we really need to see the Avengers all assemble into a circle as they battle the baddies one more time? It looks like a superhero circle jerk.<br/><br/>To give it some credit, a few moments are given over to showing a more normal human side with the Hawkeye homestead sequence, but, it just makes the contrast all the more jarring between something resembling the real world versus the utterly phony CGI landscapes of the bulk of the movie. Elizabeth Olson's Scarlet Witch isn't a bad addition, but, Spader's Ultron just looks like a slightly more organic Iron Man.<br/><br/>The ""Marvel Universe"" has devolved into the most expensive TV series ever created. And, the Avengers flicks are like the big Season Ending crossover episodes where they all come together before splintering off into next season's sequels, reboots and origin episodes. And, then, inevitably, there will be AVENGERS III: Even More Strutting, Posing and Quipping."

","* WARNING MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS!* Avengers: Age of Ultron is a decent movie, which provided me with a fairly entertaining movie to kill two and a half hours with, but it was a bit disappointing when compared with the original. One problem I (and a lot of people apparently) had was that there were too many characters and plot lines to keep up with. Thor is hardly in the movie at times (seriously, did anyone see him in the finale?). I also thought the finale dragged, because it was just watching the Avengers smash robots who couldn't even give them any opposition. Most will disagree, but the light-hearted tone of the MCU is wearing very thin, and can really spoil the tension. The positives are that its really fun, has good characters, and a it is funny at times. I think the most well-written scenes are those between Black Widow and Hulk, though their romance feels a little out of the blue. If you like the light-hearted tone, you'll probably like this more, but if you don't, I can't see you liking this movie."

I liked the new characters a lot. I'm very interested in what Scarlet Witch and The Vision can do in the next movie. I liked the character they created for Ultron, but he never really did anything interesting or memorable. Some aspects of the movie that should have been more clear were things that you had to put together for yourself, which shouldn't be a bad thing, but in this kind of movie, it is. Ultron's motivation, for example, is the main aspect driving the plot, and you really have to work it out of the subtext. For a superhero movie aimed at a wide audience, I don't think that was effective. Loki's true purpose only gets a passing mention in the first Avengers, but it was also backed up by the first Thor movie. Everything in that movie seemed to work; Ultron had me thinking, ""Well, I guess I can see that, if you look at it that way..."" So while it was miles above the average action adventure film, high expectations clouded my judgment."

Probably only Superman 1 and 2 compare to the Marvel films for mind bending fun. <br/><br/>The various Marvel sub-genres, Thor, Ironman, Captain America, are all expertly produced and mounted entertainment, solid and well crafted. <br/><br/>But Ultron is, well, different. Watched it last night and after the 1st viewing in Imax 3D - essential - I was struck by the length of the film and the mindless fighting scenes. The lovely Safe House sequence dead center is a rest from the chaos surrounding the fights with Ultron and just about everybody else. <br/><br/>Film editing is an art, not a science, but I could have cut perhaps 20 minutes out easily by trimming down the endless battle sequences. After a while, SOMEBODY has to get hurt and the Avengers get hurt soooooo rarely. Natasha is human through and through - never a scratch. Tony Stark out of armor is just a human too. Never really hurt. And yet the chaos begs incredulity. Cutting it back would make it more believable.<br/><br/>And yes, it is still a boatload of fun."

","Its obvious to compare between the first installment and the second. I found this movie visually confusing while the plot was plain and boring without much twist which you expect when Loki is there. The villain here is the AI Ultron whose algorithm is set at destroying the earth for instilling peace. That is confusing in itself. We have seen such movies where a robot or AI has gone bad a zillion times. The problem is the predictability of the story. <br/><br/>While it was nice to have a complicated little love story between The Hulk and Black Widow and an unexpected discovery of family of one of the Avengers. It seemed as if this movie was just a bridge between the upcoming movies. The fight sequences reminded me of I, Robot. So many things could have been possible with such powerful AI getting into the world wide web... He could have played God, he could have commanded the earth population. Instead he wants to delete earth from the face of the solar system. <br/><br/>The Avengers seemed like a bunch of high school students...party freaks, unsure, broken hearted and angry. There were too many things packed in each shot and it was difficult to focus on the characters.. like when two characters are talking there are 2-3 non participating lead actors strolling around or conversing amongst themselves or something non important is happening in the background. The background score is also changed. The new one is unimpressive. They should have stuck with the original score to maintain continuity. <br/><br/>All in all its a one time watch"

Does anyone remember these characters with fondness like I do from all the ink spent on their story lines? Come on, doesn't anything count anymore? Avengers is more about the coming together of the characters, not the total agreement of all of them with each other. Hawkeye has always had the task of holding it together along with Cap who must stand back and let others show their power. Thor takes the lead in this thing, but the Hulk is not to be outdone.<br/><br/>Altogether, ""Peace in our time"" is the sci-fi theme (moral) for anyone concerned with world domination by those who would say all they want is peace. Cap had something to say about peace before war and I happen to agree with that.

He makes us admire and hate Ultron. He's after fighting for what humans want: a perfect life, and if this requires the destruction of those flawed humans, well, let it be.<br/><br/>I have seen a few negative comments here, and that might be because once again, we have been given food for thought, and that's a bit of task for those who just want to see mindless fun (another 2015 blockbuster) come to mind.

Now this is certainly just one man's opinion, but I felt Whedon proved his ability once again to handle nearly a dozen superheroes on the screen together with ease. The fight sequences were thrilling and they showed us more of the Avengers working together despite their differences in methods and ideals. I laughed much more than I had anticipated (""Iron Man: Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep"") and the moments of calm provided not only comic relief but some elements of well executed and genuine emotion. In fact, Hawkeye steals the show in multiple scenes, which was satisfying to watch after he was under-used in the first film. Of course, Age of Ultron is by no means flawless but so rarely does a movie come this close to perfection. I was slightly underwhelmed by the main villain Ultron who, while charismatic, never came across as being especially menacing. But this can be overlooked as all the heroes bring their collectively impressive acting talent and charm to every single scene. Even the brief mid-credits scene left me in awe because it reveals what is in store for the next two Avengers movies and what is in store for the future looks very exciting."

Although I do like talking about comic books, I haven't seen many Marvel features (2, guardians and 1st avengers) before, and both of them did not entice me as much. <br/><br/>This film however was better than I thought it was going to be, I had heard people saying that it's going to be OK, so I just assumed that I was going to go be entertained for few scenes. I was wrong. I was entertained all the way. As with Avengers the action scenes in a large group flows together so well, and even with a larger cast in Avengers 2, the massive cast creates more harmony rather than chaos. There were some times, like hulk buster vs hulk, where the action was too close for my taste but it still worked for what it was trying to achieve.<br/><br/>Avenger 2 not only excels in the action scene, but does well in both the comedic and dramatic moment. While some action movies have dramatic scenes that are too boring or overly cliché, Avengers 2 has a nice dramatic scenes that does not go for the overly serious tone, but uses it to further it's character development as well as team development. Also the comedy works well, there are lot of comic reliefs between big action scenes but also during action scenes as well. The nice moment provides a break for the audience as well as provide few chuckles along the way.<br/><br/>The problem that I had with this movie is mostly on advertising, Beats by Dre, Gillette, Samsung, even though I know that most movie does that, the blatant use of advertising just took me out of the movie. That's just my pet peeve, but another problem that it had was that often it felt like it was a repetition of Avengers. While the middle part in the story has more background and character development that were not primarily featured on Avengers, the battle of wits and the last battle felt like they sort of overused the plot again. Those are my only problems though. The movie is a great entertainment for everybody, it's something that you should see it on the big screen, definitely worth the ticket price."

","""Everyone creates the thing they dread"", claims Ultron as he corroborates his emergence as a formidable adversary to the Avengers. A by-product of the Iron Legion from Iron Man 3, Ultron is an unhinged opponent initially created by Tony Stark to maintain accord. A physical manifestation of the detriment the team can cause, the AI goes awry and vows to ensure mankind's doom.<br/><br/>A sequel to the blockbuster behemoth The Avengers, the monolithic feature is massive in scope and epic in scale, an immersive experience best served in IMAX. Writer-director Joss Whedon is assigned the unenviable task of essentially culminating another phase of movies. The unlikely champion of the original, he is able to repeat the trick.<br/><br/>He excels at dabbling with a huge ensemble and crafting an intriguing premise, which merges multiple narratives into a singular, uniform anecdote. While the progression for each character is logical, new introductions are carried out seamlessly as well.<br/><br/>The usual suspects return in fine form and the new additions further supplement proceedings. Equilibrium is struck between all characters, each given their moment to shine. The female contingent is typified by Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) in another authentic depiction and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), one half of a destructive duo with deviant abilities. Other pieces of the jigsaw include Vision (Paul Bettany), an android with fascinating strength. Furthermore, the titular foe is memorable and mesmerizing. Biblical in speech and imposing in ideas, Ultron is inherently unstable and views human beings as a plague worth decimating. Television veteran James Spader is an inspired choice to voice the sentient robot. The only qualm in his portrayal is that there isn't enough of Ultron on screen. <br/><br/>Although it consists of the requisite fireworks, the personal and intimate character moments render it more profound than generic action fare. While set pieces fade from memory, characters always endure. The chemistry between a charismatic cast and tender moments shared by their characters are what render the movie its soul. At its nucleus, it contains several intertwined smaller stories which are heartfelt and sincere.<br/><br/>The subject matter is also sporadically divergent in nature. New players upset the status quo and expose the soft core of the team. The group is forced to contend with friction and conflicts among themselves.<br/><br/>In terms of production value, cinematography is supremely executed: the visual aesthetic is excellent. A couple of one-shot sequences of the heroes in motion are supremely exquisite. Action is always in abundance, with an epic confrontation between Hulk and Iron Man's Hulkbuster armor the highlight.<br/><br/>A prevailing modus operandi for Marvel, the plot is laden with references to past and present events. While certain nods tie in to previous films, others tease forthcoming developments. As opposed to being shoehorned, the seeds are sown with finesse. The follow-up also contains several unforeseen surprises in store for viewers. An explosion of color and celebration of comic books, the film features an onslaught of mayhem at a whirlwind pace. Age of Ultron merges several genres such as action, drama, comedy and romance, which is likely to appease enthusiasts and pedestrian movie goers alike."

","It wasn't as great as the first Avengers but a few highlights of the film covered up for the damages. The movie also featured some new Avengers. And I mean 'New Avengers,' which was certainly unexpected. One of the highlights was a new 'entity' who was worthy enough to pick the Almighty Thor's hammer, Mjolnir. I, for once, certainly did not expect that. The performance of all the artists was spot on. RDJ, Chris Hemsworth, ScarJo, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, everybody! I love the after credits scene. Ooh! You guys should totally watch it. It means there's going to be a sequel to 'Guardians of the Galaxy.' Aren't you excited? I totally am."

","Summer is upon us and you know what that means..Holy Grail Avengers...the most anticipated movie of the year has arrived and I am drinkin'it..this movie is awesome, it's a rock concert comic book slam back through from start to finish.Fun is the keyword here because this movie has not left any comic book pages left and come up in the big screen..right from the opening action sequence through everything.<br/><br/>It has dark moments like they showed in the trailers, it gets even darker then the first avengers but it kept that same sense of humour..the jokes work so well that you go from jokes to action back to jokes, it's like the new character ""Quicksilver""..as fast he is zipping around that's what this movie does a good joke then a great action sequence.<br/><br/>The relation between the avengers is taken to a next level, their chemistry is great and there is so much character development especially of ""Hawkeye"" and ""Black Widow"". Captain America was as cool as he has been..new comers Quicksiler and Scarlet Witch were pretty good too.<br/><br/>The avengers face the new baddie - ""Ultron"" voiced by James Sapder.. who is hands down one of the most awesome villain ever...""Period"". He is menacing, dangerous,Master of manipulator, charming and funny but in a very sadistic way, he just deliver's monologues after monologues and that makes him more and more convincingly evil. I Loved Ultron as the villain.<br/><br/>Then you get to see ""The Vision"" who is Jarvis who really added a lot to this film..He gets one of the infinity stones(Mind Stone)..and gets the ultimate power. His character shows so much equality of the human existence and choosing sides.<br/><br/>There were bits in the film that bummed me out where i was like why that scene has to be in the film.<br/><br/>And the End Credit scene is amazing..where ""Thanos"" comes in and says I'll do it myself..and grabs the Infinity Gauntlet glove..woah..now we will see him in Avengers:Infinity War part 1 in (2018) & part 2 in (2019). Joss Whedon does a great job in making this movie.<br/><br/>Finally Avengers:Age Of Ultron is........ - ""AWESOMETACULAR""..!!"
"sharduliyer","7","1","5","27 April 2015"," A must watch, at least once.
","Despite many number of trailers, rumors etc, this movie offers much more than what was its trailers. From minute one the movie engages you. Action lovers won't be disappointed even a little bit and the movie stays thick in its action as well as dialogues. <br/><br/>The characters portrayed are great, especially Robert Downey Jr., but the best scenes of the movie belong to Hulk. Scenes between Captian America, Ironman and Thor are great with perfectly timed dialogues, while teamwork between Thor and Captian America works well.<br/><br/>Hawkeye and Black Widow do their job well, with Hawkeye surprising you a little bit. Introduction of new characters will make you excited at first, but then you'll feel they lack true purpose of what they have to do with two of them shown like kids, and one coming at the end.<br/><br/>Ultron is good as villain, but he brings nothing new to the plot.<br/><br/>The plot will sound similar, but the graphics and portrayal of it is much better. Tech geeks will love it for sure, even those who don't favor too much computing will also like it. The first half drags a little, while the second half has many surprises.<br/><br/>Addition of romance in between might be rather awkward in this action flick, but towards the end you will be surprised for sure. Talking about the end, you will have mixed emotions and will definitely debate on whether you liked the first part or not.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Funny scenes are really funny, action scenes are really the best, but at the end some of you may feel this might just be a one time watch. But do watch it at least once, not for the story but for the action."
"guruprasad1997","7","1","5","26 April 2015"," Definitely a treat for a Superhero fan but for other people, it depends upon their Self Acceptance
","Marvel had set the foot in reuniting their comic hit lists in the sequel for The Avengers which is said to entitled as Avengers: Age of Ultron. After the Directer Joss Whedon mentioned about the sequel, it actually peers that the expectations among people really went viral. Guess what people, he does that yet another time. The sequel was absolutely better than the previous screening. The thing which really matters for a superhero movie is majorly the plot and the Technical portions that too the realistic effects which was brought about by the VFX Team ( Visual Effects). It seems to be like the Green mat technology that is the Chroma Key method which really did work for this kind of film.<br/><br/>And about the casts, whom do we must consider as the Theme for the whole creation. To begin with about the step ahead theme was the introduction of The Twins performed by Aaron Taylor- Johnson as Quicksilver and Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch. They added the true miracle to the film. As usual Robert Downey Jr. personified the casual appearance in this film along with the herculean Hulk, the respected Captain America, the tall dude Thor, the beautiful Nat and Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye. They added the enthusiastic effect not only to the film but also to the people who are watching it. Even though Samuel L. Jackson appeared only in some few portion, the Pulp Fiction Star added the awesomeness in this film. His dialogues are needed to be highlighted and he is truly damn good in delivering it. Along with many others, overall they added the Bonding Power to this film.<br/><br/>About the Technicians, Cinematography by Ben Davis. The Cinematography seems to be one of the toughest parts next to the plot creation and the VFX portion. Fixing a particular frame under the green mat technology is highly difficult but under these circumstances, the cinematographer had really proved his brilliancy with his Camera. Music by Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman. Actually to be truthful, it was a way too disappointed with the Background scores. It was better for a Superhero film but not seems to be impressive enough. Editing by Jeffrey Ford and Lisa Lassek, it was spiced over the film perfectly and the editors did a splendid job. At last the Visual effects Team, they had really done an outstanding job in turning the impossible tasks possible. Overall they are the Real Heroes whom will be happy to celebrate the Victory of Avengers: Age of Ultron. About the Screenplay. The second half was more energetic than the first half with Spectacular Interval block. Along with his hard work, the director has to thank his team for lifting him up for displaying their best.<br/><br/>Finally for the Negative side. People who hate to watch a superhero film will definitely feel like hating it. Especially Christopher Nolan's Batman admirers, Avengers: Age of Ultron will never be a kind of a film what they expect. You people got to digest it and set yourself to watch such Summer Entertainer."
"olinn85","7","1","5","26 April 2015"," Good but not great.
","I've seen all the Marvel movies leading up to this one, and maybe Guardians of the Galaxy was just too good to follow.<br/><br/>A:Age of Ultron has a solid build up, but there are way too many slow chapters in it that both are uninteresting and poorly paced, but it kicks into gear again and finishes strong.<br/><br/>For me, Ultron was way too much just a robot James Spader, his classic wit and behavior seeped through and well.. I've heard that James Spader before a million times, so I never really connected to Ultron as a villain. And a movie like this with a Villain that doesn't get you either feeling a bit for him or utterly hating him, is lacking.<br/><br/>For me Age of Ultron was too much a stepping stone for the next Marvel movies, The Avengers movies should be the pinnacle of a story arc, not a chapter in the middle.<br/><br/>All in all a decent showing, but not even close to the first Avengers and even coming in behind CA: The Winter Soldier for me."

","After a knock back by a self made foe, Iron Man, Captain America, The Hulk, Thor and other superheroes team up to stop the new threat with the help of gifted twins to save the Earth from a global catastrophe.<br/><br/>The Age of Ultron a sequel to Avengers Assemble and linked to the other recent Marvel film outings is a more satisfying superhero film than its predecessor thanks to some further character development, genuine emotion and the introduction of Ultron, perfectly executed by James Spader. Both Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Wanda and Pietro Maximoff are great in their roles. <br/><br/>Director Joss Whedon manages to tap into the style of Iron Man 3 and Winter Solider giving this addition more of a human edge. There is a clear gap between the two outings and no exposition is required to see where the characters are at. Paul Bettany with some great makeup design is a fine addition as Vision and the closing assemble of the new Avengers crew including the likes of Falcon and War Machine is interesting.<br/><br/>Danny Elfman's music score is memorable and heightens the on screen robot action setups accordingly as the team look for Loki's weapon, then later take on Ultron and his minions. Whedon and team like the first inning manages to integrate the comic book action with the drama and visual effects effortlessly. <br/><br/>Here Jeremy Renne's Hawkeye gets much more screen time and storyline, Mark Ruffalo returns as Hulk/Banner alongside Robert Downey, Jr. (who again steals the show as Tony Stark even when looking for secret passages), Chris Evans, Don Cheadle, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Stellan Skarsgård and Samuel L. Jackson. A few sub- characters including S.H.I.E.L.D and Agent Carter also appear. While not perfect, the story feels more heartfelt and its biggest strength is its pacing, for such a long film it never lags and it remains pretty close to the early comic book spirit and roots. <br/><br/>Packed with more hit and miss one liners, outstanding effects (although I still feel Hulk is a little off) and great comic book characters it sets it up nicely for the next instalment with its tag on Thanos teaser ending."

Ultron was a huge disappointment, I really wanted him to be a scary villain with a lot of potential to cause damage. He made lame jokes in the movie(Of course, he is Tony's sliver, but Tony doesn't crack lame jokes) and Ultron's CGI sucked! His lips were curling! WTF? He's a robot! There was nothing great about the script either. It was like, yeah I've seen that, what's new?<br/><br/>As from the point of being just a movie, it was the same good old entertainment that Marvel has mastered and it's super heroes have executed.

"myn6267","7","1","5","24 April 2015"," Great comic inspired actions, mediocre character exploration.
","'Avengers : Age of Ultron'<br/><br/>The wow factor is there, but the only thing falling short is the director's decision (probably STudio Exec's) to cut out additional one and the half hours. All the essential characters development is missing (especially the twins) and the whole movie feels like a mash up of 'after-events' rather than a flow of happenings. All of them could make us care more about their stories but instead now we only 'seem to care' about their actions. Many scenes in the film looks obviously shortened just to focus on actions and many issues left unresolved. For now, i will be anticipating the director's cut if there is any because it will look like more of a complete story."

I haven't disliked a movie so much since Hulk with Eric Bana. It started with a mystifying and unexplained battle and it just went down from there. I got bored right from the beginning and after 20 minutes I put in my noise canceling earphones to block out this rubbish noise. I still have no idea what it was about and I still don't care. Worst movie ever...Hated it hated it hated it. ugh...I want my time back. And I am really perplexed at how this has such a high rating.

"Racetrip","1","3","34","17 September 2015"," Expensive special effects B-movie
","Why spend money on watching the Avengers: Age of Ultron? It's a completely unoriginal story, a waste of time and a total rip-off from Transformers, Iron Man and the first Avengers movie. The action scenes happens way too fast and often, an obvious attempt to cover up a week screenplay. Sad to say it also mocks people standing up for clean language – Captain America's famous line ""Language!"" kept getting a lot of heat from the obnoxious Iron Man. Speaking of Iron Man, they might as well have called this movie Iron Man 4 – it's all about him and his major blunder of creating artificial intelligence – apparently there are not enough villains in the world, so let's invent our own. If you're looking for an awesome sequel with same integrity (clean language) then Avengers: Age of Ultron is not for you. Just watch the first Avengers movie again, or Captain America 1 and 2 – the action is basically the same."

","The second installment of the movie that shook the Earth, The Avengers but this time instead of facing the God of Mischief, Loki, The Avengers assemble once again to stop the horrifying robot created by Tony Stark called Ultron that has a thing for classic Disney songs.<br/><br/>Let's start with the few negative aspects of the film, for some reason the writers felt that they needed to build up future MCU projects such a Thor: Ragnarok, a possible Planet Hulk movie and the long-awaited Civil War movie. I understand that these aspects had to be in the film so fans wouldn't rage if Tony and Steve just fought one day, they had to show their different perspectives of the world and rivalry before the 2016 blockbuster.<br/><br/>If you're going to see a Marvel movie expect memorable jokes and classic one-liners. The writers nailed it plus I can't imagine the actors/actresses delivering the lines better.<br/><br/>The thing that I love the most about Marvel Studious is that they never miscast, Robert Downey Jr. IS Iron Man, the returning cast of course nail it in their portrayals, now let's talk about the new-coming characters. The at first villainous turned heroic twins, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen. At first I thought I'll get annoyed by their characters accent but I was wrong cause their accent is actually enjoyable. From the start the movie made me care surprisingly a lot more than I thought I would about the twins. The other new addition to the heroes is The Vision played by the voice of J.A.R.V.I.S., Paul Bettany. His acting is as always spectacular, him and Ultron are two ends of the same coin and they explore that perfectly.<br/><br/>Remember how no one cared about Hawkeye in the first Avengers movie? Yeah, after this everyone cared and loved Hawkeye because of how the genius Joss Whedon fixed the mistakes he made. Clint Barton has the best one-liners in the movie. Later on in the movie we are shown that he isn't just an agent but he is also a father and a husband.<br/><br/>The tragic death of Quicksilver, Pietro was my favorite character in the whole movie and I cried real tears when he heroically died whilst saving Hawkeye and a child from gun fire.<br/><br/>Ultron, created by Tony Stark to protect the world from future threats but instead wanted to see the extension of mankind. James Spader is perfect as Ultron, his voice is electrifying and the way Ultron looked and changed his form by time was incredibly well done although I hoped we could've seen more forms.<br/><br/>In conclusion this movie is darker and more dramatic than the first installment but was still able to give us memorable jokes, lines and heart-felt moments."

","This is a long movie, a bit over 2 hours and 10 minutes. I saw it at home on DVD. As we expect this has a very aggressive sound track when the scenes demand, with deep bass that rattled the pictures on the wall.<br/><br/>This has all the superheroes and Tony Stark (Iron Man) is going out on a limb by himself to fuse his artificial intelligence with some more powerful AI. But it goes awry and Ulton appears, seemingly destined to destroy all of humanity, in his warped thought process he thinks a full extinction will benefit the Earth. As one characters explains ""Ultron doesn't know the difference between saving the world and destroying it.""<br/><br/>There is a good mix of action scenes and slower scenes. The filming (digital) take us to such places as London, South Korea, South Africa, and Italy so much of it was filmed in real places. <br/><br/>In the end Ultron's plan to destroy the Earth parallels what scientists believe caused mass extinctions in the past, by taking a whole Italian village, the size of a large asteroid, and lifting it so high that when it is dropped it will create the impact that destroys everything. Can the Avengers save the world?<br/><br/>I enjoyed it, a fun movie not to be taken too seriously."

","The Avengers are somewhere batting some army in an awful intro scene filmed in cheap accelerated CGI. Later we learn they are attacking a Hydra facility to retrieve Loki's scepter and are after some German scientist. Of course none of them suffers a scratch that is until the German guy releases The Twins, a pair of ""enhanced"". One of them is a version of The Flash and the other a pretty girl who does Tai Chi and releases a powerful multipurpose red mist that controls people's minds, train brakes, and acts as a weapon and shield. These two finally manage to get at least the Arrow-copycat injured. But the operation is a success of course. The Arrow-copycat is healed in the regenerating machine borrowed from Elysium.<br/><br/>In Loki's scepter is artificial intelligence for some reason and Stark and Banner agree to merge it with Jarvis to unleash the Ultron initiative that will bring peace to earth through war and death. When Reddington-Ultron wakes up and wears one of Stark's suits he's a bit confused but ready to accomplish his mission so he goes rogue.<br/><br/>His first goal is to buy that super metal used to make CA's shield. By now he's joined forces with the twins. The Avengers crash the deal but Tai Chi girl makes them all hallucinate in long pointless sequences, that for some reason include a long and dull battle between the iron suit guy and the green guy and we learn which one is stronger.<br/><br/>Ultron borrows the healing machine that together with the supermetal will give him a super body but the downloading of all his consciousness is taking way too long in the superworld so the Avengers manage to grab the incipient being.<br/><br/>Stark and Banner again agree to do something stupid in the name of science, namely re-insert Jarvis' mind in the being and wake it but the others finally realize what these two morons are up to and put a stop to it. Until Thor arrives and jumpstarts the creature which happens to have a third eye made of one of the infinity stones.<br/><br/>By now Ultron without his superbody is ready to bring peace to earth, by helping humans evolve. His means of accomplishing this is for some reason wiping out all life on earth, so he separates a whole city from earth and once it's high enough he'll drop it on earth to act like a meteor.<br/><br/>Now all the dressed-up goofs will have to join forces and stop Ultron while saving everyone on the city that's starting to fly up.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is rather unimpressive. Nothing here stands out. There's no great action sequence to speak of, no central message. Instead this movie is, like Ultron, confused about what it stands for. The first half is somewhat anti-war, the second half adopts some bizarre message for kids about ""doing your job!"" (no matter what and without question, I take it). The message of unity and togetherness is lost in repeated exhortations to do your job.<br/><br/>Despite being penned and directed by Whedon himself, this movie is lacking both in action and dialogue. There's a lot of emotional stuff going on as with Romanoff's strange and surprising romance with Banner. At least it's handles with innocence. There are handful of smart and interesting lines but no worked out thoughts or ideas. Most come from Ultron as he analyzes human behavior, even though humans really shouldn't be that foreign to him. But the potential was there for more incisive thinking.<br/><br/>I didn't think much of the first Avengers movie and this one doesn't do much to change my mind about the multiple series of tiring sequels. Thor I and Captain America II remain so far the highlights. Unfortunately we're told that the Avengers will be back of course, perhaps next time they'll put more effort into making it a smart and entertaining movie."

"hichamhilal","10","1","6","28 August 2015"," Why so much hate?
","(SPOILERS) This review contains spoilers!<br/><br/>I have a feeling that the majority of people hating on this movie are 12 years old DC fanboys. 'Cause any mature human being with higher IQs would realize how good this movie was. I'm neither Marvel nor a DC fanboy, I tend to enjoy both. Avengers Age of Ultron is nowhere near ''perfect'', but not bad either. this movie was entertaining, Intense and yes funny. I've been reading so many reviews stating that the jokes were not funny at all and the one-liners were predictable and so many other stuff like the Plot, Ultron wasn't a real threat, Bruce Banner/Natasha's romantic relationship, Quicksilver's death... etc. I mean what the hell?? First of all, these are not the movie's problems, these are obviously the audience's issues with the movie, each and everyone of you had their own movie playing in their heads. Some people were expecting something and got something else, at least appreciate the movie for what it is and for what it gave us. 1. The comedy in this movie was not supposed to make everybody laugh, as people's sense of humor changes from one to another, it was supposed to make the movie lighter and not as dark as DC is presumed to be with the start of their Universe. 2. I can agree with Ultron ALONE not being a threat but with the twins, The Avengers took one hell of a hit. Ultron being made by Tony Stark is the prime explanation for it's sense of humor and sarcastic behavior and also his intentions: peace in our time: Tony's exact concern. 3. Bruce and Natasha's relationship made perfect sense: her being the only one who can calm him down, being both ''monsters'' as they stated in the movie, they have so much in common: Bruce Banner and his condition, Natasha's past and everything she went through made her believe that she had no place in the world, exactly like him. 4. Quicksilver's death was rather sad, because nobody had to die that day, quicksilver is far faster than that, he could've saved agent Barton, the kid and himself as well, but then again his death was I guess necessary due to all the stuff people were saying like: (No actual Characters die in these movies. No threat whatsoever...). Barton will have a role in Civil War next year that's why he's still alive. Also Barton's death would have been cliché as hell especially after the introduction of his little family, which brings me to my next point: 5. The new take on Hawkeye was great, the fact that he has a family makes us relate to him more. Agent Barton is not just Hawkeye, he's also a father and a husband. 6. My final point would be about Tony Stark/Iron Man. To anybody who still says Tony shouldn't be Iron Man because he said he quit in the 3rd Iron Man movie is STUPID. He never said that, he just realized that the suit was not his biggest power, it was his intelligence, his brain and the people around him. Tony Stark gives the suit it's power not the way around. As a matter of fact, he said ''I'm Iron Man'' at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Once again, an actual movie review and your opinion are two different things. Avangers Age of Ultron was entertaining and I think we should appreciate the movie for what it is."
"amichnea","10","1","6","27 August 2015"," AMAZING Action Packed Movie... why so many haters?
","Firstly I will not go over the movie summary, plenty of reviews have done that, I will simply try and cover some of the questions, some of the negative aspects on which other reviews have focused so that other people may understand that none of those negative reviews actually apply. I won't give away specific spoilers and name certain actions/fates/characters however I will try and help fill any holes which some may have.<br/><br/>I honestly do not understand why this movie have so many bad reviews? It has the same rating as Iron Man 3... almost, a movie which I decided to ignore from the Marvel Series and call it ""Alternate Universe"" story since it made no sense... is it supposed to link with Avengers 2? I didn't think it did, I didn't really see any references so I will go with that:) and I urge the rest to do so too, since Tony Stark is Iron Man, period!!<br/><br/>Now about the movie, I want my brain to have fun, relax and switch off... well not quite off, I want to gasp in awesomeness, laugh and get an eye orgasm (which for the clever people is still controlled by the brain) and this movie delivers on all of those. So yeah I loved it, can't wait for the BD version so I can watch it AGAIN!!!!<br/><br/>Contrary to IM3 at least Avengers 2 tries to stick to the story somewhat. Just a fun fact, the guy that creates and is Ant-Man is the daddy for Ultron:) however let's go with the facts and compare: (1) He (Ultron) hates his creator - In this case Tony. CHECK. (2) He hates all human life and he believes that he is there to replace all humans - in this case it is true he wants to eradicate all human life. CHECK. (3) He took the personality of his creator - in this case we can go with Tony's jokes. CHECK. (4) Ultron has multiple personalities because he was reborn multiple times, he can never truly die - not really related to the movie but FYI. (5) Ultron's main body was made out of adamantium - related to movie. CHECK. (6) Ultron created Vision - pretty accurate 90% so let's go with this too. CHECK.<br/><br/>Oh and for whoever is commenting on the Hulkbuster Iron Man Armour: As the name suggests, it was specifically designed for hand-to-hand combat with the rampaging Hulk. The armor was built as a large exoskeletal shell which fits around Iron Man's normal armor and is equipped with rocket-boosted gauntlets, capable of punching the Hulk back several miles. CHECK CHECK CHECK!!!!!<br/><br/>Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch twins (Magneto is the father), CHECK, not sure what the Hydra connection was but let's go with it, bear in mind X-Men universe doesn't seem to be connected with Avengers in the movies. Quicksilver does have a similar fate in the comics... FYI!<br/><br/>I won't comment on the love interest in the movie since it doesn't kill the story or makes any huge changes, besides if we really want to analyse this, it does make sense how they went with it as they both have dark pasts and are misunderstood. Enough said.<br/><br/>Character clashes... sorry but did people see what happens in X-Men, JLA, Fantastic 4 and so on? Of course there are clashes because they are humans and humans sadly don't always play nice. Every team out there has these conflicts and they are well ""documented"" in the comics and cartoons. Character development missing? Seriously... these are the Heroes of decades of history, if you want that go read their back story or watch the dedicated movies or watch the cartoons.<br/><br/>Too many jokes? You need to realise that this is NOT X-Men, Batman, Superman or other serious super hero movies. Avengers are more on the Fantastic 4 and Spider-Man side with jokes and not taking things too seriously, if you are going to die saving the world you might as well have fun. You don't have the same dread that you do in the other movies because you damn well know... The Avengers are so mighty that nothing can really hurt them. Hulk or Thor on its own could take down... well the Batman, X-Men and even Superman:) For anyone that understand game references (touching on the nerdy side here) Avengers is more the Diablo of games, you get 1000's of monsters yet you know your Character can take them on and it's just pure fun where if you play something like Dark Souls you have that dread. I also love the ""FUSION"" powers, if anyone did play the Marvel Ultimate Alliance is when 2+ heroes combine powers, you saw that in Avengers 1 once I believe but is often used in 2 which is great.<br/><br/>After all that my question is how are people not liking it? I leave you to be the judge as on all aspects the movie does not falls short, and sure as hell doesn't deserve anything lower than an 8.5. It does a great job sticking to the story-line. Only negative is that they did try to fit too much into the 2 hours, they should have made it 3h and give the whiners that extra development and story, build up Ultron, then again some people complained that they fell asleep during the first hour, there is no pleasing a hater."
"isaiahwilson15","8","1","6","25 August 2015"," Avengers Age of Ultron packs a hefty punch with spectacular action sequences, great storytelling, and that classic Joss Whedon charm.
","Above all, Avengers Age of Ultron is entertaining. The addition of more action was a great choice as it helps maintain the fast pace of the movie. Despite the number of movies that are now cluttered with CGI, Age of Ultron still does contain a couple of visually stunning, jaw-dropping scenes. The new characters in the movie are probably the greatest addition, as Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Vision, and Ultron all have their moments. Above all, the movie just felt like a big homecoming that just so happens to feature freaking awesome superheroes.<br/><br/>The main problem with Age of Ultron was that it just tired to fit too much into a 2 hr 21 min time frame. Everything from the development of Ultron to the build up felt a little rushed. This could have easily been avoided if Marvel would have stuck with Whedon's original 3 hr cut. Age of Ultron also suffers from a villain who simply didn't manage to live up to Loki. Now I do think that Ultron is still one of Marvel's best villains, but he still manages to fall short of his predecessor due to a cliché ""take over the world"" plan. The film also fails to recreate some of those classic lines that were featured in the original, as those lines tend to fall flat.<br/><br/>All in all, Avengers Age of Ultron still serves its main purpose as another great addition to the Marvel Cinematic Universe!!"
"carter-47153","9","1","6","24 August 2015"," It Is The Age of Ultron
","As Avengers: Age of Ultron has just crossed the billion dollar mark in worldwide box office, I thought that it would be appropriate for me to finally put a few thoughts into the value of this movie. I have viewed the movie twice and have read numerous reviews and visited comment boards trying to get a rounded perspective before I began this review.<br/><br/>For me, reviewing a movie that is part of the Marvel Cinematic Universe is a challenging task. Professional reviewers tend to look at movies as singular pieces of work and seem to be stymied by the concept of an organic storytelling method. This film has seen negative reviews as it spends a portion of itself moving pieces and characters to a ""place"" where the next film will pick up. As such, the film includes a small number of scenes that have little to do with the characters' journey and struggle against the antagonist which is present in traditional storytelling.<br/><br/>Kevin Feige from Marvel Studios has discussed how the villain Ultron is relevant to our society currently. That we rely on technology as much as we do is a common theme in current fears and how much of our humanity is lost through our everyday practices. The idea behind concepts like Ultron is that through our actions with little regard for consequences we may bring about technology that will affect our lives so dramatically that there is no going back.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is the culmination and crescendo of the second phase of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far as Ant-Man will not be released until July. Most of the events of Iron Man 3, Captain America: The Winter Soldier, Thor: The Dark World and Guardians of the Galaxy have led to this film. As such while Age of Ultron may not be able to exist without these films; what is coming after this film will rely on Age of Ultron for it's exposition. While this is a storytelling method that is revolutionized by Marvel Studios it is not without it's pitfalls. There are moments where the pace of the story is slowed down in order to accommodate this ""always looking ahead"" philosophy.<br/><br/>There are a lot of moving parts to Age of Ultron. Four main characters are introduced: Ultron, Wanda Maximoff, Pietro Maximoff and The Vision. In addition to having nine other major characters their screen time isn't as much as it could be though for their roles it is appropriate. In fact the film does a better than average job at balancing all of the characters and keeping the pace up and exciting. While in the first Avengers film, Robert Downey Jr had most of the attention on him; in this film while he is present through the film it is Chris Evans' Captain America who begins the movie with a moral dilemma and is the character who changes the most on his journey through story.<br/><br/>When Director Joss Whedon began his tour of duty on The Avengers he wanted a story to where just because someone is a hero it doesn't mean that they get a free pass. This is very prominent in Age of Ultron. Due to the events of Avengers and Iron Man 3, Tony Stark reacts by creating a source of technology that brings even greater destruction to his world. It is because of this kind of reaction that The Avengers must fight their own fears made real and their own dark sides. The world in which they inhabit is not one of good versus evil. It is one steeped in realism in which ""one creates that which they fear the most"". The protagonists have to struggle against a threat brought upon simply by their own presence.<br/><br/>The film is just as beautiful as the first one. Circular camera movement features heavily into the expanded action scenes. It is used to great effect to enhance the team atmosphere. We are also exposed to long takes that show all The Avengers in action at the same time. These are methods that we have seen before but Mr. Whedon expands upon them to use them to better effect.<br/><br/>The actors who are reprising their roles are spot on as has been the case throughout the Marvel movies. In fact as time goes on some of these characters keep getting better and better. The new actors were expertly picked as well. Aaron Taylor Johnson displays Pietro's arrogance perfectly as well as concern for his sister, Elizabeth Olsen brings the insecurity of Wanda, James Spader brings an eloquence and through voice work a sense of menace to Ultron and Paul Bettany who had previously voiced Tony Stark's A.I. Jarvis debuts as The Vision. Through Mr. Bettany's career he has played roles which have required a logical viewpoint mixed with genuine compassion. The Vision is portrayed expertly through this viewpoint.<br/><br/>In the end this film is about family. Not family in the traditional sense but the kind of a world we create and how we expect the next generation to cope with it. This is seen primarily through Ultron, The Vision, Wanda and Pietro. It is also about finding our place in the world that we inherit and help to create organically."
"andrenapuri","10","1","6","4 August 2015"," It's not only perfection, is resurrection
","Since Superman Returns(which is a pretty bad movie), is a good example for being an specific superheroes movie, like it's the Avengers Age of Ultron. Marvel has been giving us great movies since Iron Man in 2008, but they have been movies not specific superheroes subjects, like Captain América The Winter Soldier(which is a superheroes/spy movies) or Guardians of the Galaxy(superheroes/space opera movie), and now, Avengers Age of Ultron is a magnificent movie with great special effects, a charismatic villain, a perfect adapted screenplay and one of the best directed superheroes movies ever. Of course there are some disappointments like the over jokes, the pretty bad accent and the cheesy Ultron body, but the perfection and smart script make the mistakes invisibles. That why Avengers Age of Ultron is great not only for the force of the characters and the excellent soundtrack, It's great for being what we need, a perfect superheroes movie."
"yodog259","7","1","6","11 July 2015"," Avengers 2 was great in some ways but a bust in others.
","In my eyes, this was suppose to be the best marvel movie to date, but this movie failed to meet my expectations. The dialogue was great between characters, and the team chemistry in battle was very good. The amount of screen time between characters was pretty well balanced considering how many new heroes were in this movie. The action was great with most scenes especially with hulk and Iron man. I never would have thought iron man could beat hulk. Avengers made the same mistake as iron man 3 with having too much comedy in the movie. The comedy had its moments but overall killed the movies's tone. Future marvel movies need to be darker like DC movies and the winter soldier. Ultron was the biggest screw up of the movie. Ultron was less threatening than the winter soldier of all villains(props to the Russo brothers). Whedon made the Vision too powerful, for he could have beaten Ultron himself. One new bright spot was quicksilver. I enjoyed every scene he was in. It is to bad they had to kill him off. Thor is the most powerful member of the team, and he should have got more screen time than he did. Joss Whedon picked a little more than he could chew on this motion picture. Avengers: Age of Ultron was a rushed movie and a big waste of a major villain like Ultron. This movie is good but could have been great."
"kosmasp","8","1","6","7 July 2015"," The bar is set high
","And therefor it's not as surprising to see/hear people being disappointed in the outcome. But the movie itself is more than decent, if you watch it free of any comparisons. And I don't mean free as in not connected (Guardians of the Galaxy can be seen as that), but as in not comparing it in scale or humor to the other entries in the franchise. Phase 3 is a go after this.<br/><br/>Since I'm not that familiar with the comics themselves I cannot compare nor am I ""biased"" or preoccupied/preconceived by anything. So characters coming up and the interpretation of them are fresh as they are presented. It might take the ""easy"" way out in some cases, but overall the odds are against stacked against our heroes.<br/><br/>Apart from building up on the previous build ups and Hawkeye/Widow getting more screen time, what I do like, is the fact that you get little jokes throughout the movie. The ""language"" joke might annoy some, but I like little gems like that myself. Obviously some people are fed up with Superhero movies, but that won't change the fact, that they are here to stay ... and entertain if you let them"
"kmgalahad","10","1","6","21 June 2015"," A worthy sequel to the original Avengers
","Whedon delivers a stunning sequel to the original Avengers that took the world by storm, with every bit of action, humor, thrill, and overall attractiveness as the original. New characters are introduced at a suitable pace, so they have a suitable amount of on screen time, but not so fast as to feel rushed. The story is excellent, with pieces of unpredictability thrown into the mix. The acting on top of it is superb, as the chemistry within the Avengers really shine through in what I can only assume is an on screen reflection of off screen relationships. <br/><br/>Overall, one of the best movies of 2015. <br/><br/>Looking forward to Civli War and Infinity War Parts I and II."

"aimeesouthwood","10","1","6","13 June 2015"," A must see movie, for anyone!!!
","I don't see how this movie is getting less than seven stars at least. It is absolutely amazing and I am beginning to consider if it is now one of my favourite Marvel movies. I will need to watch it again, but I could watch this film non stop. I am a massive marvel fan-girl and I just can't believe how overwhelming this film was. I don't want to give any spoilers. However, I am going to say that if you were to watch this film you will laugh, cry, and be really shocked about the stories of the Avengers. In this film you get to see what their lives were like when they were younger. And what they are now and it tells you that they can live a normal life. Avengers: Age of Ultron isn't just action stories. There are so many stories and it makes us feel different about the characters. P.s when you go to see this movie; take tissues. :)"
"kenyae-cagle","10","1","6","27 May 2015"," Age Of Ultron
","This movie was very fun and enjoyable for me. I enjoyed every part of this movie except for one. The part I didn't enjoy was the fact that the Hulk got knocked out by Iron Man. And that bothers me because the angrier the Hulk gets the stronger he becomes he should have killed Iron Man. But that's something I could look past. I did enjoy the character development of Ultron and how he tried to play the aspect of god and really believed that the answer to peace was no organic life on earth. Kinda brings me back to the Mass Effect days. I really enjoyed Quicksilver and his sister when they began to help the Avengers that was pretty cool. I also loved the jokes that they were all making on Captain America about him not liking people cursing also I really enjoyed seeing the Ultron get his butt kicked by the Hulk. BUT What I really thought was stupid was Black Widow and The Hulk tried to runaway together and love each other. I am also kinda mad that the Hulk just left the Avengers and basically committed suicide. I feel there shouldn't have been a love connection between those two in the first place."
"robsta23","9","1","6","17 May 2015"," Very Exciting and Fun
","I was worried when I heard some critics were giving Age of Ultron worse reviews than the first movie, but I didn't really research what this meant exactly: whether it meant Age of Ultron would be terrible or just not as good. I try to avoid reviews so I can make my own opinion about the movie, and I have to say I really loved this movie. There are many great aspects to this film, including how it lived up to the fun of the first movie while establishing a darker tone at points (I love dark stories).<br/><br/>Age of Ultron doesn't mess around, and we are immediately immersed in an action scene at the opening to the film. And immediately we get a joke: the first line uttered is ""s***!"" by Tony Stark, to which Rodgers yells ""language,"" and this becomes a moment the film keeps coming back to. I am not going to give anything away for these parts, but the parts I enjoyed the most involved Thor's hammer; so funny. Robert Downey Jr is at the heart of the fun in this movie, being the smart-ass that is my favorite character of the bunch, but he is also one of the most tested characters in this movie which I love.<br/><br/>Tony attempts to put a shield around the world, as he states, by creating Ultron, a digital consciousness that can connect to just about anywhere in the world, allowing it to control a countless number of androids. This is a result of his seeing a vision, due to Scarlet Witch's magic, of the Avengers defeated, making Tony fear what lies beyond the planet after their fight with Loki. The creation of Ultron makes the some of the other Avengers fearful when Tony wants to upload another digital consciousness into a body Ultron was going to upload himself into. The scene that results from this reignites the film after a slow second act in my opinion.<br/><br/>Not wanting to reveal anymore about the excitement of this film, this is where I leave you. I highly recommend this film; if you like action films or specifically superhero films you will not be disappointed with this one."

I am not a die hard super hero fanatic but I really enjoyed this film. It sustained a 2+ hour time frame and I never felt bored. There are some beautiful scenes such as the beginning of the film when they are all fighting next to each other as well as the scene at the core area. It was some of the best cgi/slow motion I've ever watched. I also really enjoyed the party scene. The humor was fun and right on for a marvel superhero movie so I'm not understanding the criticism.

I mean is it really a surprise that the most popular form of cinema, populist entertainment like superhero films, star wars films, fast and furious films etc. are shunned by the cultural elite? Who cares what they think. 20 years from now no one will remember moonlight except film students and people directly related to the film and maybe the .0001 percent of the population who saw it in theaters. But all the Marvel films and the Fast movies will still be playing on FXX2 and HBORussiaWest until we're dead. Sometimes winning isn't just about awards, but what's remembered. That's the ultimate test. Immortality. Populist films by and large, especially the best of them pass this test. The reason it's not worth discussing is because frick the academy.

"hypestyle","9","1","6","3 May 2015"," ""Age of Ultron"" Smashes, Bashes and Thrills
","""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is officially the second ""Marvel's The Avengers"" movie, but nonetheless the 10th film in the ongoing Marvel Studios' ""Marvel Cinematic Universe"". All of the no less than six principal characters from the first team film are here, and screenwriter - director Joss Whedon does an admirable job of juggling them all for a mostly cohesive fantasy thriller.<br/><br/>The movie's plot opens with the team invading a terrorist stronghold, where renegade scientist Baron Strucker has been using an Asgardian artifact to conduct experiments on locals to turn them into superhuman agents of HYDRA. (This is the big-bad terror outfit that was officially felled in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"", but inevitably, these sorts of bad-folk social clubs have any number of splinter cells.) Iron Man (Robert Downey, Jr.) retrieves Scepter of Loki and figures out that it can jumpstart his team of robotic peacekeeping sentries. He works on the secret ""Ultron"" project with Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) with the hope of creating a manageable robot army and allow their friends to retire from the superhero gig. (The particulars of what their health insurance and retirement plans might be are never dealt with, but would be intriguing for future filmmakers.) After several false starts, Ultron comes alive in secret, but apparently some bugs made his programming a little ""off"" and he wakes up angry. REALLY angry. ""2001: A Space Odyssey"" introduced HAL-9000 as an intelligent computer program that gradually becomes murderous over the course of months. Ultron leapfrogs the slow-burn angle and basically is homicidal from his first day of self-awareness. It's implied that mankind's history of war and oppression irrevocably convince Ultron that humans are the ultimate invasive species.<br/><br/>After ""multiplying like Catholic rabbits"" (quoth Samuel Jackson's patch-eyed Nick Fury), Ultron's legion of self-created robots starts invading world cities, looking for rare metals that can help him create a more advanced body as well as the super-weapon that will help him-- wait for it-- destroy humanity.<br/><br/>Naturally, the good guys can't have any of that. Soon, Captain America (Chris Evans) and the rest of the team are launching assaults to pull the plug on the rogue robot. At least for a while, they manage to be stymied by the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson), two orphans of Eastern Europe's 1990s war conflicts. Olsen's character has psychic abilities that expose people's greatest fears, creating much of the angst that weighs heavily on the protagonists. In comparison, Taylor-Johnson's character is simply super-fast; a somewhat more mundane power in comparison, though he manages to make an emotional impact later in the film.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, romantic tension in the film comes from an unexpected coupling- Ruffalo's Banner and Johannson's Widow (aka Natasha Romanov). It's a Beauty and the Beast conceit that is thankfully given several lingering scenes of explanation in between the literally explosive goings on in the main narrative. Ruffalo's Banner has a tragic arc, desperate for an intimate relationship but relentlessly haunted by the threat of a Hulk rampage. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is revealed to have a wife and children living off-grid, and some downtime on his family's farm gives not only his character some needed spotlight (he spent most of the last film hypnotized) but also the other characters as well. Viewers would do well to pay attention to these scenes in particular, as they seem to sow seeds for developments in future adventures.<br/><br/>In keeping with Marvel's comics traditions, the heroes argue and fight among themselves until the moment of clarity comes for all of them who the real enemy is. This is facilitated by Paul Bettany as a new ally to the team, born from the efforts of several members. Other Avengers allies seen in some of the solo movies show up here as well, also hinting at future developments.<br/><br/>The climax is lengthy enough to be satisfying for its action scenes but also comes across as somewhat drawn-out in its execution. Look for the sacrifice of a key character at an unexpected moment, to the filmmakers' credit.<br/><br/>All of the actors manage to have sufficient spotlight- Downey's smart-aleck Tony Stark continues to be his defining modern role, Chris Evans' morally-centered Captain America has taken formal reins of leadership of the team, distrusts the notion of being at war with everyone and no one at the same time-- and is still mindful of bad language in mixed company. Chris Hemsworth's Thor has gotten more used to life among mortals.<br/><br/>Ultron is given a droll flair by ""The Blacklist""'s James Spader. Spader as Ultron is enveloped in CGI animation (via motion-capture technology) just as Ruffalo is so enveloped for his stints as the Hulk. While the actor's real body is unseen, his personality makes intriguing what could have been a very generic role. On an interesting side note, pioneering motion-capture actor Andy Serkis (""Lord of the Rings"", ""Planet of the Apes"") has a bit part here as an arms dealer, sans any CGI.<br/><br/>The film will make believers of this particular kind of action spectacle. Joss Whedon is given the herculean (Thor-ean?) task of making comic book stories like the Avengers look real enough to be appreciated by comics laypeople but fantastic enough for the fanboys and girls who are steeped in the lore. Here, he succeeds. It's not a perfect film, but like its protagonists, flaws are part of its appeal and the ending promises a bold new direction for the saga."

","I've never read a comic book or graphic novel in my life. But the way that Marvel has brought this universe together is fantastic and I'm enjoying the ride. I don't care if the hardcore fans criticize it for not following or staying true to the comics. This movie was entertaining from beginning to end.<br/><br/>It's a pretty simple plot. A robot or AI gone bad named Ultron wants to destroy the world. The Avengers need to stop him. Nothing complicated about it. There is plenty of action and quick one liners to keep the mood light hearted. I've seen others complain about the fact there are so many different characters but it worked for me. They were all interesting and have stories of their own.<br/><br/>Plain and simple, if you are a fan of the Marvel movies this won't disappoint. I enjoyed it thoroughly."

I liked Part 2 after my first of inevitable multiple viewings to come. It was hilarious at times, darker, more adult and relished in taking a ton from both the original Avengers movies plus many things from the other MCU films. I wouldn't call it perfect, as I noticed a few too many questions I couldn't answer by the end. Also, some of the scenes were just rehashing both scenes and plot devices in its predecessor. I do believe, at least, the questions will be answered with my second (or more) viewings. And speaking of which, I don't think this is a ONE-TIME viewing movie. There is a TON of stuff here to absorb – an almost countless number of subplots, relationships, motives, backgrounds, flashbackscome to think about it, why they didn't break this movie into two, like they plan for Avengers 3a and 3b, it beyond me. Perhaps Whedon knew this was his last shot, so he just threw everything in. Whatever. I still liked what came out. I refuse to give specific details of the movie on what I liked or sucked or plot points or scenesas enough spoilers have been shot around the internet as it is.

","For seven years now, the Marvel Cinematic Universe has dominated the summer blockbuster season (wow! It's been seven years of this). After its culmination in the highly successful Avengers film, the general public has started to grow tired of superhero movies. They still pump out record-breaking numbers, yet reviews have been polarizing. I understand all that- it's a formulaic genre, there are so many films to keep up with- but Avengers: Age of Ultron reminds me why we continue to see these movies; they're just so much fun.<br/><br/>The Avengers sequel dives right into the action and introduces two new characters in the opening sequence. They are possibly the best new additions to the series- Hydra experiments Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch. ""He's fast, she's weird"" Maria Hill remarks. It's a funny line, but they are so much more than that. Quicksilver's insane speeds allow him to change the dynamic of any situation he's in. He is played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson, who is transformative in the role in every way. His twin sister, played with wonderful emotional complexity by Elizabeth Olsen, can use telekinesis and can also induce visions. Age of Ultron quickly gets abstract as we see her get into Tony Stark's head, and soon after, the other Avengers. Their goal? Tear the Avengers apart.<br/><br/>This is all under the command of Tony Stark's ambitious if misguided A.I. peacekeeping program, Ultron. Ultron is almost immediately self-aware, and because of how highly-functioning he is, he soaks up information within seconds, takes command of physical bodies (machines), and can be anywhere and everywhere at once. Ultron is practically limitless in his powers.<br/><br/>Ultron is played brilliantly by James Spader. With his menacing voice and sharp wit, you laugh at the things he say while still terrified of his power and total command of any situation he is put in. And with the aid of Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, he is practically unstoppable. But not if the Avengers can help it.<br/><br/>Though Ultron wants to rip the Avengers apart, and talks about how discordant they are, they actually function much better as a unit in this one than in the film's predecessor. The only discord is between the two mad scientists, as they refer to themselves- Bruce Banner and Tony Stark. It is Tony's fault that he has unleashed this monster on the world, and he intends to fix it. Bruce Banner, on the other hand, is burdened by his powers, keeping his emotions tucked away, which proves to be a more formidable foe for him than anything else in the film. Mark Ruffalo gets a lot more time to shine in this one.<br/><br/>Hawkeye also gets a brand new treatment this one, and it's half the reason I enjoyed this new Avengers so much. Characters that were previously just there for the battles- Hawkeye, Hulk, and Black Widow- all are fleshed out further in character, while Thor and Captain America are a bit more on the sidelines. They get plenty of great fighting scenes in, but less development. That's what the solo movies are for.<br/><br/>I liked Age of Ultron even more than I enjoyed the first, though I can't say it's without its faults. The dialogue is very witty but also extremely on-the-nose at times. New chemistry between Banner and Black Widow is introduced, seemingly out of nowhere, and then rushed through for the sake of the bigger story. Some of the dialogue between them is cringe-worthy. And though the middle of the film takes us far away from the usual landscape to give the audience a breather and the characters a chance to do more interacting, the series is feeling rather tired in its landscape. Nearly all of the big battles take place in cities, the Avengers facility, Tony Stark's place, or somewhere in the blue skies. The action is exciting, but we've seen these landscapes before, and the lack of uniqueness will cause audiences to be confused as to which Avengers film they are watching when it is on TV in a few years.<br/><br/>Still, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great time at the movies. It boasts fantastic CGI and good camera work that puts the audience right in the action without dizzying us, and though the movie goes to much darker places, it never forgets to have a sense of humor about it. It's a comic book movie and doesn't pretend to be anything else. <br/><br/>Maybe you're tired of the superhero genre and maybe Hollywood could use more diversity in its tentpole films, but there is a reason they keep churning out these movies, and it's because they're so much fun. Avengers: Age of Ultron is proof of that. It's impossible to not enjoy.<br/><br/>Grade: A"
"MattBirk","6","1","6","2 May 2015"," One of the Better MCU Movies out there!
","In short, the long-awaited Avengers: Age of Ultron delivered us more or less the what we've come to expect from the MCU. Fantastic action pieces along with witty banter, to only be brought down by familiar villain characteristics. But that's not to say the movie was bad by any stretch, it was one hell of an entertaining ride and one of Marvel's best films to date. Everything from the first film was carried over and to new heights; action sequences, villain screen time, character banter, and expanded knowledge of the universe are all given more screen time. I can't see a sound reason die hard fans of the MCU would be disappointed here.<br/><br/>The only major problem with the movie is, of course, its villain Ultron. His powers, to no surprise, have been dulled down significantly and he is now a jokester of sorts. He wasn't nearly as menacing as the trailers made him out to be. At any given moment, he throws out a one liner for no real reason, so many in fact that it becomes near tiresome. But the core of the problem has to be Ultron's plans are nothing we haven't seen before. Another villain trying to end humanity as we know it and the Avengers are nipping at his heels the whole movie. They were actually too close to his heels the whole movie, in fact, they were prevailing for too much of the movie.<br/><br/>The only person to actually 'hurt' the Avengers was Scarlet Witch, and she switches sides, which leaves Ultron all alone. And by all alone I mean Vibranium Ultron and hundreds of easily disposable mini Ultrons. Only to be brought down in a predictable fashion and surprisingly easy fashion. It seems like the Marvel executives are saving the real destruction for future movies and Thanos, which makes these movies seem almost like place holders.<br/><br/>But on a high note, the movie is far more action-packed than its predecessor. Not only are the action scenes better than the first film, but we actually get to see the numerous powers from all of the superheroes. Scarlet Witch's telekinesis, The Vision's density manipulation, Thor's lightning possession, and, of course, a ton of smashing from the Hulk. It's hard to argue the movie isn't entertaining as hell! Is this the comic book movie to end all comic book movies? Not even close but it's still pretty damn awesome!"
"burakberkesu","7","1","6","2 May 2015"," AGE OF VIBRANIUM and there's also this Ultron guy who happens to have access to it and is not a threat at all who actually gives us a new powerful hero, THANKS!
","Please, you are being too harsh on this movie. It does not have to affect you the way Captain America: The Winter Soldier or Guardians of the Galaxy did, but this certainly is up there in the list of first five; don't you compare this to The Amazing Spider-Man 2 or X-Men Origins: Wolverine!<br/><br/>NO. There are not so many things going on in this movie. So many things happening is when there are three main villains (*coughs* Spider-Man 3 *coughs*) and you get none of them right because of time issues. So many thing happening is when there is development going on with every single character and you just cannot follow. Not being able to look at everything in fight scenes just gives you the chance to rewind and focus on another character this time around.<br/><br/>YES. Ultron is not menacing in any way possible. When I read about it, I thought it was about his voice being much more humane than in the trailers, but he is capable of nothing at all. Thank you for pointing it out, Hawkeye, but Captain America actually was a match for Ultron. Not even counting Iron Man who destroyed his current form and Thor-Vision-Iron Man trio damaging the ""Vibranium"" body pretty bad.<br/><br/>NO. Hawkeye is not too weak. Why is no one concerned with Widow? BECAUSE BOOBS. I have never quite liked Jeremy Renner for the role, but Hawkeye is the one who seems to be the most hilarious and arrogant, but in fact the one who rescues every other hero in the team who had got beaten because of stupid reasons just because they think they are too powerful for anything coming their way. Hawkeye is skillful and mastering something is way cooler than being born as a demigod, accepting to be experimented on, or having money. But no, portraying him as a family guy was not what he needed. Expecting that it was ridiculous to have just his bow and arrow during such a disaster? It is not empathy but awesomeness we crave about him.<br/><br/>YES. Hulk and ""Nat"" is not the best pairing to ever happen on earth. She could go with anyone but let's go with the guy who is just too old and unattractive for her. Reasons? Because we need someone to calm him, even though he was capable of controlling himself in the previous instalment. And it's Black Widow, for god's sake! Stop calling him Agent Romanoff. Or ""Nat""???<br/><br/>NO. The twins were not underdeveloped. Yes, they came in quick and one went out quick (this is a fabulous pun, accept it), but they were a good addition to the franchise. Their powers really are different from any other, they are mutants after all. Oops, prohibited word right there!<br/><br/>YES. The jokes are sometimes too much, but it still is the reason why Marvel shines amongst some other sweet ""super"" rivals. Ulysees Klaw pushing it a little too much was perhaps unnecessary, but come on, luckily, he is mighty! Language!<br/><br/>This is a movie to stun you with the CGI. It is not supposed to be full of character development; this is when you see every character already developed together, and cannot stand the greatness anymore. It may have similarities with the first one, but to coin a phrase, ""If it ain't broke, don't fix it""."
"mgouveia-171-351214","8","1","6","2 May 2015"," Brilliant.
","I honestly find it hard to believe that so many reviews on here claim the first movie to be better... it isn't. <br/><br/>For starters there is story and content all the way through, the acting continues to be top notch and the action... well its brilliant. It's honestly hard to review this because I don't want to spoil anything for you at all.<br/><br/>Finally this movie feels important unlike the first and if anything it brings a sort of importance to the first movie.<br/><br/>After guardians this is probably my #2/3 marvel movie and I imagine that will fall once civil war and Ragnarök arrive."
"ivanmessimilos","8","1","6","1 May 2015"," Very good sequel of Avengers
","Great continuation of the original, maybe just a little bit worse than the original. The film does not have any major flaws. The director took care about a good balance of the characters in the film (now there are more), action and humor. Visually the film is spectacular, there are many actions and those scenes are great shot. Some will say that there are too many characters, that there is too much action (seriously?), There's not enough story. Nonsense. The film lasts two and a half hours, which is quite enough. They even had to shorten because the first version was a long three hours and some tidbits. While expecting a darker approach in sequel, it can not happen. Also a weakness that no major unexpected moments. Usually I expect when the denouement, but it has not happened. I think the new characters well represented. There are several fine moments in the film that I will not mention for the sake of spoilers. One can now say that the phase 2 ready and has already started slowly preparing for a new wave of the third phase. Although the next movie Ant-Man, the real spectacle is expected in the new sequel Captain America - Civil War that can be considered a continuation of Avengers with respect to the story. Everything will culminate in Avengers 3 which will be released in two parts. My rating is 8/10. Very funny movie with some minor flaws, but two and a half hours we have passed relatively quickly."
"djkg1","9","1","6","1 May 2015"," The most spectacular movie I've ever seen!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
","I was a little worried when I saw that this movie only got 75% on Rotten Tomatoes.com. So I paid $11.25 today at 1:00 for 3D with guarded expectations. I was literally on the edge of my seat for 80% of the movie. It was everything I wanted it to be and exceeded my expectations by far. I simply don't understand how a fan of Marvin movies could walk away disappointed with this film. I'm going back to see it again to get clear of some things that I didn't quite get the first time, especially the mind blowing technology in the infinity stones.Sometimes when a movie like this adds so many characters, things get very confusing and jumbled.But this director made it all come together perfectly and every character makes sense and has purpose. INFINITY WARS WILL BE EPIC!"
"dhairya-16279","9","1","6","1 May 2015"," Way better than the First Film.. But not without its quirks..
","SPOILER ALERT..!!<br/><br/>Let me start by saying this, Avengers: Age of Ultron is the best film Marvel has made to date. It has some of the best jaw-dropping action scenes, funny and humorous scenes and just plain WOW moments.<br/><br/>The film and huge shoes to fill, after exceptional films like The Avengers and Captain America: The Winter Soldier. And it did it too. All the Avengers were excellent, especially Scarlet Witch and The Vision. Speaking of The Vision, more on him in a bit. You'll never know how fast time passed watching the movie. It goes on entertaining the audience until the very end. The only major problem I with the film was the Banner-Romanoff relationship. I mean why, just why are they doing this? Even Hulk didn't like all that and he flew away from her in the end.<br/><br/>The Vision was just amazing. He came in when the film was half over, but he pumped a new life into the film. The scene where he picks up Mjolnir and passes it to Thor was just awesome. Also, the scene where he meets a battle-bruised Ultron and destroys him completely with his Mind Gem was pretty good.<br/><br/>The Maximoff Twins were amazing too. Too bad Quicksilver died, but Scarlet Witch just blew it out of the park in the ending. There was a moment where I thought there was a bit too much stuffed in the movie, because they couldn't develop them properly and by that I mean they could have showed their parents in some kind of flashback, instead of narrating the story.<br/><br/>Hawkeye also played a major part in this film, unlike the first one. We get to see his wife and children. During the finale, he saves a kid. Quicksilver tries to shield him and the kid (which he does successfully but dies). <br/><br/>Ultron looked menacing and scary in the trailers, but in the movie, well, not so much. His voice is convincing enough when he speaks softly, but when he shouts, it gives and impression of a kid talking rather than a mighty-dangerous sentient being. He also suffers from being a bit underdeveloped. I think Marvel should have kept the film length longer which would have helped explaining Ultron and the Twins better. <br/><br/>At the end, Cap assembles his own New Avengers, after Stark departing, Banner disappearing and Thor returning to Asgard. The New Avengers consists of the Cap himself, Black Widow, Scarlet Witch, War Machine, Falcon and the Vision. Cap almost says Avengers Assemble, but he is interrupted by the credits.<br/><br/>In the mid-Credits scene, Thanos retrieves the Infinity Gauntlet and says.""Fine, I'll do it myself"" indicating the collection of the Infinity Stones, in which Loki and Ronan failed.<br/><br/>All taken and accounted for, Avengers: Age of Ultron serves as a more than worthy sequel. Its got all you want from a comic book movie. Even though it feels a bit overstuffed and starts walking on the wrong path, it recovers like a pro. Its definitely something that you'd wanna see."
"subxerogravity","9","1","6","1 May 2015"," Age of awesomeness!
","Lives up to the excitement I pent up for it.<br/><br/>I got to give Joss Whedon cred as a filmmaker. Age of Ultron is a very different movie than the Avengers, and I was expecting the Avengers, which hit me with a curve ball and made the movie something that I had to seep in.<br/><br/>It helps that the movie began with a cool action sequence that introduces all the players (old and new).<br/><br/>James Spader as Ultron was perfect. Dark, Inhumane, and the best part was that he does not even realize it. It's was the type of performance that can put the comic book villain up there with movie villains like Darth Vader.<br/><br/>Hawkeye gets to shine a little more for those who are huge fans of the Avenger, and Sam Jackson looks like he got into shape to play Fury again, not bad!<br/><br/>And Lots more Avengers to choose from. Reminds me of X-Men 2, you would think too many heroes would clutter up the movie, but in the end it worked. (Or maybe as a comic book fan I got Goosebumps seining so many heroes on the same screen). Lots of cameos and trivial points for geeks as well.<br/><br/>I also loved how worldwide the movie is. I've seen New York being destroyed so many times on the Big screen it becomes unreal, so it was fun watching other cities from around the world get destroyed. Keeps it down to Earth. Some of the best fight scenes are front in center in more realistic places which heightens the excitement. <br/><br/>I have to say, I liked the original better than the sequel (also like Captain America: the Winter Solder better). In this sequel, we got to know the Avengers a lot better with a lot of emotional talk, which made the movie iffy for me, but like I said the movie has to seep in on you. It did have the advantage of being the more heroic movie with the Avengers sometimes feeling like fire fighters while saving the world, at the same time being darker with a lot of geeky scenes about the definition of a hero.<br/><br/>New Avengers, Darker Villain, and more scenes with the team fighting together as one. Definitely worth the IMAX dollars"
"blarglznoflo","8","1","6","1 May 2015"," Great, but a bit chaotic at times
","First off, I'll get this out of the way. Is it better than the first Avengers movie? Not quite, but it's almost as good. In my opinion, of course.<br/><br/>One issue--too many characters for the time they had! They bring in new heroes and you barely have time to remember the name before we've moved on. They bring back minor heroes from past movies, but don't have the time to actually use those characters much during battles. Honestly, if it had been a bit longer, it might have felt less chaotic. I understand that this is just a fact of the comic world, there simply ARE that many heroes involved. But it's hard to keep them straight on a movie screen.<br/><br/>The comedy was decent. Better than in past Marvel movies, where during a climactic battle everyone pauses for some wisecracks. That didn't happen this time, but of course there were still plenty of jokes. I like that, it just needs to be the right time.<br/><br/>It was confusing, I'll be honest. I want to watch it a couple more times. Certain parts were never explained, but again that's comics. So I need to watch it over again to really ""get it"".<br/><br/>That all being said, I did love it. Each main Avenger got their screen time. Of course it's RDJ-heavy, because this is a storyline based around Iron Man. But no one is really neglected. There was plenty of action, lots of joking, some drama and fun...to me, it's very close to the level of the first Avengers movie. Not quite there, but almost. And that's about what I expected, so I was satisfied."
"nathanwesselius","8","1","6","30 April 2015"," Far better than the first, with some flaws, of course
","Reading other reviews, it is clear people were not pleased with its outcome. They had such high expectations, always dreaming of a perfect movie with flawless plot development, character depth, balance of romance and action, and so much more. I do, in part, share that vision. However, I knew that this movie, along with other Marvel blockbusters, will never become true classics. It will not become immortalized in time and worshiped as the Holy Grail of superheroes flicks. But it still blew my mind and intrigued me, always leaving me hungry for more. And that is far more credit than many will ever give it. Unfortunately, you all are missing the true genius of Marvel's movies. <br/><br/>The audience is panned for younger viewers. Simple as that.<br/><br/>Many will disagree, but that's why there's the explosions with no blood. The romance with no fire. No mind benders or major twists. This is meant to blow the box office and get the teenagers wired for more. If you want plot depth and character power, go watch the X-Men series or Watchmen. These will always be easygoing films, just please get that through your heads.<br/><br/>**Rant Ends**<br/><br/>Now, onto my opinion of the movie. Why I gave it an 8. <br/><br/>Pros - <br/><br/>Excellent acting. Hardly ever over-dramatic or overbearing, as the first movie was. There was a sufficient amount of humor interspersed throughout.<br/><br/>Special effects and cinematography was very well done, but that's what Marvel prides themselves on, so it comes with no surprise. <br/><br/>Darker themed. I don't know why, but a less black and white good guys/bad guys movie, and that's what lessens the impact of other superhero movies. Adds flavor and intrigue.<br/><br/>Further character development. They finally touched on the importance of each team member, not putting each member in classes determined by their level of usefulness. Much more personal than the first.<br/><br/>The rest of the pros are fairly straightforward.<br/><br/>Cons - <br/><br/>What the heck was with the Bruce/Natasha romance? Very underdeveloped, and unnecessary.<br/><br/>Music was an afterthought. The score is not ominous nor powerful enough as, say, X-Men or Man of Steel. Disappointing...<br/><br/>Ultron was not the ultimate villain I dreamed he would be. Too superficial, and all humor on his part was in bad taste. Similar problem with Bane in The Dark Knight Rises. I just feel he could have been more menacing.<br/><br/>The plot in general was very unchanging the whole movie. One battle scene to another, with a little quiet in between. Finale felt less like a finale. Perhaps this feeling will dissipate after a few re- watches.<br/><br/>Hope I helped. Please see it for yourself, and take care."
"Ryoku_117","8","1","6","30 April 2015"," Disney why don't you better make stand ups?
","There's only one thing that really bothers me from Marvel and Disney working together, too many jokes. Like come one you can make any tension in the plot of the movie or add a some drama if you are only regretting what happened by forcing too many Jokes or cheesy puns as possible.<br/><br/>It was as an official let down for me, i was hopping for some serious and darker tones for the movie, but they never happened, i would totally say and agree that every time Ultron was in scene, i got goosebumps. Watching him on screen made me feel like this could be it, this could be the moment were the movie turn out to best, but it just didn't.<br/><br/>Too make things short, if you like your typical action and familiar movie just to have some fun and relax, This is the movie for you. But if you are hoping for a change and some more deeper and serious plot on Disney films, you can only wish that happens any time soon."

","This first review wont contain spoilers. So lets start right away. I am a huge Marvel/ DC Fan and I love what the Marvel Cinematic Universe did the last years. My expectations were of course very high. But to be honest I could not believe that it would be THAT mindblowing!For me this is the best Marvel Movie this far which will say something because I adored The Winter Soldier. Age of Ultron had everything a Fan would wish for. It was Fan Support from the first minute on. Joss Whedon created a masterpiece for the eye. And the wonderful thing here is that they connected brilliant visual effects and action spectacle with real character development for everyone. We get to know new amazing characters like Vision, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch, who will all blow you away in the best way there is. Wonderful for every fan. Could not have been better. Visually and storytelling a delight. <br/><br/>This second part will contain major spoilers. You have been warned :) So I wanted to speak about a few sequences in the movie. Because there were a thousand ones. I could go on forever. The scene where all Avengers are in Slo-Mo in there elements to protect the staff. Shivers. Really I nearly cried because it was so perfect. Then that we get to know Black Widows past was really important in my opinion and that they developed some characters more like Hawkeye and Bruce was the right thing to do. I could tell you million scenes that were great - Ultron was an amazing sarcastic villain who did not see his self as the villain which are often the scariest ones. Visually it was a delight watching everything. The only thing I think was a little bit sad was that they killed Quicksilver so early. I really liked him! But damn. Hands down the coolest character was by far Scarlet Witch. She just blew me away how amazing her abilities were wow!! So happy that she will be back in Civil War. And the Vision was great.. could have been so ridiculous but wasn't. Sooo this is just a short review. Saw it yesterday and couldn't stop thinking about it. It was for me a masterpiece.<br/><br/>And hey: if you do not like superhero movies - do not watch them. easy. And if I am now a fangirl for you. I don't care. I love it. I love the movie. Love the Avengers. Love Marvel. Easy. I am done."

"achyutha037","6","1","6","27 April 2015"," Awesome but kinda Disappointing *Spoiler free review*
","First of all, I am not a Marvel/DC fan-boy. I watch films of both MCU and DC movies. So lets get to the review. This will be a spoiler free review.<br/><br/>The movie has action right from the beginning, but those scenes are NOT at all memorable compared to Avengers 1 or Winter Soldier. For the first time(or maybe I am wrong), I have seen a Marvel movie not show some of the action scenes properly and was kinda blurry whenever there was an Iron man vs. Ultron fight. <br/><br/>Unlike Avengers 1, there are some really good emotional scenes in this movie for each and every Avenger. But I was really disappointed with the screen time Ironman/RDjr got in this movie. All he did was create ultron and later HM something similar to that. <br/><br/>Plot is good(for an Avengers movie), but the execution was not proper. I really don't blame Joss Whedon(He's a brilliant director) for it as he had too much pressure to outdo the first one and as we all know, it would have been difficult for any director to outdo his own masterpiece. <br/><br/>Highlight of the movie is easily the Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene. It surpassed my expectations and was really entertaining. That will compensate for the other *bad* action scenes(There are some REALLY bad action scenes in this movie).<br/><br/>Now lets get to the new characters/Avengers and the Antagonist- Ultron. Personally, I liked Ultron. But he was way underused. His plans are clichéd and are there just for the sake of the movie. But that doesn't mean he was not a good antagonist. Just saying that he could have been better. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver were good, but their superpowers were not explained properly(Especially Scarlett witch). But they were really good. *BUT* the movie would have been the SAME without their involvement and they had nothing much to do except for the first few scenes and the final battle of course. Final battle could have been worse but a special character saved it and I am sure each and every one of you will love that character.<br/><br/>Action: 8/10 A superhero movie must have some good action scenes and this movie delivers. Hulk vs. Hulkbuster scene steals the show, as expected. But the final battle is very similar to that of A1 and it is exhausting to see the SAME thing happening again and again. I really was hoping that it'll be a 10/10 when it came to Action sequences.<br/><br/>Plot: 7/10 Clichéd and very similar to the first Avengers movie. But, it was really entertaining and the concept of AI was good enough. So, I will give it a 7/10.<br/><br/>Characters: 9.5/10 This was the best part of this movie. The already familiar Avengers like Thor, Hawkeye, Cap and Black widow are well written in this movie. But the only complaint is that Iron man did not have enough screen-time. Ultron was good, Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver were better than expected.<br/><br/>Ending(Special mention): 10/10 Was quite emotional. Deserves the mention.<br/><br/>Overall: Trying to outdo Avengers, which was easily one of the best Superhero movies, led this movie into a somewhat clichéd attempt. But it delivered what was expected. Don't expect TOO much or disappointment is guaranteed. Just sit back and Enjoy. 7.5/10"
"dreamtakers","8","1","6","27 April 2015"," Another Splendid Score by Whedon
","Avengers: Age of Ultron casts a different mood from the first movie. Age of Ultron is significantly darker and grittier than 2012's Avengers, which has a funnier and lighter tone. The new enemy, Ultron, is actually a handiwork of Tony Stark. Ultron is a formidable machine with wicked dreams. To create a new and better world, Ultron believes human beings need to be sacrificed to give way to the birth of a new society. Age of Ultron sets movie goers on an emotional journey. The vulnerabilities of the valiant avengers were revealed in flashes and we get a better understanding of the characters' pasts and fears. We also see the avengers turning against each other in a moment of conflict and the strong bonds they formed on the verge of breaking. A particular avenger even thought of ""running away"" because he feels that he is a threat. Despite all the obstacles, they managed to put aside their differences and assemble as a team once again. In Cap's words, if they are going to defeat Ultron, they are going to do it ""together"".<br/><br/>Robert Downey Jr, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Mark Ruffalo and Jeremy Renner reprise their existing roles to perfection. Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye, who is somewhat a mystery in the last film, enjoys extensive screen time and character development in Age of Ultron. There are many sweet ""science bros"" moments between Tony Stark and Bruce Banner that are fun to watch. The unexpected romance between Natasha and Bruce caught me by surprise because there is no indication at all in the first movie. Nevertheless, it adds a warm touch to the movie. Newcomers Aaron Taylor-Johnson and Elizabeth Olsen are remarkable in their roles, playing Pietro (Quicksilver) and Wanda (Scarlet Witch), the Maximoff twins. Both of them share great chemistry as on-screen siblings. Wanda is an exciting character as she goes through so much regret and pain in this movie, and her powers is a force to be reckon with. James Spader totally nailed his performance as Ultron and Paul Bettany's role as Vision is outstanding as well. There are brief appearances by ex-boss Nick Fury, Maria Hill and Falcon, all doing their best to support the avengers team. As expected, there is no short of action, fight scenes and uber cool CGIs. The scene where the avengers stood in a circle and fought the enemies coming from all direction is pretty badass.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron has a few let downs. The movie sheds some funny tears, with sprinkle of one-liners and cheeky quips. The Thor hammer scenes and fight between The Hulk and the Hulkbuster Armor is hilarious. However, the humour appeal is certainly not on par as the latter. The first film is so effortlessly entertaining with its many comical moments (Loki vs Hulk, Hulk saves Iron Man) and priceless dialogues (Stark quoting Shakespeare, Loki's mewling quim). Sadly, Age of Ultron simply does not have the same effect as the first (One-liners aren't that funny). Character development is a tad lacking for the old characters besides Hawkeye. Too many characters perhaps? The ending also felt sort of anti-climatic. <br/><br/>Overall, Age of Ultron is a cinematic fest with a strong cast, decent storyline and loads of fancy action. It's still quite a good movie despite minor flaws. 7.8/10."

","Yeah, that's right, I just came back from this little masterpiece. Whedon is a genius. You don't even have to like superheroes or be in on all the lore and all that. This movie has got the original beat on every front. The writing is superb. The action is excellent and the cinematography is amazing. No shaky cams or anything like that. Plus lots of very clever humor. Forget the haters. It got a standing ovation and cheers. I'm still grinning an hour later. You are going to love it. Good times ahead so check it out! It's also worth mentioning that all the characters get there little moment in the spotlight. An impressive feat with such an assembly cast!"

"talizen","7","1","6","25 April 2015"," By far the best Marvel movie ever!!!
","Avengers 2 is well-made perfection. This is going to be so far the number 1 movie of 2015. The story is excellent with Tony Stark/Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.) creating Ultron (James Spader) for peacekeeping until he wants to destroy humanity. In the comics, Hank Pym/Ant-Man, was the one who created Ultron and wanted peace with the world until Ultron suddenly had a mind of his own to destroy the world. Joss Whedon knew what he was doing to work on the story, made a few changes that are not exactly right to the comics but it fits to the story. But it's stupid for Joss Whedon to make a love interest for Hulk (Mark Ruffalo) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) when we all know Hulk loves Betty Ross. I find it quite disappointing of Joss Whedon to kill off Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson) as I always thought he would appear in more Marvel films - very sad. It was cute to put in a Pinocchio reference when Ultron said he is free and have no strings on him. <br/><br/>With Ultron, I love the designs of him and his robot army and how he transforms in many forms and then he reached his final self. At first, I was hoping Ultron would have the comic look - the evil smile and eyes but this has surprised me with the great looks. The design of the Vision is unique especially having the correct colours. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver's costume only had ordinary clothes but the colours are like exactly like their comic book costumes although at the end of the movie Scarlet Witch has a proper costume.<br/><br/>To the Easter eggs, we all know soon due to Tony Stark creating Ultron and causing chaos, will cause problems between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers/Captain America (Chris Evans) for the next Marvel movie next year - Captain America: Civil War. A Black Panther Easter egg was mentioned when Bruce Banner said the name Wakanda (the home of Black Panther in Africa) while he was looking up this man named Ulysses Klaw (Andy Serkis) who may be the next villain for the Black Panther movie. <br/><br/>Now we come to the moment that leads to the third Avengers movie in 2 parts, the infinity stones. When Thor went into this water, I forgot it was called to get answers from the dream he had from Scarlet Witch. We saw the four infinity stones that were shown from the previous Marvel movies; the Tesseract which is the space gem, the Aether which is the reality gem, the Orb which is the power gem, and Loki's Sceptre which is the mind gem. So far we don't know where or what the other gems are but we'll know for sure in the future before Infinity War. In the mid-credits, I don't how but it's really exciting, Thanos (Josh Brolin) now has his hands on the infinity gauntlet getting ready to find the gems.<br/><br/>A lot of actors have quite small roles like when Sam Wilson/Falcon (Anthony Mackie) showed up at the party before the Avengers wanted to hold Thor's (Chris Hemsworth) hammer, and at the end with his new costume at the New Avengers Facility. Other actors as well like Idris Elba, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgård, etc. as well.<br/><br/>Sam Jackson's Nick Fury role is almost the same amount as Iron Man 2 but a bit bigger, for example - how he showed up in the middle of the movie to speak about things and towards the end. James Spader, how should I say it, his voice is fantastic as I predicted. Ever since he was cast to play Ultron, I always imagined what his voice would sound like since I saw him in the first trailer of his current TV series, The Blacklist. Paul Bettany who voices JARVIS finally comes on-screen as the Vision. He played the Vision very well. We always hear his voice in Iron Man 1-3 and the first Avengers movie but now we finally see on-screen for the first time as the comic book character all fans want to see – the Vision. It was very unexpected, surprising and funny that the Vision can hold Thor's hammer. Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are like actual brother and sister in real life which is very well-played and their European accents are really good. Jeremy Renner had a much bigger role now than the first film. Seems like a Joss Whedon wanted to focus on Hawkeye which includes Hawkeye's family.<br/><br/>Sometime before the film came out, I wasn't entirely sure how long will the film go. At first I thought that the duration would be 170 minutes or so which that would've been awesome but instead it went for 141 minutes. I found out that there might be an extended version for it so then I can see many extra scenes that were cut from the film and that way I can enjoy this one the most, more than the cinema version.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed Avengers: Age of Ultron, it was amazing. Marvel cannot stop getting better. Let see how great the other Marvel films will do to top this one."
"jamamaes","9","1","6","25 April 2015"," A must see at the cinema!
","I am a very big fan of Marvel and their films, they can hardly do wrong sometimes. I was skeptical at first thinking perhaps Age of Ultron would be a downfall in the franchise but I was very much mistaken. I really enjoyed this film from start to finish. I thought that at some point Marvel have to make a bad movie, this may come with Ant-Man later this year but not with this movie. <br/><br/>The story great with a balance between what is best for humanity and the world which Is a lot different than trying to conquer New York from the last movie. With an actual good Marvel Villain arguably since Loki, Ultron voiced by James Spader was excellent. The two new additions in the Maximoff brother and sister was really good to see that Marvel can add new characters that slot straight in. In fact loved all the new characters ones which I will not mention for spoilers. <br/><br/>For anyone wanting a new great marvel movie this is it, anyone want a great movie in general this is it. Watching it on the big screen is a must. Loved the movie."
"Troy_Campbell","8","1","6","24 April 2015"," Not as good as the first, but still hugely entertaining.
","Expectations couldn't have been higher for this mega-sequel. The first Avengers was absolutely amazing and the steady line of Marvel flicks up to this point, culminating in the glorious Guardians of the Galaxy, has been rock-solid. With so little wiggle room in its margin of error, it's not surprising that Age of Ultron doesn't quite reach the popcorn perfection it aims for. Without the near-unachievable comparisons weighing it down, however, this has everything you could ask for in a two-hour plus blockbuster (take note Transformers).<br/><br/>Packed to the rafters with action, director Joss Whedon and his team concoct a wide array of thrilling and inventive set pieces that are the undeniable drawcard for the movie. The enormous budget gives Whedon the licence to go crazy with his imagination and, with flawless CGI and judicious 3D effects, he leaves nothing in the tank. Opening with a Bond-esque, pre-title snowy assault that boasts a long, uncut shot featuring each Avenger getting their kickass on, Whedon rarely lets the pace slip for the remainder of the movie. Wisely though, he changes the focal characters of each skirmish, meaning we get increased Hawkeye and Black Widow action in addition to newbies Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver.<br/><br/>Speaking of fresh faces – because by now you know exactly what you get from the established players – the new kids on the blocks are a mixed bag. As tormented siblings Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver, Elisabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson are excellent, adding a dark and arrogant spark to their havoc reeking. The titular psycho-robot Ultron is conceptually brilliant and voiced with demented glee by James Spader, but is relatively one-note and can't fill the Loki-sized hole in the villainous department. Then there's a character (name withheld to avoid spoiling) introduced in the final act who is so silly and visually ill conceived it is mind-boggling he made the cut at all.<br/><br/>Narratively there are a few stumbling blocks as well, with Whedon's script feeling flimsy and like it's solely in service of propelling the Avengers to their next battle. Although he has absolutely nailed the irreverent humour yet again, sharing the comedy around with all and sundry. Stark is his normal, lovable arsehole (Quicksilver also edging into that domain), and Cap and Thor are the centre of some amusing out-of-time and out-of-place gags, yet the wise-cracking Hawkeye and the ultra-condescending Ultron are unexpected recipients of Whedon's most hilarious dialogue.<br/><br/>It might sit a few places down the Marvel Cinematic Universe totem pole thanks to a subpar plot and a truly awful new character, but Age of Ultron fires on all action and comedy cylinders required to make it a hugely entertaining superhero flick."

","Yes ! Expectations were way too high, being fortunate that it released in India among selected countries, a week earlier than the rest. thanks to the distribution houses. The Marvel-Disney joined together will rule the superhero industry has been proved again. It's obvious to compare a sequel from the last one. So this time, the movie is less comic, and more action, lots of action. And this time, the team has grown bigger than the last one, the only problem is next time, the justification of screen appearance.<br/><br/>The script writers have totally justified the story about what kind of super-villain will they need, although there were stuff you want to know how it happened but the pace of the movie doesn't gives you the chance to sink in the think,<br/><br/>Iron man, stood as the captain of the team, so yes he is everywhere in the movie, Hulk and Bruce, both of them gave a noticeable part, and as usual. You do miss Nick fury and SHIELD in this one. Thor was there and Captain America was negligible for me. Only there for killing and action,<br/><br/>Quicksilver not as enjoyable as X-Men: Days of the future past, and Scarlett witch was superb.<br/><br/>So the question is, as I said in the start, expectations were too high, so does it meet the expectation...?<br/><br/>Definitely, make sure not to miss this one...."

Has something to do with an AI that stark had created, which somehow came to life so to speak, with the most stupid personality, kind of a baddie with a bad sense of humour, something which just didn't go. The film didn't start with them all getting together again and finding out what they had been up too and how tony got all his tech back, no, started with them hunting Loki's staff . No mention of anything before that. It just made no sense all the way through, cgi nonsense. Best bit was Jarvis coming to life but that got boring after 10 minutes too and that is only because Paul Bethany is hot. Glad I rented for free and didn't buy it, it is really bad. So gutted and disappointed it is unreal. Worse than guardians of the galaxy and that was a terrible film, but I expected that to be terrible, I had higher hopes for this, maybe that was my fault?

"BigNadz89","8","1","7","8 July 2015"," Better than the first one
","You've seen the original, you've endured the countless standalone movies just so you won't be wondering ""who the heck is this guy"" when it comes to the inevitable Avengers movie. Now comes the latest installment from the studio that constantly serves you the same old dish every time, yet you keep coming back for more.<br/><br/>The Avengers are back! and they're bigger than ever, watch the movie open with a (well done) CGI fightfest where Whedon shows off the fantastic visuals of this summer blockbuster in an opening battle where the Avengers eliminate most of what's left of Hydra. <br/><br/>Meet Ultron, the robotic love child of Tony Stark and Bruce Banner who was created ""to maintain peace"" so Tony and his friends can have a break from saving the world. Now Ultron (perfectly voiced by James Spader) becomes self aware and (rightfully) decides that the biggest threat to peace, is humanity itself. Naturally declaring war on the whole of mankind. The Avengers have a problem with this, thus starting the Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>The Avengers (as overrated as it was) was actually a good movie, but it had a lot of stuff going for it. It was the first time they would team up after all those solo movies. It featured the fan favourite Loki as the villain. They had been leading up to it since the first Iron Man film, so it was highly anticipated. In the end the movie did well for many reasons but the main one being that it was the first time these characters would be on screen together.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron didn't have that going for it, not like the first one did, so they had a more difficult job to tell an interesting story because the novelty of the Avengers assembling has worn off. So did it succeed? Well for the most parts yes. The action scenes were beautiful to watch, moreso than the first (the writers clearly learned from the action scenes from Man of Steel) The story is mostly easy to follow (bar the random out of place scenes where Thor has visions that reference future Marvel movies) It is a very interesting story except for a few scenes, for example there is a short section of the movie where Hawkeye decides to take The Avengers to his farm house where we are treated to a few pointless scenes with Hawkeye and his random family (that serves no purpose whatsoever, but was only put in the movie because Whedon feels guilty about not having enough Hawkeye scenes in the first movie) <br/><br/>The movie gets back into the action after these scenes and keeps the momentum going. Another part of the story is the forced romance between Black Widow and Bruce Banner/Hulk. Now who doesn't love a bit of romance in a superhero movie? In a standalone movie this would have been absolutely fine. However this isn't just an ordinary movie now is it? it's an Avengers movie! where there are so many characters that hardly anyone gets enough screen time as it is. So throwing in a forced romance story (that had no previous forshadowing or back story whatsoever as much as the blind fanboys say otherwise) really takes something away from the otherwise almost perfect story.<br/><br/>The feminists came running accusing the movie of being ""sexist"" and ""anti feminist"" bar a few sex jokes there is absolutely nothing sexist about this film and the feminists didn't have a leg to stand on. All the characters were treated with respect and represented perfectly (some given abit too much respect, see what I wrote about Hawkeye) And how can I forget about the Maximoff twins! Both are portrayed by amazing actors and their journey of starting off as villains but becoming heroes is a well done one.<br/><br/>The film sticks to the usual Marvel formula. Explosions and jokes, the explosions are done amazingly well but the jokes fall flat depending on your age and type of sense of humour. The usually quick and witty Tony Stark makes silly sex jokes and other jokes that really are just dumbed down. There is a scene (early on) where Tony ""swears"" and Captain America says ""Language"" and this begins an running gag in the movie where everyone is like ""oh don't swear in front of Captain"" this joke might get a giggle at first but it gets old so fast that you just cringe whenever it is referenced to (throughout the film) Ultron is treated to a sort of dark sense of humour (and occasionally quotes random Disney songs) however it works on him (mostly because of James Spaders amazing delivery) There are references and easter eggs to other Marvel characters just to excite your inner geek, which are done well also. There are some themes covered in this film. Morality isn't really one of them, I mean it is briefly touched on but lets face it, this is the Marvel world. And there are no real consequences to anything. The viewer is treated to several scenes where The Avengers are shown saving individual people rather stopping the main threat that is killing hundreds at the exact same time. There are no real consequences for Tony Stark creating a self aware robot that almost wiped out humanity, but like I said, it's a happy fantasy world. But then again it's nice sometimes to live in a world that isn't as dark as the world that we live in.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is fantastic. With action scenes and cinematography that you would expect from a Marvel movie. The story is interesting for the most part and you will leave the cinema satisfied with this experience, but part of you will be wanting more which is why you will sit through the end credits waiting for that 2 minute scene which teases you until the next Marvel release. It's a good movie, make sure you check it out!"
"Necroambulant","9","1","7","6 June 2015"," Marvel Keeps Getting Better
","Avengers: Age of Ultron was an excellent movie. I would absolutely recommend taking the time to see it, especially if you happen to be a fan of the Marvel movies that have been released to date.<br/><br/>I've seen a lot of mixed reviews, the complaints mostly focusing on the fact that there was a lot of story and a great deal of activity shoved into a package that was just shy of two and a half hours. Maybe it's because I spent a lot of my life reading comic books, but I didn't feel at all like the narrative was rushed or unevenly paced at all. Personally I felt that there was a terrific balance between well choreographed action and well-written character development...though I might have liked to see a little bit more of the story dedicated to The Vision, Scarlet Witch, and Quicksilver depending on how it was managed. The introduction of those three characters was fantastic though, and I thoroughly loved the change in dynamics that they forced upon the existing Avengers.<br/><br/>One of the other negative things that I saw frequently expressed was disdain for the segment of the movie that took place on Hawkeye's farm, with the introduction of a secret life that only he, Black Widow, and Fury were previously aware of. I couldn't disagree more with those who complained about that bit of story arc, or any of the other sections of the movie that focused on fleshing out the characters who haven't had the benefit of multiple movies establishing the more human, non-hero sides to them.<br/><br/>Ultron was handled better than I went into the movie expecting, AI is always a bit touchy for me because it is handled so poorly in almost all cases. Ultron, however wasn't necessarily an AI, not in the sense that The Vision was at least, basically amounting to little more than a trap waiting for an individual or society technologically advanced enough to assemble it. The results would likely have been the same or at least similar if Hydra had completed the project instead of Banner and Stark doing so, the only real aspect of Ultron that was provided by Stark was the name and a sort of substrate into which the AI was dumped. I get the feeling that people who claimed that the character arc was basically little more than an AI being created, accessing the internet, and deciding that humanity was something that needed to be eradicated weren't paying altogether too much attention to the fact that the AI template for Ultron was already present, within the Mind Gem, and Tony was essentially stealing that blueprint and hoping to embed it into his Ultron project...at least that was what I gathered from the dialogue between he and Banner.<br/><br/>I honestly didn't see any of the flaws that I heard people complaining about at all, and I loved the movie. I don't know that I would trust anyone claiming to have liked it more than Guardians of the Galaxy, but it comes a close second to that as far as the Marvel cinematic universe is concerned, edging just ahead of Captain America: The Winter Soldier as my second favorite of these movies.<br/><br/>I tried to avoid any spoilers, but some tiny ones were necessary in order to counter the criticisms I've been reading from those who disliked the movie or at least aspects of it. Ultimately you're going to have to make up your own mind though, see the movie (if you haven't already), and decide for yourself whether it was great or just good...I am leaning towards great."

","I saw it today. I may have been a little late to see it since it was released on May 1st, but at least I didn't miss it.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film was a little enjoyable and watchable, but it could've had better writing. The story is just not the most original because its like Tony Stark/Iron man creates ultron, it turns out ultron is bad, and the avengers must defeat him. Most of the action scenes are fun, but a couple are a little meaningless. The effects and scenery are still great. As for the characters, Ultron, the villain is well written, but not as great as Loki. The odd thing is that Tony Stark/Iron man is like the main character in an avengers film. Luckily, the other super heroes do get enough time on screen, but if there were TOO MUCH focus on Tony Stark/Iron man, it would be something like a 4th installment to the Iron man series. The Avengers were pretty much assembled the whole time, and Nick Fury only appears for a maximum of 10 minutes. The ending wasn't all that great, either. The effects are great as always, but the writing needs work.<br/><br/>7/10"
"evanobrien100","6","1","7","6 June 2015"," Overstuffed, undercooked, disjointed but enjoyable
","Where to begin? It really is a massive credit to Joss Whedon that this isn't a complete disaster. There have been reports that give the impression that the film nearly killed him and I can bloody well shows!<br/><br/>If the gigantic cast of characters and plethora of plot lines didn't break his creative back then it definitely herniated a few discs and strained a few muscles. There are SO many characters and SO much going on that the movie felt like a massive traffic jam that had to be navigated on the way to Phase Three of the MCU.<br/><br/>You can feel that Whedon on many occasions tried make it as personal a film for him as he possibly could. However, You can also sense the despondent torment he must have felt throughout the movie. On more than one occasion, it was noticeable that a scene or a sequence was written at a point of pure creative and artistic hopelessness. That's scary! Whedon deserves to take a very long vacation and then make a very self-indulgent low-budget art-house film after this.<br/><br/>With so much going on and so many character to keep track of doesn't come without its drags. It's a film that ultimately comes out as overstuffed and a tad undercooked. It was entertaining nevertheless. The bright spots from the first Avengers movie are all there with a whole new, darker more sinister escapade in tow. James Spader's Ultron came off as a bit of a naff and cartoony antagonist compared to Hiddleston's Loki in the previous instalment. The surface level philosophising is fairly obligatory and mirrors the same level of politicising that was in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>AOU could have done with an extra half an hour on to its running time with a few scenes altered slightly to make it a more satisfying experience on the whole. I didn't feel any particular plot line of the many that were included came off with as much grace or ease as they could have. Overall, a rollicking good time albeit a headache- inducing one."

","A movie is only as good as its villain, which makes sense because that is what our heroes have to unite against. Loki as the villain in ""The Avengers"" was fantastic, but in this film, Ultron is underdeveloped.<br/><br/>It's a great idea, but more time seemed to be devoted to other things than to really focus on what makes this thing tick. More over, the addition of more characters – specifically Quicksilver and the Scarlet Witch, but also a general slate of thugs who come and go – seems a bit too crowded. There's already so many good guys in this film that the trap of superhero sequels to increase the villain number just sends the story all over the place here.<br/><br/>Then there's the action. These sequences are, as expected, top notch. You have fantastic special effects and some really innovative stuff happening from the visual side of things. However, there's a generic feel to these moments. Where the action set-pieces of the first film seem distinct and different from one another, you could practically edit together these moments throughout ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" even when they happen on entirely different continents, and nothing would look any different.<br/><br/>Add the fact the movie has a washed-out palate, which I suppose does distinguish it from the first film's bright and colorful look. Unfortunately, this contributes to the heroes getting lost in a cloud of punching and falling rubble that could be from any point in the film.<br/><br/>Of course, all of these complaints does not mean ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is a dud of a film. It's still a really fun Marvel superhero movie. It's good, but it's just not crap-your-pants awesome like the first film was. And that's a shame because the string of films between these ""Avengers"" installment have been significantly better than Phase 1 in my eyes.<br/><br/>But yeah, you get to see all your favorite heroes again. You get to see the Avengers try to pick up Thor's hammer. You get to see one of the best Stan Lee cameos out there. You get to see the ""Infinity War"" teased throughout the film. You get to see Hulk smash.<br/><br/>I can't say that I didn't like ""Avengers: Age of Ultron."" I'm sure I will see it again, and watching it in IMAX 3D is still an experience (though I'll reiterate that I wish the color had popped more, but maybe we'll just have to wait until VideoLab gives it the color- correcting treatment they recently gave ""Man of Steel"").<br/><br/>I'm just a bit disappointed in what I got from ""Avengers: Age of Ultron,"" similar how ""Godzilla"" was a come-down from ""Pacific Rim"" or ""Star Trek Into Darkness"" didn't quite have the punch that ""Star Trek"" did. I'm sure when I see ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" again, whether it be during its theatrical release or on Blu-ray, I'll feel better about the whole experience. However, until then, I'll have to cross my fingers for when ""Ant Man"" comes out in a couple months for my Marvel fix."

","Today I took my niece to see Avengers: Age of Ultron the movie we waited for and had talk about for weeks and weeks and today on opening day we saw and it is one of the best films I have seen ever on the big screen. It was made special because I was with my niece.<br/><br/>And I am going to keep this spoiler free because this is a film where you have to see it twice to take it all in. Avengers Age of Ultron gives you everything you would want in a Marvel movie and then some.<br/><br/>The plot this time centers around the Avengers Iron-Man (Robert Downey Jr), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner AKA Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America (Chris Evans), Natasha Romanoff/Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Clint Barton/Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) are now up against a new threat a new villain named Ultron (Played by James Spader) along with having to deal with Scarlet Witch (Played by Elizabeth Olsen) and her twin brother Quicksilver (Played by Aaron Taylor-Johnson).<br/><br/>The film is pack with characters from the Marvel Cinematic Universe as Cobie Smulders, Hayley Atwell, Stellan Skarsgard, Idris Elba, Anthony Mackie, Don Cheadle, Samuel L Jackson and many others reprise their roles for the film and of course cameo with Stan Lee. <br/><br/>Now this film has a lot to live up to considering it's following in the footsteps of the other Marvel Movies that have begin with The Avengers but lucky in my opinion the sequel shows how you can make it a strong champion in the Marvel Universe.<br/><br/>The film balance out as you are getting many characters from Marvel into one. Plus the film brought a lot to the table this time.<br/><br/>And I found the humor in this film to be superb as everyone in the theater laugh that it almost got a round of applause, I mean they really did a good job with making you laugh.<br/><br/>When the action scenes happen you are on the edge of your seat, they brought their A-Game for the film with the wild stunts and superb action scenes.<br/><br/>The cast of the film does a grand job with their performance James' take of Ultron really surprised me as well as Elizabeth who I enjoy as Scarlet Witch, of course the original cast did their part and help tell the story of the film where you can feel their emotions from their characters that we know and love.<br/><br/>The Effects for this movie are really good and will take your breath away. Music, I know I always talk about the music in motion pictures but to me if you have the music you got the film since music is as much apart of the movie as the cast and crew are, lucky the music in the film is top notch as you would expect nothing less from Avengers.<br/><br/>There is just so much going for this film that you would be a fool to miss this one everything about this sequel makes it a strong consider for the box office and to become one of the biggest movies of the year. <br/><br/>With story telling, superb special effects, strong acting, humor and intense action scenes you will not be disappointed. There are no strings on me<br/><br/>I give Avengers: Age Of Ultron an 9 out of 10<br/><br/>And for Gosh's Sake Watch Your Language"
"Zanman720","9","1","7","1 May 2015"," A Must Watch for Movie Fans.
","THE PLOT WILL NOT BE PROVIDED IN THIS REVIEW! SOME MINOR SPOILERS INCLUDING CONTENTS OF THE MOVIE WILL BE PROVIDED, BUT OVERALL IT WILL REVEAL NOTHING BIG ABOUT THE MOVIE! That Being Said...<br/><br/>In a modern day society where super hero movies are running rampant, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" was among the top of the list for most anticipated movie of 2015.<br/><br/>Well, i'm here to tell you that it didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Age of Ultron was not only the Action packed, witty comedy filled masterpiece that you'd expect...but rather padded up past mistakes by adding more to character development. That's right, where as the first Avengers left more to be desired (Mainly with Black Widow and Hawkeye), Age of Ultron would pick up the pieces and develop all characters. A hint of back story is provided as well as molding of personalities, and character Growth. Chemistry building amongst comrades was a huge part of this movie for me...especially in Action scenes.<br/><br/>Action Scene buffs will not be disappointed. This movie is filled to the brim with classic fight scenes...two standouts include the fighting chemistry between Captain America and Thor, whom truly become a tag team to be reckoned with in this movie as they use each other's attacks to pile on attacks of their own. Some of the stuff they came up with for these two is simply brilliant. Also, The Action Scene in which Ironman tries to subdue Hulk is among the greatest i've seen in recent Movie Memory.<br/><br/>On top off all the development and action are hidden multiple comic book easter eggs, that sort of nudge all the comic book fans and give them that extra excitement. Multiple stories within stories begin to form as well, constantly calculating and setting up for the future marvel movies to come. <br/><br/>And to capitalize on the final thing, but not too much. Ultron was simply brilliant. Trailers depicted him as an emotionless Robot, but Ultron's witty and sarcastic personality brought all of the elements in this movie together. His character growth and change throughout the movie kept you guessing as to just what he'd do next. <br/><br/>Definitely a Movie that is high on my recommendation. A must watch for any comic book fan and one that only adds more prestige to this already anticipated series."
"stevendbeard","9","1","7","1 May 2015"," Great Action-Packed Sequel
","I saw ""Avengers:Age of Ultron"", starring Aaron Taylor-Johnson- Godzilla_2014, the Kick-Ass movies; Elizabeth Olsen-Godzilla_2014, Oldboy; Paul Bettany-Priest, The Da Vinci Code and the voice of James Spader-The Blacklist_tv, Boston Legal_tv.<br/><br/>This is the second Avengers movie, following the 2012 inauguration, and with more to follow. All of the original members are reunited and there are some new faces, on both the good and the bad sides. Aaron plays Quicksilver and Elizabeth is his sister, the Scarlet Witch. James voices the villain, Ultron while Paul, who has previously voiced Jarvis, is now the Vision. Like most movie adaptations, there are differences here from the books. No mention of the Magneto connection to Aaron & Elizabeth-here they were created by Hydra experiments. Hank Pym created Ultron-in the books-but here he is created by Tony Stark. As long as the story is good, I don't think some changes here and there are that big of a deal; I just consider it is taking place in an alternate universe from the books. Anyway, basically James wants to eliminate the human species and the Avengers want to stop him. Aaron and Elizabeth are taken in by James, at first, but soon see the error of their ways and decide to switch sides to become card carrying members of the Avengers. One of the things that I enjoyed-besides the usual fisticuffs and super heroic action packed battle scenes- was the equal time that the characters had spent on their private lives. One of the Avengers was even shown to have a family, including a wife and kids. Don't get me wrong, the super hero action is fantastic, with some great battles of heroes vs other heroes, as well as heroes vs the bad guys and there is lots of humorous dialogue, to keep things from becoming too dark. Stan Lee makes his usual cameo appearance, as well as a few heroes from earlier movies. There is a death of an Avenger-and it does look like it is supposed to be permanent, but who knows. There is a scene as the end credits start- involving the Infinity gems-but the only thing at the very end is a little note that says, 'The Avengers Will Return.' It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence & destruction, sci-fi action and some language and has a running time of 2 hours & 21 minutes. I think this one is a worthy sequel and is in fact, better than the first one. I would definitely buy this one on Blu-Ray."
"JulianTheIronManMintz","9","1","7","1 May 2015"," Thank you Joss Whedon!!
","When you have a movie that's so universally beloved as its predecessor, how do you follow that up? Simply put, you make a movie that's funnier, more human, and more challenging, and not just for the characters on screen, but for we the audience as well.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron provides two big ""meals"" to ""digest""- one for the eyes (a visual masterpiece filled with special effects that add meaning to the picture, and thankfully not just noise), and one for the mind, where questions and challenges that'll linger with you long after the credits roll.<br/><br/>'Should we ever try to stop wars before they start?' 'Should we ""meddle"" with artificial intelligence?' 'What happens if intelligent robots decide that humans are obstacles, not tools, to making the world a better place?' And those we're just cherries on the icing.<br/><br/>Whedon's Avengers are more cooperative in the sequel than the original, but that doesn't mean they agree all the time. Captain America, for example, having lived through World War II, is strongly against wars of all kinds — he just wants to go home. Tony Stark, on the other hand, with his Iron Man suit and endless technological resources, believes he has the power to prevent future wars, but that involves creating weapons that occasionally backfire, like his Ultron.<br/><br/>Taking stances on these big issues is inherent to The Avengers' various personalities, and it's another big reason why the film exceeds the original.The characters are much more opinionated, more human, and therefore likable. Some of the film's quieter moments offer glimpses into these characters we've never seen before and it helps us understand why they're heroic, not just super powered.<br/><br/>The film is, in general, much funnier than previous Marvel films, too, and up to par with Guardians of the Galaxy in terms of jerky humor, particularly when it comes to dialogue. This is where Whedon really shines: Banter feels realistic but screwbally at the same time, which helps keep the film fresh throughout its 2 and a half hour run time. And btw Jeremy Renner's Hawkeye is a very particular standout.<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't to say the movie is perfect. It's quite disjointed at times, and some characters leave you wanting more, and not really in a good way. But by and large, this film is a major accomplishment, in it's well-paced and never boring, consistently funny, and offers plenty of references to past and future movies for Marvel fans to gobble up. And with so much going on, this should make it ideal for multiple viewings.<br/><br/>Imo, Ultron is a masterful film that feels jam-packed without being overwhelming. There's plenty of action, but the action sequences are used as tools to keep the film moving forward, and an added bonus the film thankfully never takes itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Between acting, the clever and brilliant writing, the visuals, and its importance as a bridge to phase 3 of the MCU, Whedon has of course pulled it off again with a strange, funny, horrifying, and passionate love letter to Earth's Mightiest Heroes, that, to me, is even better than the first. one in 2012."
"ericrnolan","9","1","7","1 May 2015"," Avengers Assemble  Again!!! (SPOILERS!)
","(WARNING: THIS POST CONTAINS SPOILERS FOR ""THE AVENGERS: AGE OF ULTRON."") Fun, fun, fun! Earth's Mightiest Heroes roar back onto the screen with nearly all of the action, humor and spectacle of the wonderful original — I would give ""The Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (2015) a 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>It's got everything that you could ask for in a superhero movie, including another great villain in the form of James Spader's ""Ultron,"" beautifully animated by CGI. A surprise standout was Elizabeth Olsen as the Scarlet Witch. She's a great young actress whose work I really liked in 2011's terribly under-appreciated horror-thriller, ""Silent House."" She's got perfect line delivery. I'd love to see future Avengers films include her in the lineup, so that she can trade quips with Tony Stark.<br/><br/>There's some great writing — the backstory for the twins was suitably dark, and was a perfect motive for a hatred of Stark. The banter might not be as funny as the first film, but was still quite good. And there's some nice thematic continuity with Marvel's planned ""Civil War"" storyline.<br/><br/>The movie falls short of perfection with the occasional misstep. For example, the flashbacks/hallucinations that various characters suffer were clumsy, overdone, and sometimes befuddling. Compare them with similar scenes in movies like ""12 Monkeys"" (1995) or ""Donnie Darko"" (2001), or well made television shows like ""LOST."" Captain America's worst fear is some lame ""The war is over"" existential bullshit? No. Cap is supposed to be the personification of freedom and democracy — his worst nightmare would be a totalitarian state. Or an undead Bucky. Or better yet, being a man out of time, it would be the loss of his friends, his family and his true love.<br/><br/>A key conversation between two key characters at the end about mankind's future is just a little too depressing for an Avengers movie. Also a little sad? The suggestion that the team's lineup would change. Our existing roster is terrific — the fan's love 'em and I believe all the actors are under contract. If it ain't broke, don't fix it.<br/><br/>Postscript: this movie is interesting because it shows the same superhero starring in competing film franchises. Aaron Taylor- Johnson's ""Quicksilver"" is the very same Marvel Comics' speedster we see played (and scripted with much more fun) last year by Evan Peters in ""X-Men: Days of Future Past."" (There simply referred to as ""Maximoff,"" for copyright considerations, I guess.)<br/><br/>https://ericrobertnolan.wordpress.com/"
"caleb-676-79108","9","1","7","1 May 2015"," Ignore the buzz kill, snob critics who live with their moms
","Seems like as soon as this movie came out all the arm chair critic wanna-be's get on here and start giving it 1 star. Have people forgot how to have fun, it's a superhero movie not Shakespeare in the park. I've read comics my whole life, I know the comic version of this story very well, but I didn't care they made changes. Comics can tell a much broader story than a movie can. This movie packs a punch. It's funny, tons of action, the fights were amazing, and I had goose bumps several times.<br/><br/>I won't give any spoilers but Vision is the bomb. Loved his character. Sit back, enjoy the movie, and take in all the visuals and story telling. We know the characters pretty well by now so it won't be as deep in character development as some were wanting, and they have to introduce Ultron fairly quickly, but it still works and punches you right in the fun button."
"ktcam411","8","1","7","1 May 2015"," Stunning fights and darker problems
","Being an incredibly passionate Marvel Universe fan, I went into Avengers: Age of Ultron with expectations extremely high; the first film was near perfect in my opinion, so I was ecstatic to see what Whedon would have in store for the second. The very first thing that stuck out to me was the stunning fight choreography-they really stepped up their game in this one and added a lot of incredible team moves. There is a moment when all of the Avengers (+ Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver) are standing in a circle protecting the core, and the camera moves around each of them in slow motion as they are fighting, creating the most breathtaking and exciting scene in the entire movie. The characters in this film are more angry, conflicted, and complex. Scarlet Witch shows each Avenger their greatest fear, and the results are chilling. We see Black Widow's haunting past as well as a little bit of Captain America's PTSD-both add emotion and depth to the characters. Despite a cheesy, eye-roll worthy love-interest plot between Banner and Romanov, I enjoyed seeing the characters' hearts ripped out a little bit. Despite the vast changes from the comics as far as Ultron and Vision's origins, the movie was compelling, exciting, and stunning. James Spader's Ultron was flawless and chilling-easily my favorite part. The movie sets a brilliant stage for the next phase in the Marvel universe-Thor discovers the ""big picture"" plan to seize the Infinity Stones and it's clear that things will get NUTS. Overall, it was solid, but not quite as perfect as the first."
"needlightspeed-619-32884","10","1","7","30 April 2015"," If I read the other reviews as if I wrote them . . .
","A neg review made me want to write a pos review . . . <br/><br/>it said, 'Avengers 2 AOU was meh and unremarkable...'<br/><br/>-then said, 'it was another soul less comic book movie...'<br/><br/>I don't remember many comic books having 'a soul'(besides your basic story line arcs that contained a character with a soul.), so I think it deserves more credit than this one negative reviewer gave it.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the 3D version as much as any other big budget hit with specs required to get the full effect. (I actually plan on going to IMAX for Star Wars:TFA)<br/><br/>Without a spoiler this would not be as fun: Thor has a lot of ego while not explaining why the hammer can not be wielded by any other hands but his own. Then another hand not his own (near the end battle scene) surprisingly hands it off right to him. The character is not known to me by name but I will only say that it was sort of Thor's kin, so it actually made sense but he shrugged it off as tho it was a sign from the gods that the new hero could be trusted now. Yay! It is a pleasant twist at a time in the plot where 'a twist' is most worthy."

I watched this with my friends. and everyone in the theater was happy when movie ends. action are unbeatable. Only disspointing thing is tat Loki is not shown in movie. but things storyline, action, cinematography are amazing. and it made me speechless. starting scene with slow motion was superb.. i sat there with jaw open. completely entertaining and mind blowing . please do watch this movie.. watch with ur family and friends and have fun. it is suitable for witing top 30 of IMDb."
"MattBrady099","5","1","7","25 April 2015"," A great start to the summer movie season
","Ultron: ""There are no strings on me!"".<br/><br/>The story to The Avengers: Age of Ultron is about Tony Stark jumpstarts a dormant peacekeeping program, things go awry and Earth's Mightiest Heroes, including Iron Man, Captain America, Thor, The Incredible Hulk, Black Widow and Hawkeye, are put to the ultimate test as they battle to save the planet from destruction at the hands of the villainous Ultron.<br/><br/>You had no idea how excited I was for Age of Ultron even after the chilling and dark looking teaser trailer we got back in October last year. The teaser trailer looked really dark and so dead serious and I know that's a thing with Marvel films today that they making they own films look dark and gritty but it's comedy, I have no idea why they do that but anywhere I was hooked. The villain Ultron was another reason for me to get excited for the movie as ""There are no strings on me"", thing I never thought it would be so creepy. After seeing the movie I can say that Age of Ultron is a great start to summer movies and a lot of fun to watch.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon had spoken out saying ""This was the hardest movie he ever worked on"", and I clearly see the effort and hard work put into this movie. Joss had a lot of things in his hands while making this movie and that's it's characters, story, action and it's brilliant sense of humor, and it payed off well. Joss Whedon did a great job directing this movie as he put in enough energy and to entertain everyone.<br/><br/>James Spader as the villain Ultron is pretty much what I already expected for the most part but these a lot of surprises to his character like his sense of humor and how self aware he is about everything around him and I think it worked and fitted him very well. James Spader pretty much dose Raymond 'Red' Reddington from The Blacklist and I'm not saying that in a negative way but more of a good thing. Marvel isn't doing such a great job with villains and I'm not talking about Loki I mean in Thor: The Dark World, Iron Man 2 and Guardians of the Galaxy all have weak villains but Ultron was awesome and I'm happy his character wasn't like the other villains in those three movies I just named. Great work James Spader.<br/><br/>The visual effect's were pretty damn good, the Avengers themselves are once again brilliant as we remember them.<br/><br/>Now for problems: Black Widow and Bruce Banner or Hulk have a love triangle in this movie and it really doesn't work at all. They chemistry wasn't there and there was no build up to it, I would like to see Captain American or Haweye have relationship with her as she as better chemistry with those two, it would have made more sense since she's been with Captain America and Haweye more times than Banner.<br/><br/>I feel that the movie didn't really set up the Civil War story in the next Marvel movie with Iron Man and Captain America against each other. I know a couple of times those two would get into a little fight but they quickly shake it off and moved on, it's a small little nick pick I have and I know it wouldn't effect everyone else but I just saying the Civil War story should have been set up a little bit.<br/><br/>Overall The Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great start to the summer movie season. I had a great time watching this movie, I never got bored, all the characters had they screen time and it was funny and entertaining, the villain I thought was great and the action scenes was very enjoyable."

","here are 11 points to say the 11th marvel avengers installment is a home run again. 1.joss whedon did a great direction with equal importance to every char. 2.awesome comic humor. 3. pure quality of comic flavor great origins and perfect balance of back stories to every chars. this excludes tony stark as he had many installments . 4.ultron and vision .their creation in a given amount of time without any clichés. 5.all the avengers assemble during the fight their communication and humor. 6.maximoff twins really great climatic change in avengers is being introduced. 7.new team of avengers lead by captain America wohooooo. 8.the infinity stones story ,which got packed in a very healthy way. 9.C.G.I and action .it is nothing like transformers age of extinction.It is a quality product. 10.It has got a great darker moment.the way they save the people .one liners,jokes that are very human. 11.science nerds will love the way they utilized the science fiction. There are 3 points which would not make people like this movie as much as they did the first one. 1.quicksilver .Let down he may have got best time but,the fox and Disney contracts made him commercial .Which set him apart from comic taste. 2.rushed up story lines,rushed up wanda's emotional break down. 3.death of ultron .It was man joss you should have made him see more darker .but,every one's got the restrictions ,he simply made the best out of the time being provided. 9.0/10."
"shivamt25","7","1","7","25 April 2015"," Liked the first one more.....disappointed.
","Lets start with all the good things, all the treats that this movie brought us because no doubts there are plenty of them. Stark tries to jump start a peacekeeping mission and something unexpected happened and now avengers have to deal with it.<br/><br/>Movie starts with a bang. Avengers are all set for a mission and they are jumping their and dodging this and all that and 'the twins' are introduced. Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver played by Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor Johnson respectively. <br/><br/>I must say this new addition is really exciting, not only in this movie, but i am waiting for more involvement of them in future avenger projects, despite of such an enormous star cast. <br/><br/>Now one by one let us talk about the director and the actors. Joss Whedon, he is a genius, or was, i don't know, all i know is i liked Firefly very much and this movie, i don't think it can compete with that, but what i was disappointed to see that as the movie proceeds it executes a very good story, also long, in a very easy going way. It does not have any of that charm that the first installment had. Also there are too many one liners, you know those sarcastic dialogues given to the actors (mostly to Downey Jr.) where they expect small laughs from the audience. I mean they were good in the first one but really used here over the limit. But no problem with the direction business. Its just when i hear Joss Whedon, i think of something that is perfect for me, this movie isn't.<br/><br/>Now Robert Downey Jr. is again in his best form, nobody can deny that when he is there, only he is there. The story around iron man is not so exciting though.<br/><br/>Chris Evan made an impression. There was a small portion about Captain America's past and his choices for his present, that i liked very much. <br/><br/>Mark Ruffalo seemed tired, mainly because he turned green for a long time in this movie, but his screen sharing with Scarlet Johansson was okay. Scarlet was sexy as always with some really great action moves. <br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth has some important part to play with which he did justice. <br/><br/>Jeremy Renner was really looking good when standing with all those superheroes, i mean in the first he was almost insignificant.<br/><br/>Elizabeth and Quicksilver were good, but their role was too small, they almost weren't looking that special, nor was Paul Bettany, i am a huge fan by the way, but seeing his suddenly appearing as a very important character felt forced. <br/><br/>The movie was good, i gave it 8 right, but the thing is i gave the previous Avengers a 9. I missed the thrill that was there all the time in that film, maybe because it was a new concept and now when this is a follow up, it isn't looking so exciting."
"muvi-fan-73","7","1","7","24 April 2015"," with that budget, could have been much better.
","The movie is about creating a machine named ultron, which can take the place of avengers in the long run. The idea is nurtured basically by Tony Stark and supported by Bruce Banner. The machine ultron, defies its purpose but in the process a character 'vision' is bought into existence.<br/><br/>pros: we get to see ample lot of new avengers, love between 2 soldiers(black widow n Bruce), team-work, family love of a committed soldier(Hawkeye), positive ending.<br/><br/>cons: an avenger is killed(sadly the one with lot of potential). unnecessary fight between Hulk n Iron-man(Jarvis is killed, internet is taken over.. yet stark has full access to his suit.. a special one.. which altogether demonstrates f**k*d logic, as he says in first movie We have hulk), man capable of building Jarvis requires a stone to build something they are not clear about, and it requires two of them to build something that has 'faulty' vision's.<br/><br/>I personally felt the part where Thor connects with his thingy to have been more exposed, crashing buildings, entire city getting displaced in air all defining unnecessary, unpleasant visuals is shown."
"TheOneThatYouWanted","7","1","8","17 April 2016"," Better than I remember
","This is my second time watching it. The first time I watched it, I liked it but found Ultron a little annoying and weak. Anyway, let me review this old a$$ movie. The film is overall entertaining. Scarlett Johansson is eye candy but a horrible actress and now that she is older and not as hot, she is just a liability. Her acting takes you out of the film, her origin story and her dumb romance with the Hulk make the film drag. I hope Marvel does give her a solo film just so people will finally realize what I've known for years. Anyway, the action in this film is off the hook. Did I really just say off the hook? Sh!t, it is too early in the morning to be reviewing this movie. I just want to get this done so I can log out of here and go do sh!t. Anyway, this film is better than I thought it was. When I first watched it back when it first came out I ranked it about a 7/10. Now I'm giving it a 7.3/10. Probably because BvS sucked so bad. I have high hopes for Civil War."

","Age of Ultron, like most of the Marvel films, was absolutely fantastic. The combination of action, progression of the already intriguing story arc and character development, special effects, and humor make for a great viewing experience. I thought the additions of the new characters were executed well and Whedon somehow managed once again to give every character their fair share of screen time. There were only really two disappointments I had with the movie at both happened in the very end. The first is that there was zero integration with the Agents of SHIELD television show. I thought that final scene where they're introducing the ""new team"" would've been the perfect opportunity to at least have a Colson cameo at the minimum. The other scene was when SHIELD came in at the end for support at Falcon was nowhere to be seen. Sorry but that would've been the perfect time to transition him with War Machine and the rest. Those disappointments aside, the only other elements that weren't perfect fall within the suspension of disbelief. Overall, another wonderful installment to the Marvel Cinematic Universe."

","Marvel has done it again. A successful and terrific ending to Phase 2 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU). And it's correct that without a strong villain, it's never so much fun. And Ultron is bad ass. James Spader has done an awesome job. Have to mention Paul Bettany as Vision is good. Vision saved the day. No need to mention the other performances by the previous cast because they are awesome as always. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch was a nice addition to the team. Good performances by Aaron Taylor Johnson and Elisabeth Olsen. Age of Ultron was an enjoyment to watch. Joss Whedon has also done a good job with the script. He has not wasted time on unnecessary plot. He hit the track right away. It was good to see how the Avengers have created a bonding with each other."

","This movie is so beautifully crafted, organic. It leaves you wanting more and in pain that something you waited for so badly has ended. This one seems darker than the first one, it still includes that light humor that we loved so much in the first one, it's action packed, sometimes it's even hard to digest all the action happening. After seeing Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. episode connected to the movie I really pieced it all together and I'm proud that I totally guessed how the movie is going to start and I was not disappointed in any way. The most beautiful thing was Vision, the way he looked and acted, I was really enjoying it. Marvel movies always have this surprise moment in them and in Age Of Ultron something so usual for normal people and totally unexpected for a superhero grabbed me by shock, who am I kidding, it was full of surprises and I had my mouth open most of the time. You totally need to watch this. And you need to remember that nothing is perfect, but this in my opinion is the closest you can get."

","This gets ten stars alone for just not using super hero's to push corporate corruption, government incompetence, and propaganda like DC does. Marvel Studios has made me a fan of super hero movies before Iron Man I never would have spent any time watching comic book movies even if I had free promo tickets and now I go and see them all in the theater. These film have real American values attached to them and hold freedom and individuality to the highest esteem. Unlike dc they deal with consequences of actions, individuality, and expressing who you are and what you believe in while dc films at their best have pushed propaganda for major corporations made excuses for government spying and the desecration of our constitution. Example batman with Nolan placing centralized banks in every commercial and plot line.

"Quinoa1984","8","1","10","2 May 2015"," Enough flies to make it worthwhile
","Let me start off about Ultron. Voiced (and performed, perhaps in mo-cap) by James Spader, he is a weird, robotic creation meant for peace and, instead, reverts to the ways of violence. Actually, that's not entirely true: Ultron gets all the information on what is up with his sorta-creator Tony Stark, and the world, and realizes there is a way to make peace: by getting rid of all the people on it. He may need some things for it, like the stone inside of Loki's scepter, and then he'll be ready to go. <br/><br/>What's so refreshing with Ultron is that he/it's a villain who probably, no, for sure knows how twisted this is, and yet sees with such contempt what the Avengers are and stand for. That and being a sarcastic son of a b****. He's the sort of curse words that the heroes, in mock jest, tell each other not to say. You know, kids are watching! Age of Ultron is as BIG a spectacle as they come, with the action you come to expect from Marvel movies. The highlight for me is when the Hulk, influenced by the powers of the Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen, among many top shelf actors here), goes on a rampage in an African city, and the only one who can stop him is Tony Stark - as the HULKBUSTER. And yet for how ridiculous this sort of fight can get, as others in the film like when A.I.'s Ultron and the Vision (the later-model sort of hybrid of other alien stuffs whatever of Jarvis) go at it, Whedon makes the battles creative and refreshing.<br/><br/>And there's even time out to, you ready for this, showing the superheroes going out of their way not only to make sure people are out of harm's way (much as they can, sometimes it can't be helped, though there's no R-rated stuff for here), they save people sometimes one by one. Though things certainly get melodramatic near the end - there may be death, there may be rather abrupt departures for characters for, you know, 'reasons' of the plot that aren't convincing - the writing is consistently clever and funny throughout. Genuinely funny I should say; you don't expect to get things like a Eugene O'Neil reference, but it does come at one point (whoops, does that count as a spoiler)? <br/><br/>There can be gripes with certain decisions characters make, or that the film has both too much in it and not enough time to go even further with things - allegedly a director's cut is waiting for DVD. But this is the sort of case where I'm happier to get more rather than less, and there's a balance of strong character interactions and great dialog carrying things along. A relationship like the one that Banner and Natasha have shouldn't work - for some it might ring as false or rushed, like where was this in the first film(?) Whedon ultimately knows two things: we're invested already with these characters (and he's done his share in the first Avengers), and there's real pain and tragedy to how they connect. Could things be different if they weren't broken people, or thought they were, amid the heroic acts? Who knows? But the filmmakers put that in there just as we think it's ALL about the jokes and mayhem.<br/><br/>Added to this are some wonderful new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - people who you don't know for sure will or won't be the villains, the 'puppets' for Ultron ironically enough - and reappearances by others in the gallery of characters from the past Iron Man and Captain America and Thor movies (Incredible Hulk... well, who knows). It's all so much you may take for granted that Downey is still a blast to watch as Stark, a man who is his own worst enemy and keeps screwing things up for his team. He's self-aware, terrible and wonderful, a jerk and a realist, and drives the story forward.<br/><br/>So... yeah, good times all around, if less than great for reasons of certain plot issues, things that seem to go by so quickly you may need to watch it a second time, and characters that only get a sliver of screen time (i.e. Andy Serkis, and... Julie Delpy?!)"
"CleveMan66","9","1","10","1 May 2015"," ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is even better than 2012's ""Avengers""
","Marvel has pulled off something INCREDIBLE – something unprecedented in the annals of American cinema! They have assembled the parts of four different movie franchises into a combination franchise – and it's a huge, HULKing success! Almost a decade ago, when I first heard of Marvel's plans to make separate movies about the Incredible Hulk, Iron Man, Captain America and Thor, and then bring them all together in an ""Avengers"" movie, I admit that I was a bit skeptical. I said to myself, ""Self, that's a lot of time, effort and money towards a single goal. I hope, for their sake, these movies don't suck."" I watched and waited to see if they could IRON out the details, and MAN, did they! The 2008 Hulk movie (2003's ""Hulk"" wasn't part of this grand plan), the three Iron Man movies and the Captain America and Thor films (two each) and 2012's ""Avengers"" have made a combined total of over $2.6 billion – in the U.S. alone! By the hammer of THOR, that's a lot of money! More importantly, these nine films (ten, if you count Marvel's ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") have averaged 7.4 stars on IMDb.com and an 82% audience rating on rottentomatoes.com! And now, writer/director Joss Whedon, the CAPTAIN of this culminating franchise, has given us a blockbuster that may break box office records in America and all over the world! Is Whedon's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (PG-13, 2:21) worth all that? For the details (but no spoilers), and our official Movie Fan judgment, read on. The AVENGERS have ASSEMBLED! ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" (as part of this grand plan for the Marvel Cinematic Universe) picks up on the cues and clues left us in ""The Avengers"". As the 2015 episode opens, Iron Man / Tony Stark (Robert Downey, Jr.), The Hulk / Dr. David Banner (Mark Ruffalo), Captain America / Steve Rogers (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Black Widow / Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye / Clint Barton (Jeremy Renner) are racing through the woods in the fictional Eastern European country of Sokovia, to a secret research laboratory where they hope to reacquire Loki's scepter. As we learned from the previous film, that staff has tremendous power and can't fall into the wrong hands. And in the right hands, it could be very beneficial. There's a rare stone within the scepter and that Stark realizes he can use to power Ultron, the artificial intelligence project that he's been working on. The idea is that Ultron would function as a global defense system to keep the world safe from aliens with bad intentions. ""Peace in our time,"" Stark calls it. The problem is two-fold. ""Peace in our time"" was the phrase used by British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain after he got Adolf Hitler to sign an agreement not to attack England and we all know how that turned out. Secondly, these guys have apparently never seen any of the ""Terminator"" movies, in which a defense technology called ""Skynet"" was supposed to keep earth's inhabitants safe and we all know how THAT turned out.<br/><br/>When Ultron becomes self-aware (much more quickly than Skynet did), he makes himself a body out of spare robot parts, starts sounding like James Spader talking through a bad cell phone connection and decides that the best way to save the world is to exterminate humanity. Uh-oh. It takes all the Avengers to slow him down for a minute or two. Ultron, he of the high intelligence in the digital format, can escape into any computer in the world – or all of them. Besides that, he has help. A pair of genetically-enhanced twins, Quicksilver / Pietro Maximoff (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch / Wanda Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen), have a personal beef with the Avengers and are more than happy to help Ultron destroy them. Quicksilver makes Superman look like an old man with a walker and Scarlet Witch can move objects by waving her hands and can get inside someone's head more effectively than any woman I've ever met. Ultron uses their particular set of skills to significant advantage, but he hasn't told them that he has a little more on his high-tech mind than just getting rid of the Avengers. But the good guys have help too. Several characters from previous films in the Marvel Cinematic Universe show up to lend a hand. I'd love to tell you who they are, but my policy is to not reveal anything that you can't learn from the trailer or the movie poster. I'd also love to tell you what we learn about several characters' back stories and the surprising developments involving some of the characters in the present, but that would spoil the fun! And ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" IS a lot of fun! This movie contains all the elements that made the first film work so well, but never gets repetitious. This movie even enhances those elements. We get more character development, more character conflict, more humor, superior visual effects and, most importantly, an even better story and even better action sequences! What's not to love? The visuals are stunning, the action sequences are intense and creative, and there are more laughs in this movie than in many so-called comedies I've seen. The humor is not only perfectly balanced with the action, it's perfectly timed. This film will leave superhero fans and action movie fans alike wanting more, and more is on the way. We're going to have a chance to see ""Ant-Man"" in July. ""Captain America: Civil War"" arrives next May, ""Guardians of the Galaxy 2"" and ""Thor: Ragnarok"" in 2017, and ""Avengers: Infinity War – Part 1"" in 2018. For now, ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" gets an ""A""."

I'm part Jewish and am still getting sick of Hollywood spinning hatred about something they can't get over instead of sending a message of unity and humanity trying to get along with each other going forward.

When the heroes are standing still and the background is altered to make it look better, this is pulled off okay. But any time there is movement, it looks just ridiculously bad. Chases, fighting, and even the Hulk are very silly. How can this be acceptable? The inclusion of Quicksilver also seems to have been a big mistake. I understand why he was needed, but it did not have to be that way. If we had just focused on a good story (like the last ""Captain America"") this would have been better. I will give them bonus points for introducing Klaw, though... perhaps he will return in ""Black Panther""?"

","The real vote would be 4, but because there are so many hysterical votes attributing this crap as a masterpiece, I had to give it the worst possible evaluation.<br/><br/>Extraordinary bad Special effects. Copy and paste, sloppy and poorly done. Not congruent with contemporary technology specially having such an immense budget and such history background (also mediocre with some exceptions).<br/><br/>It's irritating the omnipresent allusions to sex indirectly pointing to a teenager's world of erotic fantasies: Thor's deified masculinity attracting every women, the focused mums in desperation jumping with big breasts (perhaps both Freudian allusions), and so forth.<br/><br/>It's annoying to note the paradox between the surreptitious sexual allusion in contrast to the puritanism against using slang. Reminds the ""good old days"" where everything was censored (I'm being satirical) although very bad things were happening behind the stage. If you know what I mean.<br/><br/>It's fastidious and ridiculous to hear the same cheesy jokes over and over, like hysterical paranoiac people, desperate to make a stand or to supplant the others.<br/><br/>The costumes wouldn't be immensely corny if at least they weren't pretentious or didn't pretended to be modern. Captain America's is the only good costume.<br/><br/>The present effect sounds were used already at least a thousand times on other movies.<br/><br/>The only glimpse of good representation is the shower act between Bruce and Natasha. The rest of the it is mediocre, specially Chris Hemsworth's who looks exactly like someone who has painted his hair in yellow and is wearing a Carnival Comic costume; adding the fact he sits upon his masculine appeal and forgets how to act or incarnate his character.<br/><br/>Ultra-rubbish!

"fernandoschiavi","8","0","1","2 March 2020"," Whedon inserts new elements presented in the most recent films of the characters, and expanding the story to a more global level
","It is no secret that the challenge is enormous. In addition to maintaining the great quality of the films of this second phase of Marvel, Joss Whedon tries to overcome himself here, since the first Avengers is practically a unanimity between critics and the public. And he manages to reach a similar level, delivering yet another spectacular film in every way, inserting new elements presented in the most recent films of the characters, and expanding the story to a more global level. Whedon, who once again does not have to tell origin stories, let alone find a good reason to reunite all the heroes again, is free to go straight to the point, going straight to the plot.<br/><br/>Trying to protect the planet from threats like those seen in the first The Avengers, Tony Stark seeks to build an artificial intelligence system that would take care of world peace. The project ends up going wrong and generates the birth of Ultron (voice of James Spader). Captain America (Chris Evans), Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) will have to come together again save the day.<br/><br/>Whedon already begins the film with a spectacular action scene, where the skills of several heroes are shown during the invasion of one of the bases of H.I.D.R.A, where they recover the Scepter of Loki, an inexhaustible source of energy and psychic control. In parallel, seeking to keep the local population safe, drones commanded by Jarvis (at the behest of Stark) try to reduce collateral damage, but they are not welcomed in these eastern European lands. Tony's project has already started, creating an immediate cohesion with Extremis technology, which we saw in Iron Man 3, right after they recovered the artifact that gives Tony Stark the possibility to advance in the project he developed with Dr. Bruce Banner. In Stark's conception, it would be the end of the group, while they would be replaced by a ""bigger shield"", an omniscient protection that they themselves could not overcome, something very similar to what we saw in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. Once an arms manufacturer, Iron Man continues to be forced to face the result of his past actions. Becoming a superhero was part of the process of dealing with that awareness. Now, becoming a global defender is an even more powerful opportunity in that sense.<br/><br/>As in the first Avengers, the meeting of the heroes is cohesive and well balanced. There is no central character taking on a more important posture, not even Captain America who is the leader of the group in the comics and also in the films. As a matter of fact, characters who did not have such a large participation in the last film, have the chance to participate more effectively in the plot as a whole. It is like that with the Black Widow and the Hulk, who end up building an important sexual tension between them, putting on the agenda the possibility of a possible relationship, showing two traumatized and fragile people who hope to live a normal life together, away from the Avengers and of everything that implies this coexistence. The similarities between both characters already existed, but the script highlights and seeks them. Another highlight is Gavião Arqueiro, a happy and married man with two children and one more on the way. This relationship between Gavião and his wife, the fact that they live in isolation and his relationship with his family is explored. In fact, this isolated and calm place is where heroes try to recover from nightmares that torment them from that point on.<br/><br/>New characters were also introduced efficiently. James Spader is the android Ultron. He, who acted in person and later was replaced by computer graphics of motion capture, is undoubtedly the great success. The actor, basically with his voice, lends a threatening, cold and even ironic tone to the villain, who dictates that to solve a problem you must eliminate its source: the Avengers and humanity. Its triumphal entry seems to have been taken directly from a horror film. We don't have a simple homicidal machine in it, but something completely human, which makes it even more terrifying.<br/><br/>Speaking of motion capture, there is no way to mention the participation of Andy Serkis (the Gollum of ""The Lord of the Rings"", the Caesar of ""The Planet of the Apes"", the King Kong of the Peter Jackson remake) in the skin of the dealer of arms Ulysses Klaue in a cameo. He is responsible for removing the vibranium metal from the African nation of Wakanda and selling it on the black market. It's the same alloy that makes up Captain America's shield, it's the material that Ultron needs to build his indestructible body.<br/><br/>We also have the twins Wanda and Pietro Maximoff (Elizabeth Olsen and Aaron Taylor-Johnson), known in the comics as Mercury and Scarlet Witch. Since Marvel / Disney does not own the rights to the mutant word, owned by FOX in theaters, it was up to Joss Whedon to reinvent the origin of the characters. In the film, the brothers are the result of experiments conducted by Baron Wolfgang von Strucker (Thomas Kretschmann), a scientist at HYDRA, a Nazi organization that extended its tentacles within the spy agency S.H.I.E.L.D. - as shown last year in ""Captain America: The Winter Soldier"". Pietro has super speed as a characteristic and participates well in some good action scenes. But it is Wanda who gains more prominence and importance due to his powers of manipulating reality - and perception. In comics, she combines her changing power to alter reality with witchcraft, a mixture that, in the cinema, could be confused. Joss Whedon simplifies the equation, giving him telekinesis combined with the power to invade minds, unlocking unconscious fears from his ""victims"".<br/><br/>One of the new heroes to be worked on is Vision (also Paul Bettany). A perfect adaptation of the character on the pages, the creature appears simplifying all its concepts from the comic books, but at the same time keeping them intact. The android Visão, created by the film's own villain to harbor his conscience, but which ends up ""rescued"" by the heroes, becoming his ally. Vision is, in fact, a ""symptom"", an artificial person with his own thoughts. Interestingly, Vision and the Scarlet Witch formed, in the comics, one of Marvel's most unlikely couples. It is not impossible to imagine that the novel is also mirrored in cinema.<br/><br/>The film has a darker, darker tone, but it has a balance that doesn't let it get too serious at any time. Like any Marvel movie, the movie is full of jokes, mostly good ones. At no point does the film stop amusing itself in the midst of action that does not disappoint once again. As already shown before, we have important ethical discussions between Captain America and Iron Man. Steve Rogers is the perfect opposite to the idea, which flirts with totalitarianism, of a corporate peacekeeping force, acting on foreign soil, of Iron Man. This discussion could have been further explored and debated in the script, generating consequences for the Age of Ultron, not just a prelude to the coming Civil War.<br/><br/>One of the differences from the previous film that brought together the heroes is the relationship between the characters. There are many more scenes of interaction between everyone, however the number and scale of the action scenes is even greater, which was a little exaggerated in certain sequences, which seem to come directly from the comic book pages to the big screen. Despite this, they are visually creative, beautiful and imposing scenes. Among the main action scenes, we can highlight the invasion of the H.I.D.R.A hideout, the scene of the appearance of Ultron in the middle of the party where the Avengers are gathered; the scenes on the African Coast; the fight between Hulk and Hulkbuster (with Tony Stark in special armor); the fight and chase involving the Black Widow, the Captain and Ultron in public transport through the streets of Seoul, in addition to the great final battle in Sokovia. The scenarios of the confrontations are completely different from those of The Avengers, leaving luxurious New York for marginal environments, much more impoverished, but also much more human. In the plot, the evil presence also denotes more impact, gravity in the situation, as, given the much larger number of characters, it becomes uncertain who will survive and who will die.<br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron is yet another hit by Marvel, creating a unique and exciting experience for the general public. Joss Whedon knows how few combine action, drama, science fiction and humor in one film to amuse everyone. There was no shortage of destroyed cities, shattered robots and spectacular scenes, whether in the air or on land. With the terrain prepared, it remains to await The Civil War, which will show the split between heroes."

I know lots of people disliked Iron Man two and three, a lot disliked Thor Dark World, and a lot disliked GOTG 2. I liked them all myself. However the bickering and blame game drama of Civil War and Ultron just contaminated those two movies for me a bit too much.<br/><br/>I saw this way back in 2015. I remember how I was just annoyed how they dumbed down the characters just to make them argue. It just infuriated me that they were all just bickering with each other and being idiots. Not the heroes I wanted to see. A bunch of blame game out-of-character nonsense. What is worse is that the arguments weren't even rational. It is like they just needed to create some fake drama filler as if this were a stupid reality tv show.<br/><br/>I also recall feeling that they didn't completely make the villain make sense. His intent for the reason said was just illogical. That angered me as well.<br/><br/>There WERE lots of GOOD things in this movie, but I'm keeping it at just six out of ten because these negatives really weighed on my mind throughout the movie.

And the whole Black widow and hulk romance didn't make sense since in the first Avengers film, she was terrified of hulk. It would've made more sense if there was a Black widow and Hawkeye romance but then came the twist where it turns out that Hawkeye has a secret family. And not to mention why did they kill off Quicksilver after one movie? It would've made more sense if they saved his death for civil war and gave him some more character development but they just killed him after one movie.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron<br/><br/>Average at best, with things getting more and more technologically complicated, yet a storyline which is 'ok'. Compared to the previous Avengers movie, age of Ultron is a downgrade I feel. The novelty of these superheroes coming together is completely worn off.

Can't help but begin to feel that these Marvel films are heavily reliant on Downey Jr.<br/><br/>Body forms of A.I arena interesting part of the series, but it's becoming more and more fantastical with each movie.

","Once you start doing something it's hard to stop. That's the case with the Avengers: even without the imminent and devastating danger they keep working together even on issue of local scale, which gives us the opportunity to see the pompous show-off and some cool teamwork. However, when it comes to such a grand title we expect something massive to happen. What can possibly be bigger that the attack from outer space?<br/><br/>Apparently, there are many ways to endanger the peace on the planet, and, as it mostly happens, the reason is a human mistake. The artificial intelligence always has scared people and the idea of it getting evil has troubled the minds of many geniuses over times. The most prominent example is the Terminator. So here comes the Marvel interpretation of the AI problem with a savior-turned-villain creation of Tony Stark that grew its twisted conscience and decided to make the world better.<br/><br/>The creators have an enormous collection of good and bad characters; I really appreciate the effort of introducing us to more and more unique figures of the universe, which makes every movie a surprise for every fan. The stand-off between the two opposing sides kicks off several times and, frankly, every encounter gets better and better.<br/><br/>The dark cloud that shades the sun here is the talks. The long, boring and repeating speeches explaining the reasoning. Sure, they make the bad guy look worse and the armor on our knights shine better, however, the preciseness is a key to success.<br/><br/>On the side of the action one can say that the sequel has kept the pace and even tried to outperform the predecessor. From a nice team fight to a duel of a year that was on everyone's mind to even bigger final clash. The hallmark of a franchise is a slow-motion group interlude, which looks cool but only there to stress the fact that it's not a solo movie feels overused but what won't you do to please the fans.<br/><br/>I am going to go ahead and say that the idea is not new but still interesting and with a few novel tricks up the creators' sleeves, however, the outcome of a story is a little bit disappointing. Some might say that it wrapped up too easily and I will totally agree, Ultron with all its computational power turned to be just an improved version of my pocket calculator - I hoped for more.<br/><br/>Dipping the feather into the ink I will end up this history chapter by saying that the 'age' is a too big word, because the length of this ""reign"" was hysterically short although it for sure was impressive. The second part did a solid job but it didn't jump as high as the pioneer of the franchise, all my hopes are that we will get some more stories that next generations will wish they could have watched on the time of the premiere."

Dir: Joss Whedon
Runtime: 2 hr 21 mins
Rated: PG-13<br/><br/>Synopsis: When Tony Stark attempts to create a peacekeeping program call Ultron, to protect the Earth, the AI becomes self aware and enacts a disastrous plan. It's up to Earth's mightiest heroes to stop him.<br/><br/>Originally I watched this I believe two or three times in theaters. Loved every minute of it but after going back and really watching the film there's a handful of things that I can nit pick at now. All things considered on where the MCU has gone and finally ended it's a really important part to completing the story.<br/><br/>Pretty much instead of using the standard story of Ultron like from the comics in which Dr. Hank Pym is the creator of Ultron the story uses the aftermath of what happened in prior years in New York from the first Avengers film to propetuate Tony Stark into thinking that Earth needs a peacekeeping program to protect the Earth in the case that another foe from space comes down to attack the Earth again. Consumed by wanting to protect the Earth and the idea that a program will be able to stop such a thing Tony stops at nothing to try and create Ultron. In doing so he accidentally creates a self aware program that realizes that the only threat to the Earth is people.<br/><br/>
There's a few choices that could have been made here that I guess would have helped with the film. The storyline itself has a few moments that are a bit of a plot hole but not too much to where it no longer makes sense. I would have had Alan Silvestri do the score how it usually is in Avengers films. Don't get me wrong I like Danny Elfman but I feel like Avengers films aren't really his cup of tea. Of course all characters are portrayed rightfully with Marvel being able to re obtain all the original actors for the franchise. The element between Hulk and Widow I suppose is needed because in later movies it plays more into Hulk's story. I guess it's just kind of weird how they went about it. A little unexpected but you can tell that since the first film and the Avengers working together over time that the ""lullaby"" has been mastered now. I think my favorite part about this film is the villain, after seeing this so many times Ultron has really became one of my favorite MCU villains.<br/><br/>I already own this movie, def a recommendation for anyone trying follow the Infinity arc because it plants some pretty important stuff throughout the film including introduceing new characters.
3.5/5 a high 3.5 at that."

","Continuing the ""Endgame"" prep with ""Age Of Ultron"" a film that, somehow in my head is a bit of a misfire. Happy to report that, though this is perhaps the weakest of the three ""Avengers"" films, ""Ultron"" is still a decent film and has a lot of great moments.<br/><br/>Haunted by the threats from other worlds that he's seen, Tony Stark wants to replace the Avengers with Ultron, an autonomous artificial intelligence that would protect the Earth. Finally locating Loki's missing spear, he utilises the properties of the Mindstone Infinity Gem to bring Ultron to life. Faulty and psychotic, Ultron decides that the best way to protect the earth would be to rid it of the primitives that inhabit it.<br/><br/>I find it really hard to believe that this was only four years ago! It seems like a lifetime. ""Ultron"" gets off to a shaky start, I felt. The battle to capture Von Strucker is a little bit too frantic to be enjoyable, and the CGI occasionally is a little shaky, however, the film really picks up from here and neither of those flaws could be levelled against the rest of the film. Expanding the cast and adding a number of characters who would feature in ""Civil War"" and ""Infinity War"" was done well. The plot points for the whole Infinity Saga is starting to come together too, with Thor learning about the Infinity Stones and realising that someone is behind their recent appearances, perhaps that impacts on this film a little - as Ultron doesn't necessarily feel like the same threat that Thanos is.<br/><br/>I can't decide how I feel about James Spader's Ultron. His naturalistic delivery is fun, and often funny, but I'm not sure how realistic it would be for an artificially intelligence to display these sort of mannerisms. Visually he's not quite as good as say Thanos in ""Infinity War"", there's a sheen to the CGI that's not quite dead-on, maybe the moving mouth was a mistake too.<br/><br/>The film does have perhaps the single most rewatchable single scene in all the MCU, the battle between Hulk and Ironman in his Hulkbuster outfit. There is lots of good stuff in the final battle scenes also. With hindsight, it's easy to say that it was time for Whedon to move on from the MCU and for the Markus/McFeely/Russos to take the saga forward, and with their writing and direction they have elevated it to another level. But ""Age Of Ultron"" is a really really good film, that would, in any other series, be a highlight. Here's though, it's just a solid addition."

But overall, I found it lacking!! Especially compared to the brilliant first.<br/><br/>All of the cast fit their roles like gloves now, they are all comfortable in the roles and it shows. There is not a weak link, in the cast, but things like the collateral damage to civilian life (during things like Hulk V Hulkbuster) still bothers me. Like Thor: Dark World and Iron Man 3, It seems rushed. Did they start filming all of these without finished scripts??

"jamesrupert2014","7","0","2","15 January 2019"," Lackluster sequel
","Once again, Earth faces an existential threat and all that stands between us and extinction are 'Earth's Mightiest Heroes'. This time we hapless humans are faced with 'Ultron', the verbose metal-manifestation of Tony Stark's software solution to world-peace gone rogue. Lacking the spark and cleverness of the first Avengers film, this sequel covers much the same ground, as the team squabbles amongst themselves, then come together when they are needed most. The usual superhuman crew (introduced in solo films or the first entry in the franchise) are opposed/joined by a couple of Eastern European meta-humans (complete with Boris and Natasha accents), 'Red Witch' and her brother 'Quicksilver'. Elizabeth Olsen looks great as the telekinetic Red Witch but her abilities are so vaguely powerful that it's hard to imagine why she alone can't solve most of the problems. Also new on the scene is 'Vision' (also vaguely all-powerful), in whom is embedded one of the MacGuffins around which next film in the franchise circles ('the excellent ""Infinity Wars"", 2018). 'Age of Ultron' is a step down from the first Avengers film: the story is illogical (see goofs section) yet predictable, the script weaker (especially the endless (and sometimes incongruous) ""lighthearted"" banter between the Ã¼bermensch), and the villain more irritating than menacing. The special effects are pretty good (although the film opens with a gamey-looking battle between the team and Hydra minions), as is the acting (considering the genre). While I got a little tired of Tony Stark's incessant 'droll egotist' shtick, it does play well against Steve Roger's 'greatest generation' decency and Thor's demigod literalness, and Mark Ruffalo is excellent as Bruce Banner/The Hulk, the ultimate in ego/id incompatibility. The pacing of the film is a bit off, especially the prolonged layover in Hawkeye's Norman Rockwellesque farmhouse (and why you would use your family's home as a 'safe house' when at war with a near-omniscient foe is beyond me). All in all: OK as a segue in the 'Infinity Stones' story arc but a bit weak as a standalone feature."

What's new and interesting is the slight advancement of 3-D imagery and the introduction of the creative ways of destroying things. There are few new characters that add a dash of freshness.<br/><br/>Overall, though there are a few dead zones, Ultron's actor's familiar voice can be a bit distracting and other then the action there doesn't seem to be much new or hugely interesting about this movie.

An example of why I thought of this is because of Ultron's intention. It would've been much better if Ultron actually did what he was programmed to do: protect humans. I mean, if Ultron couldn't kill humans, this would present a conflict that Ultron needs to get past to accomplish his goal. Other than that, here is how I rated this movie:<br/><br/>Cast - 7 -> The cast is quite amazing. They make this story-wise terrible movie half-decent.
Story - 5 -> Like I 've said, the story was built terribly, but with good intention, therefore it gets a higher rating than it might've gotten.
CGI - OVER 9000!!!! (9) -> Let's just not get into this. It's great. Period.

","After my terrible review of the first Avengers i'll review the second Avengers movie.
The movie was overwhelming to say the least and disappointing.
This movie failed to meet my expectations and im kinda disappointed cause all it ended up being was a movie similar to it's predecessor.
It manages to be a good movie i was almost about to rate it a 6/10 but it has flaws and i will address does flaws.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
The characters are great and we get to see their personality shine throughout this movie.
The part where we where at Clint's house was a good part in the movie where we got to see the characters act and we also give more depth to Clint and we see that Clint is just a normal human being like all of us and i really like how they made these characters more down to earth.
Thor's character didn't get to shine as much as the others which is kind of a flaw.
And Vision just made the movie more overwhelming. It's good to have him but there are other ways to put him in the movie.<br/><br/>ACTION
The action is still great and it still holds up.
The Avengers working together as a team is great and fun to watch and i don't have a lot to say about the action.<br/><br/>SIMILAR
Now to the flaws.
This movie was similar to the last one.
What it should have been was a very different movie that has originality to it and way more depth than any other movie in this universe but it failed to do that.
it's just Avengers 2012 with robots.
in the end there is this huge fight with loads of enemies and the world nearly ending but the difference is that in this movie its way overwhelming cause it has so many things it needs to focus on.<br/><br/>VILLAIN
The villain is wasted potential Ultron could have been a great villain with depth but all got ruined by Nick fury saying that Ultron's goal is to destroy the world.
I was so disappointed when they Nick said that.
The villain has character problems idk if it is intentional but at one moment he is a little bit charismatic and in the other he is very dark and serious.
The villain is just bad and disappointing to me.<br/><br/>VERDICT
You should watch this movie cause it's pretty good but it's overwhelming.
overall a dissapointment.

But that's something that you can expect from Joss Whedon when he's TOO in control.<br/><br/>For this film, he had many guidelines for what Marvel wanted to see in this sequel and some of the decisions were OK. This movie is not as bad as people say, I quite enjoyed it the second time round.<br/><br/>The criticism that many people would agree on is to introduce the character of Hank Pym as a side character, have HIM create Ultron just like in the comics and the Earth's Mightiest Heroes cartoon, then when he turns up again in the Ant-Man movie that follows this film, he could redeem himself by handing over his Ant-Man persona to an ex-convict and helping to redeem Scott Lang in response to what Hank did with Ultron. I think that would have worked a lot better.<br/><br/>Overall, this isn't as bad as people say. It has great moments like Hawkeye being given more deeper character development, the introduction of Vision, the fight between Hulk and the Hulkbuster armour and the dynamic between each of the Avengers. The fact that they are starting to get on better really makes me happy and hopeful."

","Following the events of The Winter Soldier, the Avengers infiltrate a Hydra facility where they come across twins who have superhuman powers. It starts off big, loud and over-the-top, complete with a slow-mo money shot of the team. Big opening scenes like this are usually a risk as they can make the rest of the film feel underwhelming. Thankfully that isn't the case here because it's filled with relentless action sequences throughout. A few standout moments include a penthouse surprise attack, an enraged Hulk destroying a city and a chase scene in Korea. Some of the action scenes have choppy editing but the majority are well shot where we can see what is going on. <br/><br/>The plot centres around Tony Stark/Iron Man who creates AI robot Ultron. To disastrous results he becomes an evil version of Stark hellbent on destroying the world. Perhaps their hardest obstacle yet, he's intelligent and always one step ahead of them. He uses the super twins as his pawns whilst also using his own robotic army to wreak havoc on everyone else. James Spader steals the show, he is intimidating, creepy and often amusing. <br/><br/>It's a little more grounded this time as the Avengers try their best not to cause any civilian casualties as they know it will only have repercussions. It also has a darker palette which makes it look better than the previous film which was very colourful and bright. The dark tone isn't for everyone but it works well within the story. There are some grim moments including one scene where they all get warped visions of their past. It's full of exciting action set pieces which take us to other places in the world rather than just the US. <br/><br/>It's not without flaws though, there are a few new characters introduced which makes it feel overstuffed. It loses focus sometimes because there are so many subplots -Natasha suddenly has a crush on Bruce Banner, Clint/Hawkeye has a secret family and Stark learns nothing from his mistakes deciding to make another robot midway through. However one good thing about delving into Hawkeyes personal life (everyone's least favourite Avenger) isn't a bad move and makes us root for him. But there are just one too many character storylines which the film could have done without. The final showdown is great showing them working as a team to stop Ultron from destroying the world. But like most comic book films, it wraps things up too fast."

The only character interaction that didn't work at all was the evolved relationship between Bruce Banner and Black Widow. When they talk to each other you're only eating for them to stop instead of listening to what they have to hear. Everyone else works good even though what they say isn't as memorable as in the first Avengers, but what is one of the only memorable things in the film is Hawkeye, who plays a very important part in the story. He also builds good relationships with the two new twins Wanda and Quicksilver, and grounds the rest of the heroes near the middle of the film. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver are fun new additions to the team who each have an effective power that doesn't go unneeded. The new addition who works the most is Vision, who is an intriguing android who may even be more powerful than the Avengers themselves. The movie is polarizing in the sense that the opening is poorly done and the third act is the strongest point. It definitely gets better as is goes on. The final fight lacks in good action but is rich in good character moments and some slightly moving moments. Through the rest of the film between the underwhelming action are spurts of good action that is cut off before it can make an impact. Which sort of summarizes a lot of the movie as a whole. The story touches upon some cool concepts, but doesn't to explore them enough. Which is also again summarized with Ultron. A villain who has a cool concept behind him, but is squandered due to his laughable facial design, his occasionally child like personality, and his seemingly conveniently inconsistent ability power levels. Overall, Age of Ultron is a big step down from the first, and it's strengths desperately climb out of it's weaknesses to be considered an okay movie. So I give it a 6.2"

","I'd give this 8.5/10<br/><br/>This was the first Marvel Movie that I ever saw and it did take a while to get me interested. Ultron was one of the better villains and he certainly deserves a sequel film. Why are people slagging this off? Yes it's different to the first Avengers but even that wasn't the best Marvel film so stop saying it is. Ultron is better than many of the Marvel films. The character was intelligent and hard to beat unlike Loki. For some reason I already knew Hulk despite it being my first Marvel film so the character development deserves credit. The only real problem with the film is that some of the build up is a bit random. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were great and they are what we want in the Marvel films, anyone who preferred Loki just because he's Thor's brother needs to rethink. I like Loki but Ultron makes a better villain so Jack Spade needs to make a come back. CGI by the way was awesome, didn't occur to me that people would find destroying Sokolvia an issue until Captain America Civil War. That film basically tells us that the Avengers did a bad job which does ruin the plot slightly. <br/><br/>Age Of Ultron 2 would be great. So would reviving Quick Silver"

","If Avengers (2012) was a huge hype for fans all around the world, then let me tell you, Age of Iltron does not disappoint.... what's more, the movie is a huge step higher than its predecessor, packed with action, massive destruction and an international threat that promises to set the world into an age of apocalypse and desolation. The movie was awesome, the Avengers were more focused as a team rather than individuals, and they have been developed from their last appearance with more interaction between characters and more action in fight scenes. The villain was perfect, Ultron posed a deadly threat which in his viewpoint was simply a mission he must enact. This directly adopts Ultron's persona from the comics which was also such a malevolent character. The story felt unorthodox but great seeing as this is a team-up movie and not a solo film. It was really awesome to see that Ultron had this weird idea that he was right and his plan, ultimately, was a huge surprise to both fans and moviegoers. The actors and actresses did their job well. In addition, Elizabeth Olsen's character was good but Aaron's Quicksilver needed more screen time, Hawkeye was done some justice by appearing as a mentor to Olsen's character. All in all, 10 out of 10 is the rank I will give this epic showstealer. Go watch it for sure."

"EthanBJones_03","7","0","1","24 May 2017"," Joss Whedon needs a hug; Would Recommend
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' is the second feature film in the MCU's 'Avengers' franchise and was directed by Joss Whedon. It stars Tony Stark Jr, Chris Evans and James Spader and is the story of Ultron(James Spader), a psychotic robot created by Robert Downey Jr and Bruce Banner to stop all wars before they even begin.<br/><br/>It was impossible for this movie to live up to the absurdly high hype that came of off 'Avengers Assemble' and the other MCU movies. It really was but I still feel that people were too harsh on Joss Whedon. Seriously, the guy needs a hug. He was bullied by movie goers because this movie didn't reach the heights of one of the best movies of 2012. I feel bad for the guy. He made a fun, action packed movie with a stellar cast and fun villain but was manhandled by smaller people? Oh children that's right I forgot the word there for a second. In all seriousness, this movie is very entertaining and fun is you can ignore the absurd plot and tropes carried over from movie to movie. <br/><br/>Speaking of absurd plot, the plot is absurd. The term 'Age' implies 2000+ years of something, not a week. The concept of Ultron was really cool and they could have made a very creative(and possibly, if they did it right, satirical) doomsday device that involved our mass reliance on technology and the internet. They do try to cram a LOT into one movie and fail miserably at it. It think this was a Feige issue and not a Whedon issue because he has said how many restrictions and guidelines he had to follow and that undoubtedly interfered with his vision for this movie. Something happens in this movie that should have meant a lot but it doesn't have as much of an impact as it should and therefore feels very wasted and like botched potential. <br/><br/>Right, let's get the obvious out of the way. Tony Stark is excellent as Roberty Downey Jr. Downey Jr is just such a charismatic guy and he makes Stark a very memorable character. This is only heightened by Chris Evan's much better performance of Captain America. There is more back and fourth between Evans and Stark than there was in the Korean War. Scarlett Johanson was good as Black Widow, as was Mark Ruffallo as Bruce Banner but the 'relationship' between the two felt so forced and contrived and had little to no buildup to make it successfully work. Chris Hemsworth was good as Blondie but I feel like his presence was neither necessary nor warranted. Jeremy Renner as good as Hawkeye and the wonderful producers at Marvel Studios decided we needed a reason to like him so that when he kicks the bucket in Infinity War we'll actually give one(I refuse to count that as profanity). Elizabeth 'Hand Wavy' Olsen was weak as Scarlett Witch as her 'superior acting method' consisted of doing stuff with her hands in the air and, occasionally forging an accent. Aaron Taylor-Johnson did better as her 'brother' Quicksilver but his purpose was to be there and not for anything else. Paul Bettany was great as his character in the movie and was a very welcome and entertaining surprise. Plus, dat hamma scene tho. Now for arguably the most controversial part of this movie, Ultron. I understand that Ultron wasn't as menacing as people wanted him to be but I appreciated Spader's approach to the character. Having him share similar qualities to that of his maker(Robert Downeyy Jr) was an excellent choice and gave further levels to the character. He was definitely one of the better MCU villains but that is like saying something is one of the better ways to get stabbed. <br/><br/>Once more, I adore Whedon's beautiful cinematography and his long, unedited tracking shots and stunning to behold. On the flip side of that argument, while some scenes(such as the opening sequence) were amazingly shot and edited, scenes such as the church scene were horrifically edited and were done extremely poorly. The effects were amazing and looked awesome(I wouldn't say they looked as impressive or cool as 'Avengers Assemble' but that is just my opinion). I do think the set design was pretty generic and they could have done quite a bit more with it to make it appear more lively. <br/><br/>This movie needed to provide some fun action, fun humour and set up ((37*(x**40)) + (π*407³)(Have fun maths nerds!) movies in the process. The action is very fun and arrives when it's needed. Amidst the incredible action, there is also deep, heartfelt character moments and some of them worked. The one liners were most funny but some of them were were very profanity filled and that is offensive to Cap/Disney. As for setting up movies, it does to that but it could have been done so much cleaner and work so much better. Another thing this movie had to do was involve stakes but it doesn't feel like it does that. This is a glaring issue with MCU movies and hopefully they'll fix this in 'Infinity War'. <br/><br/>The music was very good. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is not as good as 'Avengers Assemble' or 'The Winter Soldier' or even 'Iron Man' but it is a very enjoyable movie and better than a lot of MCU movies. The cast is still stellar and Whedon proved he direct action competently with his other movies. If you want a fun way to spend your two hours, I will recommend you see this movie because it is very fun and enjoyable to watch.<br/><br/>7/10"
"ryanskywalker-87402","8","0","1","30 April 2017"," ""But if you step out that door, you are an Avenger""
","Almost two years ago, when this was being released, I was the most excited Marvel fanboy you could imagine. The entire Marvel Cinematic Universe had grown on me immensely and had become a franchise that I went back to time and time again and this film was being released just as my inner nerd was evolving. The very first time I saw this I was disappointed, actually. It wasn't everything I had hoped it was, but I still enjoyed it very much. Then came the release of it's blu- ray and I picked it up day 1 to see if my thoughts had changed at all, and it turns out that I watched it three times in the same week and I just admired the film.<br/><br/>After my realization that this wasn't going to be as good as The Avengers is where, I think, I truly found my love for this. Every time I saw it on I would sit down and watch it, or every time I was bored I popped it in and it just was so re-watchable to me. You see the thing that made the first one so amazing was the fact that it had been what Marvel Studios' was trying to do since the beginning and felt like a true experience. Avengers: Age of Ultron kept that experience like feel, but somewhere deep down it didn't feel as ""cinematic"" as the first.<br/><br/>Returning to his rightful place, Joss Whedon once again sits in the directors chair for this outing and I actually think he did a better job here, in the direction aspect at least. In The Avengers, Whedon's writing ability is easily the best part; being able to have all these characters combine and he made all of them feel real. The writing in this, while fantastic, didn't have that charm of the first where it felt like a combining movie. He didn't have to set the chemistry up so I think that's why it's not as good. Anyways the direction though in Age of Ultron is better in my opinion.<br/><br/>With grand landscapes and gorgeous set pieces gracing the screen, the MCU hasn't looked this beautiful in awhile. Each thin shown or even referenced has a purpose and makes the film even more compelling. The action is some of the best and I think it doesn't get the love it deserves, in the action department, because Mad Max: Fury Road was released the same year. The entire first sequence is done to perfection and the final battle is a marvelous piece of filmmaking. Each part is shot beautifully and the close, but effective, editing makes for the 141 minute runtime fly by.<br/><br/>Like I said above, the way that Whedon wrote the Avengers themselves in the first one was phenomenally done. It's hard to balance all these characters and their individual arcs, but Whedon does it effectively and does it with such ease. Thanks to the actors though, they all combine to brings these characters to screen once again and I fanboy every time. Robert Downey Jr. being cocky as all hell, Chris Evans being a buff dude, Mark Ruffalo using a code green, and Jeremy Renner stealing the show from all of them with his jokes and inspiration, makes me smile and proves just how much I love these people. I always see complaints about Spader's Ultron, but to me he was perfect. He felt menacing, and the quick jokes just show how ""human"" he actually is.<br/><br/>Even after my 6th! viewing Joss Whedon's superhero extravaganza of a sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, has become quite possibly the most under loved, and under appreciated film within the entire MCU. My initial reaction to the film was poor, but after so many thoughts and talks I've had about the deep love I have for, not just the film itself, but the entire franchise and how it all fits together, has made me admire Joss Whedon's sequel and everything it does. From Hawkeyes kickass speech to Hulk vs. Hulkbuster, Avengers: Age of Ultron marks as one of the best superhero films ever and one that makes me want to throw a fist in the air."
"Moviemanic22","6","0","2","25 January 2017"," Good sequel
","I seen the Avengers 2012 two years back on Christmas. The running time couldn't hold my attention and I was having short cat naps in the second half. I think I missed many of the crucial parts in the story. But Anyway somebody told me yesterday that in order to really enjoy these marvel movies, one has to watch every film in the order and sequence that they release. So if you haven't seen the 'captain America' movies, then you're out of luck. <br/><br/>The Avengers return in this sequel that eventually lives up to expectations. That is if you manage to sit through it till the end. I couldn't help but feel that perhaps this was on a shorter budget compared to the first film. The picture colour filtering also looked different. This is not really an issue but it gives the impression that there was some cost cutting involved. The plot seemed more straightforward and less complex to it's predecessor. The team are back fighting the evil. This time its some robot named 'Ultron' He wants to destroy mankind and have his own world. <br/><br/>The final extended battle is the highlight and Olsen and Johnson are the new added characters in addition. The relationship between Hulk and Johanasen provides an emotional core to the story. I anticipate the 'Avengers Infinity' when it releases."
"Uriah43","5","0","1","14 January 2017"," An Okay Sequel Containing Lots of Action and CGI
","This movie essentially begins with the Avengers raiding a Hydra stronghold in Eastern Europe and in the process seizing a staff previously belonging to Thor's brother Loki. Naturally, ""Thor"" (Chris Hemsworth) wants to take the scepter back to Asgard but he acquiesces for a few days to allow his Avenger teammate ""Tony Stark/Iron Man"" (Robert Downey Jr.) a couple of days to examine it a little further. Unfortunately, Tony Stark has no idea of what he has stumbled upon and accidentally unleashes a computerized being named ""Ultron"" (James Spader) who decides to help humanity evolve--by destroying it completely. To gain time and keep the Avengers occupied he creates an army of robots all controlled by his computer intelligence. Meanwhile, he subsequently acquires the metal used to make the shield for ""Captain America"" (Chris Evans) and forces a scientist named ""Dr. Helen Cho"" (Claudia Kim) to use her knowledge in synthetic tissue to create a new body for himself. Throw in the addition of several other superheroes and villains and the result is complete mayhem on earth. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that, from what I understand, this film made over $1.4 billion and ranks as one of the highest grossing films ever made. And with a profit margin like that additional sequels are already in the making. Be that as it may, however, I was not overly-impressed with this movie by any means. Although the CGI was top-notch I thought there were too many characters involved in too much action and too many sub-plots going to really amount to anything coherent. That being said, the fact that this film garnered so much money is certainly an achievement and nothing succeeds like success. But it was all a bit too much for me and I have rated it accordingly. Average."

","I can't understand the distaste people have for this. The Avengers were growing more comfortable with one another, a fact made clear in the script. In the first film we saw them learning to be a team, in Ultron we saw them acting as a team.<br/><br/>The script was fine, the acting was fine, in fact Spade stood out. Not only that but it raised a few questions as to what was coming next. It developed the characters better.<br/><br/>Some of it was a little over-the-top but you are watching a movie based on comic books.<br/><br/>The little romance may have stood out as forced & unnecessary, but, well that's only a reason to take away 1 star, not 9.<br/><br/>You get to see new characters, you get to laugh & you get to gobble up popcorn in & suck down sodas in the typical action/sci-fi induced hypnosis.<br/><br/>I honestly can't see all why it has so many negative reviews."
"Amari-Sali","7","0","2","5 October 2016"," Age of Ultron maybe one of the first of Marvel's films to show why making each film part of one long arcing story may not be the best ideas.
","Once again the Avengers assembly and, at first, it is against Hydra, Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson). However, with time, and Tony (Robert Downey Jr.) trying to create some sort of retirement plan, comes the birth of Ultron (James Spader). A being made to stop wars before they begin, and the only way it sees to do so is to end the human race. Something The Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), and Captain America (Chris Evans), alongside Iron Man, and the various sidekicks, plan to stop. That is if they can.<br/><br/>Praise<br/><br/>Like with any Marvel film, there are comedic moments, the type of sci-fi which helps show what a 200 million dollar budget looks like, and of course, we have iconic characters brought to life in glorious fashion. Though perhaps the best parts deal with the idea of the team splitting apart. For while everyone has always been united against a foreign evil, with this film comes the idea that, past certain personality conflicts, there are true, irreconcilable, differences between everyone. Leading to the idea that, especially in MCU (Marvel Cinematic Universe) movies to come, that perhaps nothing will remain as one-sided for the perception of good and bad will be severely blurred.<br/><br/>Criticism<br/><br/>Being that everything within the MCU is pre-planned, and the source material is accessible to the public, it makes films like these seem more so like stepping stones than grandeur monuments within a series. For example, one of the next major films to be released as part of the MCU, after Ant-Man, is Captain America: Civil War in which we'll find Tony and Captain America on opposing ends of an issue, and it seems a good bit of the film is dedicated more to setting up their eventually battle than trying to craft Ultron into any sort of interesting, or truly credible, villain. Especially considering Thanos continues to lurk in the background, making damn near every villain, outside of Loki, to just seem to be a placeholder. <br/><br/>Making it so I almost was left wondering if it wasn't for the expectations built by knowing what is to come, would this film even be interesting? Of which the answer ultimately was: no. For while Marvel always puts out quality entertainment, at times it does feel like it has found a comfort zone, which you've grown accustomed to, that makes it so you eventually need and expect more. After all, it has been 7 years since the first Iron Man and Marvel began this one universe strategy and, while both critically and financially successful, at this point there is a need for a serious jolt. No more, I feel, can Marvel rely on interchangeable villains, and slightly different love interest/ comic relief characters amongst their films. The formula has to be changed. Otherwise, even with the large amount of source material, and both famous, and cult favorites, amongst their archives, eventually the empire will fall. <br/><br/>Overall: TV Viewing<br/><br/>Granted, this is a good film, and achieves all you would expect from a Marvel film, but after a certain point, and after seeing the movies, the S.H.I.E.L.D TV show, and maybe also the animated series or movies, you have to wonder if perhaps we have seen the best Marvel can offer? For with Age of Ultron, we seem to have hit a plateau. <br/><br/>We know of the great effects the production teams can muster; we know the screenplay writers can craft jokes and help flesh out characters which don't ultimately seem like shallow demi-gods; and with the knowledge of there always being a future, one which can pursue the idea of our heroes becoming villains, there is always something which can be done to revive the MCU. However, with a movie like Age of Ultron, the question remains: Should everything, until Thanos become the central villain, perhaps only be seen as filler or just a stepping stone; Will, even as new characters are introduced, should we pretty much just expect the same formula to be used repeatedly ad nausea; or will, one day, Marvel will find itself breaking ground once more, with its storytelling, and not just box office records? Only time will tell."
"bodhi-13262","6","0","1","1 October 2016"," Welcome to a new Age......of Ultron.
","'Avengers: Age of Ultron' was the most highly anticipated superhero sequel ever since the smash-hit of it's predecessor; 'The Avengers'. Joss Whedon returns to the helm, but did he do as good of a job the second time around?<br/><br/>1. The main cast of the first film returns to great effect, but the new additions is where the weight is felt. The blatant fact that Whedon included Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor Johnson) and Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) to the cast simply because he said they looked cool, is really not a good reason at all. The two serve somewhat of a purpose, but could easily be removed and not change a thing to the plot. Robert Downey Jr. is the center of attention once again as he unleashes the villainous 'Ultron' after jump-starting a dormant peace-keeping program. It's obvious that this was a forced story- line since 'Ultron' was the creation of Hank Pym/Ant-Man and not Tony Stark.<br/><br/>2. This movie (unfortunately) follows the same beats as the previous in terms of plot points. Loki's scepter is once again the cause of confusion, a villain that is physically inferior (combative-wise), and another faceless army of minions for the Avengers to cut through during the climax. I'm actually glad Joss Whedon left the MCU, cause this would have been the sad direction 'Infinity War' might have been headed. James Spader does an amazing job voicing and motion- capturing Ultron himself. His appearance might be menacing, but he pales in comparison and disappoints every time he faces off against any Avenger. And just like Loki, Ultron is punked during the climax and smashed around by the Hulk.<br/><br/>3. There is a completely out-of-left love-story between Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) & Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo), which is utterly sickening for the least since Whedon willingly ignored the existence of Betty Ross. I for one was actually relieved when Quicksilver died, cause he was just a waste of space. The introduction of the 'Vision' (Paul Bettany) in the last third of the film was exhausting to me since the movie was already crowded with characters at that point. Luckily the Russo brothers actually found a purpose for the Vision in 'Civil War', so he can probably be excused in this film. I'm still overjoyed that the Russo's will be directing the future Avenger films.<br/><br/>4. The climax is kinda underwhelming to say the least, since it's basically a repeat of the last film. The most impressive sequence actually comes in the middle when Tony Stark summons 'Veronica' (the Hulkbuster armor) to stop the unstable Hulk from rampaging through the streets of South Africa. Audiences were on the edge of their seats for that entire fight scene. Never would I take anything away from the visuals and CGI in this film, because they are fantastic. If it's one thing MARVEL gets right, it's the special effects using ILM. However, this film does way too much advertising of future films crammed into one and it becomes way too obvious and overbearing at times. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie is still fun and enjoyable to watch, but then it doesn't really stand out due to the fact that nothing new is really presented. It's still worth seeing, but Whedon and company fails to ignite nor recapture the thrills they've achieved before."
"cherold","8","0","5","26 September 2016"," A marked improvement over the overrated first one
","I was disappointed by the original Avengers. After hearing it lauded as the most awesome movie ever, what I got was empty spectacle, a movie that summed up everything I don't like about films that sacrifice character development in favor of big battles you never really care about.<br/><br/>Still, as empty spectacles go, The Avengers was pretty fun, so eventually, about a year after it came out, I equipped my low expectations and watched Ultron.<br/><br/>Ultron surprised me though, because it has what the last one lacked; personality. This movie has far more interest in its characters and ideas. It even has some angsty and rather touching romance.<br/><br/>Even better, the movie has a really great villain, beautifully voiced by James Spader to be both dangerously psychopathic and quite funny. <br/><br/>This movie has somewhat less action than the previous one, as it takes time out to get to know its people, but that action is put in context this time, so I actually care about what's going on. The final action scene is a bit overlong, but overall the action is great.<br/><br/>There are some issues with the special effects though, particularly in the case of the Hulk. It's something I noticed in the first sequence, which looked, especially in long shots, rather fake; it looked like something from a video game. It's not terrible, but it's not always believable.<br/><br/>Overall though this was one of the better Marvel movies."

","I liked this sequel more than the original.as usual there is a ton of intense action sequences.it's also a very funny movie and once again the acting is as good as or better than in the original.there are also a few more marvel characters dropped into the mix.but the one thing that makes this film superior to the first(in my opinion,anyway)is the villain Ultron.this is one of the best villains to come along in the last few years.he is certainly a worthy adversary to the Avengers.Havin James Spader voice the character was a stroke of genius,in my mind.his voice just fits the character so well.overall,an excellent film.so far,Marvel is winning the superhero sweepstakes against DC,for two very important reasons.firstly,humour,second a relatively lighter tone.DC films tend to be dark and bleak.until DC figures this out,they will continue to lose ground to Marvel.this is just my opinion of course.anyway,for me Avengers: Age of Ultron is a 9/10"

","I felt that there was a disconnection with the other parts. For example, Thor's return is never shown not in this and not in Thor's movies. We learn that he has seen Jane after coming but we are not shown that, seems as parts are missing. Also we are not shown how the avengers got contacted and got together. We learn from the Winter Solder movie that they have to destroy the centres of Hydra but that was just Steve and Natasha, they never mentioned that they will call the others or keep the avengers alive. This is also feels like a part missing. Their get together. <br/><br/>I am not gonna talk about life lessons or plausibility because its a super hero movie and those are pretty obvious how they are in these movies. I must say however that this part was more concerned with characters dilemmas, their fears. It is an attempt to develop them, let the audience understand them better. A missed target here because firstly, as I said its an super hero movie, the characters are super heroes and no matter their dilemmas because of that they will always come back to the same ending and secondly, they did it poorly and shortly and it just took a lot of movies time without making any impact. <br/><br/>The story line is impressive however and that's what a movie like this should have, more wow moments and twists and surprises than character's dilemmas. They story is well told with action scenes and fast development and the feeling that you don't know if they all are gonna make it which was new. What I like most about the story is how the story keeps developing through all these series and you can sense that it is going to build into something quite exciting.

","I am not a comic fan and neither have the Idea what heroes there are. First,the movie before is much better than this one! There are not these funny moments when the bad guy says something mad and suddenly Hulk knocks him ultra fast and unexpected....I mean when I was watching a movie I almost knew what would happen certain scenes and with that the Film lose on the quality cuz If I'm sure what's gonna happen in a movie..then I have to say this movie don't deserve the name ""Blockbuster"" or anything like this. Oh...and again as we all know,Hulk is the Greatest hero,strongrst and bulletproof so in theory he can beat ANYBODY!<br/><br/>all in all another great action movie."

","Great special-effects but not an ounce of originality in the whole thing. We have come a long way from the shoddy special effects in the DC Comic Universe movies of years gone by. As usual, Iron Man and Tony Starks' robots and gadgets are just amazing. ""Natasha"" (The Black Widow?) continues to be very charismatic. She must have a bit of Russian ""Black Cat"" serum in her because she appears indestructible and has the perfect gymnast abilities of a Spiderwoman. Everybody else is perfectly predictable, especially Thor and the Hulk. I wish I had a dollar for every superhero action movie where the heroes or villains are aliens or mad (or nice) computers. In all the Universe(s) what makes Earth so special that every thing wants to conquer, destroy, or eat the entire planet? I guess I am getting too old for this type of movie? I have seen too much and I haven't been a teenager in decades."

","I have to say, I watched this movie several times but not for the reasons you might think. I got an absolute kick out of the cynical, snarky, hilarious, egotistical, fun that James Spader had with Ultron. When I found out that he was the voice behind it, I kept watching and listening to the way that he totally immersed himself and embodied the role. It was genius. I got no strings to hold me down. <br/><br/>The only comic books I ever read growing up were Archie. Gasp, choke, gasp. No Superman, Spiderman, Iron Man, etc. So for me, the characters are larger than life. And since I have no point of reference to compare them to or to critique them against, their personalities are formed and introduced to me on the screen. I learn their backgrounds and history from watching the movie. <br/><br/>Realizing that all of the characters in these movies are comic book characters, should make you also realize that you can't take these movies too seriously. While I learned a lot about our heroes in this movie and there is much more to any of them than meets the eye, they are still 2 dimensional for me.There is not enough information to flesh them out so to speak, but I'm sure that will come in future movies.However, Stan Lee and his cameos are always nice to see. <br/><br/>The next thing is to just enjoy the fun and the dialog. Plot?? Who cares. Acting?? Meh. For me, it's fun, it's cool, it's entertaining, and frankly worth the money I paid to buy the DVD. I am collecting all in the Marvel Universe and will continue watching until I am old and gray. Well, older and grayer than I am now. <br/><br/>For this movie, I do not believe that I wasted 2 hours of my life."

Sound exciting? The playful tone of the movie make for some fun moments,but stop the movie from having any sort of mystery or suspense.The CGI is top notch,and the destruction effects seem realistic.The new cast members are nice,particularly Johnson and Olsen.James Spader voices Ultron brilliantly,but sadly,the villain is just weak.This movie is good.Overall it is enjoyable,but I expect better from Marvel."
"jcramadi","7","0","1","29 May 2016"," Wish they failed in the end
","This movie has its flaws as with any superhero movie. I however enjoyed this one more so than Avengers (2012). The action was tighter and more swift. The story however was nothing new, but very engaging dealing with an AI that goes rogue and watching the seeds of disassembling take root among the Avengers. The characterization is some of the best I have seen of any superhero movie.<br/><br/>Now the bone I have with this movie is that it doesn't take the risk in showing the reality that failure can happen. The ending for this movie presented the Avengers with an impossible situation that involved either saving the human race at the expense of a failed state or allow the extinction of humanity. This was a pivotal moment in superhero era where the superhero will have to face a disastrous situation the Avengers and the world would never recover from. Instead we get a generic ending and the Avengers once again saving the day. We could have gotten a movie where the superheroes fail. That's what I was hoping to see as that would not only change the dynamics of the Avengers, but the dynamics of superhero movies to come.<br/><br/>Ultron was great but I was hoping for more use out of him in how he affects the world structure. When it says Age of Ultron I thought Ultron was going to revolutionize the world. I was hoping for world implications of his existence nothing short of economic catastrophe, internet shutdown, launch of nuclear weapons codes, wars, massive human loss, and of course the murder of the human race at the hands of Ultron a la robotic army.<br/><br/>AOU is worth the time and is still a fun ride. Just hoped that the Avengers failed this time around."
"slicedbread117","9","0","4","28 March 2016"," Avengers: Age of Ambivalence
","Ambivalent. That's the word I would use when describing what it was like watch Earth's Mightiest Heroes in their second crack together in the ever-growing Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU) in Avengers: Age of Ultron (AoU). In another word, it was bittersweet. It was underwhelming yet exhilarating, sometimes bland and sometimes superb, it left you satisfied, yet wanting worlds more. The Age of Ambivalence.<br/><br/>What it did great:<br/><br/>Age of Ultron first and foremost does one thing better than any other superhero movie has been able to do before it; it showcases the incredible accuracy of power and excitement behind each and every hero on screen. The film's greatest strength is its ability to take iconic heroes that have been around for decades and bring them all as close to their full-power, comic book form that we've ever seen, and it's magnificent. Hulk smashes and jumps like never before, Thor fights and flies like a true demi-god, and director Joss Wheedon definitely learned how to write Captain America's full power into an Avengers film, thanks in part to the Russo brother's successful attempt at re- tooling the Captain in 2014's spectacular ""The Winter Solider"". The bottom line is, that all of the mentioned and unmentioned heroes (Iron Man, Vision, Hawkeye, etc.) in the film are a constant thrill to watch. No matter the fight. Watching our favorite heroes in Age of Ultron was like watching a comic book unfold before my eyes, and I was wowed with simply how much fun it was to watch these heroes in their biggest and best form yet. <br/><br/>Another great thing AoU is able to have to its name is an outstanding cast, with each member delivering the greatest continuing performance to their individual characters in superhero film history. Robert Downey Jr. is practically Iron Man in real life, Mark Ruffalo has only gotten better as Bruce Banner/Hulk, and all of the newcomers, including Paul Bettany (The Vision), Elizabeth Olsen (Scarlet Witch), Aaron-Taylor Johnson (Quicksilver) and James Spader (Ultron) only add to the endless pool of talent found within the MCU. The chemistry between all of these characters is strong and seamless, only solidifying the film's accuracy to a live-action comic book. Although the screenplay itself might not have necessarily been dipped in gold, every actor is able to play their character to a tee, and it continues to be a joy to watch them on screen film after film.<br/><br/>What it did good:<br/><br/>In the first Avengers film we spent the majority of the movie watching our heroes slowly build into the superhero team we now know and love. There was more necessary character development that was vital to making us care and ultimately lose our minds when Earth's Mightiest Heroes finally worked things out and teamed up. In AoU, right off the bat we hop into Avengers-heavy action and it's wonderful. The team has been established, we know the characters, and it was nice to not have to waste too much time waiting for a big action scene to unfold. The opening action sequence is grand, and one of the best scenes in the film. It gives the audience the awareness that they are an established team now, with every hero working together to effortlessly take down the opposition. <br/><br/>As the eleventh film in the MCU, Age of Ultron was sure to continue building the future stepping stones for the years to come and did just that. The seeds of Captain America: Civil War were planted, and the furthering growth of the road inevitable Infinity War was also very much felt in the film. These things are great for the future of the franchise, but distract from what really is important in the movie, which brings me to my final section.<br/><br/>What it did bad:<br/><br/>While the MCU is a vast one indeed, and many stories have been and will continue to be told, Age of Ultron spent far too much time as a Phase 3 setup film, rather than focusing more time on the story at hand, and Ultron himself. Too often does the film divert its attention away from the story it's trying to tell, and off into territories that have to do with movies 3, 4 years down the line, or subplots like the Bruce/Black Widow romance, which was wasted time that could have been spent further fleshing out Ultron and his evil, yet enticing plans. Even the mid- credits scene was a Infinity War tease. Ultron is one of Marvel's greatest villains, and a wonderful Avengers foe. The sad truth is that, even with James Spader's delightful voicing of the character, Ultron is a massively underwhelming antagonist, which is a heavy disappointment given the potential there was in the character. <br/><br/>The bleak development of Ultron and his story also create cracks in the road of pacing throughout the film, with several scenes feeling rushed and jumbled up. Overall the film sustains a solid flow, but too often does it feel like Joss Wheedon and his team had to stuff 5 tons of content into a 2 ton bag, rushing to deliver a satisfying immediate story and at the same time setup the lager MCU story.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is a great film, but it's hot and cold. It's packed with exhilarating action scenes, it's colorful with gorgeous CGI, and every hero on screen has never been more fun to watch, period. The acting is flawless, and the connection to the future of the MCU raises numerous questions that are exciting to contemplate. However, it has occasionally sloppy pacing, it fails to tell a full story and there's a unfortunate lack of development for the title character. Avengers: Age of Ultron may have its flaws, but at the end of the day, it stands as a worthy sequel to its 2012 predecessor, and an overall enjoyable entry into the distinguished Marvel Cinematic Universe.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

","""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" raises the age-old question of just how much freedom we should be willing to sacrifice in order to ensure a lasting peace. And, as a corollary, how much power should humans be willing to cede to technology, particularly in the form of artificial intelligence, to achieve that goal? It's a theme that more than a few works of science fiction have dealt with over the years.<br/><br/>In this sequel to the box office smash of 2012, Ray Stark, aka Iron Man, has invented a program called Ultron whose purpose is to eliminate the need for war and global conflict altogether. To no one's surprise but Stark's, when the program is prematurely activated, it turns out to have less than noble intentions as it sets about creating a race of cyborg warriors to completely eradicate humans from the face of the planet and to repopulate it with others like himself.<br/><br/>Only the Avengers (embodied by Robert Downey, Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Don Cheadle, Mark Ruffalo, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Remmer, et. al.) can save the day. And save it they do, amidst supercharged action sequences and jaw-dropping special effects. <br/><br/>Stark certainly means well as he sets about essentially eliminating the need for the Avengers at all, but we in the audience know this is a fool's errand from the start for, if successful, there would be no more entries in this highly lucrative franchise. And we certainly couldn't have that, now, could we?"

","It's great special effects movie. It can be just watch for fights of characters. But I hate they always show most of characters' real power very little. 1- Thor can't be effected by Scarlet Witch's mind effecting ability. He is too powerful for that ability. He is a god. His real rivals are Hulk, Thanos, Galactus etc. Not relatively weak Scarlet Witch. Thor is inhumanly powerful, fast, strong minded etc. for every mutant in Marvel universe's Earth. Only Celestials dare to rival his powers. 2- Hulk definitely can't be affected by Scarlet Witch too. Hulk's mind doesn't allow one with that relatively weak mind effecting power. Even maybe Professor X can't affect him. In some point with the fight with Hulkbuster, he gets kind of exhausted. This was very wrong. Hulk can fight for weeks without stopping and he gets stronger with that. If he gets strong enough, he can destroy Hulkbuster with a single punch. 3- Quicksilver isn't that slow. You can't even see him move with his real powers. He can easily surf between any machine gun's bullets without having a scratch. And at last... WTF romance between Banner and Widow?!?!?! In the end, watch it for special effects and thrill of fight. Don't expect more."

So, if i continue this review, there'll just be praises,NOTHING ELSE!!! Incredibly expensive action scenes full of destruction go on for way too long with little context behind them, leading to overkill and boredom. ike the first film, what makes the sequel work is how director Joss Whedon builds the action on this character foundation and injects it with just enough humor to make its personality radiate."

","I think it was inevitable that this sequel would have a hard time satisfying the fans and critics. The first movie was not only a major first time event in showcasing all these superhero characters together on the big screen for the first time, but it was also a shock that it worked so well. Naturally there was the wow factor, the surprise, we were all wanting a hit but really, who knew. Everything in that movie was fresh and new (to a degree), mainly because this Avengers team were together for the first time doing it. So could this sequel carry the ever growing pressures of the hype machine? Plot wise its pretty much as before, the A-team are up against an enemy who has a massive army of robot drones, as before when it was a massive army of aliens. The difference being the enemy has been inadvertently created by Stark, or least turned out to be evil which was not foreseen. This creation also kick starts the bickering within the team which will eventually lead to other movies, and there's one problem of the movie (and all Marvel movies now). These don't really feel like movies (to me), they feel more like a requirement, an obligation or constant filler merely to lead you into the next movie, and so on. Most of this movie is simply exposition and setups for other things that will happen in other movies, interspersed with high octane action. It never really feels like a stand alone movie, admittedly these comic book movies aren't really like that of course, its all part of a wider universe (like the comics), but at times it kinda feels like you're being cheated."

","==The Avengers: Age of Ultron== This movie is directed by Joss Whedon.It is bigger and better than it's prequel 'Avengers'. Sure it repeat a lot of same formulas of the first film, but to different effects on a very different narrative. In the first Avengers movie we had the Thor vs.Hulk fight sequence. In this movie we were given the Ironman vs. Hulk.The action sequences are amazing,especially the opening scene with the Avengers leaping off trucks and destroying everything in their path.The movie is a tedious one though, as it is slow and tiring but still it is worth watching this movie. Ultron is bad-ass villain in the movie.He was forged with the strongest steel in the world, carries an infinity stone, and his best power is his cape-shape-ability.Ultron is created by Tony stark and Dr. Banner using Loki's stick as a peacekeeping program. But this invention went wrong and Ultron tries to destroy humanity.Thus,The movie revolves around the efforts and struggle of Avengers to control Ultron. Avengers make the business of being a hero look in the film's opening scenes, the movie is ultimately about the hard work needed to do what's right in a world that doesn't make that any easier, for the extraordinary and the ordinary alike."
"BarnabyTurner","10","0","3","5 August 2015"," A roller-coaster that still has soul
","WHAT I LIKED: A movie of such size that still has soul. 'Age of Ultron' truly is massive, an ambitious round of great, explosive action, special effects, setup and an incredible (and massive) cast. But Whedon manages to pull all that together in a way that the movie still feels personal. This is thanks to his level of characterisation and relationship development which bring some realism to the overall spectacle, giving the audience excitement, awe and buckets emotions throughout. In fact, by far the best scenes here are where the Avengers just talk, grounding everything ready for more incredible action. And because of this roller coaster ride, 'Avengers 2' has to be the MCU's best film to date. Nothing like it brings together everything great about all the films and comics we love like this does. Well done Whedon. WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE: Perhaps the reason for this film's overall average reception is the marketing campaign, which built expectations for an entirely different film. Without that, 'Age of Ultron' only really falters with small things. In a film this ambitious, there are bound to be niggles (Thor's cave etc.) But the beauty of it is that they hardly take away from the overall experience at all. VERDICT: The MCU's best film is a thrilling, beautiful roller coaster. Whedon steers it with perfection - and achieves a blockbuster with real soul."

","AT LAST, I HAVE FOUND THE TIME TO WRITE MY REVIEW FOR THIS AMAZING SEQUEL TO AVENGERS ASSEMBLE (2012).<br/><br/>I waited for this film ever since it was announced that a sequel was in development & the film did not disappoint me at all as everything from the CGI to the plot of the film to the interaction of each & every character was spot on especially funny & emotional. The best thing about this sequel was the fact that I did not have to pay to see the film as I won two tickets in a competition & took a friend to see Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>In Age of Ultron, the team have managed to function as a team as shown in the opening scene of the film as they have tracked down one of the last HYDRA facilities after the events depicted in Captain America: The Winter Soldier. During the opening scene, the team apprehend Baron Von Strucker & hand him over to NATO, but they come across the powerful Maximoff twins ― Quicksilver & Scarlett Witch. Before holding the sceptre of Loki, Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlett Witch bewitches Tony Stark & shows him his deepest fear which in turn leads to the creation of Ultron.<br/><br/>Ultron states that There is only one road to peace...their (The Avengers) extinction, before attacking the team at the Avengers HeadQuarters which sets the tone of the film as well as vital parts in future Marvel films.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron has a lot of funny moments. Some are listed below:<br/><br/>1) Since their first interaction, Hawkeye & Quicksilver kept on trying to one up each other with ""You didn't see that coming?"" This all culminates in Hawkeye drawing back his bow, ready to shoot Quicksilver in the back. ""No one would know!""<br/><br/>2) When the team are on their way back to HQ, Natasha asks Thor for a report on how the Hulk did on the mission – not even taking into consideration his usual flare for the dramatics of battle. <br/><br/>* Natasha: Report on the Hulk.<br/><br/>* Thor: The gates of Hel are filled with the screams of his victims. The look of shame on Banner's face along with the ""are you serious face"" from Natasha only adds to the awkward hilarity as Thor tries to rephrase his response.<br/><br/>3) While investigating Strucker's hidden base, JARVIS discovered what appeared to be a dummy wall. Tony checks it out he says ""Please be a secret door, please be a secret door, please be a secret door Yay!"" ― Robert Downey Jr. is brilliant as Tony Stark/Iron Man with his wit & charm.<br/><br/>4) I really enjoyed the scene when Iron Man was repeatedly punching the Hulk saying ""Go to sleep, go to sleep, go to sleep"". However, the best moment during their battle came after Iron Man delivered the final punch to the Hulk, which resulted in the Hulk to turn to face Iron Man & spit out a tooth. The frightened look on Tony's face while he frighteningly utters ""I'm sorry"" was hilarious as I could not stop laughing & neither could the other people who were there. Game on Tony. Game on! <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron has an impressive cast from Elizabeth Olsen, Chris Evans, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Cobie Smulders, James Spader, Samuel L. Jackson & Robert Downey Jr. as well as a cameo by the great Stan Lee.<br/><br/>I rate the film 8/10."

Before watching this new movie in cinema, I have already decided to rate at least 8 out of 10 for this movie which I expected for too long. And the movie turns out so exciting and live up to me and the original comics. There are more new roles coming out and showing their distinct abilities like Vision, Scarlett Witch and Quciksiver. I don't like to carp about so called ""boring"" by some critics because this is an action and comic-adapted movie rather than a literary movie.

","(Review contains spoilers) Okay, first of all let me just say, this movie is getting a lot of crap because people say that you wouldn't understand the majority if you didn't see the previous films, as in Iron Man, Avengers, Winter Soldier etc. Well that's the point of a SEQUEL. Duh. <br/><br/>The point is also consistently brought up that the movie takes too long to reveal something. I think that was one of the most amazing parts of the movie. A film that can consistently keep the audience wondering what will happen next, has put lots of thought and suspense into it. <br/><br/>You have to realize, creating Ultron is something they had to show without the use of Hank Pym, the creator of Ultron from the comic. Though the origin may not have seemed perfect, but it was mastered incredibly for having to start a new origin story. <br/><br/>Another plus of this movie was it was visually stunning. From the opening sequence against Hydra, to the Hulkbuster scene, this film was jam-packed with amazing shots. I was personally in awe the rotating shot when the Avengers were defending the church.<br/><br/>A lot of stuff had to go into this movie as well, they had to introduce countless characters, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch, Ultron, the Barton family, and Vision. The filmmakers also had to pack in tension between Captain America and Iron man for the ""Civil War"" sequel, and give background from Black Widow. <br/><br/>I believe that this movie was mastered digitally, had amazing acting, great continuity, and gave perfect nods to future films while still keeping a good pace. Age of Ultron had a very solid plot, and was the perfect combination of action, drama, suspense, comedy, tragedy, and even hints of romance, making it a golden film."

"drewthedude","9","0","3","3 July 2015"," Age of Ultron is massive entertainment, but not without some flaws
","The first Avengers was a massive film that was loved by many comic book geeks and casual audiences alike. With that film being so successful, a sequel would have some big shoes to fill in. However, In my opinion I thought this was a very satisfying sequel. But it still has some flaws and they must be remarked upon.<br/><br/>First off, I have heard many complain that this film couldn't quite ""capture the magic"" of the first one. But when you really think about, how can it? The Avengers film was the first time we saw all those heroes together on the silver screen and that's what made that film special. Since we've already seen that, It would have been impossible to recreate that feeling in the follow up. So I went into this film knowing that I wasn't going to get that same amazement that the first film had to offer, and that's what ultimately made me enjoy the film.<br/><br/>I found the story of this film to be a step up from the predecessor. Unlike the first film which had a typical ""save the world"" type story, this story was a bit more sophisticated which I appreciated. The action scenes are very entertaining and they are the highlights of this film. I was smiling during some of those action bits because they were just super fun to watch. All characters are also entertaining, even during calm moments of the film. Some of the things they talk about are pretty funny, so the first film's humor definitely returns in this sequel. The main antagonist of the film, Ultron, was also a cool villain which was definitely a relief considering how some of the past Marvel villains were a bit underwhelming, besides Loki from the first film. I liked how Ultron seemed like an intimidating figure to the Avengers, but yet he still had some one-liners which offered a good balance. Speaking of Ultron, we also got some other new characters like Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch and they are all also fun as well.<br/><br/>Now what did I not like about this film? For starters, this film actually ended up being a lot different then what the trailers made it look like. The trailers made the film look like it was going to be a lot darker and more intense then past Marvel films, and that really ended up not being the case which I found a bit disappointing. That's not to say that I didn't like the overall feeling of this film, it's just that I really thought this film was going to be a lot more of a major turning point to the whole Marvel Cinematic Universe then it actually was. Now this film does set up some things for future Marvel films, but that ends up being another problem with this film. Sure these foreshadows get us hyped for future movies, but they were a bit much and they took up a little too much time in this film.<br/><br/>Overall, Age of Ultron wasn't perfect but its large entertainment value still makes this film an easy recommendation. I don't know if I would say I liked it better or worse than the first Avengers flick, I think each film has their own strengths and weaknesses. However, if you want some good action sequences starring earth's mightiest heroes then you will enjoy Avengers: Age of Ultron!"

And yet i believed that it was a lot better than The Avengers 1 which is one of the highest-grossing films of 2012. So how awesome can this film really be? Let's find out. Story:I have been so proud of Joss Whedon for all of the movie he wrote. The plot is so amazing. Yes folks i'm totally dead serious about that. The story wasn't so big without it's own dark and menacing tone. I mean come on, how could you definitely love that kind of tone? In addition, my goodness the screenplay looks so fantastic. So in conclusion all of the story is spectacular. Characters: every single character in the flick is truly unforgettable to watch. And Ultron is one of the best villains in all of movie history. You guys better or better not get in his way. Also Wanda and her brother are twins with superpowers? That is pretty awesome in my book. And would look who got the most screen time in the movie? Captain America you played well for now. All the characters from the film are so very well-acted and trust me when I say that they're all well worth watching. Music: My freaking god. All the music from the flick is so incredible to hear and listen to. And I am for one giving a big kudos to Brian Tyler and Danny Elfman for it. It is also good having Alan Silvestri's themes back for the very first time in a row. I'm more than happy about that. Visaul Effects: All the Special Effects and Visaul Effects are brilliant. And there is absolutely no question about that. The design of the Ultron Sentanls is so cool that I can not ever bear it. Not gonna lie I would not be hurting it so much.<br/><br/>Conclusion: And so all of this is why i definitely love this movie. The Avengers 2: Age of Ultron isn't only one of the best MCU movies ever but also one of the best movies of 2015. And with an extremely well-written story, unforgettable characters incredible music and spectacular visual effects there is exactly no knowing why it existed all around the world in cinemas. This is an absolute must-watch for all of us marvel fans and comic book lovers. And I am so looking forward to the next sequel. And for God'sake i am always knowing where not to go wrong For one of the best MCU flicks that this one truly is,I'm giving it 10 Ultron's smiley faces out of 10. And yep I bet that you did not know why I'm here to do that. Now if you'd excuse me I really need to go to bed now. It just took too long for me to review this awesome flick. <br/><br/>My rating 10/10"

","I thought this movie was good but not great. I liked the amount of action and comedy. Character development was okay. I felt like there could of been more though. The time line felt rushed. As soon as one thing started, they would spend like 5 seconds on it and move on. Bit too fast. The actors and actresses were great. Keep in mind they're only saying what's on the script. The best was James Spader's performance, it was amazing. Special FX was amazing, not too much but still enough. It wasn't like I thought it would be, in a good and bad way.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed it and would recommend it."

","What were people expecting from this movie? The Godfather Part 2? No, you went into a Marvel movie that was advertised as a fun superhero movie. I really don't get the low ratings<br/><br/>Positives: The action scenes are great and see these heroes working together that we only saw a glimpse of in The Avengers. One standout scene is the Hulk v Hulkbuster fight in South Africa which has balls to the wall fun and contained a lot of laughs. The characters are better than even here. There were many complaints about the first movie not having character development and what do people do? Complain about 20 minutes of screen time is dedicated to developing Black Widow, Hulk and Hawkeye as characters which is great since these characters don't have standalone movies. Iron Man and Cap. are given enough conflict to set up Civil War and Thor is at his funniest in this film. The newcomers to the team, Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch are also great additions to the teams as well as Vision played by Paul Bettany, he steals a lot of scenes and I sure will not spoil him for you, if you've never heard of the character.<br/><br/>The villain of Ultron played by James Spader is great. He's more a neglected son of Tony Stark in his sarcastic and witty mannerisms but also serves as a great threat but I would have liked to see his motivations to destroy the world explained a bit more. The plot is good enough. Tony creates a AI named Ultron to keep world peace and to basically guard the Earth while the Avengers are retired. This backfires when Ultron decides the only path to peace is the extinction of not only the Avengers but all human kind. The humour here is top form and really shows the chemistry between every member of the team and for some truly laugh out loud moments.<br/><br/>Negatives: 3D is a flippin' rip off. The 3D could of been really capitalised on in the action scenes but is just a cash grab Vision's powers aren't fully explained. Thor's sub-plot feels rather underwhelming.<br/><br/>Conculsion Avengers 2 is a boat load is freaking fun and everything a summer blockbuster should be. It also really makes me look forward to the expansion of this Marvel universe and where we could go."

","A spectacular movie ! You should see this , it's great ! But there are a few cons and pros I want to name:<br/><br/>Cons : They should of explained ultron better . His origin wasn't very good. They made it too quick . And in the comics iron man didn't create ultron , that was dumb The visions origin was not good either . They should of changed that.<br/><br/>Pros : This movie had great action sequence . Good jokes ( sometimes too many ) They explained the relationship between Bruce banner and black widow better . A superhero finally stayed dead : quicksilver was killed and stayed dead.<br/><br/>I'm glad this movie didn't make quicksilver and scarlet witch have a relationship like in the comics"
"zshah2010","8","0","3","13 June 2015"," Decent movie, Worthy sequel
","Im one of those guys who was looking forward to this movie for a very long time. I watched the first avengers movie on the insistence of a friend, and ever since, I've watched every MCU movie that has been made, except for Iron man 2 and 3, I cant seem to find time to watch those..ANYWAY...<br/><br/>This was a good movie, with a legitimately terrifying villain and very likable characters. but if you want to know what my personal gripe with the film is, it would have to Be pacing. every scene feels very rushed and hastily put together, and whats weird is that what this movie lacked in pacing it made up for in comedy and character. We get to learn several backstories to the avengers, we get to meet Scarlet witch and her brother Quiksilver, and we even meet Vision, who is by far my favorite part of the whole movie. he is both interesting and funny, and he supplies some of the best quiet moments in the film.<br/><br/>The only other great part of this story is easily Hawkeye, who practically steals the show after being sidelined in the original movie. I always felt he was underused, and now hes so much more interesting, and i do hope the fans appreciate this fact.<br/><br/>Overall, a nice film with some minor flaws that can be overlooked to truly enjoy it."

","Look. It's not going to win any Oscars. Unless they're for special effects, because they were actually pretty good. But it's an action movie and it ties in well with the others so far.<br/><br/>Characters have already been developed over the earlier films (and some of the TV shows as well) in general, though the few new ones who get introduced are a tiny bit shallow. Particularly Ultron, who could have been so much more sinister. I rather hoped he'd have that subtle menace of HAL...but this is Marvel and Stan Lee doesn't do subtle. Neither, it would seem, does Joss Whedon. Which is fair enough.<br/><br/>I agree with one of the other reviewers that the vaguely romantic back story doesn't work without having a lot more attention, and I also agree that some of the peripheral characters were either wasted of a distraction. <br/><br/>But you know what? I sat down at the beginning and then it was over. It certainly didn't drag and I certainly didn't feel as though I'd been ripped off. A damn' fine way to spend an evening, in fact."
"trixiesmithee","Null","0","4","10 June 2015"," Awesome movie.. Watch it more than once..you have to .
","This is a great movie...very Awesome and interesting. There are many Battle scenes that are explosives, fast-action, and will make you go ""wooah"". The costumes and CG are great. Hulk and Veronica battle is Wow!. Tony Stark-iron man is the intelligent one, and coolest.<br/><br/>All the cast from the previous Avengers movie all reprise their roles. Robert Downey Junior was amazing as Ironman. Chris Evans and Chris Hemsworth were both great as Captain America and the mighty Thor. Scarlett Jhohanson was brilliant as Black Widow and was even more bad-ass in this movie, than any of her other films.<br/><br/>Avengers! everything that worked in the first movie team dynamic, one lines & character moments are awesome and still feel fresh.<br/><br/>Totally watched it. Its Great FUN. Avengers Assemble. ;)"
"mizpikasso","9","0","6","7 June 2015"," Successful Sequel
","I don't agree with some of the reviewers who want to pick apart the movie: Some complain about lack of a love story development in previous movies, but I definitely can look back and see where some little hints were teasingly introduced. Some complain about the camera angles or special effects/visual effects, but it's an action movie that is flooded with CGI, how are you going to honestly compare it to other movies that don't have any CGI? Some complain about the lack of story. Well, if you read comics, what did you expect? The movies go a lot further into character development and story lines than the comments. Either you are or you aren't a comic turned movie fan. If you've liked the movies so far, you will really like Ultron. James Spader/Ultron, & Paul Bettany/Jarvis/The Vision made this movie one of my top picks for 2015."
"suhjonathan97","9","0","6","7 June 2015"," Worse than the original? Really?
","Despite Loki's absence, I actually think AofU equals Whedon's first installment. Ultron is a fascinating villain and Spader portrays him perfectly. The clever dialogue helps as well. I think the movie did a great job building on the already existing MCU. The movie also expands on the universe, throwing in exciting Easter eggs.<br/><br/>Probably my biggest problem with the movie is Quicksilver's death. Although Marvel's portrayal of the character is nearly not as good as Fox (X-Men)'s, I still liked the character and wanted to see more of him in action. I do understand the licensing issues, but I wished he would have stayed on.<br/><br/>Overall, however, Marvel knows what it's doing, and it got one of its biggest star vehicles right. Well done."
"bloodysatana666","9","0","3","4 June 2015"," About Loki and scarlet Witch
","I am really disappointed that Loki wasn't in it. It was all about Loki's scepter and he wasn't even in it. They had to give Loki a little role just one scene or more, but they didn't. I am also surprised that Scarlet Witch is the twin sister of Quicksilver. In the Comics I read Quicksilver was the son of Scarlet Witch. I also know other theories about Scarlet Witch. One theory is that Scarlet Witch got a son with Wolverine, the child have Wolverine powers. Other theory is that Scarlet Witch is the daughter of Magneto. After she lost her children she is mental damaged and she destroyed the Avengers. One other weird theory is that scarlet witch is the daughter of Magneto and sister of Quicksilver (like in the movies). Well I hope this review is useful."
"anaconda-40658","8","0","3","3 June 2015"," Hulk vs Ultron.
","Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015): Dir: Joss Whedon / Cast: Robert Downey Jr., Chris Hemsworth, Chris Evans, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson: Worthy and entertaining followup to the 2012 hit. This one throws viewers within the midst of a battle that is pretty pointless that last about ten minutes. After retrieving Loki's scepter they are confronted with a new enemy of robotic form called Ultron. His policies evolve around peace, but the kind that exterminates mankind in favour of robot. Needless to say the Avengers don't respond well and band together to battle an army of robots. Joss Whedon returns as director after his grand success with the first film, and the special effects are explosive. Robert Downey Jr returns with more sarcasm within the suit of Iron Man. He feels responsible for Ultron, which leads to hostile debates within the group. Chris Hemsworth as Thor brandishes the famed hammer while trying to interpret a nightmare that was cast upon them all. Chris Evans as the shield throwing Captain America finds the mass of Ultron even a challenge for his own weapon. Mark Ruffalo as Hulk is guilt ridden after his mind is hacked resulting in an outburst that has him clashing with Iron Man. Scarlett Johansson as Black Widow identifies with Hulk and her sense of isolation. Jeremy Renner as Hawkeye shoots the arrows while concealing a family of his own. James Spader provides the menacing sarcasm of Ultron whose views are corrupt. While just a mindless special effects eye candy, it succeeds in entertaining and presenting tension within a group that needs to resort to teamwork. Score: 8 / 10"
"pjbhaumik","8","0","2","30 May 2015"," Age of Jarvis
","Singularity experts may like this movie. The computer program which powers the Iron Man suits becomes the centerpiece in a struggle between good and evil. Wills are tested and heros even a heroine are born. Scenes throughout this fantasy action movie reveal the consequences of mankind's decadence. A Slavic proletariat serves as the terrorists' base which the Avengers must save. Tension and distrust amongst factions of the Avengers grows to the point of Bruce Banner and Tony Stark's coupe d'etat. Uncertainty in purpose troubles Thor and romantic issues pang Bruce Branner. The good guys win this one yet the costs are taking a toll on team dynamics. Fate hinges on conflict resolution and team work in the next battle."
"obro","8","0","3","30 May 2015"," Very Enjoyable
","This was in my top 3 most anticipated movies of 2015, I was so excited to see this film! And I'd say it more or less delivered.<br/><br/>I'll start with the positives. Firstly, it's great to see the team back together. By this point each of the Avengers are beloved characters in their own right and to see Earth's mightiest heroes back together is of course fantastic, especially for big Marvel fans like myself. The entertaining chemistry among the group that we saw in the first film is even stronger in Age of Ultron which allows for plenty of comic relief which is always refreshing. I've seen some negative comments about the humour in this film which I think is ridiculous. The Avengers are a team, they're friends, of course they're going to crack jokes they're not zombies. Plus DC already supplies us with the bleak side of comic book movies so I think it's nice that Marvel want to make their films a bit more colourful. Also I think that the new additions to the team, Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver, will please audiences, although I do think that Quicksilver was better portrayed in X:men: Days of Future Past.<br/><br/>I like Ultron as the villain as well. James Spader voices him perfectly, giving the character an intriguing charm but making him the sinister supervillain that we deserved. Ultron was quite an intelligent adversary for the Avengers so he wasn't simply physically menacing. <br/><br/>I was happy with the pacing of the film as well, the action started immediately and continued throughout, although there were of course pauses in the action to give room for the narrative. However I do think certain aspects of Ultron's character were rushed but overall the pacing was fast which works well in a film like the Avengers.<br/><br/>The action sequences are of course great. The visual effects are stunning and as I've already outlined seeing all of the Avengers together battling an army is glorious. I do accept however that seeing this for the first time in the first movie was probably more incredible.<br/><br/>As a big fan of Marvel I went into this film with some hopes, a sought of checklist for things I wanted to see and questions that I wanted to be answered. For the most part my desires were met but there was one question in particular concerning how Captain America's shield is broken. The broken shield was shown at the end of the first trailer and although it was addressed in the film, I wasn't satisfied with it's reveal when I finally saw the film because me and my friends had come up with so many cool theories as to how it could have been broken and who could have broken it.<br/><br/>As a whole though I had a lot of fun with Avengers: Age of Ultron. Fans on Marvel should enjoy this movie a lot and for those who are not seasoned Marvel fans this film is very accessible."
"jgunsenhouser","8","0","3","28 May 2015"," If AOU was this awesome, then I can't wait for Civil War and Infinity War...
","With this highly-anticipated follow-up to the first go-round, the first issue is out of the way...and that is also the main disadvantage...the Avengers have already assembled. There can be no repeat of the first panoramic shot of all six Avengers like the shot from 2012 in New York when Banner finally showed up...here, Whedon is forced to give a couple variations that still work but, alas, that cinematically historic moment from 3 years ago is its own creation. But that is where the positive comes in as Whedon jumps right into the pool and swims right for the deep end. And, as it did in 2012, everything clicks perfectly...the banter, the conflict, additional personnel...all leading to the start of something new...a new team...by the end, Cap and Widow are overseeing War Machine, Falcon, the Vision and Scarlet Witch. Stark and Barton are taking a little vaca, Thor heads home to investigate other realm issues and Hulk has gone the way of the dodo bird in a Quinjet. Between the end of AOU and the cast list and plot of CA:CW, it's safe to say that as amazing as AOU is, it is truly a mere stepping stone for the cinematic story being told, and while that's both a blessing and a curse, it's also a hell of a ride...one last thing I'll leave here...when we saw it, one particular scene with Paul Bettany's Vision got the place lit up, and for good reason...in the space of about 2 minutes on screen, he commits himself to the fighting side of life, thus allying with the Avengers and does something that truly had the audience cheering and had Stark and team with their jaws on the floor. Truly a scene worth the price of admission by itself...like I said, one hell of a ride."
"zlaf","10","0","4","25 May 2015"," a great flick for all ages
","Honestly, the first set a bar near too high for any following Marvel movie to exceed. I personally thought that the movie was amazing. It was also stated by Joss 09 hedonistic multiple times that there was footage that didn't make the final cut as it would've made for a movie longer than the hobbit, making it feel a face paced movie. I get this and think that it is a great set up for the coming Marvel movies, and may set up Antman and clearly sets up Black Panther, as the Klaw was created by ultron (not by intention) and the city/country of Wakkanda. It also sets up our infinity war story as it describes the infinity stones, and features the Infinity Gauntlet. It also begins our plot of the Civil War to come, as well as expanding our universe of characters, such as Winter Soldier references, War Machine Mark II and even Falcons new suit. The only thing I find a problem is Quicksilver's death, as it was his opening film. Other than that it is a great movie and recommend it to anyone who enjoys action with a dash of comedy, just as any other Marvel Movie."
"alexcomputerkid","8","0","4","24 May 2015"," Sure, this movie doesn't beat out the 2012 film but this is a very solid sequel.
","Even though I read comic books for a limited time with really little knowledge, The Avengers always stood out to me as a comic book that could be made as a film. So many superheroes and many villains for many people, and really as much as I hate to say it, it would seem like easy money for a studio. Once you got the first Avengers film in 2012, you were long overdue for another one but you couldn't take away what a great summer blockbuster it was. From directing from the always positive Joss Whedon, excellent casting, superb action, everything was running on cylinders. With what Avengers turned out to be and the money made, a sequel was bound to happen. <br/><br/>After Tony Stark tries to start a pacemaker program and eventually taps into artificial intelligence, Stark unleashes Altron (James Spader), a villain of mass destruction that only the Avengers are capable of stopping. This is a familiar formula for a superhero film and for Marvel in general. <br/><br/>I didn't go into this expecting to have issues with characters but this sequel seems to make even more light of them. Solid acting, writing to a script that supports them, chemistry between them and the biggest highlight is some of new elements to them. Hulk/Bruce Banner (Mark Ruffalo) is trying to control his anger and really just can't. He finds a love interest in Black Widow/Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson) which deals with the themes of being normal, how they have different powers and two very different identities. Where as I thought Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) was given nothing to do in the first movie, he was given a quality backstory that should make us look more forward to this character once the new installments come along. Hey, we even get new character in Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson). Scarlet Witch's cap taps into energy and a person's mind. Yes, it would seem like mind powers won't be special compared to what the Avengers cast can do but in a surprise, she brings some of the best moments to the screen. Her twin brother, Quicksilver known for impressive fast speeds is ultimately going to be remembered for how this character played out in the last act in a very memorable way. <br/><br/>After a while, I have come to expect that superheroes films plots are convoluted and are really meant at times for comic books fans. This plot is much of the same with so much depth to it and mostly dependent on the villain character. The character Ultron has really wonderful voice work by James Spader who proves he can be a menacing character. Ulton is still very silly and not a lot background was given to him. He dazzles though in his action scenes and really like any character in this movie, he doesn't drag in any act. Ultron A memorable villain but not without issues.<br/><br/>Moviegoers probably come to this movie for a lot of reasons and I would expect action is one of them. Being that the budget isn't an issue and Joss Whedon has a good track record of good action movies, you can expect high flying scenes in the first part and in the last act, the action really puts this movie on top. This is the type of action that is made in a way that really would be hard to get tired of. <br/><br/>With two Avengers films set after this,the future looks very high for this franchise. Sure, this movie doesn't beat out the 2012 film but this is a very solid sequel. This is one of the few franchises around that I don't mind that we are getting sequels as we keep on the same road that we are on now."
"matej-trkanjec-133-920386","10","0","4","24 May 2015"," The perfect continuation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe
","Avengers: Age of Ultron was the most expected sequel of the entire Marvel Cinematic Universe franchise. From the first trailer it built up an incredible amount of expectations and the final version did not fail.<br/><br/>1) The story. If one has not seen every previous installment, the story will be a little bit difficult to follow and understand. The opening sequence is understandable only, and only if The Winter Soldier was seen. So, basically, the MCU became a TV series comprised of movies. Not a bad idea, but we will see how that will go on in the future and with future releases. Getting back on track, it is fluent, entertaining, funny and dynamic. It's everything a Marvel movie has to be. The thing that makes this story a bit more complex and far better that any other Marvel movie is the background story of the Avengers. We finally see the things that were spoken of or were glimpsed at in the previous movies. The Avengers were given a dimension and layer unseen before. Some of them were more developed in this movie and that makes the viewers relate to them more. All of these elements make Age of Ultron, in total, a better movie than any other Marvel movie so far.<br/><br/>2) The acting. Unfortunately not much to say here. All of the actors are so into their characters that not much changed since the last Avengers, or any other Marvel movie. But, Renner finally got more space to show his acting skills. Hawkeye was the most developed character in the movie, and Renner used every single second of screen time in his favor. Johansson did a decent job, taking her character to a level not seen before, going out of the box with Black Widow which, in comparison to the Winter soldier, was an interesting thing to see.<br/><br/>3) Ultron. The only thing wrong with the movie. It saddens me to say that Ultron, the one thing every Marvel fan was excited to see is a total failure. Spader's voice fits perfectly but the character itself is not as good as he should have been. More time was given to the Avengers and their background stories (especially those who don't have their own movies) than was spent on Ultron. Somehow, Ultron was not as terrifying as he should have been, he was just not good enough. If 15 more minutes were spent on the story of Ultron, his character, his transformation and embodiment, the movie would have been flawless.<br/><br/>All in all, Age of Ultron is entertaining, fun, not too different from the other movies of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but it is a much more serious movie with more character development and layers. If you disregard the underdeveloped Ultron, this movie tops all of the other Marvel movies made so far."
"jana_tb","7","0","4","23 May 2015"," New content for an existing schema
","Avengers: Age of Ultron could be very well defined and summarized as what Downloadable Content (DLC) is for video games.<br/><br/>There is nothing significantly new in comparison to the previous movies in the Marvel universe. Almost all main characters sport only a slight addition to their arsenal and - apart from the two new characters, Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch - there is no significant change in the cast.<br/><br/>The movie gets straight to the point without _any_ prelude: action scenes. This, however, also introduces some plot-holes considering where previous movies of the Marvel universe left off; none of which is important in the context of Age of Ultron, but can be considered significant for those looking for the bigger picture.<br/><br/>If you liked what you saw before in the previous installments, and are itching for some more action, a new streak of moves and cheesy one-liners instead of re-watching the old ones for the 10th time, this is definitely something for you, no doubt.<br/><br/>The battles are very spectacular and full of ideas. You also get to see surprisingly new sides of select characters, which is interesting, but doesn't add significantly to the plot. Take this movie lightly, bring popcorn, and expect top-quality CGI."
"michaelwebby","8","0","3","22 May 2015"," Impressive Sequel
","A really impressive squeal! Without any shadow of a doubt this movie goes in my top 15 favourite movies of all time. I have never been a big marvel fan but I have watched the Iron Man movies, the Thor movies, the Captain America movies and the original Avenger's movie which I thought were all very good. I do tend to dislike squeals of excellent films because as we all know sequels of great films tend to never cut the mustard. one of the best examples of this would be The 3 squeals to the original pirates of the Caribbean movie, they have all be dreadful compared to the original however I am happy to report that Age of Ultron does not fit this pattern, it's a film with unparallelled action scenes and some outstanding acting performances. The story is a bit complicated if you don't know a lot about marvel but with a 5 minute explanation from a marvel geek and you will have no probs understanding the story. The theme itself centres on what can happen if we let artificial intelligence to its own devices, other themes include love, family bond, regrets and power. <br/><br/>The story line: I can understand why the story line could get criticised due to its reliance of things happening in the right place at the right time however I think that the story was well thought out, there were many twists and turns, for example we get to see that Hawk eye has a family which is untrue of any of the other avengers. This gives the story the chance to show the downside of being a superhero, the risk of having a family which is clearly seen with the scene between black widow and Bruce, both of them wanting children but are unable to have them. This for me is the reason why we see love between these two characters as they seem to have an excellent understanding between each other. I can see this match something that critics will dislike due to the unlikelihood of a relationship between an attractive assassin at the top of her game and a mad scientist with breath taking anger management issues :) but for me this was a very clever way to explore the deeper parts of the two characters. delving into the bulk of the storyline it essentially involves a crazed AI attempting to end the world, sounds a bit clichÃ© but the way it was told was very impressive, the ending of the story stems from a vision that Thor has, something tells him that he must complete an already stared piece of work, Ultron's clone. This clone had been half completed by Ultron himself then stark attempts to program Jarvis into its brain, he is stopped by the captain but Thor comes into finish the job and vision is born! Part Ultron, part Jarvis, part Thor, he holds the power of one of the five infinity stones and is essentially a god. This can be seen in my favourite part of the film when he picks up Thor's hammer and says 'but we have to go' this action confirms his Goddness due to you having to be as worthy as the God Thor to lift the hammer. The final part of the story is a typical American lets save everyone scene in which the world and civilians are saved from certain death. Where sadly we see the death of quicksilver. Acting performances Top spot goes to Mark Ruffalo with an excellent performance as Bruce Banner and the hulk. I really liked him in the first Avengers movie but in this movie he really was very good. We saw his dark side a little in this movie, from his inability to have children to the mad scientist creating Ultron. Robert Downey junior, Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth and hawk eye where typically good. (Surprisingly I actually really enjoyed hawk eye in the movie.) Scarlett Johansen was definitely a stand out in this movie but in my opinion this wasn't her finest performance in the marvel universe and last but by no certainty no means least was James Spader as Ultron. He really did nock it out of the park in this movie he really captured the essence of a crazed AI perfectly he only just misses out on the top spot to Ruffalo. Should you watch it? Most certiantly!!!! An excellent movie if you understand marvel or not action packed and with a good story behind it however this film may not appeal to adults whom are not marvel enthusiast's due to its lack of scenes that don't involve action but for anyone who just wants to see a fun, action packed, high budget blockbuster then I can't recommend Avengers Age of Ultron enough. (oh and p.s. I recommend watching the first avengers before you watch AOU)"

","I'd say if enjoyed the last Avengers? And really who didn't? This lives up to the last in every aspect. This one has Iron Man,The Hulk and has more robots. Even an ultra evil one with a good bit of humour. And when has evil robots ever been been a bad add in, for a comic or science fiction show? This all makes for A Hulk Smashing!, Hulk Busting!, Robot Blasting!, Robot Thrashing!, Good Time!!!<br/><br/>Actually the whole gang is back. And again in whole, the group is balanced off well in this comic epic. Was just stating at the start what really makes the show. Hulk and Iron Man. Iron Man in that Hulk buster battling Hulk was the shows stealer moment. Coming in next would be Ultron, an evil AI bent on destroying humanity and still managing to be an enduringly fun and funny memorable character. <br/><br/>But he is not the only one who has added some more action and fun drama to this second instalment. Nope there are some new interesting characters introduced. This is what makes Age of Ultron to myself even better then the last. Not going to spoil anything. This one did have more to offer. Still not perfect. But it's hard to be critical on a movie this mammoth."

It was a much more darker movie then the first one but I enjoyed it. <br/><br/>I am a superhero geek so I was never going to hate. I loved how they brought in the characters and how they were able to develop the characters a bit more this movie. Especially hawk eye.

","*Definitely Contains Spoilers* (I didn't want to write about spoilers but then I couldn't really express my feels otherwise.)<br/><br/>The film started out with a bang, lost it somewhere in the middle but ended strong.<br/><br/>First my complaints: I had such high expectations for this film that I was claiming it to be the best movie before even watching it, sadly it wasn't. Actually the first disappointment happened before the movie even started when the lady taking tickets informed me that I wouldn't be allowed to bring my Thor hammer in the theater even though I had brought it with me in the past to Thor 2 and Cap 2. Seriously it's just a toy.<br/><br/>Anywho, I forgot about that little fiasco as soon as the movie started, only to find that more disappointment was on the way. <br/><br/>The movie had so much potential but just didn't take the turn I was hoping for. I feel like it focused too much on uninteresting things such as the random ""romance"" between Black Widow and Hulk which seemed unfitting and out of place. I felt like the whole ""Hawkeye's farm"" secret was unnecessary, unwanted, as well as out of place. Plus it slowed the movie down in a dull sort of way. I only wouldn't have minded the overly zealous amount of attention on Hawkeye if he had been the one to die. No offense Hawkeye fans, but he was the most expendable. And it would have been a heroic death. Which brings me to my biggest disappointment: killing off a new character who had so much potential. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch (and Vision) were a nice change a pace for the movie and I was really looking forward to both of them in future movies. But who know's hopefully Scarlet Witch can bring him back somehow. ~On a side note of complaint: I was also disappointed with the lack of screen-time/lines/importance of Thor and Captain America in the movie. Thor was already hardly in the first one; he shows up practically half way through. ~On another side note of complaint: I was annoyed with the disrespectful digs directed towards Catholics to make jokes that weren't even funny.<br/><br/>I know this review doesn't really make sense, a high rating with lots of complaints and really I need to watch the movie again to give it a proper rating because the first time was difficult to pay attention due to the unimaginably, deafening volume blasting out of the speakers rumbling the whole theater and blowing up my heart (or was it perhaps the death of Quicksilver that did that?). Really though, having the volume full blast doesn't make it a better movie.<br/><br/>But all that aside, there were things, or rather characters, I enjoyed more than I expected in the movie such as: Vision, Quicksilver, Scarlet Witch and Ultron. There were entertaining fight scenes and character conflicts/interactions, likable characters, and a satisfying final fight scene.<br/><br/>In a a nutshell: Definitely not as good at the first one but still a good movie."

","This movie has got some bad reviews . People liked the first one better , but aren't we forgetting the second in the series is always a bit slow, but there is hope for something bigger and better coming our way. <br/><br/>The story is unfolding about the infinity stones , and this movie's main motive is just that , Ultron is just a byproduct of that . He is cool , with some cheesy lines , but lines will be cheesy .. its based on a comic book guys , they aren't known to be highly articulate. We have new characters 'The twins' as they are called , but i don't really see the resemblance . One is known as the Scarlet Witch and she is something , and for those who haven't watched this movie yet i wont go into it further. Then there is that guy , the fast , the cheeky Quicksilver , who is really quite fun. The best part apart from the fights and Hulk , are the stories of the Avengers. We want to know why is that guy like this , why is that gal like that , so we know now. There is also the romantic angle of Hulk and Black Widow.. but don't expect your songs and dances here.<br/><br/>This movie is about how things go bad even when you don't mean it , this movie is about the past, and the promises of the future . An installment you don't want to miss, it feels a bit dragged out in some parts but i feel something had to give if you have to set things up for the next in line.<br/><br/>Why watch this movie .. well there is Iron Man , Hulk , Back Widow , Capt.

"harryvader","9","0","3","19 May 2015"," A messy yet marvelous movie with its own ways of entertaining
","The Avengers in 2012 was a huge success. Not only did it entertain people all around the world by putting all its greatest heroes together, but it also pushed the Marvel Cinematic Universe onto the throne of one of the greatest movie series and one of the greatest ways of selling movies yet (Also Joss Whedon became more famous than ever, as a result of the movie). Of course, the movie's sequel, Avengers: Age of Ultron, is highly anticipated (DC fanboys who hate Marvel's guts are not included). But, is it better than the first one? <br/><br/>Avengers: Age of Ultron continued the ""Marvel style"" with many surprises and laughters (Not as much as Guardians of the Galaxy though), also tons of easter eggs. Joss Whedon did an amazing job keeping the actions ""fresh""; they were packed with extremely nerdy yet awesome and funny sequences throughout. The movie also smoothly inserted many easter eggs that are relevant to the Marvel Universe, they also made connections to Phase 3 of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, including the clues of the Infinity Stones, appearance of Thanos, cameo of Stan Lee, also the appearance of the name ""Jocasta"" (Who is Ultron's wife in the comics). <br/><br/>The movie was messy, because it has way too many characters, but it did a rather good job putting the characters all together, also giving the audiences more background stories of characters who do not have their own movies. While the first Avengers, in my opinion, did a horrible job pacing the story, the second one did a better job making a story that actually ""feels complete"" and more satisfactory.<br/><br/>The movie successfully depicted each Avenger more in depth, showing their individual fear through Scarlet Witch's illusions while the Avengers still remain their coolness Iron Man is still the one who always talks, Cap is still the encouraging one, Hulk is still the shocking one who did something just like SMASHING LOKI from the first Avengers movie. Surprisingly, Thor became a more funny and adorable character. As said before, we get to see more background stories for Hawkeye and Black Widow. The Maximoffs and Vision gave the audiences more of an eye-popping experience throughout the film. <br/><br/>As an antagonist, Ultron worths the price. Created by Industrial Light & Magic and voiced by James Spader, this menacing mechanical villain mastermind makes himself as lovely as Loki. Filled with philosophical yet funny phrases, Ultron threatens to destroy humanity with thousands of himself. Industrial Light & Magic did an amazing job making Ultron's appearance scary and threatening while James Spader's voice makes the character even more ghastly. Although the appearance of Ultron is scary enough, it turns out that he is also a very cute robot with his own ways of doing things, his attractive arrogance and his crazy thoughts. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, Age of Ultron was not as shocking as the first one, the movie could not give us the feelings we had when we first saw the Avengers assembling anymore, but it had many improvements on both the story and the pacing. So I wouldn't say it's necessarily better or worse than the first one.<br/><br/>Overall, Avengers: Age of Ultron is a marvelous movie with its own ways of entertaining. While impressed by the movie itself, I was also very happy to see that Marvel succeeded, not only because Marvel itself had hard works, but also because of all the supports and love from all the Marvel fans throughout the world, and that is what makes Marvel special, that is what makes Marvel marvelous."
"koushik-08254","7","0","3","17 May 2015"," spoiler alert: good movie, but big disappointed
","this is my first review...SPOILER ALERT, EVERYBODY.. after watching this movie, I can't help but feeling a little bit disappointed...hey, its a good action movie and is really entertaining...so first, i'll give the plus points of this movie. the storyline was good...and what I really liked about this movie was the grand scale of action...and yep, the new characters...scarlet witch was awesome, quicksilver...well, more on him later, and Paul Bettany nailed the vision to perfection!!! now, i'm afraid, i'm gonna have to, well, tear this movie apart. this movie fails in so many areas. firstly, the lead villain was pathetic. I mean, for god's sake, guys, I know humour is good and the MCU has its own signature humour, but a joke for every 5 minutes? I'm not saying that Ultron should be a typical evil comic book villain, but he's supposed to be a menacing, ruthless threat....and even as a non comic book fan, if you had watched the trailers, you will be disappointed..sure, James spader's voice is creepy, but by far he is a terrible villain(even scarlet witch does more damage to him). and secondly, the infinity stones plot diversion. I know that marvel has been building up towards this epic battle, but the way this has been inserted into the main story seems really forced. sure, joss whedon might have expanded that cave scene in the uncut version. but if they wanted this storyline, they should have given it full concern or it should not have been here at all. Thor could have simply popped up during the vision's intro and could have said""hey I went on a solo quest and these are the infinity stones blah blah "" and all that...you guys could have added those scenes in Thor 3.one of the best things about the avengers movie is that it stayed on its on story and never focused on any phase 2 movies. this movie does that. speaking of forced things, why the hell was there a romantic subplot between Natasha and Bruce?thank god, if ruffalo and Johanson might not have been on these roles, it could have been one of the worst pairs ever. it seems so forced into the movie and the previous movies never built it up. I mean, those lullaby scenes were quite....stupid!!! and Natasha, of all people, one of the strong female characters in the MCU..she is a train wreck here. and joss whedon...of all people....I never thought you would make her a damsel in distress...sure, I liked that twist in the red room storyline, but the romance starts off nowhere and ends nowhere.... the best character development is given to hawkeye and the worst is iron man. I mean, after all that""we create our own demons"" speech in iron man 3, he goes on to create Alton? man, he's more messed up. another underutilized character is quicksilver. aaron taylor Johnson's quicksilver dies even before the audience get to know him. I mean, couldn't they have saved him? sure the death comes out of nowhere, but it does not make a major impact. but aaron plays this guy to be a likable asshole, and as a character audiences want to see in future movies, unlike other characters(sorry hawkeye, you are cool and all, but...just no). remember when man of steel came out and everybody trolled it for being""OVERLY DESTRUCTIVE""? turns out, age of Alton is marvel's biggest 250 million dollars troll.well..in the climax, the avengers evacuvate the people out of the city. its not a bad thing, but how the hell can any body survive 18,000 feet in the air? and the helicarrier appearing out of nowhere..thats okay, but how the hell can it house an entire city? i'm not saying that this movie's bad. i'm just disappointed because this movie fails to match up not only against the first avengers movie, but also against my personal favourite phase movie: the winter soldier. I expect more from civil war."
"pvanstone","8","0","5","19 May 2015"," A good movie that needs to be seen twice
","This movie has been anticipate since the first teaser trailer came out last year. I have to say it did not disappoint. It bought the team back with an amazing action sequence where the avengers were facing off against a Hydra base. In the first two week of Avenger Age of Ultron I saw it twice. Once in 2D and once in 3D. Both time I was sitting in a good spot not too far away and not too close. This allowed me to catch all the action throughout the movie. <br/><br/>All six avengers are back with the same actors playing them. Tony Stark (Robert Downy Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), Bruce Banner/ Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). In the first scene we also meet the Maximoff Twin also known as Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver who are enhanced humans who have been artificially created. <br/><br/>After this first scene everything starts to cool down as Tony and Bruce try to make Ultron an artificial intelligence program that they want to make to protect the world. Well they succeed and Ultron is not what they expected instead of helping the human race he see them as a threat to the earth. So I'm guessing you know where this is going. <br/><br/>Things go wrong and it up to the avengers to stop him. Now there is the context and I do not want to spoil the movie. This movie is in the middle of the Marvel cinematic universe so it is here to set up so many movie in the future. For example there is a scene in the home country of the Black Panther who has a movie that is to be released in 2018. It also starts the tension between Tony Stark and Steve Rogers that is going to lead to the events that are going to happen in Captain America: Civil War. This movie for what is here to do is great but it's a filler movie to bring in new character and set up plot for other movies to come. Think of it like an ending scene at the end of the other Marvel movie but it's a whole movie. It's here to satisfy the fan so that they don't start saying ""Where the next Avengers Movie."" It bring together part that people are excited to see with many character that are to be seen. <br/><br/>The action is great and the story is good for people who know about comics and the story line that are coming up. You know what all the hints are in the movie. A major complaint I have is that it moves so fast once you get into one storyline and you're interested in that, the movie does a 360 on you and goes somewhere completely different. But this movie has made me excited for the movies to come so I am torn whether that was a complaint or a good thing in the movie. By the time you leave the movie theater your head is spinning I had to go see it twice to under enough understanding to write this. But I also understand why there were rushed story lines because they had a lot to get through in two and half hour movie even that is not enough time you can see where there are plot hole and where scenes were cut out. I want to see an extended director cut which in total honesty would probably increase the movies time by half an hour to a full hour which is the time they need to fix all the plot holes that come up. <br/><br/>Overall this was a great movie in my opinion but it's a set up movie it there to set up movie in the future which I am not complaining about I want the movie in the future and have a movie to set up all the movies in the future is fine by me. I personally would watch it again just so that I don't miss any of the details."
"feakes","Null","0","4","18 May 2015"," Behold The Vision .
","AVENGERS : AGE OF ULTRON, is that rare movie in which the second movie surpasses the first in every way. Here Joss Whedon builds on the first Avengers movie and expands on it. Adding layers. The action is explosive and impressive. The Story is a beautiful love story to the Avengers 50 year history. The film opens with the Avengers smashing a HYDRA Base and regaining Loki's wand from the first one. When the Avengers throw a farewell party for Thor who plans to return the wand to Asgard. Tony Stark and Bruce Banner decide to examine it and see what makes it tick. They discover the wand has a mind of its own and use it to their Ultron protective program. a program designed to protect the world and usher in a era of peace Except, The AI sees things differently. It decides that the greatest threat to mankind is mankind. and The greatest threat to Ultron is the Avengers. The film moves at a break neck speed. The fights are mouth dropping. but that's not the only important thing here. There is a actual story that is buried underneath the action. a subtle story about man over relying on machines and the need for heroes. A major step up over the first one in every way. And Paul Bettany steals the film as The Vision a android conceived to be the ultimate weapon. And instead becomes one of the Avengers. Worth seeing more then once."
"YoungCriticMovies","7","0","5","18 May 2015"," Age of the Blockbuster: Marvel Restrains its Director From Taking On A Auteristic Tone
","It's always hard to make sequels, especially sequels of highly successful films. The Avengers was a worldwide phenomenon back in 2012, it became the third highest grossing film of all time, and it established Marvel as the powerhouse of blockbusters. What was so successful in the first installment of The Avengers was its ability to bring so many stars together for one film. Director/writer Joss Whedon had managed to gather the likes of Iron Man (Robert Downey Jr.), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Hulk (Mark Ruffalo), Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson), and Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner). For the second go round, Whedon had a more challenging task of appealing to comic fan-boys, cinematic critics, and the stars themselves (with the every growing cast, screen time is becoming more difficult to administer), all while topping the first film. However, Whedon has magically managed to pull off a film that achieves a kind of balance in all of these aspects with the second installment of The Avengers, The Avengers: Age of Ultron.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron finds our Avengers saving the world yet again from the decaying terrorist organization Hydra (last seen in Captain America: The Winter Soldier). Iron Man (aka Tony Stark) talks with the Hulk (aka Bruce Janner) about the possibility of creating an AI army that would be able to protect the world from any more alien threats; as Tony Stark puts it, it would be ""like a giant suit of armor around the world."" However, we all know what happens when you deal with AI: it always ends up turning on its creator. Tony Stark's first experiment, Ultron (voiced by a perfect James Spader) breaks from the confines of Stark's computer named Jarvis (voiced by Paul Bettany), and decides that the main threat to the earth is the humans themselves. Ultron is also able to recruit other super humans: the mind reading Scarlett Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) and the super fast Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor- Johnson). The only ones that can stop Ultron are the Avengers (duh). So voila, great plot and high stakes!<br/><br/>Whedon hasn't signed on for the next two Avengers films in the saga, and the thing is: I can't blame him. Marvel wants a clear-cut blockbuster, but with Ultron you can see brief sparks of Whedon's wit and art; something, which you could also notice was being restrained by Marvels magnates. The problem with caging up a director that wants to take risks is that the film itself risks falling into dullness. Fortunately Whedon was able to slip a couple of his brushstrokes; we especially see this in possibly one of the best scenes in the film when all the Avengers attempt to pick up Thor's hammer. It was one of those awkward almost Tarantino-ish moments. These brief flashes of Whedon help make the film slip into being an enjoyable and quality blockbuster. But the big challenge for this film was balancing the huge cast, while keeping the story moving forward. No matter how skilled of a director you are, to achieve that task with perfect marks is impossible.<br/><br/>I think that Whedon's big victory here was giving the new cast and lesser-known characters more screen time. Elizabeth Olsen, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, James Spader, and even Jeremy Renner, Scarlett Johnasson, and Mark Ruffalo trumped the likes of Robert Downey Jr. and Chris Evans who we usually end up sick with by the end of the movie. This screen time shift allowed the audience to delve into small characters, but it also allowed for the narrative to not become redundant with the previous film. Whedon's handling of the cast was magnificent. You could tell he kept all of his actors happy by giving them a chance to actually act. He manages to get a romance conflict between the Avengers, and other emotional stakes are set with family, children, and especially each other. This adds to the humanity and to the audience's care for the characters, so that you can tell that if one of them perishes, you will be devastated. The best part of this emotional upping, however, was that Whedon pulled it off without sounding cheesy!<br/><br/>In terms of the acting, what I most appreciated was how serious the cast took their characters. It didn't feel like a Fast and Furious film where you refer to the people on the screen by the actor's name. In this blockbuster there were actual characters, who were deeply crafted and very multilayered. This character development also helps this film differentiate from the first film, and it keeps the audience's intrigue.<br/><br/>However, one must not go into these films expecting to see a film as legendary and exceptional as The Dark Knight. Marvel's objective with its films is to simply make you marvel at their visual effects (see what I did there), and to keep you coming for more. With Age of Ultron, we see Marvel apply this logic. An unfortunately it ends up making the fight scenes elongated and even repetitive. But hey! What are you expecting from this type of film?<br/><br/>In the end Whedon manages to pull off a satisfying sequel that moves the Marvel universe closer to its final clash of the Guardians of the Galaxy and Avengers franchises. The blockbuster in requirement in Age of Ultron ends up sucking up too much of Whedon's freedom so that there is much less story in the film than there should be (for a two and a half hour film). Even so, the film is entertaining so you are never left bored for more than a couple of minutes, and while the jokes are starting become tacky like in the Die Hard and Fast and Furious films, most of them were able to hit home."

","I was very concerned after reading some of the negative reviews. After finally seeing the flick after a late release overseas, I don't think the movie could've been much better for my expectations, though I do understand why some viewers don't quite agree. No movie can cater to everyone's taste. It just depends on what you're trying to get out of it and what you're expecting. If you're looking for some concoction of profundity or depth, this is simply not the right genre. If you think it lacks character building, my opinion is that you've gotta be realistic with respect to the number of characters and the limited film duration. There had also been plenty of opportunities in the previous standalone films for character building. The film did move at a frenetic pace, requiring a fairly comprehensive spectrum of knowledge and familiarity with the MCU in order to keep up as well as to fully comprehend and appreciate all the seemingly minute but essential details, which, if connected together effectively, would've made the experience much more rewarding. At the end of the day, I'm very pleased with the product, and I will continue to be an avid fan of the MCU. Looking very much forward to the rest of the films in the Avengers franchise."

Granted, the inventor creates something that goes haywire plot is a tad predictable, and Quicksilver is not a character that you will care about. Other than that, this film is golden! The action is definitely better than the original, I was on the edge of my seat at some points.... but how can I not mention the Hulkbuster scene?! It's just amazing from start to finish, and it mixes humor and fighting very well. The 3D is also extremely cool, most namely the opening action scene, which had a shot that got butterflies in my stomach. The comedy is consistently laugh-out loud funny, especially the Hulk gets punched several times one(the whole entire theater was laughing like crazy when that came along). I was also impressed by Ultron, who is both a ruthless villain who wants to destroy the world and a lovable robot that cracks several funny jokes. The characters will pull your emotional strings because of how well-written they are, and will leave you with a grin when they fight. Age Of Ultron is a must-see for everyone and you will be satisfied."

","I honestly think that Age of Ultron is better then previous film. It has better jokes, atmosphere character development and many other things. For me, this is a perfect sequel, just like Terminator 2 was. Im not saying that Age of Ultron is as good as Terminator 2, but it surely is worth watching. The movie ads 2 ""new"" characters to the Avengers Universe. They call them ""enchanced"", but they are really mutants from the x- men universe. I don't really like them, and I think that they are the biggest flaw in the movie. All of the characters in the movie have its own back story, which are surprisingly deep. The movie last for two hours and 20 minutes, and in its runtime it packs a tone of action, some twists and turns, epic moments, emotions, character development and many other things. It improves over its predecessor in every single way. Also, I would like to say that cinematography in this movie is perfect. In action scenes you can see what every single hero is doing, even if they are separate from each other. This is how today's action movie should be made, I recommend this movie to every action movie fan, and others."

But it was. It started off with an amazing opening sequence, filled with amazing action sequence. Which started of a hilarious gag of 'Caps Bad Language' restriction. ""Cap said a bad language word... Cap wouldn't like that word... Did anyone else just realise Cap said language"" I thought it was hilarious. The action sequences were thrilling, as well as putting me on the edge of my seat. There was emotional scenes, those involving Natasha Romanoff and Bruce Banner. The Avengers hallucinations were terrifyingly good. The end battle was intense but it showed that the Avengers are the Earths Mightiest Heroes. I nearly cried at the end. Also, it was nice to notice that Clint Barton's 10(ish) year old son was reading Diary of a Wimpy Kid book, as well as it was nice to know that the last 10 mins was recorded in Norwich, my home town. Amazing film."
"AkelaLoneWolf","8","0","3","16 May 2015"," Still enticing as a sequel
","I was worried that this Avengers sequel would be less exciting than the first, given to understand it would not feature the favourite villain Loki and by now the thrill of having so many superheroes gather together would have worn off. I needn't have been so concerned; Marvel has successfully developed the characters of this (unlikely) team and added new elements such that the audience bask in the familiarity yet still enjoy the fresh chemistry of interactions among them. The ""creation"" of Ultron was natural given the megalomanic nature of Tony Stark - this somehow bringing out the moral that good intentions lead to hell - and the divergence and reaction of the team in face of self-created disaster was powerful drama. Since Ultron was too strong an adversary, allies and additions to the Avengers were necessary and these turns in the story did not, fortunately, have an artificial ""forced"" feeling to them. An interesting point was the twins were in fact characters from other tales of the Marvel universe, and Thor's hammer and ""worthiness"" was a recurrent joke. The use of stunts (given that Scarlett Johansson was eight months pregnant in the later part of filming) was masterly, and the resolution of the endgame crisis was much more realistic than other Marvel movies - with casualties, wounded hearts and broken spirits. Very good entertainment and I look forward to the next one in the series - did the post-credit scene suggest a marriage between the Avengers and the Guardians of the Galaxy I wonder? In that case, sweet anticipation."
"paul_3-960-896774","8","0","3","14 May 2015"," Age of Ultron is Whedon's response to the nitpickers for The Avengers
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is action packed we jump right into the action, it's thrilling, exciting, and more importantly much more layered than I thought it would be. We all know these characters but what happened here is that we get to see them. Who they are and how they are when they're not protecting/avenging something. The first movie was basically the meet-up, ""the first day at school"" but now they all know each other, they've been working together for some time and you can feel and see it in this movie. Age of Ultron goes deeper with the relationship between the Avengers, and it goes deeper into the characters' personalities. Black Widow's back story is definitely the most interesting one, it gave her an emotional layer that she didn't really have. It made me feel like we finally got a glimpse of who she is deep down - who Barton knows her to be.<br/><br/>Speaking of Barton, he is in Age of Ultron what Hulk was in The Avengers. He kind of steal the show, he has some funny scenes, and through him Whedon addresses most of the criticism made to The Avengers and particularly to the ones about Hawkeye. It is almost like Clint Barton is pulling a Deadpool on us by breaking the fourth wall because he is very aware of how his character was treated in the first movie and how his weapon of choice might not be the best for a battle against robots. He's maybe not addressing the audience directly but he might as well. <br/><br/>In contrast to Barton, Hulk was actually like I expected him to be in the first film, slightly tortured, complex, and not completely comfortable with what he is. I'll admit it doesn't perfectly add up to the Hulk we've previously seen but I chucked it up to Banner having battle fatigue. As for his romance with Natasha, Widow made me buy into in once she explained why she liked him.<br/><br/>As villains go, Ultron was a worthy one. He was smart, sarcastic, and has a child-like innocence in his ruthlessness. Some might like Loki a little bit more but to me it's due to the fact that we've got to know Loki in a few films over the years, and it's jealousy that fuels him something we can all relate to and that Ultron does not have. As for Baron Von Strucker was window dressing in the movie - not that I was expecting a lot more of him - his real purpose was to introduce the twins in the end-credit scene in Captain America: The Winter Soldier.<br/><br/>Whatever you may thing about their East Europeans accents Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver were pretty cool. They're powerful, they're new, and at the same time you could feel them striving for more so they quite seamlessly joined the team. They were avengers from the beginning, they had something to avenge from the start.<br/><br/>One of the good things with Avengers: Age of Ultron is that from start to finish the story is easily followed and we can already see the ramification the events in the film will have but the interest stays intact.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron is definitely less Disney. It's darker, more serious, and adult but children can obviously enjoy as well that what the comic relieves are for. What took it up a notch was the danger factor, there's a death in the film - a real one I hope. @wornoutspines"

","Well I have seen a couple of the Marvel Studios movies, and for me, this is the most enjoyable yet. I know it is just building plot, and is its own entity, so I will not compare it to any other movie the studio has made... call me crazy...<br/><br/>First I would like to say that the movie has very good pacing... it does not leave you feeling exhausted from too much action at once. It seems attention was paid to a normal enjoyable human attention span, (which is about an hour.) <br/><br/>The portion of the film which takes place at the safe house was a welcome breather in the intensity of the film. In an age where most pictures tend to brutalize the human attention span, this one seemed a throw back to the days when a film reached the halfway mark, there would be a music intermission and people could get up and go to the bathroom or concession... (which is good for the theater business?) <br/><br/>I would really like to see intermissions in movies again. a little break makes viewing so much more enjoyable... having said that though... the break was nice.<br/><br/>Now concerning character development, there have been some complaints about it, but if one has any idea about where Marvel is taking all their films, there would not be as much complaining probably. It will all make sense in the end all ye who are in doubt.<br/><br/>Now the trailer definitely painted a different tone for the picture than the tone that was actually on display when I saw it. I was glad for that. It was not as dark and depressing as I thought it would be. Through my revealing Source, I actually felt it would be a good film for me to see, to my semi surprise. It was indeed family friendly, (and even had a scene with Hawkeyes family sharing some bonding time), It was more comforting and fun than I thought it would be.<br/><br/>The action and humor were blended together well in a hopeful manner. It was nice to see, after a temporary set back, the Avengers rally to just trounce the baddies... smashing em to wittle itty bitty pieces, while at the same time being able to save the lives of hundreds, maybe a thousand people? Then Thor and Mr. Starke work together to created a breathtaking smashy smashomrama that seriously registered on the wow factor scale.<br/><br/>Thanks to all who were involved in the making of this film. If you did not like it, I know of the Way you could reprogram yourself so that you could like it. Trust me it would be worth your time! Avengers!... are sweet... so is the Life... Vision seems to be connected a little bit in a very deep philosophical way that transcends normal cultural comprehension. <br/><br/>May God bless Marvel, America, and all of you."

","Another year, another Marvel movie, and this time, the heroes are facing their greatest threat yet...A hype train. Last year's one-two punch combo of ""The Winter Soldier"" and ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" sees the studio sitting on a pile of money and critical praise. Now comes the sequel to the Avengers. It brings the earth's mightiest heroes, Iron Man, Captain America, Black Widow, Hawkeye, Hulk, and Thor together again, and this time they're fighting the biggest baddie of them all: Ultron(James Spader), intent on making a city into a comet to evolve humanity by destroying it...or something. James Spader was a fantastic choice, and his menacing voice and evilly pompous personality could make for a great villain...if the end didn't come down to him splitting himself into multiple copies, and having those copies attack everything that moves. For the smartest Avengers villain yet, his plan is remarkably similar to EVERY OTHER ONE. Ultron is aided by Scarlet Witch(Elizabeth Olson) and Quicksilver(Aaron Taylor Johnson) who both do serviceable as both lesser bad guys and reluctant heroes. They are, however, hindered by some bad Russian accents. From the opening scenes, it's clear that the formula of dialog from the first Avengers film is still here. That's great. Witty banter gives way to strangely thought-provoking statements, and some cutting-edge meta humor thrown in there for good measure. Joss Whedon(Creator of Firefly, Buffy, and Angel) is a master at this sort of thing, and he's back in his element. In fact, the standout scenes in the movie are the quiet ones. Hawkeye's conversation with someone very special who I will not reveal, Ultron's many monologues that bounce between philosophical and hilarious, and a fantastic party scene all come to mind. There are bits of dialogue in this film that sound like poetry, like when Ultron comments that he enjoys the ""geometry of belief"" in reference to a church being in the center of a town. However, the problems come from his trying to re-create the magic of the first film too much. The opening action scene is all shot in the one-take style that made the final scene of the 1st film so memorable. This time around, it's hindered by bouncy CGI, especially where Thor is concerned. His hammer doesn't look like it's connecting with anything, and the laws of physics are so bent that everything begins to feel pointless. This stuff is absolutely unacceptable in a movie of this size. It's refreshing that the film isn't too dark, like the trailers suggest, because that's not what these films are supposed to be. However, it certainly looks dark. The vibrant colors of Avengers 1 are replaced with drab yellows and whites that look good in Fincher films, not summer blockbusters. The issue of battle fatigue that films like ""Guardians"" have so masterfully avoided rears it's ugly head in ""Ultron."" Instead of a thrill ride, the final action scene is a slog, with almost no audience reaction in my theater. The cast is in fine form, and their chemistry is palpable...except for the most out of left field romance I've seen in a film of this kind. Bruce Banner and Black Widow's dialogue and actions toward each other are about as subtle as a punch from the Hulk, and about as well-written. There are other problems too, some plot holes, some storytelling. Overall though, fanboys will love it, casual fans like me will have fun, but the joy stops there, something that could not be said about Guardians, Cap 2, or the 1st Avengers."
"shadowyx12","8","0","3","13 May 2015"," Age of Ultron isn't as captivating as its predecessors, but serves as a satisfying continuation of the story lines already established in the MCU.
","Age of Ultron picks up right after the mid-credits scene in The Winter Soldier - with the Avengers trying to reacquire Loki's staff from Hydra. Meanwhile, Tony Stark secretly tries to develop his Ultron program - a program that uses an artificial intelligence to protect the world. Of course, things go wrong and the team is brought back together to deal with Earth's newest threat.<br/><br/>Is this the best movie in the MCU? No - absolutely not.<br/><br/>But is Age of Ultron a good movie? ...Yes. <br/><br/>But there is a line - the movie has it fair-share of problems (a number of them being the fault of Marvel Studios), but I believe Whedon did what he could to meet the expectations set forth by his bosses and audiences. The movie is unbelievably overstuffed - with new characters, old rivalries, and the continuation of the Infinity Gauntlet storyline - it can be a lot to take in. Unfortunately, it's overstuffed storyline can be a turn-off for many people - with the exception of hardcore fans who care more about the overall universe set forth in the films.<br/><br/>The film's overstuffed storyline also detracts from many of the existing characters we know and love. Sure, they all get their fair share of screen time and action, but most of them don't receive any further character development (which I didn't mind too much since some of them have their own films). They all pretty much remain the same at the end of the film - with the exception of a couple of characters. Yes, many of them don't grow in soul or spirit in this film, but we can expect them to in their upcoming films.<br/><br/>When it comes to pacing, we can come to expect the old formula that Marvel has been using for their previous films. It's pretty predictable - but well balanced at the same time. The comedy is a aplenty; however, there are jokes that happen at inappropriate times. You might find yourself frowning instead of laughing in these moments.<br/><br/>One should also note that this instalment contains a lot more action than any of the previous films (especially the first Avengers film). While I'm personally glad there are several well-made action set pieces throughout the film (they are quite spectacular on the big screen), other viewers might suffer from fatigue and become bored of it all.<br/><br/>If there were one thing that truly stood out for me, it would be the conflicts that each Avenger has with their own team. Building on the first Avengers film, Whedon manages (although hastily) to elevate the tension that already exists within the super-powered team. It allows the viewer to wonder about the potential impacts that these characters will have on the team, and the future disasters that can occur as a result.<br/><br/>Age of Ultron may not live up to some of our higher expectations (it certainly doesn't work as a standalone film), but one cannot deny that it serves the ever-expanding MCU quite well.<br/><br/>VERDICT: Who am I kidding, of course you're going to see this film in theatres (unless you've already become sick of the whole superhero genre)."
"ydnar123","Null","0","3","7 May 2015"," Might be my favorite Marvel film ever
","Avengers Age of Ultron is likely going to be the best experience I've had in a theatre this year and it is the best I've had in a long time. This is just a fun film. All of the main cast members of the original film return for the sequel and the chemistry is as good as ever. The comedy is great I love the jokes that are scattered throughout the movie. Robert Downey Jr is of course amazing as Iron Man but he is just so funny in this movie and this is probably the funniest I've seen him. One of the downsides of the original film is there is not quite enough Hulk but there is lots of him in this film. The action sequences are amazing and there are so many stunts in the film that leave you in awe. Hawkeye gets more attention in this film as well and we learn more about his character which only makes the movie better. After this movie Hawkeye may not be considered the dud Avenger. Plus there are great classic performances from Chris Evans and Scarlett Johansson. Now there are also some new additions which I think are all added well and all are good strong characters. Quicksilver was certainly an interesting character I liked the effects they used when he ran and I also enjoyed Scarlet Witch who has already been confirmed as a returning character in the future. Then we have Vision who is amazing but doesn't get as much screen time as I would like but will likely play a bigger part in the coming films. Finally we have the villain Ultron. Ultron was not what I expected but he was not a disappointment either. James Spader does an excellent job for the voice but when I watched the trailer it looked like Ultron was going to be a villain we could love that was dark and complex. He is more sarcastic and funny than anything. I liked Ultron but I did not love him. The only other problem I have with this movie is I thought it needed to be longer. Director Joss Whedon has said already that the film was originally 3 hours long but 40 minutes were cut. I hope that when the film is released on DVD and Blu Ray we will get a chance to see the directors cut and I may even enjoy it more. This movie could very well be my personal favorite Marvel film and so far it is my favorite movie this year. I recommend that you watch Age of Ultron in the theatre and not a home because it is a great experience."
"PWNYCNY","9","0","3","7 May 2015"," Out of control technology.
","What a movie! Another high-tech extravaganza. It required an army of people to produce it. And the result? A highly imaginative science fiction story. The story poses a simple question; What is one to do when artificial intelligence goes berserk and wants to destroy the entire planet? It's similar to the Frankenstein story, except taken to an astronomically higher level. And this monster has infinitely greater destructive power. And whereas the Frankenstein monster had the trappings of being human (although he was not), the creation in this movie is entirely non-organic, making it incredibly more lethal. What makes the story even more fascinating is how it takes an consortium of superheroes to finally bring matters under control. To that point, it is all-out war, with the population of the globe caught in the middle. It is total pandemonium on a worldwide scale. Yet the renegade AI can't be assigned total blame for causing the mayhem. It happened through carelessness, not malicious intent. The AI was already programed; that better care was not taken to prevent what happens is entirely attributable to the human factor."
"rmsccbm","5","0","5","7 May 2015"," I liked it... A bit
","As I Got back from the avengers I knew I had to review it. The action was really well done, sometimes flawless. The scenes with all the heroes bantering more than made up for the 2 hour plus run time. Ultron was a fantastic villain. His comedic harshness and sense of evil presence added to his very well developed character. I also loved the inclusion of Vision. His scenes, though limited were very entertaining and fun to see progress. Hulk/ Bruve Banner was a very weak character oh my gosh was his and Black Widows romance ever forced.as expected there was amazing CGI through the film. It really took the glass to reality in some scenes. Andy Serkis's cameo was cool to see but it was short lived and felt obligatory. It slowed the story down a bit and added to more unnecessary runtime. Quicksilver and Scarlet Witch were good but weakly developed. There were some major pacing issues near the start that made the first act seem boring and unwatchable. However it still is a very well made film and it sets up the rest of the MCU projects well."
"rogerdarlington","Null","0","3","5 May 2015"," Once more into the breach, dear superheroes
","Joss Whedon has done it again. The man who directed and wrote the hugely successful ""Avengers Assemble"" has performed the same roles with the same achievement with this sequel. The first movie was challenging enough with its deployment of no less than six S.H.I.E.L.D superheroes, but this time - as well as Ironman (Robert Downey Jr), Captain America (Chris Evans), Thor (Chris Hemsworth), the Incredible Hulk (Mark Ruffalo}, Hawkeye (Jeremy Renner) and Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) - we have new villains in the shape of the Maximoff twins, Pietro/Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Wanda/Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) plus the eponymous Ultron (voiced by James Spader), not to mention assorted other characters.<br/><br/>So, at first viewing, it's not always clear what's going on but the whole thing is a visual treat and I was fortunate enough to experience it on the Sky Superscreen in 3D at London's O2 Arena. The pacing is superb: it opens with a big action sequence and closes with a huge action battle and, in between quieter interludes alternate with lots more action. All the superheroes get to show off their very individual talents but they are seen to blend as a team and two of them are starting to become emotionally involved. Inevitably, a city gets trashed but this time it isn't New York but somewhere called Sokovia."
"Quentintarantado","8","0","4","5 May 2015"," Overall, nice, but I think Ultron went about it the wrong way.
","Spoilers: Personally, I like the movie myself. However, this is a minor thought, and I could be wrong, but raising a city that high then flinging it down, even with rockets, does not seem to be enough to create an Extinction Level Event. I think an asteroid, a mere 1.5 kilometers in width, brought down from space at 45,000 kph will have enough kinetic energy to lay waste to mankind. Not as spectacular nor as cinematic as Ultron's ""raising a city"", and there's no chance for the Avengers to waste their time saving civilians, but it's a sure thing. In Gurren Lagann, (one of my favorite anime now) the Anti-Spirals planned to send the moon down to earth. That's a 3,500 km in diameter sphere from a distance of 365,000 km away. And this will spiral in, remember, not just bump the earth like in billiards, so the tidal effects will lay waste to the earth's surface before it enters our atmosphere. I like the numbers in that. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gurren_Lagann"

","""Eugene O'Neill long."" Tony Stark (Robert Downey Jr.) about an active Avengers' day<br/><br/>The bad news is that Avengers: Age of Ultron is not only long (141 min.) but also overstuffed like thanksgiving turkey that keeps giving until you can't take it anymore. Yet, the film is filling, that is, filled with explosive set pieces and characters aplenty. If any summer hero movie could have been split in two or three, this one could.<br/><br/>The good news is that it is fun, as always. Writer-director Joss Whedon has peppered the dialogue with smarts, like the above quote (I just sat through an O'Neill play, so I get it) and when Stark describes their challenge: ""This is going to be like finding a needle in the world's biggest haystack... fortunately, I brought a magnet!"" It's not that quips have been absent from other Marvel hero flicks, it's just that this iteration is filled with them. Unfortunately they are sometimes lost among the loud ubiquitous explosions.<br/><br/>I understand the need to appeal to young males and therefore to load the sci-fi thriller with testosterone, but this much is a loss for the more humanistic elements such as the intriguing love affair between the Black Widow (Scarlett Johansson) and Hulk (Mark Ruffalo). Consider also the fascinating youngsters, twins Quicksilver (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) and Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen), who have powers capable of subduing the Avengers. So much story waiting in so many characters yet so much fighting.<br/><br/>Having just enjoyed Ex Machina, about artificial intelligence, I was pleased that beyond the special effects in Avengers lies a treatise on the dangers of man playing God, a lesson we have not learned from Frankenstein to 2001 to this film. Yet, something is there to be enjoyed when we can be cautioned about our pride through art.<br/><br/>So enjoy the first blockbuster of the summer. There is goodness in the mayhem: We learn to adjust to civility as we evolve, we hope, into higher beings: ""The world adjusts, evolves to live with changes."" Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson)"

Well, Age of Ultron actually did what many thought of as impossible. It tops the first Avengers film. How do you top a masterpiece? By delivering the same fun, action and humor but adding more complexity and more depth. Whedon and company should be commended for taking it to the next level even if most people thought those heights weren't even possible given the love for the first film.<br/><br/>I guess it shouldn't be such a surprise because Marvel has set this up from the start and have done so delivering some instant classics along the way. Most every solo hero film has been rewarding in some way or another. In this instant classic, they combined the greatness of what we've already seen but added even more epic elements. No other franchise gets individual solo films to develop a film's characters. They had the budget and the right guy in place and he made it all work.

Ultron was formidable and I loved James Spader being the voice of Ultron. His voice was menacing when needed, cryptic when needed and even jocular. I thought a jocular Ultron was unnecessary but I could see how the levity angle would go over well with kids.<br/><br/>There were new characters introduced, which is always a treat. And nothing allows the Avengers to display their talents better than the entire world being in jeopardy.<br/><br/>The movie started off with excitement. Right away we were thrust into a battle between the Avengers and Hydra.

Iron-Man fans got healthy doses of Iron-Man, Thor fans likewise, Hulk got some nice screen time, as did Cap, Hawk-eye and Natasha. Some of the better scenes were the team work between Thor and Captain America.

In fact, I need that humor to keep me engaged, and Marvel understands my sense of humor well.<br/><br/>Spader's Ultron is hilarious to me, but still evil enough to be understood as the bad guy in this classic good guys vs. bad guys superhero story. I appreciate the further development of Clint aka Hawkeye and an attempt to further develop Nat and Bruce, however it seems possible to me that perhaps Natasha was using her spy skills to try and keep Bruce with the team and may have only been saying what she felt Bruce wanted to hear.

","Avengers: Age of Ultron- PG-13, 2015 ➡️Marvel's ""Avengers: Age of Ultron"" is by no means perfect but, it is a lively and beautiful mess of a film that will undoubtedly leave a smile plastered on your face upon leaving the theater. Joss Whedon returns to the directing chair and does a bang-up job of helming the sequel to one of the biggest summer blockbusters of all time. Our favorite Marvel superheroes (including some great new additions) are back and better than ever in what becomes their most arduous battle yet. They are confronted with the malevolent Ultron (James Spader) who began from within the group and, because of his unique inception, begins to tear the group apart at the seams. Constant mind-boggling action, great character moments, and some choice comedic situations help to set this film apart from other generic superhero films. Age of Ultron is one superhero film, flaws and all, that is here to stay. Age of Ultron represents escapist summer blockbuster cinema at its finest and I ate up almost everything about it. The ensemble cast played off of each other excellently and their performances increased my affinity for each individual character. Marvel finally has another formidable villain on their hands in Ultron who is a layered and surprisingly comedic villain. The negative side to his character, and one of my main problems with the film, is that his motives were unclear and forced. his hatred towards the Avengers was not earned. It felt shoe-horned into the script. The greatest sins this film committed though include its uneven pacing and convoluted plot. Maybe this is my spoiled, novelty-craving self saying this but, I thought the first Avengers was a more balanced and, ultimately, better film. There is still lots of fun to be had with Age of Ultron as it is a close 2nd. It must be seen on the biggest screen possible. Marvel films are the best at combining fantastical action with true heart and Age of Ultron continues this signature characteristic. Avengers AOU is a rousing, albeit flawed, summer blockbuster that took me on an emotional roller-coaster I thoroughly wanted to remain on long after the curtain call! I give AOU a #8/10"

","Avengers: Age of Ultron is the sequel to 2012's The Avengers and the 11th film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. The film is written and directed by Joss Whedon and boasts a huge cast including; Robert Downey Jr., Chris Evans, Chris Hemsworth, Mark Ruffalo, Scarlett Johansson, Jeremy Renner, Samuel L Jackson, Don Cheadle, Aaron Taylor-Johnson, Elizabeth Olsen, Paul Bettany, Cobie Smulders, Anthony Mackie, Hayley Atwell, Idris Elba, Stellan Skarsgård and James Spader.<br/><br/>This was one of my most anticipated films of this year and it had a lot to live up to, every single Marvel movies seems to up itself and get better, especially the last 2 films, Captain America: The Winter Soldier and Guardians Of The Galaxy which are my favourite so far, and i'm glad to say Avengers: AOU didn't let me down but i had a few problems with it, that didn't make me enjoy as much as the two films i just mentioned.<br/><br/>The story of the film is pretty complicated because of the various plots going on but the main plot is Ultron, Tony Stark with help from Bruce Banner help create a A.I that would stop The Avengers having to go and risk their lives for the world, and that this new A.I, Ultron could prevents disasters from happening first, but when Ultron is created he realises that humanity is the real problem and tries to vanquish them all and start all over again, so The Avengers have to deal with this threat they created from within. This is enough story for the film, yet there are various side plots that feel like they are just build up for the upcoming films in the Marvel universe instead of helping this story. One of the weakest side plots was when new addition, Scarlett Witch, uses her powers to give The Avengers nightmares, which was interesting but these didn't really lead anywhere, especially Thor's which seemed like a lot of set-up for his next movie, Thor: Ragnorok, and makes me think a lot of this film got left on the cutting room floor, Whedon said that the first cuts was over 3 hours long so they definitely took a lot out of the film, which i think was a disservice but you can't have a 3+ hour movie. Also the main villain Ultron, he was a great character but i think his evolution was rushed in the film, i would of liked him to start off good and then realise that humanity was the problem in the world instead of being there from the get go.<br/><br/>Moving on to the good things in the film, the dialogue between the characters were just as witty and funny as in the first film, maybe even better thanks to Whedon's writing, i thought the 4 new main characters were great; The Maximoff twins' Quicksilver and Scarlett Witch were great additions to the team, there powers were really cool, especially Scarlett Witch's which had a big effect on the story of the film. The other new avenger, Vision, was also amazing to see on screen, Paul Bettany did a really good job of playing this android who was just born very well, he had a scene which blew my mind when he lifted up Thor's hammer which immediately shows you what kind of character he is. Ultron was the last new character and he was a great imposing and intimidating villain, not as good as Loki but he was close, i thought it was really interesting that he was a lot like his maker, Tony Stark, even did the same funny quips that Tony Stark would do, but i was disappointed that they didn't focus on that too much because Ultron is really like Tony Stark a worryingly amount that could be foreshadowing for Tony Stark doing something really terrible to try and help humanity. <br/><br/>Of course the returning Avengers were better than ever, Captain America was a bad-ass, head of the team who had some really interesting stuff to do in the film, trying to keep everyone on the same side, Iron Man really messed up by creating Ultron and feels really bad about it but he still has time for his funny lines and has one of the best scenes in the film in his hulkbuster armor fighting The Hulk which was amazing, speaking of The Hulk he wasn't as impressive as in the first Avengers when he was the highlight of the film but he was still good here, Bruce and Black Widow had a very strange relationship story-line which was really good because they are both such messed up characters that it was nice to see them messed up with each other. But the standout of the returning Avengers is Hawkeye, after the first Avengers when Hawkeye was a mind controlled drone of Loki, it was nice to see the real Hawkeye this time round, he had some great lines and we got to meet his family which added to how we looked at the character, they also did a really good job of making it look like Hawkeye was going to die in this film, every-time any character in the film was talking about death, it would cut to Hawkeye and they put him in peril a lot, to do the swap at the end of the film and have Quicksilver was a great change to what i thought was going to happen and worked great and will also give Scarlett Witch some great character development in the films to come.<br/><br/>There is really too much to talk about in the film, i really enjoyed the film but i think it was too much for one film, and that it messed up some of the pacing for the film, but i still loved it and can't wait to see it again."
"damonous","9","0","3","3 May 2015"," Amazing Balancing Act
","My initial thought as the credits rolled was: Not quite as good as the first Avengers, but..."" And, that ""but"" was immediately followed with ""I have to see it again, because there are more layers here that I wasn't able to completely appreciate and absorb"" in the midst of all the depicted chaos.<br/><br/>Sometimes, you just have to wonder what it really IS that people want. Do not buy the words of those saying that this has a thin story. While the basic premise is fairly simple, Ultron is a unique and fairly complicated villain. There are 3 other new characters (Elizabeth Olsen as Scarlet Witch, Aaron Taylor-Johnson as Quicksilver and Paul Bettany as Vision). While they could've had more development and screen-time in a much longer movie, they are solid enough to enjoy.<br/><br/>Which leads to the summary title of this review: the film is really an amazing balancing act. I'm not sure how director Joss Whedon does it, but he's able to take a thousand moving parts, join them and make them interesting, drop wallops of action on top, AND even add dashes of subtlety that will bring you back for more. Which leads back to the beginning of my review: there are issues he throws out with ease around 'the responsibility of being a superhero' (the impact on what it means to their everyday lives), 'what it means to be a robotic slave', and even 'what it means to be a new type of AI'. None of these things are dwelt upon indefinitely, but this is the 'richness' that Whedon brings to his 'superhero cake'. It's not as deep in those tones as Captain America: The Winter Soldier was to 'the danger of government having too much spy power', but it's what makes the movie MORE than just a pile of punching and bashing.<br/><br/>For longtime comics fans, the origin of Ultron and the Vision are altered somewhat...but in a way that I can't fault Whedon for. While I was maybe a little dissatisfied in the change to Vision, on counterpoint, there were a couple of really cool things done with his genesis. And Bettany in the full garb is another fantastic 'ripped from the page' embodiment of the comics. At the end of the day, unless they were going to spread the origin of these characters out across multiple movies, the way it is handled is just completely sensible from a point of narrative.<br/><br/>So, while I still think that (for now) I'd rate Avengers: Age of Ultron a little below the first Avengers (which really was lightning in a bottle, and finally such magnificent proof that ""Yes, it IS possible to have so many heroes in one enjoyable movie"")...I'm anticipating that successive viewings will eventually raise that score, potentially above the first. There's just so many fine layers to Whedon's Superhero Cake."
"mod04105","8","0","4","3 May 2015"," Avengers; Age of Ultron Review
","Avengers Age of Ultron was an amazing experience for me to watch. It's a little bit more fast-paced that other Marvel productions. It didn't have that much plot like in the first Avengers, but it definitely had a lot more of fun action-packed sequences to watch and was a lot funnier. I have never heard so much laughter come from a full-house movie theater audience watching a Marvel movie in my whole life. I think, personally, this movie would have had some more plot if it didn't have cut a 1/2 hour of footage. There were some pieces that would have made more sense with some more explanation in the movie. This movie did have a lot of characters,unlike other Superhero films, but it's an Avengers films; they need plenty of characters to interact with each other in order to have that 'Superhero Team-Up Feeling'. AoU was a little over advertised on TV with the millions of different TV spots, but I was still shocked by certain events in the movie, even though I saw too many trailers and previews and did some research of the film. <br/><br/>Was I happy walking out of the theater after the movie was over? Yes. I can't lie about that. <br/><br/>Was I satisfied? Not fully. There were some minor downers, but it's hard to make a sequel to a movie with so many characters and so many expectations. Even with the downers, it had some surprisingly awesome moments that made the movie entertaining. <br/><br/>Do I think this movie will help set up a big chunk of future titles in the MCU? Totally. 100%. You can see how this movie will help set up Phase 3 of Marvel and how some of the characters will act during the next phase. <br/><br/>Overall, I give this an 8 out of 10. Not bad for a sequel, but not the greatest sequel of all time. It's still a pretty good movie to watch. I'd recommend it."
"kc-49817","8","0","4","3 May 2015"," Great fun with a few glaring flaws
","Firstly, Age of Ultron is a good movie. I'm going to pick apart a few mingling annoyances. But these are still minor gripes, and ultimately, this is the most fun I've had in a theater since Guardians of the Galaxy. I did not leave the theater thinking I'd wasted time and money, I left enthusiastically chatting with my viewing companions about what would happen next.<br/><br/>Which, in a way, is my biggest criticism of the film. Whereas the first Avengers felt like something that could stand on it's own, Age of Ultron falls a bit short of that, investing a significant amount of the film setting up the next movie. Sure, we all knew a third was coming, but I went to see Age of Ultron, not an extended trailer for the next one. And though setting up the next in the series isn't a bad thing, if I were to have watched Age of Ulton without a passing knowledge of the comics, I would have felt some of the character actions seemed very random and confusing.<br/><br/>The other big issue I have with the film is the inconsistency of character development. I couldn't help but notice that, whenever the action winded down, these characters were all painted as these flawed and troubled people with varied motivations. Then the action would start, and it was like a switch had flipped and every character starts whipping out witty one-liners (to mixed success), as if the characters knew there was enough else going on that they didn't have to carry the film anymore.<br/><br/>Let me say it again; I had a great time. And maybe I'm hitting that wall. Seeing so many super-hero movies lately, I could be reaching heroics saturation point. I don't know. But I can't honestly say I enjoyed Age of Ultron quite as much as it's predecessor."
"anchoreddown","9","0","3","3 May 2015"," One great thrill ride.
","For some reason, or another this film seems to have a mixed bag of reviews, some love it while others hate this piece. Want an honest review??? When the studio reached the 'point of no return' by getting to The Avengers, it was the first Marvel film to reach the billion dollar mark. Up until this point, most of the Marvel based films received good reviews. What went wrong?? It seems to always be the common denominator, the audience. Movie goers seem to get more nit-picky of films that have background material these days. They keep praying that the producers keep 'messing up' on their favorite comic book characters. However, I mean no disrespect to anyone. This being said, it puts more pressure on the studios to do their job right. This is why films like Spiderman 3 failed to bring full force is because Sam Raimi could not give the script he wanted full treatment. Now that I have laid down some ground in the way Nick Fury would, as if talking to the team, here's my review of this movie. It's good to see new and old faces. With the grouping of the characters in Age Of Ultron, it's difficult to really put character emphasis on any one or two superheroes. We know the ones we've already seen in the Marvel Universe. Once again, this is part of the start of phase two in the writing process of both the films and Agents Of Shield. We got to see the alien life force from the first Avengers, so it makes sense that Age Of Ultron would have robots to accompany Ultron himself, seeing that he has to upload himself to a machine in the first place. This also eludes to the reveal that Marvel fans will eventually get of Thanos. Not only that, but now Spiderman will be able to join the roster again. Everybody knows that Agent Colson is still alive, so we have yet to see him show up again, but more than likely, will stay with Shield. What makes this film special?? I think it's the Scarlet Witch who taps into the minds of others, making them face their fears of their past. Bottom line is, don't let anyone tell you what you should and shouldn't watch. Sometimes you have to test the waters,......trust me, if you relax and sit back you just might enjoy this piece of film you may call 'a piece of crap'."
"DoubleOscar","6","0","3","2 May 2015"," Definitely Satisfying, but Feels the Same
","Having just got out of seeing Avengers: Age of Ultron, let me start by saying that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The action is definitely there and some shots look right off the pages of the comic book, which was great. Having said that, this movie has a few problems that have been recurring through many Marvel movies.<br/><br/>PROS: Let's start with the good parts. As mentioned before, the action is there and should suffice for most of the viewers. To continue, Ultron is probably the best villain so far in the MCU, and he is brilliantly portrayed visually and by the voice work of James Spader. As usual, the Avengers themselves are all great and each get some spotlight, especially Hawkeye. This was probably my favorite part of the movie. Before, Hawkeye was kinda just there and was out- shined by most of the other heroes. This sequel expands greatly on Hawkeye's arc and it was very touching. Also, Vision was used magnificently here and was easily one of the highlights of the entire movie. Lastly, the comedy is there as well with a bunch of little quips from everyone throughout many scenes. The chemistry of all the actors greatly adds to the comedy and brings on more laughs.<br/><br/>CONS: While some of my problems are that the film feels very similar to its predecessor and that it needed to set up future MCU movies, most of my problems coincide with the positives. To start, the comedy, it worked at some parts, but at others it just felt out of place. At some points the movie was trying to show a more serious and darker tone, but then threw in a one-liner. Next is a recurring problem and my biggest problem with the movie. The fact that I never feel any threat of danger for any of the characters made it harder for me to be completely enthralled by the action scenes. I've had the same problem since the first Avengers came out. In my opinion, the only Marvel movie to show any threat or consequences for the characters was Captain America: Winter Soldier, but I digress. My last complaint is that some parts felt a little rushed, namely, the beginnings of Ultron. <br/><br/>Overall, while watching this movie, the positives outweighed the negatives for this movie and it made me greatly excited for the next films to come. While some parts may be a bit overblown and stuffed, Avengers: Age of Ultron met my high expectations and brought me a highly enjoyable sequel that is definitely worth at least a couple more viewings.<br/><br/>Overall Score: 8.75/10"
"rinkutiwari1","8","0","3","2 May 2015"," Avengers Age of Ultron is a dream
","Yes, he Avengers Age of Ultron is a dreamt come true. This is exactly the sequel to a great film that we have been dreaming about. It's superb on every single level. It honestly has no real flaws that I could see. How great does a movie have to be given the inherent difficulties in making a film like this in the first place? Writer/director Joss Whedon did an admirable job of balancing the screen time of the sprawling and expanding cast.<br/><br/>As for the new characters, I loved what they did with The Vision and how they did it. The Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver â€” aka, Pietro and Wanda Maximoff are amazing as well. Wanda's psychic powers are much more complicated and empathetic then I expected them to be. What I love about Wanda is that she physically goes through emotional trauma when she uses certain powers and we as the audience go with her on that emotional journey. Like just about everything this film, that really packs a punch. Ultron, unfortunately, takes this directive way too seriously and believes that world peace can only be achieved by exterminating humanity, and he'll stop at nothing to accomplish this goal. <br/><br/>The battle between the Avengers and Ultron is further complicated by the appearance of superpowered twin Quicksilver, and Scarlet Witch, who ally themselves with the homicidal android........<br/><br/>It was always going to be a tough call to match the first Avengers movie, which, in all fairness, was a monumental cinematic experience, but here, it appears that Whedon knew he couldn't match it, realise the film would make bucketloads anyway, and just hasn't bothered with many of the characters."

"meganparkin-53508","8","0","4","2 May 2015"," Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great film that is just missing half an hour from the beginning...
","Avengers: Age of Ultron is a great film that is just missing half an hour from the beginning. The action scenes were, as always, brilliant, the dialogue was hilarious and there really were some emotional scenes in this film. However I feel that some of the story lines were either rushed or came out of nowhere. One of the main ones was the hulk/black widow romance. Now don't get me wrong I actually quite like this couple but we went from them having a pretty normal (or as normal as can be with the avengers) relationship to them pretty much being a full on couple, there was no in between. Also the hydra base at the beginning was a bit unexplained. My other issue with this film was Ultron. Based on the trailers I expected a really dark, different villain, but instead Ultron was funny and more human than I expected for a robot, even though he is based off Tony Stark. This is actually a really funny film, I was laughing out loud at several points in the cinema, Hawkeye, especially is brilliant and is now one of my favourite avengers but Ultron having humorous dialogue felt like a little too much, he should have been darker to balance out the humour of the avengers themselves. I also felt like the film makers rushed into his whole 'I'm going to murder humanity' mind set as he is basically created and 5 minutes later ready to cause global extinction. Despite these criticisms I really enjoyed this film and Joss Whedon does not fail to keep the audience engaged. Scarlett Witch and Quicksilver make great additions to the team, Vision is awesome and we get to see more of what motivates the avengers than ever before. Overall I think Marvell did a good job but we could have done with seeing a bit more which is again, probably a good thing!"
"RyanTesone","9","0","3","2 May 2015"," New favorite in the MCU!
","THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS!!!! YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED!<br/><br/>OK so I am very critical of films. Guardians of the Galaxy, for example, was about a solid 6.5-7.5 out of 10 for me. But this film was PHENOMENAL! Easy 9.5/10, taking the place of my new favorite in the MCU, eclipsing both Winter Soldier at third and Ironman at 2nd.<br/><br/>The action and effects were great, and the battles were extremely fun to watch. There were quite a few major fight sequences in the film, and they were all very well-done. That said, I do wish that the final fight would have been less similar to that of the climax of the first film: it was basically a huge mash-up of all of the heroes (this time, there were 9 of them as opposed to 6) tearing through tons of incredibly weak Ultron drones.<br/><br/>The performances of the characters were much of the same save for one player, and that is Ultron, who is portrayed by James Spader. Not only is he very cool-looking and powerful, but his performance was absolutely top-notch, rivaling even the portrayal of Harry Osborn/Green Goblin in Amazing Spiderman 2 (as flawed as that film is, Osborn was acted very thoroughly). Easily my favorite villain in any Superhero film (the other MCU films included)! Although it would have been very nice to see him in combat more often, specifically during the final battle where he got shafted a lot like Loki did in the first film, not really doing as much as he could have been. And his ultimate death was not that impressive in the slightest.<br/><br/>Another character that is often brought-up is The Vision, played by Paul Bettany. He was a very impressive character with a great performance, but I honestly fail to see what exactly made him stand-out so much from the rest of the Avengers, which, as I have said, were more-or-less the same execution-wise. <br/><br/>As amazing as this film was, it still did have its flaws, one of which obviously includes Ultron's wasted potential. Some other gripes of mine include: misplaced/unnecessary humor (too much of it), everything moving far too quickly (the downfall of Strucker and HYDRA, the creation of Ultron, the rise of Vision, to name a few major pieces).<br/><br/>Again, this film was TERRIFIC! 9.5/10 is my final rating, which is no easy task from me."
"Challenger2013","9","0","3","1 May 2015"," Not the Best Marvel film, but it's up there!
","About a month after seeing ""Furious 7,"" here I am after screening the new ""Avengers"" film and I realize...the two are very similar. The family aspect isn't a big theme in the Marvel film, but aspects of extreme action, humorous dialogue, and outward ridiculousness involving a team of super-humans make the two films quite comparable.<br/><br/>In the newest Marvel piece, The Avengers are forced to take on a form of evil artificial intelligence, in the form of a robot named Ultron, when he is created by Tony Stark, who brought him to life with good intentions. With the help of a Russian brother and sister pair that were given special abilities, Ultron plans to evolve the human race into some kind of human-android hybrid and wipe out the humans currently living on earth. <br/><br/>The film itself is filled with intense action throughout, as Marvel films usually are, brought together through some very quick cutting mixed with some pretty impressive long takes of our heroes taking on the baddies. The sci-fi action goes beyond any type of sequences Marvel has done in the past, and is crazy fun to witness. <br/><br/>While the action was expected, what surprised me was just how funny the film is. Until, ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" I was pretty convinced that excessive comedy didn't belong in these types of films. Now, both ""Guardians"" and ""Age of Ultron"" have proved me wrong. There are moments of dialogue between the characters that are genuinely hilarious and filled the theater with laughter. There are still those corny lines mixed in, but the script was much better written than, well, films like ""Furious 7.""<br/><br/>While the film gets most things spot-on, there is one gnawing aspect of the film that serves as its only big downfall. The problem is that the last half hour or so, while in a different context, is strikingly similar to the last half hour of the original ""Avengers"" film. The ending is definitely much more exciting than the first, but it was somewhat sad to see a fun story build up to something so unoriginal. <br/><br/>While ""Age of Ultron"" doesn't achieve quite as much as ""Guardians of the Galaxy"" did last year, it is still one of Marvel's best products to date and completely exceeds the slightly overrated first ""Avengers"" film. The best thing about these films is how much closer we get to each character with each installment. I can only hope the world is ready to buckle in for the sure-to-be wild ride that is coming up in the future Marvel films."

","I was one of the first people to watch AoU when it was released in my country. To be honest it really didn't live up to my expectation. In the trailer we saw a powerful Ultron, powerful enough to break Cap's shield, defeat Thor... But the actual movie showed a different Ultron entirely. It couldn't even defeat Tony Stark. I think that most of the people bashing it were just wanting to see Ultron beat the crap out of the Avengers and a darker, more 'DC' version of the movie. But aside from that it was just genuinely fun and a good Marvel film. I mean what did you expect. It is a Disney film. So expect laughter, fighting, and a little bit of emotion. So to be honest if you could watch FF7 and have fun while doing so, AoU will be just as good or even better than FF7. It's not as good as the first Avengers movie in 2012, but it will be a fine addition to the MCU, a good opening to the Phase 3."

Hawkeye plays a big role in this movie and is very like able. Ultron is not like any typical A.I. one has ever seen as it very much has human personality traits. At times Ultron feels like a little kid with two much power. This movie also spends a lot of time setting up the future of the Marvel Universe and that takes away from the film a bit.

I'm sure Fanboys and the average movie goer a like will be entertained by this flick. <br/><br/>My main critique or question I would pose is that is there such thing as having one too many instalments in a film franchise? I've been anticipating this film for a long time and when you finally see it, it leaves you feeling slightly deflated in the fact that you're just thinking ""that ones done, whens the next one"". With this constant continuation I'm not getting any sense of resolve.

","If Whedon's films have a fault it is that he tries just a little too hard to give his audience more bang for their buck. Ordinarily, this wouldn't be a major problem: indeed in episodic TV drama it is an advantage. Characters are fully-rounded and developed. The Fanboys (and girls) have their appetites for their favourite heroes fully sated. In a self-contained feature, though, this can occasionally be a burden.<br/><br/>I liked 'Age of Ultron'. I'm a comic-geek and a film-buff, and I think the integration of supporting characters from the 'Thor', 'Captain America' and 'Iron Man' franchises (some of whom are going to become more prominent as Downey and Renner explore other projects) was amusing. The major achievement of the first 'Avengers'movie it that it made these franchises cohesive. But if the reaction of some of the viewers grumbling in the aisles at my screening are anything to go by, it can also make for an over-busy narrative for the uninitiated.<br/><br/>The big guns are all good. Downey and Hemsworth dominate, but everyone gets their chance to shine (and quip). Spader's voice work as Ultron is maybe just a little arch, but it suits the tone of the movie, and Bettany's Vision provides an interesting counterpoint to all the hysteria. The dialogue is great: though some of the one- liners were verging on being just too-cute...almost a parody of a Whedon script. But busier.<br/><br/>The movie's biggest redeeming feature is clearly Whedon's love for his characters, and that's what stops this being just another splashy special-effects flick...but it's greatest failing is that characters, relationships and the group dynamic are oddly left hanging...at least until the NEXT episode."

Story line Movie starts with an on-going battle in all fictional country Sokovia, Strucker has kept Loki's Sceptor from the part1. The team fetches the scepter and Tony discovers the Gem in the Scepter is a complicated Artificial Intelligence which he now intends to use it for his Global peace keeping program named 'Ultron'. As we expect the program goes wrong the Ultron now controls everything on the internet. Ultron misunderstands the objective of peace-keeping and talks about extinction of Avengers and the entire earth for a new evolution. Meanwhile he recruits a twin who were experimented by Strucker, One is a fast moving with a Russian accent, the lady twin is a manipulator of minds and fire boomer. They have a childhood revenge on Stark, their story is heart touching. The Ultron with the help of a scientist builds an indestructible human form weapon which is meant to erase the mighty heroes. Luckily the team stops that and steals the weapon box or whatever its called. Tony gets a second chance to fix his program puts our favorite Jarvis into human form..That was really nice.. A human form with all the powers put together named as Vision comes out as takes side of Avengers against the Ultron. Maximoff twins too join the league. Now the whole crew battle the well spoken Ultron to save the earth. Movie is a mixture of artificial intelligence and Emotions.. When the mind-gamer girl takes everyone for a dream ride there are a lot of complicated scenes which we sorta fail to understand but Whedon has tried his best to put a lot of things together in short-time. Cast - Jeremy Reaner has got a lot of screen presence than anyone else..i guess he was disappointed for his screen time in his last edition. Scarlett (black widow) and the Banner (hulk) have some silent romance, that was unexpected but good move. Mark Ruffalo - Hulk as always larger than life, will talk more about this fight with Tony Chris Evans - Brilliant as Capt. America as always...the hot-star of fantastic four has mastered the art of Superhero Chris Hems - Thor - I din like him much in the first part, he has gone better much cooler in this and the hammer is a lovely weapon to watch. R. Downey Jr - best of all - He steals the show in every screen presence.. Any trend you talk about starts from Tony..!! Veronica.. Hulk-buster.. Jarvis brain.. A lot more..There is no Avengers without the Iron man. Paul Bettany - The actor from the priest ..the voice of Jarvis which we have loved for years.. Comes alive as Vision the new superhero.. Happy to see him.. He justifies the role. Ultron - Voice of John spader - the villain who rips of everyone is one new badass I liked.. Still smaug & joker are my favorite villains.. The voice is malevolently epic. Technology Where there is Tony Stark there is new technology... Veronica is the killer one in this episode.. Veronica is a Armour set which Tony is kept in space...which has a special suit.. Hulk-buster.. OMFG that was crazy...as the name says its made to kick Hulks ass if in case he goes mad. The artificial intelligence.. Though its quite aged.. Wasn't picturized before like the one in this movie.. The beauty of Vfx. The vibranium - The indestructible metal with which the shield of Capt. A Is been made. I love the names of these fictitious metals... Adamantium in xmen n Vibranium here..impressive. Critic The movie sometimes leaves you puzzled, asks you to connect the dots by yourself. By the time you connect the scenes it rushes to the next...one mark less for this. The climax is pretty sober ..doesn't keep you nail-biting... lifting the city up in the air above the clouds to use it as a meteor and drop it down.. Umm not so cool idea.. One mark less for this. Too many heroes vs one Ultron -- not so fair match.. Counting 5+3 heroes ..will get everyone less screen time please Hollywood don't repeat the same mistake. Some incredible stuff Hulk-buster & The Hulk fight -- paisa wasool part of the movie Humor on victory party.. and try lifting Thor's Hammer was very tickling. Quicksilver in slow motion ..the speedsters action shown in slow motion in a beautiful way. Atlast the fight with thousands of minion like robots with The avengers altogether at one place. Its a treat to watch all the powers come together. Good to see a complete performance by everyone but not by the director in-terms of narration. Post credits a new villain is shown as a Hint of next sequel who is probably bigger than hulk and he has a ironman handsuit which fires. Says.. Fine I ll do it myself. Lets watch for the next. Rated - 7 out of 10"
"budad2007","7","0","5","28 April 2015"," OK , but lost some of its charm from the first film
","it was...OK but that roof they had in the last film of talking over the kids and letting both age groups have fun, caved in a bit on this film, the dialog on the farm was some of the worst because it was trying to rope you into an emotional scene with tag lines like,"" I hope you can finish the barn dear after your done avenging with the avengers"" and being all serious like that was how hawk-eye identified himself or some crap dialog like that, not exact quotes here, it just came off wrong and super cheesy, and further in a few more lines like this came out, and felt a bit to forced, and that Ultron looks like a Michael bay wet dream , the faceless glow pit face from the comics would have been far more scarier, but hey got to keep it kid friendly, people forget the dark crystal, scary as hell, one of the best childhood films, kids need to feel risk and fear in film as well, that's part of growing up, again like the kid who grew up in a sterile environment and developed allergies to everything you could think of because the kid's immune system never had a chance, same goes for main stream ""dumming down"" and Disney chasing the dollars, just felt it on this film, tried to be dark but some how the roof caved in on a few key things in the film. not terrible but not nearly as good as the first film, ultron was not scary, he just looked like a video game character, even the first transformers held up better than this film (1st transformers was awesome, they all suck after that) rant over :)"
"velvoofell","7","0","3","27 April 2015"," Good but not the dabble in the Marvel Palette It Could Have been.
","I think that the film was fine but basically a retread of the original 2011 movie. However The Winter Soldier, with a fairly complex and even thought provoking plot and Guardians of the Galaxy which was a Sci-Fi effects movie with indy heart and soul promised something from Age of Ultron that wasn't delivered.<br/><br/>I think Whedon and the producers should have retained Hank Pym (Michael Douglas) as inventor of Ultron, commissioned by a US government ashamed of what SHIELD had become. There could still be conflict with Stark with Ultron invading his armoury. Add a more unstoppable Ultron element (in the time he was away he could have brought world finance to a halt) then you would have had an epic scale sense of peril that wouldn't just be limited to one small Eastern European City (even if it was going to be used as a nuclear warhead) Overall I enjoyed the film but last year's Marvel films wrote a plot and tone cheque 'A:AOU' failed to fully cash.<br/><br/>Introducing Pym (Michael Douglas) and having him be Ultron's creator wouldn't have been difficult. I feel this would have made so much more sense and added that extra layer that it needed - then Pym's history and initial protection of his creation could have provided a character arc that would have led more neatly into 'Ant-Man'.<br/><br/>Marvel/Disney own Pym and Ultron - there was no need to erase Pym from Ultron's history. OK, may be OCD-geek of me, but I truly think that just on film terms that would have enhanced the drama.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film but despite Ultron's excellent CGI capture of Spader's performance, Tom Hardy - for example - with a plastic mask and shaved head managed to hold so much more dramatic power as a super villain because the timing and plot showed so much more tacit threat."
"kokmeng-886-61974","7","0","3","27 April 2015"," Not great but still good!
","Can't say its better than The Avengers (2012) but it's still a good entertaining film. What The Avengers (2012) lacked is ridiculously compensated in Age of Ultron, unfortunately at the expense of what made the first one a better and more complete film. Some might feel that the second act in The Avengers was a bit slow but in my opinion, it is moments like these that made the third act all the more fulfilling. Age of Ultron lacked that bit in my opinion. It was all one flashy action set piece after another with very little built up or back story. Without a slower second act to built up some tension and drama, the whole movie does feel a bit flat in the end. <br/><br/>Having said that, the movie does feel like there was originally a bit more to it than what was released. You can't help but feel that chunks of the movie were taken out to reduce the run time. That feeling when you see a scene transitioning into another and go, ""Wait hang on, did they just skipped a page?!""<br/><br/>To sum it up, it feels like a Transformers movie that was done right. A insane amount of non-stop action with tons of funny one- liners thrown in the mix with very little build up."
"ramanangru","7","0","3","26 April 2015"," Not as Impressive as Avengers 1
","Captain America Winter Soldier ended with the Post credit scene Baron Strucker experimenting on Twins. AOU starts with avengers attacking the base were the twins (enhanced) were held. One of the enhanced has the ability to influence mind and other has ultra speed (similar to Flash). When Tony confronts the elder twin (one with telekinetic power), she shows a illusion to Stark. That everyone in Avenger will be killed as Tony could have done better to protect them. This kick starts Ultron program (AI). What made to protect the world becomes the tool for ultimate destruction. How the avengers stop this force makes the rest of the story. If you expect anything like first movie then you will be disappointed. Don't have any expectation for the movie. You can enjoy it. This movie didn't matched the Anime Ultron Saga. There was a hint given Hank Pym and Black Panther will be added soon in Avengers. Background music was good. Ultron's single line comedy are good. There was a little flashback about Agent Natasha. But making her to pair with all the super heroes is not acceptable. The movie some what depicts Agent Romanoff is a flirt. In previous movies she was very close with Hawkeye and CA. In this movie she is paired with Hulk/Bruce Banner."
"hypnotoad8128","Null","0","4","26 April 2015"," An Enjoyable And Superior Followup
","The Avengers: Age Of Ultron is your typical modern day, summer blockbuster, Hollywood fare which trades absolute originality for massive scale.<br/><br/>It's an enjoyable ride that is both witty and darker in tone than 2012's Avengers, and thanks to the lack of need for nearly an hour of character basil exposition before getting to the main story, it's superior to it's predecessor too.<br/><br/>Length and noisy final act aside, Avengers: Age Of Ultron shows that Marvel know how to make an enjoyable superhero film which will appeal to all ages and that's something Warner Bros. need to learn after the utterly depressing and dystopian Man Of Steel."
"master-erik_95","6","0","5","26 April 2015"," Age of Ultron once again delivers an entertaining but inferior sequel to the Marvel ensemble hit
","The sequel to 2012's breakout superhero hit, Age of Ultron obviously serves as a middle film in the MCU. Although the stakes are significantly higher than last time, some aspects feel a little underwhelming and inconsequential, despite the total or partial destruction of at least three major cities. Joss Whedon still proves adept at staging massive action sequences and giving his characters endless quips to throw at each other at even the worst of times, but taking into account that he has discussed several times that the making of the film exhausted him, it's occasionally noticeable, as he includes, by necessity from the powers that be in the MCU, many character cameos and hints of future plots.<br/><br/>The weaker aspect of the film is definitely the inclusion of the Maximoff twins. Quicksilver made quite the impression with his powers and presence in X-Men last year with only 15 minutes of screen time, but here Aaron Taylor Johnson doesn't even come close to that. His weird and obviously forced accent doesn't really help him. Elizabeth Olsen fares better, although her accent also proves to be distracting.<br/><br/>Despite these flaws, the film still proves to be highly entertaining, although it doesn't quite reach the heights of the first film. The acting is once again great, with everyone fitting comfortably in their roles. Ultron, although a little wasted, is helped by Spader's menacing voice. One thing I particularly appreciated, especially compared to every previous Marvel film, is that the characters showed their vulnerability quite a bit more and for once, there was emphasis in evacuating civilians before unleashing a war in their midst. Whedon's VFX-assisted long takes once again make a couple of appreciated appearances, and Vision finally provides a cool flesh and bone role for Paul Bettany. His first scene was really one of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>Hawkeye's one liners and the fact that he has a family were quite funny too, especially Tony's predictably sarcastic reaction."
"foghorn_clj","7","0","4","26 April 2015"," Not as good as the first... But close.
","After the perfection of ""The Avengers"" a sequel was always going to be a tough ask. Never the less it's Joss Whedon so my expectations were high.<br/><br/>Overall it's darker and deeper than the first. However the story arc is pretty much the same as the 1st. Big threat emerges, avengers get their ass kicked, avengers sulk, avengers rally and save the day. It's comfortingly familiar but still a little disappointing nonetheless.<br/><br/>Firstly the great stuff:<br/><br/>1. Even for a darker film the Whedonesque sense of humour is still everywhere. If anything this film had more laughs than the first. The party scene is hilarious (seriously I could've watched 2 hours of just that). I will agree with others that the humour in this movie isn't as organic as the first <br/><br/>2. The Tony/Bruce intellectual bromance gets some nice screen time. So does Jarvis. Seriously I don't think I've ever had such strong emotions for a computer program.<br/><br/>3. Ultron = awesome. I have no idea what villain a lot of the other people on here were watching but I thought ultron was complex, funny, a little psychotic and evil. I forgot he was a robot for most of it.<br/><br/>And now the bad...<br/><br/>1. The fight scene at the end was ridiculously, needlessly long (not to mention a little boring). The never-ending army of robots attacking was particularly uninspired (too much like the end of iron man 3). <br/><br/>And I cannot understand why ultron choose the method of destroying the earth that he did. He could've achieved the same result with a far easier and less convoluted plan. <br/><br/>2. Vision. All I can say is WTF?! I don't understand how he came into existence, who the hell he is, what the deal with the stone was... I could go on & on. Seriously I had to ask my friend at the end of the movie who the hell he was. They clearly forgot that not everyone is the theatre would be a comic book fan.<br/><br/>3. Unlike the first there wasn't the same equal screen time for all the characters. <br/><br/>It honestly could've easily been called ""Iron Man 4"" with the amount of screen time Tony Stark got. <br/><br/>Thor was basically comedic relief in this movie with some ridiculous storyline about water and visions which had no context whatsoever. <br/><br/>Captain America didn't know what his role was.<br/><br/>But nice to see hawkeye get some screen time.<br/><br/>Verdict: not as good as the first but still enjoyable to watch."
"gerry_barnaby","7","0","3","25 April 2015"," Avenger age of Ultron is a great film but not perfect
","To start with I've seen a lot of reviews that are buyest giving this film a full 10 out of 10 from marvel fan's so let me be clear this is a fair & unbiased review of the film as it wasn't a perfect film I'm not going to let just because it marvel effect the way i review this film.<br/><br/>Joss Whedon hasn't done a bad job at making this film there are a few flaws in this film which i will explain in the dislikes, but as for the start of the film it throw you into a battle with hydra which has no build up which i assume this scene follow from the end credit of the first avengers which i thought could of had a bit of a build up to it but it wasn't to bad. Cant believe they actual snook the F-word in a 12A film but gladly follow by a funny one-liner from one of the main characters which i did find funny but i couldn't believe what i heard,the dose appeal to a mass audience that enjoys action and super heroes combine in to one film which is all good. With the character of Ultron i actual was in-pressed with the way they brought him in to this film, although having his origin story change this wasn't badly executed. The only reason why marvel screwed this up was because the original origin story of Ultron was from Hank Pym's, which comic book reads know as Ant-man but because Ant-man wasn't filmed before this film they couldn't go with the origin story of Ultron so it had to be change which didn't seem off balance or out of place this was well executed in the film giving the character life. Which James Spader done perfectly voicing Ultron, what the trailer doesn't show you all to well is the way James gives this character its nature, its was like watching a child with a psychotic, mental, ideal, person hell bend on destroy everything so a master race could rise, that the way this character came across he actual was pretty menacing but he attitude just matched his way of looking at thing & look.<br/><br/>I did notice that there is something going on with Bruce banner (Mark Ruffalo) & Natasha Romanoff (Scarlett Johansson ) which had a bit of a spin in the film although felt something was missing about it, in certain part you do notice the atmosphere between tony stark (Robert Downey Jr.) & Steve Rogers ( Chris Evans ) you can see the civil war aspect coming between them which is a future film project for marvel which is clever implant in the film i did notice that. Some of the banter is funny in places, but some times come across a little unnecessary for the scenes but you do find yourself laughing at them. Wanda Maximoff aka Scarlet Witch (Elizabeth Olsen) pull off a great performance as a woman with powerful magic you don't mess with along with the speedster her character brother Pietro Maximoff aka Quicksilver ( Aaron Taylor-Johnson) who dose have a few funny one-liners although most of his scene are C.G.I effects he dose a great job. The Other new character that is introduced in this film Vision (Paul Bettany ) was a welcome addiction to the team, love the design of his look, comes across very powerful, there is a moment with him that had the dose have the whole audience thinking W.T.H moment with Thor which was brilliant executed scene in the film that even had me god-smacked because i wasn't expect it, as well as a few scene with Clint Barton aka Hawk-eye ( Jeremy Renner ) There is unexpected scene that was keep from the first film which made me a little puzzled but it was explain briefly which i liked otherwise it would would have been a plot hole. Visual effect are & action in this film dose keep you attention on the film although a few scene are little slowed down this was to bad of a film, not perfect but still an OK film, but with a surprise end credit scene which most of the story-line in this film set up for the 3rd film.<br/><br/>Dislikes : Sorry but i need to saying this because most everyone complains about the use of C.G.I in film's, I've heard a lot of people complain about the C.G.I in transformers saying it look fake, well I'm sorry to say this but Age of ultron use a lot of C.G.I in visual effects that is very questionable. Although the performance of Ultron is brilliant from James spader the C.G.I use is over the top for some of the scene, its come across a little fake in a lot of scenes which make the character a little to unbelievable at time, the only part that actual look real was when you see himself which is seen in the trailer talking about not being worthy. I feel some part of the film were showing crack in Joss Whedon directing as he been stretch to much with doing a lot of other film's because its show in the story plot of this film which is over shadowed but visual effects & action, sadly if you take away these visual effect & action there isn't much story there which is a shame because this film is more style over quality story.<br/><br/>the other thing was i disappointed in is that Quicksilver & Scarlet Witch background isn't explain much other than the fact they were experiment on by hydra, i feel the story was lacking there as well as the other characters lack of humanity in there manors. I feel Vision could of been in the film more as he's not in the film much."

","Avengers turned out to be as thrilling and exciting as its first part. It was definitely good but not as great as the original. <br/><br/>Avenger are threatened by new enemy Upton is spawned from a peace program initiated by Tony Stark keeping other members out of loop. However , things turn topsy turvy when the program goes horribly wrong as he plans an attack on Earth and wage a war against mankind and turn humans into his slave. Together, Avengers with new members must fight the evil Ultron.<br/><br/>It would have been really challenging for Joss Whedon, director of Serenity and the original Avengers, to make a film by assembling all the superheroes in one flick but to my surprise he did a fantastic job and turned this comic-story into a must-see film. Of course, if you would have followed their original parts then this will be easy to continue. The differences between the characters has been portrayed ecstatically. 1st half boast of some path-breaking action sequences. The street fight between Iron man and Hulk is astounding. 2nd half loses the steam with so many stories interwoven under the same umbrella. Couple of scenes that easily stands out are conversation between Ultron and Iron man, the chemistry between the black widow and the Hulk. Climax fighting depicted reminds you of the first part which is well executed. Screenplay is effective along with punching dialogues Cinematography is enthralling. The CGI is magnificent with thrilling visual effects. On the flip side , any superhero movie is supported by electrifying background which is clearly missing here. Nevertheless, it is compensated by powerful performances by rest of the starcast especially Robert Downey Jr who clearly stands out in his portrayal of Ironman and witty one- liners. He is just getting better with each film. Surprisingly, I liked Scarlette Johanson as the Black Widow.<br/><br/>Overall , an action-packed entertainment with good storyline , lovely performances and superb CGI. It definitely misses the mark when compared to the previous part but do you even care when you have the privileged to watch all the superheroes under the same umbrella. GOOD 3/5"
"raj040492","8","0","5","24 April 2015"," Mad Scientists and Monsters, But not end of the line
","If you are reading this review, then 9 out of times you will watch this movie, even if I trash it to the pit. Why? Simple. Because they are ""The Avengers"" and we love them for that. But, am I going to trash it? Read on.<br/><br/>When one of Tony Stark's haywire experiments goes haywire, the Earth's mightiest heroes are given another excuse to flex their muscles, crash buildings as if they are made of legos, perform insane stunts with all possible modes of transportation, prank each other's style, confront the past, fight amongst themselves, win an unwinnable antagonist and in the process, save the world (again!).<br/><br/>I was one of those (few) who felt that,despite the brilliant attempt, the Avengers (2012) at 8+/10 in IMDb was slightly overrated. But the sheer pleasure of watching so many superheroes within a single frame can be happily overwhelming for anyone. But this time around, the movie is a lot more than just the superheroes.<br/><br/>Where the movie succeeds: Unlike Avengers(2012), this has a much deeper storyline and gives us a good glimpse into the human side of the superheroes. This takes the story of Marvel Universe into the next stage, with the I-stone being clearly explained for the first time in a Marvel movie. Introduction of the twins adds fuel to the fire and the latter burns brightly. Taking cue from any Marvel movie, CGI and wit are the usual stand-outs. SuperHeroes, no matter how super they are , have a past and that past makes a presence here and there in the movie. Hawkeye is actually given a sizable role rather than being a weak link (as in the previous installment).<br/><br/>Where the movie fails: Too much talking in an action movie can be cumbersome for an action- buff especially if he/she doesn't care a penny as to how the characters feel. Loki's wit is definitely missed with the ever- serious Ultron. When our superheroes can't stop fighting among themselves, we doubt if they really deserve the ""super"" in superheroes. Cheated upon when I hoped for a Post credit scene was the ultimate disappointment. With every passing movie, I am tired of this end-of-the-world-if-we-don't-stop-him scenario. It's time someone took a fresh look at it.<br/><br/>Thus I have presented Black and White of said movie. You can choose either or you can choose grey (like me). But something tells me that you have already made your choice. Let me know what you think of the movie.<br/><br/>PS: Someone else besides Thor lifts Mjolnir (the Hammer) (and not just once)."
