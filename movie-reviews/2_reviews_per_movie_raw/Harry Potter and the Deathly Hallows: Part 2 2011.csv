"vila-ddt","Null","147","180","15 July 2011"," End of an era... End of our childhoods... End of Harry Potter
","What can I say... This was by far the most amazing finale any fan could have asked for. I cried, I laughed, I was short of breath in many instances, I was disturbed, but overall I was thoroughly satisfied with the conclusion of this series. I felt something amazing after the movie ended, something I didn't feel after reading the book. Being able to watch the end of Harry Potter on the big screen really brought the impact of just how much this series has touched not only my life, but the lives of everyone around me. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is by far (in my opinion) the best movie of 2011 and quite possibly one of the best movies of all time. I don't want to give any spoilers I just want to express how happy I am with this film. It picks up where Part 1 left off, all of the characters get the closure they deserve, and the story just comes full circle!<br/><br/>BRAVO!!! That is all I have to say. Thank you to everyone involved in these movies for taking the world on such an amazing journey. J.K Rowling, thank you for writing such a masterpiece that will truly live on in my heart, and so many others hearts for years to come.<br/><br/>Go see this movie!"
"hjpog","10","63","80","26 December 2015"," My childhood..
","At the start of J.K. Rowling, thank you for this wonderful series of books forever. I can tell you this current state of my childhood and my future. Sign up everywhere it has always been a part of Harry Potter's name. I'd say the most important series of my life. I owe my childhood such wonderful pass to the books and movies of this series. In this series, even though I know better than the series it has always been a special place for me in this series and it will always continue. This movie is definitely the best in the series. And the players is the most mature film. You feel throughout the film until the end of the final air and this is an amazing thing for fans like me. Book series as well as certainly never did. However, in each film it was pretty cool. And with incredible finale made this film. Harry certainly kept the best for last. Put all the music from the beginning to the end of the movie you are very successful and internal chills. You feel deeply cool is really going on. When the film ended up being a very big gap within you. Of course, you are a part of this world..."
"Pjtaylor-96-138044","8","27","32","30 April 2018"," The series ends on a very strong note.
","The conclusion to the series hits some of the strongest emotional beats, mainly due to our long-standing connection with the characters, and provides some grand visual treats in the form of extended magical battles. While 'Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)' may be the biggest in scale and it is entertaining, it does feel lacking in depth - since some things are left oddly unexplained - and instead comes across as an extended third act for its duration. It actually plays out like one long climax, with little of the build-up required to further invest the audience, but at least it's well paced and doesn't hang about. A strong note on which to end a phenomenal series. 8/10"
"Loving_Silence","10","442","655","12 July 2011"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II gets everything right to send off Harry on a cinematic high
","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled!<br/><br/>The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film. <br/><br/>The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.<br/><br/>We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films."
"theycallmemrglass","9","287","435","7 July 2011"," An Exhilarating and Beautiful Conclusion to a Magnificent Saga.
","I saw this at a preview screening in London.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows part 2 ends this incredibly well produced saga with tremendous grace and a beautifully orchestrated climax that I am sure will satisfy both lovers of the books and films.<br/><br/>If you have read the books as I have you will be glad to know major key moments are intact. Much is missing but I won't dwell on that, no point, its how well this movie plays out and for me it rolls wonderfully between excitement, thrills and emotional drama towards a satisfactory (though a slightly rushed) conclusion. <br/><br/>There are at least 2 sequences so powerful that I defy anyone not to at least stifle a tear or choke a little. One of those sequence is an exquisitely executed flashback that is pivotal to the whole story. <br/><br/>I have to say, that despite the woes we book readers have when elements (big chunks of it too) are omitted from the movies, much credit still has to go to Steve Kloves for adapting the books for the big screen, cleverly weaving, changing and even adding new big elements to give a kinetic flow to the narrative and here it all comes together superbly.<br/><br/>David Yates assured direction has nurtured our young actors in the last 4 films to blossom into even more adept actors who convey their characters with natural tones without overacting. Daniel Radcliffe had to carry this movie more than any other and has done so brilliantly complemented with great support from his two companions, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint.<br/><br/>Pretty much all the characters we have met in all the movies have made an appearance in this finale but one actor stands out, Alan Rickman. His portrayal of Professor Snape has always been a joy to watch (if a little novel) but here his scenes will leave a dramatic engraving in my memory. Here he elevates his portrayal of one of the most complex character in young adult literature to an unforgettable piercingly emotional one.<br/><br/>Another actor who really shines in the few scenes that he has, is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who we see gradually transforming over the past films from the clumsy bullied boy to a brave warrior in this final film. Many other British thespians of the series also have their few moments to shine especially Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagal who was a delight to watch as she takes charge of the defence of Hogwarth School.<br/><br/>As for the spectacle of the battle and showdowns, while not at the scale of Lord of the Rings, I honestly cant think how it could have been done better as the film makers have intertwined heart stopping action with dramatic progressions in the narrative. Its actually more visceral and dynamic than the rather smaller scale battle of the brilliant novels (not to take anything away from Rowling's writing). <br/><br/>Do I have any gripes? Yes I do. Although I applaud Steve Kloves for a difficult screenplay adaption...I think he could still have done better at explaining some odd anomalies that only readers of the book will understand. This might annoy you if you haven't read the books. But its a small gripe because what we get is delightful.<br/><br/>What an amazing achievement to faithfully bring Rowling's epic saga to the big screen with the same cast and largely the same crew, maintaining the brilliant quality right to the end.<br/><br/>Oh my god, its only just sinking in, this was the end....but what a great great end."
"cchip96","10","174","261","14 July 2011"," ""It all ends"" well
","This movie could not do any better, it ended the Harry Potter series with a bang. It is a good balance from the first part of The Deathly Hallows. The first part was more of a drama, while part two was action packed left and right. This may be my favorite movie of the series, though all of them are equally amazing. I have read the books, and there are definitely major changes in the movie, but I find they fit perfectly well with the story, even if it isn't the original plot. Even for those who haven't read the books (why wouldn't you?!), it is equally enjoyable. This movie, along with the rest in the series, will be loved for years and years to come."
"akash_sebastian","7","233","357","15 July 2011"," Good Movie, But a Disappointing & Unsatisfying End to the series...
","Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.<br/><br/>But, this isn't the way The Harry Potter saga was meant to end. A movie which is supposed to mark the End of an Era could have been much better. With the expectations I had, I was a little disappointed. It DID NOT have the depth and the emotional impact WASN'T nearly as good as the book. <br/><br/>I was pleased with Part 1 because it stuck very well to the book. That's what I was expecting with this too. But no... they had to spoil it. What's the use of making the movie in two parts if they can't do justice to the book? They should have made it a Trilogy (as all great movies are made, like 'The Godfather Trilogy', 'The LOTR Trilogy', original 'Star Wars Trilogy', The Bourne Trilogy', etc.) or they should have increased the length of the 2 parts. Who forced them to fit the whole thing within 2hrs.15mins. each. ??(Every part of LOTR is over 3&1/2 hrs. long. No one had an issue with it). . *<br/><br/>** SPOILERS **<br/><br/>THE GOOD :<br/><br/><ul><li>Snape's and Voldemort's characters were played quite well.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Throughout the series, Snape has been rather emotionless and monotonous. But, in the pensieve, we see a refreshingly new emotional side of him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Gringott's scene was nicely shown.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They added the scene where Hermione &amp; Ron destroy Hufflepuff's cup.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They show the future (19 years later) scene. I thought it would be cut.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE BAD : (I have to mention these because I was disappointed as hell)<br/><br/><ul><li>My Biggest Disappointment - Snape's Memories. They showed the whole thing within a minute. They're some of the most interesting &amp; touching scenes of the story. They just rushed through it, even excluding many of the memories. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fred's death. They don't even show it. Then later it was ridiculous to see Mrs. Weasley angry at Bellatrix when the latter was fighting Ginny.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The battle was too short and didn't the magnitude and impact as in the book, with Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Spiders, Ghosts, etc.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They don't show the Common Rooms. I always imagined it while reading the books. But I badly wanted to see them in the movie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They don't show Harry using the Cruciatus Curse on the one of the Carrows.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They wasted time in Nagini's chase.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They don't mention about Teddy Lupin and that Harry was his Godfather. They don't mention the names of Harry's other two kids.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No mention about the significance of the horcruxes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No mention of Bloody Baron and his link with Ravenclaw's diadem.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>No mention about how the Invisibility Cloak came into the possession of the Potters, how Harry and Voldemort are related through the Peverell brothers.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>They don't show how Dumbledore communicated with Snape after he died.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Harry doesn't even mend is wand. He directly snaps the Elder Wand into two pieces...</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>In the future scene, all the funny and cheerful dialogues are excluded. Everyone's just smiling and staring at each other. And moreover, none of the them seemed in their late thirties. Didn't the film-makers have enough money to hire good make-up artists.</li></ul><br/><br/>THE UGLY :<br/><br/><ul><li>Dumbledore's Story. He's my most favourite character in the book. There's nothing about him in the movie. They just say he had secrets (what secrets??). They don't even tell the story of Dumbledore sister, Ariana. They don't show him getting emotional at King's Cross.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The use of ridiculous one-liners and humourless jokes when the situation is so intense and sad.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Harry &amp; Voldemort had their final fight in the middle of nowhere. No one was even around to watch it. (In the book, they were in the middle of the whole crowd.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Bellatrix and Voldemort die bursting into confetti!</li></ul><br/><br/>ALL IN ALL, it wasn't the send-off the series deserved. Someone who has grown up reading the books and watching the movies in the series will understand my woes..."
"ephoratus","10","283","442","13 July 2011"," Epic End
","Even though I consider myself to be a huge HP fan I never thought I would actually give a movie from this series straight 10 out of 10. Just saw the movie today and the word epic is almost an understatement. This movie really lives up to the promises that have been made. Further more it is (in my opinion at least) the movie that stays most loyal to the book. I did miss some scenes from the book yet nothing relevant was left out. I don't want to give out any spoilers 'cause I don't want to ruin it for you but if you have read the book it will be very easy to follow and if not - well I think it still makes sense most of the time. I highly recommend you to watch it whether you're a fan or not. 10/10"
"ruddaga","6","185","284","12 July 2011"," 2 Films for 1 Book, yet misses 1/4 of the story....
","I don't know what I was expecting... To be honest apart from the first HP movie... every single one of the following movies has left out major plot points, characters and story lines. I guess I figured that was mainly because the movies only have a certain length of time to tell the story. Thus it was natural for me to assume that with 5+ hours they would be able to include everything in the one book... I assumed wrongly.<br/><br/>First off - Do not see this in 3D... The 3D is an after thought and literally added nothing to the experience. The only scene that was 3D that stands out in memory was the death of Voldemort and his confetti explosion.<br/><br/>What did they get right? Well its hard to say really.. I was really disappointed with the pacing for the first half of the 2nd part. It felt slow and weird and anti-climatic the entire way. The bank scene and special effects seems average and low budget for a franchise with such high profits. The acting from everyone doesn't quite do the job. Snapes ""redemption"" scene was acted out really poorly by Alan Rickman.. which is a shame because I was really looking forward to it as it's one of the more moving parts in the series. The only scene that felt like it mirrored the book accurately was the Kings Cross section (apart from Harry having clothes on...) My main gripe with the movie is that they left out so much considering they had two movies to cover it. Harry telling Neville to kill the snake and thus Neville having and important role in the ending of the war <- This part was the ONE part I was looking forward to when Neville pulls the sword out of the hat and cuts Nagini in two... Yet they changed it to Hermione and Ron battling the snake and Neville coming in as an afterthought... The entire war at the end was missing - Centaurs, Goblins/Kreecher, Hagrid/Aragog and just felt very anti-climatic and also have very poor CGI. The entire point of the Deathly Hallows is missed out with Harry not claiming ownership of the wand and reflecting Voldemorts death spell back onto him, and is replaced with a VERY tame action scene that went for about 10 minutes (its then mentioned as an afterthought by Harry post battle). The scene when Harry confronts Snape was also bizarre and seemed unnecessary... Overall the changes and missing scenes left me feeling very empty.<br/><br/>My girlfriend hasn't read the books and she enjoyed it.. So I'm sitting here wondering if the knowledge of the books hampered my enjoyment of it. I have no doubt this film will be hailed a success and will make bazillon dollars, but I can't help but feel that another director/team could've handled this a lot truer to the books."
"TourettesPersonal","9","113","170","19 July 2011"," Better Ending
","Endings are usually the problems of most movie series. They usually end up being mediocre & unsatisfying or they are made to cash in people. The great thing about Harry Potter movies, the filmmakers are taking their job seriously. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a great ending of the series. It's more than throwing a lot of action and exposition. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is one of those conclusion that actually care about the series.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows part 1 is just the first and the half of the second act of the story. Deathly Hallows part 2 begins straight forward to its continuation of the last Harry Potter film. And of course, if you haven't seen Deathly Hallows Part 1 or any of the Harry Potter movies, you'll be confused to death. Obvious isn't it? It's pretty clever to make the whole Deathly Hallows story like a slow burn. It started from silent thrills, plans, and escapes to big and loud battles.<br/><br/>The series doesn't only end with big and loud action. It also gives us some nostalgia from the old Harry Potter films. And we still get to see more of the characters. The movie itself is pretty exciting. It's a good choice to let David Yates direct the rest of the Potter films because he made this series darker and bolder. Aside from that the film still has its compelling moments like the Prince's Tale scene.<br/><br/>No need to tell about the performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and the rest of the cast because they are obviously good to their characters but there is one actor here is worth mention and that is Alan Rickman. We already knew him as Snape but there is one scene where we see more of his character and his performance was excellent. The filmmaking, the special effects is obviously good. The music score really made the battle scenes epic and perfect for a final film.<br/><br/>For me it's really hard to write a review about Harry Potter. Is it because I never read the books or I'm not really a huge fan but in my opinion Harry Potter is a successful series. If I rank all the movie conclusions, this could be number three because nothing beats Lord of the Rings and Star Wars. Either you're a fan or not, you'll love this series. And yes, this is another remarkable movie series."
"DoctorBatmanPotter","6","523","852","12 July 2011"," Good, But Disappointing
","I watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 and was very pleased with how well it stuck to the book. Because of this, I had high expectations for Part 2. I mean, if you did so well in the first half, you have to do just as well in the second half, right? Right? Wrong.<br/><br/>The movie started off very well, starting from exactly where it left off in Part 1 and staying faithful to the book all the way to when Harry and co break into Hogwarts. That's where it starts to go down hill.<br/><br/>*Spoilers!* <br/><br/>The good: <br/><br/><ul><li>Neville. He was perfectly perfect. I really wish they gave him more screen time because he was adorable.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Gringott's scene. Very well done.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The emotion we are shown from Snape. Throughout the series, he's been rather monotonous and emotionless. In the pensieve, we see a different side of him and it is a refreshing change.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The battle at Hogwarts. It was intense and wonderfully done.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Helena Ravenclaw. It was very emotional and creepy. Although they did not tell us her back story with the Bloody Baron.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Rupert Grint and Dan Radcliffe shirtless. That's certainly a plus.</li></ul><br/><br/>OK you know it's bad when I resort to writing about that.<br/><br/>The bad: <br/><br/><ul><li>They completely took out the scene where Harry and Luna go into the Ravenclaw Common Room, where they are ambushed by one of the Carrows. It appeared as if they would show it, as I hope they would (I've always wanted to see the other common rooms), but then they don't. Hm.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Fred's death scene. Gone. Yup. They show his body once at the end and don't even give you time to grieve before moving on to the next scene. This was an insult to his character's memory.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Crabbe's disappeared. Gets replaced by Zabini, and replaced in a different way by Goyle.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Snape's memories are rushed and they take out some of the most interesting memories. They just go through a few of them quickly. I've always enjoyed the memories, because you get to see life at Hogwarts through the eyes of someone else for a change, in a different time era.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Hermione and Ron battle Nagini, and eventually Neville slays the snake. Eventually. It takes some time getting to that scene.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is not a single mention of Teddy Lupin. That is, until the end when Harry suddenly knows about Lupin's son. Weird, considering Harry was camping in a forest and hadn't heard of any of this.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Collin Creevey is replaced by that random Nigel kid.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The students are not sent home. No, the teachers think it's OK to just lock the Slytherins in the dungeons and let everybody else stay and fight.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Still no mention of the significance of the horcruxes. Hufflepuff's cup is just a plain old cup that Voldy turned into a horcrux.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Not enough interaction with characters other than the trio. Too much Harry. It's as if everybody else just have cameos.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Random scene where they blow up one of the bridges (ignoring the fact that there are like 2 other bridges that would take them into the school).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Voldemort's and Bellatrix's death = explosion into confetti!</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Harry does not fix his old wand with the Elder Wand. No, instead he takes the Elder Wand and SNAPS IT IN HALF. Is that even possible? I didn't think so. So Harry breaks the wand and then chucks it into the abyss. Really Yates, really?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All of the fun and cheerful dialogue from the future scene has been resorted to everybody staring and smiling at each other. No explanation once again. They don't even say who's who! Plus there is absolutely no chemistry between Dan and Albus Severus. And it was really awkward to see them all with old make up on.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Goodbye Dumbledore's back story! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Too many attempts at one-liners and humorless jokes.</li></ul><br/><br/>*End of Spoilers* <br/><br/>All in all, all of the personality and charm of the series was zapped away in an attempts to make this final movie is action-packed as possible. It's a shame to see something that you've grown up with, learned to love, taken and twisted into somebody's 'vision.' I mean, why bother adding your own unimportant scenes to the movie, when there are perfectly good ones in the book that you did not bother using at all? There's no...bonding with the characters, no connection with them you felt in Part 1. I did not feel the love for this movie like I had with the book. There was just so much significance that was left out of that movie, and it is such a shame. It had such potential to be a fantastic movie, and it fell short all because of the changes that were unnecessarily made.<br/><br/>See the movie, and I'm sure you'll form your own opinion of it. It's not a bad movie, just disappointing and unsatisfying for a die-hard fan who's been following the books for 10 years of their life."
"kjm92","10","225","360","13 July 2011"," Brilliant!
","I predict this will be the movie of the year.<br/><br/>I was thoroughly immersed in this movie from start to finish and when leaving the cinema (twice in the last 24hours) I could only hear the endless chatter of comments like ""That was great"" and ""Brilliant way to end the series"".<br/><br/>Though, in my opinion, some key factors were missing or needed more exploration I think you'll find it's easy to clue on whether you've read the novels or not. Some previously main characters were lucky to slip in a line or two whilst some of the more minor characters sneaked their way up to the top.<br/><br/>The film was brilliantly directed. Music, lighting, script; everything was flawless. Some scenes had my skin crawling and heart racing for absolutely no reason other then the fact that it was utterly eerie, it was hard not to grip the armrests in anticipation.<br/><br/>Dramatic musical build up mixed perfectly with lingering silences in all the right places. Spots that would usually host a soft violin were left with the honest and real quiet so that you could wrap your head around everything.<br/><br/>My emotions were chewed up and spit out over and over, I didn't know whether to grieve, cheer, laugh or scream and neither did the audience I was with.<br/><br/>By the end I couldn't even think of the fact that it was the end of an era, I couldn't even grasp everything that had happened which is why I'll be going to see it for the third time within this next week.<br/><br/>You wont regret paying for the full experience with this one."
"rsre4-1","Null","423","693","15 July 2011"," Too Bad It Ended Like This
","OVerall it was okay, and will make a bunch of money. But David Yates was not the best to direct the Potter films. His method always seems to be to just get through the movie as quick as possible. This has been true since OOTP. The problem is that such a quick pace leaves out many key scenes and doesn't allow the viewer to make more of an emotional investment in the story and the characters. Deathly Hallows 2 was no different. It was enjoyable enough, I suppose. But could have been so much better with just an additional 10 minutes of movie. A few additional scenes and extending a few of them just a little more could have added greater depth and emotion.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: Just some scenes that could have been added or extended: Snapes memories- a few more scenes to greater establish his closeness with Lilly and his role in fighting Voldemort. It would have helped to explain why Harry named one of his kids after a man he had hated for 7 years. And a few more lines to show his reluctance to have to be the one to kill Dumbledore. This would have shown Snapes greater respect and love for him.<br/><br/>Slightly extend the scene leading up to Mrs. Weasley fighting Belatrix. A few more seconds to establish Jinny's peril in the fight before Mrs. Weasly stepping in and uttering her great line. IT happened so fast, you could miss that Jinny was even fighting Belatrix if you blink at the wrong time.<br/><br/>SHould have shown the death of Fred and Percy's reuniting with the family. This wouldn't have taken very long and Fred deserved to have his death scene, rather than just being an afterthought body on a stretcher.<br/><br/>SHould have shown a few more individual fight sequences, especially with Hagrid. I was beginning to wonder if Hagrid was even going to appear. And there was no emotion from him when he thought Harry was dead.<br/><br/>Extend the scene of Mrs. Malfoy and Harry to better explain why she lied to Voldemort about Harry being dead.<br/><br/>Should have shown more entities involved in the fight, like parents, Hogsmead residence, the elves as lead by Kreacher - rather than showing mainly an army of kids fighting the Death Eaters.<br/><br/>MOre of the school's teachers in the fight.<br/><br/>The final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort could have been done better and stayed truer to the book.<br/><br/>OVer all, Yates' Harry Potter movies have been rather emotionless and anti-climatic. DH2, sadly, was no different."
"DonFishies","8","48","70","31 July 2011"," A breathtaking finale to an amazing series
","Moments after I saw the very first trailer for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, I was crawling with goosebumps and plagued with anxiety. After almost a decade, the franchise was coming to an end. I had already read the book, knew the plotting, and remembered the fates of all the characters, but the trailer left me in a near unfathomable state -- the end was coming, and there was nothing I could do to stop it.<br/><br/>Picking up practically the exact moment where the first half of the left off, the film begins with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) still on the trail for the elusive Horcruxes that make up Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) soul. Rather quickly, it becomes apparent that the group will need to travel back to Hogwarts, and it is there that the final battle to determine the fate of the wizarding community, and the world at large, begins.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fitting finale for one of the best and most consistent series of the past decade. It is a simply wondrous spectacle that extends and concludes the story wonderfully. While the story and effects are just as great as always, it is the final battle we have all been waiting for that delivers in spades. It is everything you imagined it would be and more. Splitting the films may still be a debatable decision, but the film is able to stand on its own much the same way the previous part did. It is that good, and that gripping. It may be the shortest Harry Potter film, but it is also the only one that feels like it knows exactly where it wants to navigate itself to with each new scene. <br/><br/>Grint, Watson and especially Radcliffe are simply stunning in their performances. They have grown up with these characters, and have gotten progressively stronger as actors with each new film. But here, they have totally immersed themselves into their roles, and the results are nothing short of magical. They are exactly how you remember them written in the book, and move from sadness, to courageous, to fearful, and more, with such passion and conviction that you forget they are simply acting. Their styles are that strong, and help provide the emotional crux the film leans on and never from. <br/><br/>Even with their varying screen times, the supporting cast is impeccable as always. Alan Rickman is spectacular and simply devastating as the devious Professor Snape. Maggie Smith finally gets some real time to shine as Professor McGonagall, as does Julie Walters as Molly Weasley (who gets the greatest line in the film). Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham Carter, George Harris, Tom Felton, Michael Gambon and Matthew Lewis also perfect their characters, and help deliver awesome performances all around.<br/><br/>But the supporting screen time is dominated by Fiennes as Voldemort. When Harry and his friends are not the focal point, Fiennes simply owns everyone. His performance always ranked amongst the best of the series, and he does not let the finale slow him down. He is horrifically evil in his interpretation, and frequently compares to his absolutely and terrifyingly brilliant performance as Amon Goeth in Schindler's List. The fear that courses through the characters' veins at the very sight or mention of his name, courses equally through the audience. Even when he is being darkly hilarious, Fiennes is downright petrifying. He is the stuff that nightmares are made of. His work is just that close to perfect in the role that it gives an almost genuine authenticity that should not come so effortlessly.<br/><br/>But like all Harry Potter films however, the cohesive product is not without its faults.<br/><br/>My main gripe with the film come out of the sheer fact that because it was split off into two parts, it allowed some of the more useless and careless sections of prose to make it into the film. Much like the extended and excruciatingly long camping trip from the first half, the second half gets dragged down by the addition of standout moments from the book that felt awful the first time you read them, and come off even worse on the screen. I know they are pandering to the audience, and adding just as much as they possibly could to make the film feel complete, but there was a reason so much was cut out of the other books when they made the leap to the big screen. This is the shortest of the saga by a long shot, and the chaotic pace makes it feel like it could have been even shorter had they chopped more out.<br/><br/>My other gripe is the 3D. The filmmakers said they did not have the right amount of time to convert the first half properly, so they just scrapped the plans. The movie looked amazing anyway, and I found myself puzzled at what exactly would have been three-dimensional about it about the second part. Save for a scene early on involving a rather badly rendered dragon, there is not much else that takes advantage of the added 3D. The majority of the film just looks and acts normal, never exploring the format, and never giving the audience a reason to care or change their minds on the quickly dying trend. <br/><br/>In what feels like a blink of the eye, the Harry Potter film series is over. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has arrived, and with it, an incredible end to the franchise. It stumbles in some places because of the inane and disappointing prose of the book, but the filmmakers have stayed true to their book and film fans, and delivered a tremendously worthy finale. It is one of the strongest films of the year, and one of the best film finales ever conceived. <br/><br/>8.5/10.<br/><br/>(An extended review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"abisio","Null","69","104","15 July 2011"," In the future AVOID any movie with Mr. Yates as director
","Harry Potter's saga had many directors; I will not go back again to who was the best (hint; a Mexican guy), but by far Mr. Yates was the worst. Mr. Yates was only interested in make an easy sell PRODUCT. The only reason the first was paced was to fill out two movies with only one book. Now, we are at the end so WHO CARES, let's just finish it, get the money and keep going. Clocking barely two hours, it feel rush and incomplete; missing lots of interesting (and even important) parts on one of the richer book of the series. Hermione and Ron do almost nothing; the others even less. Harry gets a lot of screen time but not necessary good scenes. Even the battle at Hogwarts (the only part Mr. Yates seems to be interested ) is a lame copy of ""The Two Towers"" without any kind of emotion. His direction so bad and unimaginative that when most of the characters die; we do not feel anything. In brief; worth seeing to understand how better the book is and because it is the last one; but AVOID any further movies with David Yates as director."
"moviexclusive","10","250","413","13 July 2011"," An exhilarating action-packed spectacle that delivers a magnificent finish to the beloved fantasy franchise
","An incredible journey that began a decade ago finally arrives at its close with David Yates' ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"", as 'The Boy Who Lived' comes face to face with 'He Who Shall Not Be Named' in an epic showdown between good and evil. And what a showdown it is- tense, thrilling, breathtaking, and fitting of just about any superlative you can think of. <br/><br/>Whereas the first instalment of the 'Deathly Hallows' emphasised the profound sense of loss and isolation among Harry, Ron and Hermoine, screenwriter Steve Kloves and director Yates leaves behind the moody atmosphere of the previous movie for newfound immediacy and urgency. This is all about that final battle where only one can live, and from start to finish- for once in a Harry Potter movie- the action is swift and relentless.<br/><br/>Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.<br/><br/>There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.<br/><br/>But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. <br/><br/>Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.<br/><br/>Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling.<br/><br/>Though brief, this revelation also works brilliantly as a catalyst that propels Harry to come to terms with the sacrifice he has to make. Harry's realization of this leads up perfectly to the ultimate duel between him and Voldemort, one that is fierce, ferocious and- thanks to Yates' imagination- more exhilarating than reading it off the page. <br/><br/>The outcome of that battle shouldn't be a secret by now, and when the 'happily-ever-after' coda in Rowling's book set 19 years later is also faithfully adapted here, you can't quite help but be moved by how it so properly gives the series closure.<br/><br/>They are of course no longer kids here- Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson now young adults who have through the film series grown up right under our eyes. While Part I had greater emphasis on Ron and Hermoine, the focus here is squarely on Harry and Radcliffe truly shines in this instalment- his usual understated performance allowing his audience to appreciate the enormities of the challenge before Harry.<br/><br/>That we can be so fully immersed in Harry's world is testament to the craft of each and every one of the technical team. Production designer Stuart Craig does a masterful job portraying the devastation around Hogwarts, complimented nicely by Eduardo Serra's beautiful cinematography and Mark Day's skillful editing. Alexandre Desplat's evocative score, which combines his own elegiac work with both the John Williams theme as well as Nicholas Hooper's mournful composition for the sixth movie, works magic with the visuals. And most deserving of credit is none other than director Yates himself, who has matured movie after movie to deliver a crowning achievement for the series.<br/><br/>Pardon us if we have also taken this opportunity to extol the merits of the 'Harry Potter' franchise- it's really hard not to considering how this is the last time we will see the Potter-world in its current incarnation. It is this to which the movie is a farewell to, and it is as beautiful a farewell as it can be, packed with visual spectacle on a scale never before seen in any of the other films and fused with the same powerful emotion as Part I and the Yates films before. All good- even great- things have to come to an end, so there is really no better way to bid adieu than with this grand and glorious final chapter."
"vane117","3","75","117","17 July 2011"," David Yates managed to kill the end of the series
","SERIOUS SPOILERS INCLUDED ***************************** David Heyman, the Producer of the Harry Potter films, made the single biggest mistake of his career when he decided that the Director of each film would be offered the opportunity to direct the next. Chris Columbus did a great job working with the young inexperienced actors and actresses in the first 2 films. Alfonso Cuarón and Mike Newell did good jobs with the next 2 (I wish Goblet of Fire had been split into 2 films to include many more subplots, but the primary emotional content was maintained). For various reason, each of these three directors stopped.<br/><br/>Then David Yates entered the scene and proceeded to dramatically change the feel of the films. For lack of a better word, the ""magic"" was expunged and everything took on a more ""realistic"" look. Films 5 and 6 were terrible compared with the books. I initially blamed 5 on the fact that Steve Kloves did not write the screenplay, but I now know I was wrong.<br/><br/>The film of Deathly Hallows, Part I was OK, but it was simply the setup for the emotional second half.<br/><br/>I just saw Deathly Hallows, Part II this evening and I was speechless. In addition to adding useless parts to the narrative, critical emotional scenes were eliminated (e.g. final conversation with Dumbledore and the final conversation between Harry and Voldemort/Tom Riddle where Harry gave Voldemort on last chance to find remorse).<br/><br/>Yates even managed to suck the life out of one of the most exciting moments in the book, where Molly Weasley intervenes to save Ginny from Bellatrix and yells ""Not my daughter, you bitch!"" In the film, Molly calmly makes this statement as if she is some western gunfighter.<br/><br/>The final scene between the 3 main characters (not including the epilogue) had NO life at all.<br/><br/>David Yates - shame on you.<br/><br/>Thank goodness we will always have the books."
"elie-fares16","10","140","228","14 July 2011"," The Movie Of The Year
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, part 2 also known as the movie that tore my heart and soul into oblivion. If you thought goosebumps was the criteria for a good scene, then mix those goosebumps with emotional upheaval, coupled with your hands almost shaking and this is Deathly Hallows part 2 in its entirety.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione are still on the pursuit to collect and destroy Voldemort's horcruxes. They believe the next one is hidden away in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts, the wizarding bank. But going into the bank is near impossible – unless you know a goblin who worked there, which they do. And so a deal is stricken. At Gringotts, they are discovered to be impostors. Hearts will race as they try to escape with the horcrux and as Harry soon finds out the next one is hidden inside Hogwarts and it's something that belongs to another founder of the school. And it is to Hogwarts that he goes. But Hogwarts has changed. Snape is the new headmaster.But there are many things that Harry doesn't know, the ultimate secret being one that revolves around his every being. Things are never as it seems. People will show their true colors and they will come out as triumphant even after years of hatred.<br/><br/>Dan Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have done the impossible here. They are possibly the only set of actors that you have seen grow up on the big screen and as the actors grew up on a personal level, they added their maturity to their characters. It's very fascinating to watch them interact. Their acting is relentless, captivating and charming as it should be now that they have mastered the characters they're playing. You cannot imagine other actors portraying Harry and Ron or another actress to portray Hermione. <br/><br/>Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith as Snape and Professor McGonagall respectively gave their all in this movie. You cannot help but be on the edge of your seat whenever any of these two actors are doing their thing. Rickman has a part of the movie entirely dedicated to his character's personal story. It is also one of my favorite parts of the book. The Prince's Tale is transferred so magnificently on screen that it WILL bring you to tears.<br/><br/>Professor McGonagall takes a stand – several, actually – in Deathly Hallows as well. She stands up for a Harry and when she does, the whole theater will explode in applause. Maggie Smith fortifying Hogwarts and then cracking a joke to lighten up the mood Just the way I like it. You cannot but share the pain in Smith's eyes as she sees her beloved school crumbling around her, as she sees all the work that they've done go to waste <br/><br/>And what better actor to portray this generation's most bad-ass villain than Ralph Fiennes. He gives his character an extra dimension in this movie now that he has the room to spread his wings so to speak, seeing as he's one of the movie's main pillars. Lord Voldemort is all evil. But in this movie, another side of him shows up: anguish and misery. And yet, there's this subtlety to the nuances of the portrayal that make up the overall result to be very epic, indeed.<br/><br/>Steve Kloves is the movie's screenwriter. He captured the movie's essence perfectly. He presented J.K. Rowling's work in such a brilliant way that even the slight deviations from the book (and they are very few) do not even matter anymore. He portrays the gravity of the situation to the letter: the deaths, the destruction, the revelations, the build-up. His version of the story is so well done that it would be incredible not to see an Oscar nod (and a win!) for him in the Screenplay category. He added his touch while keeping Rowling's magic. Some of the lines from the book are transferred to the movie as they are and for someone who has read the book over and over again, I was ecstatic to hear them on screen. ""Look atme."" Enough said.<br/><br/>Director David Yates has helmed the last four Potter movies and while I had my doubts about him at first (Order of the Phoenix was not exactly great), he more than surpassed my wildest expectations in this. The pace he sets for the movie never dies down. It keeps on building up and up like a beautiful orchestral crescendo. He guides his actors and actresses with confidence. He's working with a marvelous script based on a terrific book. And he has the green light to give it all out. What do you expect from a very talented director with those options? Something not less than magical.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 provides you with a sense of catharsis as it ends. It lets your senses go. It lowers your inhibitions more than alcohol. You cannot help but see your hands automatically clap at some points in the movie. You shout in desperation without even controlling your voice and you root for your characters like they're really in front of you. Tears flow down your face without any power of you to stop them. There isn't any better way to end the epic series that was Harry Potter. If only it weren't ending"
"nellevasey","Null","102","163","12 July 2011"," Could be better; was disappointed...
","We've been to the first session (virtually) of each Harry Potter movie. You expect the movie to never be exactly like a book (when is it EVER?!) but this one really did change a few things that shouldn't have been touched.<br/><br/>There was a lot of good work in this movie. Lily, James, Sirius and Remus joining Harry to go into the Forbidden Forest was well kept. The acting was impressive as usual, something one has come to expect from this group. The visual effects were also excellent, and the storyline was well followed up to a point (this is why the movie got 7/10 from the writer); however, when major changes to this occurred, disappointment set in.<br/><br/>The lack of use of the Invisibility Cloak (which we all know is one of the most important hallows to possess) by Harry throughout the movie (except for when they are at Gringotts) is puzzling, as he used it extensively to get around Hogwarts so he could manage to obtain the diadem horcrux as well as make his way to Voldemort within the Forbidden Forest. Also, when Harry 'falls' out of Hagrid's arms out in Hogwart's grounds (when all Hell breaks loose due to Nagini's demise) he uses the Cloak to escape and cause panic amongst the Death Eaters.<br/><br/>Also, the fact Harry didn't tell Neville it was imperative Nagini needed to be killed, but Hermione instead, diminishes Neville's importance! In the book, it is completely up to Neville to destroy Nagini as he is the only one left who it is thought to be able to. Also, it can be tied into the prophecy that Trelawney made all those years before as Neville killing the final horcrux, causes Voldemorts vulnerability. Thankfully, Neville is the one that kills Nagini, but more by luck than good management.<br/><br/>Harry telling Dumbledore that he had nothing to kill Voldemort with (at Kings Cross Station) was not correct, as well, as he went into the Forest with both the Cloak and a wand, which was what made him so special as he did not raise that wand against Voldemort. He instead died willingly, again showing his great strength and love of those important to him - his friends/family at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The adaptation by the screen writer, Steve Kloves, of the final scene between Voldemort and Harry of the novel - well...THAT'S A DISAPPOINTMENT!!! What J.K Rowling wrote was good enough and whenever I've read it I've always loved it and pictured it so clearly in my mind, so the whole battle scene between Harry and Voldemort was ridiculous, and could only occur because they ruined the sequence of events. VERY UNNECESSARY! The wands locking in battle – what the???? That should not have occurred, as they had different cores, different timbers and were nothing like the Twin Core Phenomenon that occurred in book four (Goblet of Fire). You don't even hear Harry say Expelliarmus which had become his 'trademark spell'.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione not going to the Headmaster's Office after defeating Voldemort, and there getting a standing ovation from all previous Headmasters and Headmistresses, and Harry not mending his phoenix feather core wand through using the Elder Wand (Death Stick) was very much an anticlimax. Instead, Harry (in the company of Ron and Hermione) snaps the Elder Wand (the possibility of which I would think is questionable in the first place!) and chucks it off the bridge (never to be seen again?).<br/><br/>It would have been nice to have had the connection between the Dumbledore's and Grindelwald explained, especially Adriana's death. This actually moulded Dumbledore into the man he became - a professor and later Headmaster of Hogwarts; never Minister of Magic; and a supporter of Muggle-born witches and wizards. It also explained how he came into possession of the Elder Wand.<br/><br/>I was so glad, and there was applause in the theatre when the epilogue occurred as its lovely to see Albus Severus Potter and the short conversation between him and his father, Harry.<br/><br/>Overall, probably not one I will see again at the movies, which is something I have done with the others (though they were disappointments in ways as well!)."

","Yeah. I came out of the film disappointed. Not feeling like I had a good time.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it was a good movie. But there are things that brought it down and too many of them for it to be forgivable.<br/><br/>1) Dumbledore's brother and sister. You know what I mean. Referred to and never followed upon.<br/><br/>2) The kiss. Didn't happen in the Chamber of Secrets. In fact, did the Chamber scene happen at all? In the book, it happens after Ron expresses concern for the welfare of the elves (in light of Dobby's heroic death) in the outbreak of a fire at Hogwarts. Here, it is given to you as a variation of the ""We're alive! Let's kiss!"" movie cliché'.<br/><br/>3) Fred's death should have been on screen. Period.<br/><br/>4) The Avada Kedavra curse didn't make bodies disintergrate. Until Voldemort (and perhaps Bellatrix, too?).

To only see their names in the full cast is scandalous to say the least.<br/><br/>(And, yes, I am aware two-time Oscar winner Emma Thompson gets the same treatment. I know she makes two small appearances, but again, she has two bloody Oscars! Either she is very humble or she needs a better agent.) <br/><br/>6) They really should have stuck with the CGI aging.

"tanujdua","9","225","386","7 July 2011"," A Brilliant ending to a great great franchise.
","I quite luckily got the chance to see this at an early screening on July 7th.<br/><br/>First impressions of the film? Brilliant.<br/><br/>Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. This pleases me because these 3 films are my personal favourites out of the 7 that have come out so far so I think it's fair to say that I was expecting big things from this. I'm very pleased to say that he's pulled it off ending the series in a fast paced, well written final act.<br/><br/>The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort (Ralph Finnes) has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.<br/><br/>Their final journey takes them to places we may not have seen recently or remembered, places such as Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley and Hogsmeade. Along the way they encounter a variety of creatures, both friend and foe from dragons to spiders, death eaters to old friends and of course, the Dark Lord himself. Will Voldemort Succeed? Or will good trump evil? For those who haven't read the book this is your chance to find out.<br/><br/>What I especially love about this film and Part 1 is the direction in which they've taken, adding more cheesy lines and (for example in Part 1) that dance sequence. I feel that these small touches bring the films closer to our hearts and help us to connect with the film a lot more. Sure they leave out a lot of information that the books provide but that's the same with all film adaptations! They've got the main story down and where they've deviated from the book it has been for the best. Not everything written down on paper will translate into visually appealing footage.<br/><br/>Part 1 to me also felt unfinished (well it was only half the book I suppose!), I mean in the way that it was long and never seemed to climax. Sure at the end of Part 1 Voldemort gets the want he so badly seeks for and leaves then the films ends on a giant cliffhanger. Part 2 definitely adds the rest of that epicness that so many other films have towards the end. It's full of action! I definitely believe that both Part 1 and 2 are best viewed with a short as possible gap in between them. Otherwise it's like watching the first disc from one of the extended editions of The Lord of the Rings and not watching the second disc for another 6 months!<br/><br/>This paragraph is about the visuals and 3D. Skip to the final paragraph for final thoughts.<br/><br/>Visually the film is stunning from an effects point of view. From the trailer alone you can see that this film has quite a lot of action in it, crumbling buildings, hundreds of spells and lots of fire. Everything looks great, from the wand duals to the dragons it all is fantastic. Also this time around it is being showed in 3D and is the first (and (probably) last!) potter film to be shown in this way. Now I was very sceptical about this, especially since they announced that the films (originally both parts) would be converted from 2D to 3D instead of being natively filmed in 3D. I believe that what they should have done was what they did with Part 1, scrap the 3D. I'm going to say that it's not great, at times it's pretty good, but never great. For the most part it's okay. I'm going to compare it with the last blockbuster film to come out in 3D, Transformers: Dark of the Moon. The 3D effect is not even close to looking as good as what that film (shot in 3D) had. So I'm going to tell you now, 2D is the best dimension to watch this film in. Having said that if you still want to (or have to) see it in 3D by all means do, the 3D doesn't take away anything from the film, but it doesn't add much.<br/><br/>I will end by saying that I definitely recommend this film for everyone, especially Potter fans. The ending that many thought could easily be done wrongly has been done right. Then when you think of Part 1 and 2 as the same film I believe that they are easily the best Potter films. This truly is a fitting ending for the boy who lived."
"jvl-89","Null","38","58","14 July 2011"," Unsatisfying
","Yes this film has amazing special effects, and the Hogwarts fight really keeps you on edge for the entire film. The fight between Voldemort and Harry was really well done, even though it deviates from the book, but being a film it has to.<br/><br/>Where this film loses point is where it omits far too much from the book. This goes for the Half-blood prince too. In fact, I think all of Yates' films follow this pattern:<br/><br/>I know they have to make some tough choices by cutting out what is not really essential. Though an extra 10 minutes would not have hurt. Dumbledore's past is only slightly hinted at in both films, but never explored. Leaves you wondering why they even bothered to mention it in either film. One thing I was really looking forward to was the fight between Dumbledore and Grindewald in a flashback of some sort. Aberforth neglected to mention anything though. I was also looking forward to the three-way duel between Voldemort, McGonnagal and someone else (I can't remember who), but that was also omitted. <br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows aren't really explained, we never know that Harry's cloak is one of them, or that Dumbledore possessed all 3 at one stage. Makes the film's name seem a little pointless. Horcruxs are also rushed. No explanation for their significance. Also, why Harry is able to go back to life, the significance of Voldemort using Harry's blood back in film 4, is all left out. <br/><br/>Most disappointing of all, is the ending. When Frodo destroys the ring, the movie doesn't just end. But when Voldemort dies, the movie ends a minute or two later. Lets not forget the 100s of death eaters that are still alive....what happened to them? There's no happy endings, rejoicing, no thankyous, nothing. <br/><br/>This is another point where I think Yates gets it wrong. There really is no interaction between Harry, Ron and Hermione. In fact, Harry doesn't have much dialog either. He doesn't even look at his Dad in the forest. This really make the film feel rushed. As I said, once Voldemort dies there really is nothing else. You kind of expect some sort of happy ending with Hagrid, the Weasleys, the Gryffindor kids. <br/><br/>But look, the film was still pretty good. I give it a 7 out of 10 and there's a load of review that will tell you why. Go read those. <br/><br/>Also, the giants looked stupid."
"knowlesy_16","1","57","93","16 July 2011"," This review will contain more emotion than this poor excuse for a film
","If I was to think of this and part 1 as one long movie, it'd be a 7/10. However it's not and part 2 was a shadow of the first. A real 'hollow' film that seemed rushed and had no great emotion or character depth which, to me, is what the final film should consist of the most. <br/><br/>The bad. 1. Goblins getting stoned from spells. 2. No real dialogue between any of the characters 3. Harry snaps the most powerful wand ever, with his bare hands after Olivander makes wands seem like living things earlier in the film. But yeah. He just snaps it. Poor storytelling. 4. The only good thing in the film (Snape's memory) was rushed. 5. Bad humour to break the tension when the tension should not have been broken. It is meant to be a dark film after all. 6. Not showing characters deaths. Which one of the Weasley's died? I challenge anyone that hasn't read the book to answer that. They showed no close up and didn't really give any notification as to who it was, except for maybe once. Which doesn't really give the characters justice and makes them seem worthless. 7. The Death Eaters just leave and I'm left asking..why? Why is this not explained? 8. The Elder Wand should not duel against it's master Harry, I thought? So why did it do so once the part of Voldemort was out of Harry and just before Nagini was killed? It's as if it went, oh, Nagini is now dead. Voldemort can die. Let's deflect the spell onto him now. So stupid. Substituting suspense with a consistent plot. 9. You'd expect some interesting words from Harry and Voldemort, especially since their feud has been hyped up for 10 years. There was none of that. 10. No screen time for anybody except Harry and Voldemort. <br/><br/>The Good. 1. Voldemort walking through blood in his bare feet talking to Nagini in parsel tongue. It was dark and brilliant. If there rest of the film had continued like that, it would of been a lot better. 2. Snape's memory. It contained emotion and served justice to the character. Which no other character truly got in this film.<br/><br/>There's loads more bad things about this film. But it's annoying me just thinking about them. There is not other good things I can think of. I feel robbed as a fan of previous films and a fan of the books. 1."
"garyvanb","9","4","4","20 November 2018"," I'm Sorry, Hermoine and Ron Who?
","The one that ends it all, after 8 films (7 books) in the wizarding world, Harry finally has a showdown with He Who Has No Nose, and it's rather confusing, but also satisfying, and other than Harry and Valdemort, the other characters who get to shine are Mrs. Weasley, who gets fed up and dispatches Bellatrix, Neville Longbottom, who singlehandedly stands up against Valdemort despite everyone laughing at him, and it is he who offs Valdemort's snake, the last vestige of his soul, allowing Harry to finish him of - and Neville also gets the girl (Luna Lovegood, a cute couple), and finally there's Severus Snape, who turns out not to be a villain after all, but endured a lot as he infiltrated Valdemort's ranks in a plan that eventually proved fatal, and all because he loved Harry's mother from afar. In the end, Harry looks upon Snape as one the bravest, noblest men he's ever known, or ever will know. So yeah, a very entertaining conclusion."
"deathy87","3","39","62","16 July 2011"," Not Harry Potter, but which film have i watched then?
","I just saw the movie and i have to admit.. the special effects and whatnot are good.... <br/><br/>BUT I'm 100% sure that David Yates never read the books, cause there are nearly no similarities to what happened in the books. I could make a full list, but i think its not worth the web space filling, so i will only write down what i remember:<br/><br/>1. In Bellatrix chamber the things inside are not just duplicating, they get very hot, so hot that they are burning them.... 2. Harry isn't telling anybody then Hermine and Ron about the Horcruxes and especially not Dumbledores brother... 3. The flames would have destroyed the diadem anyway so it wasn't necessary to kill it with the basilisk... at least not in the books... but in Davids world i guess its OK -.-' 4. The fight with Volde at the end was in front of all the people, but i guess Yates missed that too cause its certainly more expensive then just alone somewhere in the bush. 5. Harry repaired his own wand before he kept and never used the elder wand again until he would die so the power of it would vanish. 6. A looooottttt more!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br/><br/>All in all i hated the movie, in the last part of the movie i stopped watching the movie and was just thinking about how it is possible to make such a bad movie out of a wonderful book. Thanks David for making that possible!!!!!! <br/><br/>PS.: Eng is not my foreign language, if u find spelling mistakes u can keep them :D"
"abhinav-prakash","4","28","43","19 July 2011"," It could had been much much better
","Time for your OWL marks Mr. Yates and Kloves! No- don't bite your fingers; You don't get a Troll nor a Dreadful either- you have just managed yourself a resounding Poor though. Hmmm, better luck next time!- not for you but for HP fans who may want to see someone else re-doing the entire series in future. <br/><br/>Death Hallows Pt 2, for some time to come, will remain as the foremost example of a movie that could had been a classic if not for the grand opportunity missed, or rather wasted by the director and the crew. It had every resource at command- a very talented set of actors, latest 3D and computer technologies, and a 10 years old legacy to guide its way to greatness. But quite inexplicably it refused to even say 'accio' to these sources, and instead, after running impressively through half the way to summit, it wandered, stumbled, and then jumped off the path into same abyss where Harry is made to throw the Elder wand at end. The movie starts convincingly from part 1, and holds itself really well until the time the trio of H.R.H enters into Hogwarts. The scene in vault where artifacts start to multiply or the flight of dragon are superlatively done, there is no question to it. But once inside the castle, the fizz suddenly goes off the movie. <br/><br/>Yates wanted to rush towards boom boom explosions with such haste that it let the thing implode on itself. And so the second half becomes a rubble of montages and frozen frames crashed in a monumental heap where Harry Potter fans like me are still trying to find some meaningful pieces together. <br/><br/>To put it another words, the entire second half of the movie is just arranged together- there is no feeling introduced, no association built with the characters, no bridges created (but blown away certainly). It just compilation of images one after another. Pretty, no doubt, but Mr. Yates, ought to know that in wizarding world people in images also have soul; and the second half had not a shred of soul in it. <br/><br/>And therefore, I did not feel any personal sense of loss when Hogwarts shook and crumbled, when Fred, Lupin , Tonks and so many others died, and quidditch ground burned to ashes. Damn you David Yates- I had loved Hogwarts more than my own school, had ROFLed at Fred's quips and jeers, followed wizard quidditch more than Ron, and had made friends with Harry's batchmates. You dehumanized the entire saga, and left me with not even a feeling of mourning at these losses and worse-- neither one of jubilation at Harry's triumph. <br/><br/>And this is my principle discontent. In the movie, the climatic fight between Harry and Voldi occurs completely isolated and away from everyone. There is no one to watch watch this epic struggle which was building since last 7 years of the movie chronology. It was absurd and spoiled the movie for me. I had never liked the 7th book much, but still the conversation between Voledomort and Harry at the end was thrilling and enthralling – equally moving was Harry's conversation with Dumbledore's portrait. Yate's machination constructed an altogether different and vastly inferior ending.<br/><br/>As a foot-note, this is still a tolerable movie- and certainly not 'OMG-worst-movie-i-ever-saw' kind of stuff. Pity is that, it could had been much much much better."
"le_savon_fou","9","130","230","3 July 2011"," The end is good..
","Yesterday i went to a private screening of the movie and here is what i though.<br/><br/>Harry potter and the deathly hallows is the final volume in the award winning Harry Potter series and boy does it have a good send off. The acting, as usual is sensational and very convincing. Ralph Fiennes does a really amazing job at playing Lord Voldemort as he has done in all the previous movies.Lord Voldemort gets a lot of screen time and you should be please because he is really great.Also as usual, Daniel Radcliffe, Ruper Grint and Emma Watson are great as Harry,Ron and Hermione.Alan Rickman as Severus Snape is the best choice that could be done for the character as he is nearly exactly what i was imagining what he would be like when i read the book. I really do not need to tell you about his acting because its Alan Rickman and as usual he is fabulous. Michael Gambon is, as usual, a great Albus Dumbledore.Maggie Smith does a very very good Prof McGonagall...well you will have to see the movie to know what i mean but i am pretty sure you will like everything she does ! The film takes quite a few liberties from the book but to be honest, thats fine with me..one of the prime examples is the scene in the trailer where Harry and Lord Voldemort seem to hug and jump of a roof. In the trailer it looked odd and out of place but in the movie it looks pretty good and a lot less odd.The Battle for Hogwarts takes up about half the movie and is pretty spectacular and on a pretty large scale..well as spectacular as a PG-13 can be..there are so many explosions and things going on at the same time and it is just pure chaos,as the book intended i am sure, and its plain old fun to watch.Quite a few things happen in the battle that do not happen in the book but to be honest thats fine...doing a 100 percent adaptation would be a tough task and might not be as fun to watch.The movie does a great job, as the others did, at being funny seconds after a emotionally charged scene..and there are a lot of them ! I heard quite a bit of crying in all the moments you can imagine (if you have read the books) and also a lot of laughing.The special effects where very impressive, and well made if not a little over used.My only main problem with the movie is it did not need to be 3D.quite a few of the effects where clearly just to say look at me i am 3D !! It just did not feel needed. The sense of danger that Harry and crew face is very real and the director did a great job at making sure you are kept on your toes.The film is definitely the darkest in the saga so far and has quite a few intense scenes..Knowing how uptight censors can be its good that it gets away with a PG-13..I am trying to do the review without giving away too much because i am not keen on giving spoilers away at all but if you have any questions just ask and i will do my best to answer them. If you are a hardcore Harry Potter fan, you will most likely love it and it will be a whole bunch of fun.if you hate changes being made to the book chances are you will not love it so much...It may have a couple of flaws, which i am going to address below, but other than that its what it should be; a whole bunch of fun and a pretty good send of (or is it the end?) for the saga.The final scene is sweet and in all a good ending. When i left the theater it felt quite surreal as i have been nearly growing up with the Harry Potter saga, and it made me sad to know it was over..or as David Hayman said in the speech he gave before the movie, The end is just the beginning.<br/><br/>My final thoughts on it are that its a pretty amazing end to a pretty amazing saga. (i am trying to improve my reviews little by little)"
"tnybny","2","28","44","5 August 2011"," Utter Gibberish.
","This movie was so low on my expectations, and it did not disappoint. From the last few movies of Harry Potter that have come out, being an avid reader of the books, I've absolutely loathed the way they've been commercialized for the box office, ignoring a lot of the story that made the story so very emotional. Yes, when I say that, I mean FOR the box office. Yates probably knew he had messed up the series and thought he might as well earn a few bucks and make this an utter fiasco instead of using its plot to live up to the potential it had for an Oscar.<br/><br/>Spoiler alert: This movie had so many moments where people go out of character I don't even know where to begin, but I'll try. I'm actually finding it really hard to understand how people have missed it. I'll point out a few instances, they're not in sequence of events, they're just what comes to mind spontaneously:<br/><br/><ul><li>During Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort's epic battle, at a time when Voldemort is ARMED WITH A WAND, instead of targeting the killing curse at Harry, he KICKS HIM AROUND ON THE FLOOR. What is this? Alcoholic husband goes on rampage? THIS is HARRY POTTER people. The world of MAGIC. These things DO NOT happen, sorry Yates.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As part of the same scene, Harry throws out a one-liner at Voldy and grabs him by the head and jumps off what appears to be some like of a terrace in Hogwarts, pummeling them in to a fall which appears to be about 15 seconds long, and they just shrug off the dirt from the ground and start crawling toward their wands, unharmed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>McGonnagall throws out a couple of one-liners that are totally out of character when she asks Filch to escort Slytherin house to the dungeons and another when she casts that Locomotor spell and says she's always wanted to use it.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The oh so timid Neville also comes up with a stupidly placed heroic speech when Voldemort brings Harry's body forward and asks people to join him.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Don't even get me STARTED at the part when LORD VOLEMORT *HUGS* Draco Malfoy. Since when does the Dark Lord HUG people?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>On a lighter note, when Harry returns to school, Seamus throws out a one-liner at Ron when Ginny sees Harry.</li></ul><br/><br/>Those were probably the more major ones, but I'm sure everyone would've liked the movie better with a few changes like more scenes from Snape's past and better makeup for Mr. Malfoy, but I'm restricted on words here.<br/><br/>End of spoilers.<br/><br/>You also probably should know that I've registered on IMDb JUST to rate this movie the pathetic 2 stars it deserves and write this review.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Yates, you're the biggest fool on Earth, oh and PLEASE read the books."

","I went to this movie with high expectations considering the good job the makers had done with the first part,but all this movie did was leave a bad taste in my mouth and was ultimately a huge disappointment.<br/><br/>I really did not get what the makers were trying to do in the end. It was as if they had lost the plot in the last half an hour.<br/><br/>The movie to a certain part does keep in line with the book but just when you think this will be the best potter movie ever, it gets screwed up and screwed up big time.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe sleepwalks through the entire film probably just wanting to do away with the movie. Everybody else get bit role.<br/><br/>The ending was a big disappointment especially for the people who have read the book.<br/><br/>Voldemort looks unintentionally funny,especially his laugh after showing the dead body of Harry to everyone. I warn you this scene is really funny.I think everyone was laughing for this scene.His voice is also really bad,not at all fear inducing.<br/><br/>I cant believe Harry did not get any applause for defeating 'the greatest dark lord in history'. A big joke really. <br/><br/>Sure it is the end of an era and even i clapped when the movie ended but somehow the end was not that satisfying. Great graphics and the humour when intended has come out really well."

In one scene, when Harry walks to the Forbidden Forest to sacrifice himself...after ALL these times of being together, fighting together,..Hermione just cried and gave him a hug and did NOTHING. Ron was just standing there, saying nothing. What kind of friendship is this? They were supposed to be best friends! It got way away from the book.<br/><br/>2. No real jokes.<br/><br/>3. In one scene when Dumbledore's brother asked Harry where is Dobby, Harry answers so bluntly and quickly as if it doesn't matter at all - ""He's dead"".<br/><br/>4. There were loop holes all around the place, no history about Ariana, Dumbledore, Horcruxes, and most horrible thing is that Harry breaks the elder wand whereas it was to be used to fix his real wand! And....etc.<br/><br/>5. In the last scene, the boy who acted as Albus Severus...is a stupid child...they all sounded like ROBOTS. And no freaking jokes or punchlines! They totally ruined the ending.<br/><br/>6. After killing Voldemort, OMG, no cheering no nothing? I was puzzled for a second if anybody knew that he really died or not...! It's awful.<br/><br/>7. After Harry's 'dead' body was carried to the Hogwarts, except for Ginny everyone took it simply, I mean what the hell? You guys are all wooden characters!<br/><br/>The only good side of this movie was when Harry got into Snape's memory, I cried again for Snape. :'(<br/><br/>I'm really disappointed because Harry Potter series is my most favorite book series!

"narayan-divya88","1","40","67","2 August 2011"," Rowling's work has been abused severely...
","Elder Wand works despite cracking??? What is going on in this film??? Humor was placed at inappropriate times. It was supposed to be a hard, intense, fast-paced, all-out action, battle-hard, World War 2-kind of film, but this is anything but. Those who are in need of a good laugh might enjoy this film. Rowling's wizarding laws are completely decimated. Since when did Harry start 'sensing' horcruxes? Did Harry even possess this ability to 'sense' horcruxes to begin with? In that case, why didn't he realize that the diary in 'Chamber of Secrets' is a horcrux, and Slytherin's locket and Nagini in 'Deathly Hallows Part 1' are also horcruxes? In such as a situation, the trio would've been totally spared the trouble of wandering around like nomads (searching for the remaining horcruxes) like they did in Part 1. It doesn't even work that way. But then the previous adaptations were so horribly created (if you can call them adaptations, that is) that the film-makers had to tie up the loose ends somehow, and the end result is there for everybody to see. <br/><br/>Oh yeah, Bellatrix and Voldemort burst and erupt like confetti when they die. And after Harry kills Voldemort, no one even cares two hoots about what has happened. They are all behaving as if Voldemort never even existed in the first place, drinking tea in the Great Hall (not even a ""Well done, Harry""). In that case, why did they even fear to speak his name for all these years?<br/><br/>I am a fan of Rowling's writing. But the films have never lived up to that standard. And this one, I'm afraid, is no different."

","*contains spoilers.<br/><br/>I saw the movie a few days back and was utterly disappointed with David Yates. what was that anyway?! Seriously, David, did you read the book or was it what you heard from the fans that made you do the film that way. even that would be bad if it had been told by a fan.<br/><br/>first of all, the good points. 1. the Gringotts scene was good but could have been better. 2. the room of requirement scene leaving the part when harry found the diadem(in the box!!!!!). 3. the cinematography. the bad points, lots of them. 1. why did Griphook want the Gryfindor's sword we all wonder. 2. whats with the Huffelpuff's cup to be selected by Voldermort for a Horucrux??? i.e. his fetish for the important things. 3. Dumbeldore's life and lies. nothing we hear about it. 4. the school, what were all the students doing there at that moment??? 5. harry found the diadem in a box(shining)!!!! 6. no justice done to the battle of Hogwarts. come on it was supposed to be a battle! 7. death of Fred Weasly and the Percy's famous dialog ""minister i forgot to give you my resignation"" was not shown. even after wards Fred was not mentioned. 8. what was that when molly Wesley got Bellatrix? she just burst up into god knows what! where was the dead body? it showed that the death eaters did not turn to just dead bodies! 9. what was that speech by Neville when he should be killing nagini which he did though after taking much of the unwanted screen time. 10. harry when first brought in by hagrid was supposed to be shocking but leaving Ginny others took it quiet calmly. 11. then the best part harry and voldemort playing hide and seek and we see voldemort battling harry with the elder wand that was supposedly not be working against harry. we should have seen voldermort after casting the death spell which after deflecting by harry's disarming spell hit voldermort and he should have been dead like each of the others coming to the same end after death as equal but he had to be different for Yates... he blows up!!! amusing. 12. now coming to the best part. i literally had my hands on my head when this was shown. harry breaks the elder wand into two and throws it. can it be done!!! what harm would have it done if he could have stuck to the book? 13. the epilogue was disastrous. no more on that.<br/><br/>on the whole a good script already prepared by J.K.Rowling wasted by Yates."
"dapatrickj","1","69","123","19 July 2011"," One of the Worst Films iv ever watched!
","First of all I must explain that I am a huge fan of the books. They practically taught me to read. This is perhaps why I found the film so devastatingly disappointing. It is worth noting that if you have never read the book you may find this film to be entertaining.<br/><br/>The good: -The scene with the room of requirements is very accurate and entertaining. Especially with Harry saving Malfoy and Crabe dying. <br/><br/><ul><li>Helena Ravenclaw, he scene was spooky and pretty much the same as the book. However it just seemed so rushed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Neville was pretty much spot on. Just not enough air time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Gringott's scene was accurate, but again so very very rushed. </li></ul><br/><br/>And that's pretty much it for the good.<br/><br/>The Bad: -The constant pointless inaccuracies to the book. I'm well aware that things must be adapted when making a film from a book. But here they seem to change so many things, some important some not so important, for no particular reason. For example some of the Hogwarts students SEEM to be living in the room of requirement, so they can hide from Snape but they still go to the great hall, when he calls them. And when the battle for Hogwarts is about to begin, instead of evacuating all the under aged students out of the castle, they are allowed to fight, and the Sliverins are just kept in the dungeons. I won't list them all, as there are far far far too many to mention. But this is the main thing that really lets the film down.<br/><br/>-Bits of the story that they failed to mention earlier in the films just appear out of no where, and carry on as if we've known about them all along. For example the ghost of Lupin talking about his son. Nowhere in the films is it mentioned that he has a son, and its actually a fairly big part of the book. <br/><br/>-Fred's death is skated over very quickly. This is so disappointing, because in the book this is pretty much the biggest death. But before you know it, its over and Fred is never talked about again.<br/><br/>-There is hardly any talk about the deathly hallows. No wait scrape that, there is pretty much NO talk of the deathly hallows, and it's the title of the FILM! Not even Dumbledore talks about them, and that is such a massive part of the book, and a massive part of Dumbledore.<br/><br/>-The entire film should have been called ""Harry and the lost Cameo"" because that's what it is! Every other actor just seems to have cameos. <br/><br/><ul><li>Percy's on the good side all of a sudden. No explanation at all (a reoccurring theme with Yates, don't you think?).</li></ul><br/><br/>-Absolutely no Dumbledore back story. This is just such a huge part of the book.<br/><br/>-The final fight scene Between Harry and Vol is just completely inaccurate. The whole point of Harry being the master of the Elder wand but not possessing it is that Vol can't cast any spells at Harry, and there he is shooting all sorts at him.<br/><br/>-Voldemort's death is pathetic, plus its meant to take place in the great hall were everyone can see it. <br/><br/>-One of the worst parts of this film is the epilogue. It takes place 19 years into the future. So I hoped they would have used different actor. NOPE instead they made a very poor attempt at ageing them all, by making Harry and Ron Fatter and Ginny and Hermione just plain frumpy. It's a horrible way to end a hugely disappointing film.<br/><br/>I can't believe the film is being so well received, and I really can't believe that J.K. Rowling is happy with this film. If you're a lover of the books then please don't do it to yourself to watch this film. Just read the book again."
"jburtroald95","10","9","12","24 July 2011"," I can't believe this is the last Harry Potter review I'll ever get to write!
","Fifteen years of tireless, incredible hard work from some of the best of Britain's storytelling talent, supported by an equally faithful and eagerly devoted fan base, now culminates in the cinematic experience of a lifetime. Ever since the frothily juvenile but still undeniably good quality Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone first hit cinema screens in 2001, the Harry Potter saga has experienced countless crucial plot developments, more and more introductions of new characters and actors, several new directors and frequent changes of tone, all to give an astounding and vastly rewarding end result. <br/><br/>As a stand-alone film, this largely action heavy film would most likely be dismissed as merely glitzy uninspired bore, but our familiarity and previously established emotional connection with these characters and their stories means that we are holding our breath during every dangerous moment instead sitting back indifferently and indulging in ego- boosting cynicism. Today's moviegoers will not just simply throw away their sympathy and compassion at any tortured, miserable face a director puts on the screen, unless the film in question is a serious depiction of a real-life tragedy. However, when it comes to the Harry Potter characters, there is a remarkable type of long-term relationship that has been built over our long period of acquaintanceship with them, transcending the usual barriers that are placed in front of fictional characters and ultimately making this an impossibly lovable and endlessly enthralling movie.<br/><br/>Part 2 of the final chapter initially continues in the vein of its taut yet gloomy predecessor, showing our three effortlessly likable main heroes on their believably difficult quest to locate and destroy Lord Voldemort's horcruxes. Whilst searching, they must constantly be on the lookout for any of the dark lord's ever more numerous agents who are trying furiously to hunt them down. In addition to the vicious death eaters, many other wizard folk who were formerly opposing him have now begun to join his side of the battle out of a deep-seated fear. Others have simply found it easier and simpler to continue drifting along living sheltered lives and being, for the moment, cocooned from the horrors taking place outside. After the comically inept Ministry of Magic was swiftly overthrown, most of its employees have been compliantly carrying on with their everyday work, even though they know what they are contributing to. The same applies to the sedentary yet sinister Gringotts goblins, as we see when the trio makes a clumsy infiltration of the almost impenetrable wizard bank in order to find the next horcrux in a frivolously entertaining early action sequence that, like the opening sequences of the similarly paced Indiana Jones series, is a wonderful appetiser.<br/><br/>However, nostalgically like the first six Potter installments, the bulk of this film takes place at the historic Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, placing the search for the remaining horcruxes in a profoundly different environment and atmosphere. Instead of feeling alone and helpless surrounded by nonchalant and corrupt citizens, they are amongst the most loyal and supportive friends anyone could wish for. The infallible trust and beautiful hope we see in their eyes as they see that Harry has arrived to rally them all into finally facing off the forces of evil that are oppressing them is astonishingly touching.<br/><br/>However, this is all sadly a double-edged sword, with terrible consequences being presented as well as good points. Voldemort predicted that Harry would return to Hogwarts at some point to seek the aid of his old allies and is ready for him when he arrives. When he makes a full-scale siege on the castle in order to extract Harry, the hundreds of teachers and older students as well as the surviving members of the Order put up a fiercely brave struggle against a colossal dark army of snatchers, giants and death eaters. With the ongoing fatalities and mortal injuries, Harry's conscious is pricked by the thought that he is letting them down as ""the Chosen One"" by not being able to defend them. Our empathy is certainly with Harry as the guilt and the doubts overwhelm him, but it is clear that his friends would much rather die in this horrific battle then join Voldemort and gutlessly scavenge an undeserved existence. They stare in the face of terrible danger and somehow know that this can be overcome in the end.<br/><br/>This rebellious spirit is supported Voldemort's visible deterioration. He cares only about avoiding death at any cost, and so he has in fact resorted to scavenging that miserable existence, with horrifying results. As the horcruxes are disappearing, he is experiencing a gradual destruction of the soul that is far worse than death. His final demise is far from sudden: the direction from David Yates drops small hints and artistic allusions that show the formerly great and powerful figure slowly being reduced to nothing. <br/><br/>That this has all been depicted so effectively is largely attributed to the masterful acting from Ralph Feinnes, who has managed brilliantly to create a very fascinating character. It is often mentioned that the cast is filled with an abundance of accomplished British actors that help significantly to lift the status of the films. While there are countless acting veterans listed in the credits, apart from Feinnes, it is really only Rickman, Gambon, Maggie Smith and Helena Bonham Carter that are given a decent amount to flourish with. Matthew Lewis is another standout, giving a terrific performance incredibly noble, righteous and heroic Neville Longbottom.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a film undoubtedly about loyalty, and both its characters and its fans are in the end rewarded by it. For that, and all of the other reasons, I look forward to seeing this gem soar up the top 250 as far as it can possibly go, and I hope it really pushes the buttons of the arrogant anti-Potter cynics when it land near the top."

","I've been a big fan of the books having read each several times in the American and British versions. I was interested to see the movies knowing that there would be some changes required because of length and the fact that it is hard for movies to show thoughts. I have often been disappointed in each movie because of the illogical changes to plot lines beginning with Professor Quirrell not being harmed when he touches Harry but being destroyed when Harry touches him.<br/><br/>The seventh movie in the series was the WORST for plot changes. Voldemort (the ""t"" is supposed to be silent) does extraordinary things with Dumbledore's wand, not because it's part of the plot, but because it makes more special effects possible. While, in the book, Harry never jumped off the school with Voldemort, it's added to the movie because it's another chance for unnecessary special effects.<br/><br/>In the final battle, it isn't shown why Fred was the one killed. Whenever anyone ""good"" is killed, they simply fall over dead. Yet, when Bellatrix Lestrange and Voldemort explode into tiny black triangles(?). Neville's attainment of the sword of Griffindor after his speech to Voldemort and Harry's speech with Voldemort wherein he wraps up all the plot twists is changed to nonsense to allow the addition of more special effects.<br/><br/>I've never been more upset after a movie, tho' having to waste $18 on totally worthless 3D effects didn't help."
"philipforever","2","15","23","20 October 2011"," Absolutely dreadful - If you love the books, don't watch it
","This final Harry Potter movie might be one of the worst films in years. But only if you've read the books. If you didn't read the books, it's nice and entertaining. The acting is quite good and the special effects are amazing. If you did read the books, it's absolutely dreadful. <br/><br/>I consider myself to be a Harry Potter fan. I just love the books, I've read them all a couple of times. Especially the last one ""The Deadly Hallows"" is one of the best books I've read, even though this is a children's book. The whole story comes together beautifully.<br/><br/>But in this movie, The Deadly Hallows Part 2, the magic that the book offers is completely absent. In the first movies, some of the details were a little bit different from the books. It annoyed me, but I could understand it. It made the movies more watchable and you can't get every detail from a book into a movie can you? But here! Not only a few details are different, everything is different! I would expect a few scenes to be faster or more dramatic, but there are whole parts of the movie that are nowhere to be found in the books. I simply can't understand why they've changed so much. I wonder if I've read a different version of the book than the directors. They just made up whole new scenes. <br/><br/>Imagine Frodo in Lord of the Rings not dropping the ring into a volcano of lava but in one of tar. Imagine everyone but Frodo sailing away in to the west in the end. That would make the whole thing kinda different right? <br/><br/>Why is the whole school called in front of Snape, while the key figures are supposed to be hiding in the room of requirement? Why does Harry just reveal himself to Snape instead of in a classroom with the Carrows? Why doesn't Harry reveal himself to be still alive once Mrs Weasley has killed Bellatrix Lestrange? But no, he's already running around and fighting with Voldemort. And why does Voldemort go up in smoke once killed? <br/><br/>This is all wrong. I give the movie a 2 for effort. If you like the books, don't watch this movie, it might ruin the story you love."
"alvispotter-1","10","38","68","15 July 2011"," The perfect ending for my perfect franchise
","Some might stop reading by my review title, and that's okay. First thing to know if you want to keep reading is that i'm more than a huge fan of Harry Potter, books and movies (even though i love the books much more... however, while i haven't been on board with every decision on screen, i have LOVED all the films and they are my favorite films in the world. I understand they're not the best, but they are my personal favorite, and considering all the love they get, i can honestly say i'm not alone).<br/><br/>So you might see where i'm going. I LOVED THE FILM! I just did. I have been waiting to death for this final installment and even from the first trailer it looked just epic. Obviously it came from the perfect finale from the book, but it still was hard to translate to screen. And they manage to do it perfectly for me. Spoilers from now on I cried my heart out (especially since Snape dies), i laughed (well, they included more jokes than i would have intended, but boy i laughed) and my heart was beating all the way through the fastest 2 hours of my life. And you can't just have a better cinema experience.<br/><br/>Now, as an adaptation it is good. There are many things missing from the 2nd part that i won't ignore and some things could have been better, but they conveyed the main theme, sticked to that and made an awesome film. Although even at my 2nd viewing i'm not still convinced with Ron and Hermione just letting him go to die so easily, that should have been like the book.<br/><br/>But that's just it: so many things can be added, but the film is just so amazing as it is. It has EPIC written all over it, and the finale we had all been waiting for. The battle scenes were breathtaking, and the characters were at its best.<br/><br/>As usual, but even more this time, the production was great: visual effects were top notch and deserve the academy award; Desplat outdid himself with the score, and while i loved part 1's he creates the music so fitting and so beautiful that made us all bawl; Stuart Craig needs the Oscar, enough said; Serra made some beautiful and memorable shots, editing good, etc.<br/><br/>The acting was actually very good from the trio and mainly from anyone, but it is obvious who stands out: Alan Rickman as Snape. Seriously, i was very afraid of this scene, and they did it beautifully (they cut many things but did it perfect). Alan not only made us cry, but he gave a very VERY strong performance.<br/><br/>So many things could be said about this perfect final film for this incredible series of films. David Yates (who directed this incredibly) created an amazing send-off to this story (in the films of course) that will stay in many of our hearts, and personally it shall never leave mine.<br/><br/>So go see the final film or miss the amazing final film of a series that has changed millions of us... into much better people. Thanks Jo, i can't ever thank you enough."
"LeviticusStroud","2","12","18","30 July 2011"," Should have done much better, an insult to Rowling and the fans!
","There are an awful lot of reviews talking about how this film is 'the best yet' and how it 'ticks all the boxes' or is 'a must for fans'. It is none of these!<br/><br/>7 years ago I walked out of watching the 3rd film cursing and swearing out loud about how poor the conversion of book to film had been done. Scenes dropped and changed for 'time considerations' whilst others were invented and thrust in- all creating plot holes that did not exist in the novel. <br/><br/>This time I walked out praying that I live long enough to see someone take the books and redo the ENTIRE series properly, using the obvious failures done in the films to date as a road map for improvement.<br/><br/>**SPOILERS**<br/><br/>It is, unfortunately, near impossible to give a proper review of this film without including at least some spoilers. Whilst one can make generic statements such as 'divergence from source material is too great', 'plot holes cause a lack of integrity' and 'over editing leads to a lack of connection to the characters' none of it means too much without going into at least a little detail.<br/><br/>Simple things such as not showing the death of Fred, despite having gone into George's injury so well in part 1, or the massively powerful and indestructible Elder Wand being snapped in half with little to no effort whatsoever are good examples. Bellatrix's wand was more durable for god's sake!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, having just spent an entire previous film searching for Horcruxes they suddenly jump from finding one in the form of a cup based on logical deduction to guessing where the next one is on what appears to be a whim. For the sake of taking 90 seconds of screen time to mention that the ring was Slytherin's and the goblet was Hufflepuff's, and it would seem logical for Voldemort's ego to have a desire to stamp his dark magic on a legendary item for each of the 4 founders- therefore Ravenclaw would be a good place to look next- instead Yate's goes and has the characters make a crazy leap of logic for which they need to endanger their lives with no apparent reason behind it whatsoever. This is storytelling of the lowest calibre!<br/><br/>These things aren't just failures to adapt the book correctly when to do so would have been better than making alteration, they are basic failures of storytelling that any student on a film or writing course would have lost marks on if it were an assignment. These plot holes, discontinuities, omissions and alienations are in such great number that if it were an assignment it would, in fact, have been lucky to scrape through with a D as a result!<br/><br/>No doubt we will see the score of this film drop over time as more and more people- particularly on 2nd watching, or seeing it for the first time on an average size TV or ten years from now when special effects technology has moved on- find the imagery far less awe inspiring than the films flaws. At that point the realisation will kick in that this is actually a very poor rendition of the source material that almost any hack director could have put out just as well if not better with the budget and cast/crew available to hand."
"cory-d-watson","6","12","18","21 July 2011"," Felt Like I'd Been Hit With a Cruciatus Curse
","I was a late-comer to the Harry Potter series. I saw the Sorcerer's Stone for the first time right before the Half Blood Prince came out. Within a month of that first experience with the wizarding world, I saw all the films and read all the books thrice. I was hooked.<br/><br/>The books are excellent in that they capture the innocence of youth and the pain of reality in a beautiful dichotomy that both kids and adults can relate with and enjoy. They are engaging, flow extremely well, and keep you on your toes the whole way through. They're as much mystery as fantasy, making the reader a part of the discovery process, and are a delight to read.<br/><br/>The films, up to this point, portrayed those concepts brilliantly. The first two were bright, fun, and drew you in to a fascinating, surprising world. The middle three began to slowly grow darker, pulling you deeper into the emotions, fears, and relationships of the characters. The sixth and first half of the seventh saw the characters you had grown to love being forced to grow up quickly, confront their fears, and fight for their lives. It was with great excitement that I went into this final film...knowing that it was to house both the climax of the action and the final resolution.<br/><br/>Following the movie, I walked out of the theater unsatisfied and annoyed. I'm not going to go on a tirade about what was left out that was in the books. That has been done exhaustively already. Instead, I will simply say that this movie ""missed it."" <br/><br/>It missed the pain of the story. The physical pain of hot treasure in the vault was omitted. The emotional pain of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks' deaths seemed an afterthought, being given about 20 seconds. Where was the pain of Hagrid thinking Harry dead? Where was the pain of Helena Ravenclaw and her tragedy with the Bloody Baron? Where was Draco's pain, having lost two of his closest ""friends?"" The answer, there wasn't any. No pain at all.<br/><br/>It missed the drama and emotion of the story. Aberforth had no emotion at all in his 10 second tirade on his brother (before Harry dismissed the conversation). The pensieve scenes were short, awkward, and didn't explain much of anything. Alan Rickman's tears while holding Lily were the only believable emotion in the entire film. And then there was Harry going to his death. Instead of him leaving the headmaster's office alone and walking straight to the forest, it saw him awkwardly informing Hermione of his plan, receiving an even more awkward hug, and then having an even more awkward talk with his parents, Serius, and Lupin (you'd think having only been able to talk to his parents for about 20 seconds during the priori incantatum in the graveyard in his life, that he'd at least look at his father more than once). Snape died in a boathouse instead of the symbolic shrieking shack where so many historical events had occurred. Neville's speech was embarrassing, and Voldemort's mannerisms after he thought Harry dead were laughable. The acting just seemed forced the entire way through. Emma and Rupert had no chemistry...seeming uncomfortable around each other. Overall, I wasn't drawn in, I was just watching things happen on a screen.<br/><br/>It missed the action of the story. Yes, that's right. I don't care how many statues, giants, or dragon you have. I wanted to see Voldemort dueling three people at once. I wanted to see Kingsley Shacklebolt tearing into someone. I wanted to see Molly fight for more than 8 seconds with Bellatrix (and a little more passion in her cussing the woman who had just almost killed her daughter would have been nice). I wanted to see house elves stabbing people in the ankles with knives and centaur arrow wounds. Instead, I got a lot of giants with big sticks, a bridge exploding, and 3 minutes of chasing a snake around. The battles in the books were so good because real people whom you knew and really wanted to win fought them. This just looked like the fight scene at the end of Russell Crowe's Robin Hood with wands.<br/><br/>Finally, it missed the closure of the story. Voldemort was not killed in a single, decisive moment. Instead, it consisted of 10 minutes of rolling, flying, physical punching (by the most powerful wizard in the world), and eventually a standoff where no words were spoken and Voldemort died by breaking into pieces and floating away. That might work in Transformers, but not the Potterverse. The bridge scene at the end with the disposal of the Elder Wand looked like they threw it in because they forgot to film anything else, and the epilogue was painfully awkward.<br/><br/>While the movie had good special effects, it sadly played out more like a smash-fest Transformers than an emotionally charged Gladiator or Braveheart. It had some humor, but that was the closest thing to real emotion or drama you could find. Here's to Snape...the single redeeming factor in the entire film. I'm sorry to see the franchise go out this way. Maybe they'll release an extended edition that will redeem it somewhat. Here's to hoping."
"summeriris","1","12","18","17 July 2011"," OK film, terrible adaption
","Deathly Hallows works all right as a film, I suppose. My enjoyment of it was just spoilt by the total lack of respect shown by the director and scriptwriter for the source matériel. The book had a rather good plot and not bad characters. Would it have hurt the film that much to include any of that. No, all of that was junked to put in scenes that had nothing to do with the plot of the book, twist and slant other parts of the book plot, ignore quite a lot of important book points and simply never refer to the main plot point of the book at all. Does anyone recall anything about what the Deathly Hallows actually were and how many Harry had, if indeed he had any?<br/><br/>So OK film, terrible, terrible adaption."
"Bangell153","1","33","59","30 August 2011"," Boring, Ridiculous, Devoid of Tension
","The final nail is hammered into the coffin of Harry Potter as the series dies in a stupid action-fest. I'm going to list three reasons I dislike this movie and the direction the Harry Potter films have taken, and then I'll let you all lynch me.<br/><br/>1. Tone<br/><br/>Tone is important to a movie. You can make it dark, or light-hearted, or funny, or scary, but if you mix it up too much you'll end up with a film that's hard to take seriously. Harry Potter started off as a charming phenomenon for kids - the peril was mild, we were constantly meeting magical new people and creatures and it was all great. Then we come to this movie, and by now I've got no idea what the tone is meant to be. It's certainly not a light-hearted movie for kids any more. It's not really an adult film either. You've got something close to horror in one scene, and then you've got comedy, and then romance, and it's hard to tell when you're meant to be excited or laughing or scared. The constant humour and the earlier films have established this universe as a very light-hearted one, and so when we're introduced to Voldemort and his big, evil taking-over-the-world plan, there's not really much of a sense of danger. People try to tell me that the series has grown and matured as its audience has grown and matured. Now, I started reading the books when I was very young, so I'm part of that audience. I'd rather appreciate it if people stopped feeding me that crap - you pick a tone and you stick with it, or I won't be able to take anything seriously.<br/><br/>2. No Tension<br/><br/>You can spend as much as you want on amazing visuals and complex action sequences, but they won't be exciting unless you make the audience care. I have to be worried about whether the protagonists will succeed, and the obstacles need to be hard to overcome. In the earlier films, they had interesting obstacles: look at the first film, where they had to get past a series of tests to get to the philosopher's stone. Then in the second, they hatched a plan to transform into other people in order to sneak around. It was tense; they could get caught.<br/><br/>The new films may have cool visual effects, but they're unimaginative. The phrase ""deus ex machina"" sums up a lot of this movie. For example, they enter the bank. Holy crap, a giant dragon! How will they overcome this?! Oh, don't worry, this goblin guy is just going to ring a bell. Yeah, keep ringing... There we go, problem solved. Wow, how exciting! Now, let's get the thing we came in to get which the audience doesn't care about... Oh no, the room's filling up with gold, but I'll just keep going and... Yeah, there we go, got the thing. Now, let's leave. Oh, no! The place is collapsing! How will we get out?! Oh, a massive flying dragon we can ride on. That's convenient. Off we go!<br/><br/>It just felt like a series of things which happened. Every obstacle had some immediate and convenient resolution. Even when Harry died we all knew that he'd just somehow come back to life. It just sucks out all the tension.<br/><br/>3. Harry Potter is Ruined<br/><br/>Like I was saying earlier, remember how Harry Potter used to be a charming adventure for kids? By the end of this series, that's all gone. They don't spend much time in the magical castle, they spend it in the dull English countryside. Every book used to be a fun adventure at Hogwarts, which was full of mystery as well as familiar, enjoyable people and settings. Now our lovable fictional universe is the setting for some uninteresting conflict which we don't really care about. JK Rowling wants to make a load of points about modern issues and politics. In the end, these turn out to be very shallow, broad, and uninteresting. Here's a hint: your books got popular because we wanted to read about Harry's magical adventures, not the Ministry of Magic getting taken over by Nazis. Oh, no, wait, it's a serious series for adults now, no more childish fun to be had here. <br/><br/>Anyone who watched George Lucas ruin the Star Wars franchise with the prequel films will see that mirrored here: iconic, wonderful, interesting things from the earlier films are shoved into the film in excess. George Lucas had a billion lightsabre duels. In Harry Potter we've got a massive fight with wands. It looks amazing; bolts of red and green stuff flying all over the place, people getting knocked down, things exploding... But that's not the point of wands. Think back to the duel between Harry and Malfoy in the Chamber of Secrets. That looked rubbish. It was small. But it was far more exciting and gripping than hundreds of wands discharging all over the room like they're laser guns. Likewise, remember the duel between Harry and Voldemort at the end of the fourth film. Different coloured streaks of magic stuff came out of the end of each wand and the only real action was in Harry's face going grrrrhnnngrrrr... But that was great - it was the first proper face-off between Harry and his mortal enemy; it was a clash of good and evil, an exciting showdown with the villain. Now all that's been ruined.<br/><br/>There are many more things I could list. The fanboys will hate me in any case. But this simply wasn't a good film, and the magic of Harry Potter is long gone."
"indiefilmslover","4","13","20","4 November 2011"," David Yates ruined the movie
","I found other comments from boards and posts around the net, I found that I agree with all of them. I'm a fan of the books and Yates ruined the franchise. He sucked out all of the magic and unnecessarily changed key parts of the story or left them out all together.<br/><br/>Other HP fans on the film: <br/><br/>""I think that the film missed too many points of the books.<br/><br/><ul><li>If Voldemort could feel the horcruxes being destroyed, he would have changed their location in book 6.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Things Just Happen: for example when Harry gets Resurrection stone, he doesn't turn it three times. The spirits just appear.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>People were laughing in the cinema for many many things, not because they were funny, but because there was bad acting, bad lines, bad effects. Imagine most of the theater laughing for the mauled Voldemort in Harry's dream.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Unnecessary changes. Why every wizard can fly without brooms? It was supposed to be Voldemort's specialty. That sucked big time.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Making exciting moments of the books so boring or omitting them totally. In the book it was so exciting to have Harry wonder in the castle with his cloak.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Blowing up a bridge with 100 death eaters on it  wait? There was a bridge in Hogwarts? Wait, at the end there is another bridge on top of some bottomless valley.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Voldemort's death, final battle, watch 8 movies and at the end Voldemort dies with bad CGI effect. There was no dynamics. The book's version was million times better with Harry telling things and what he had understood. And Bellatrix didn't blow up in bits and pieces. It seems to me that killing people with CGI effects is OK to show to kids. Killing people as it would happen in ""real life"" isn't. </li></ul><br/><br/>Yates decided that the movie had to be shot from his personal point of view, as a director, pitiful fight scenes, saw little action the whole movie and if you did they were short. <br/><br/>1. It failed to create a satisfactory ending for all characters. Where was Neville being surrounded by admirers? Where was Kreacher in the battle of Hogwarts? How was Percy suddenly reunited with his family? etc.<br/><br/>2. It left out the whole Dumbledore and Grindelwald plot which i thought was great in the book. It started it in part 1 but never really finished it. There was no possible reason i can think off to remove this from the film other than stupidity.<br/><br/>3. The final battle was neither as epic or as dark as was promised. It never created that sense of peril that it should of done or the sense of finale that it also should of done.<br/><br/>4. It never explained why Harry survived Voldemort's killing curse. Dumbledore wanders on and tells the audience the one thing that they already bloody knew (which was that harry was a horcrux) failing to explain anything else.<br/><br/>5. It differed far to much from the book which was amazing. I can't understand the logic of taking something amazing and changing it so that its not.<br/><br/>6. The snake lasted longer than Bellatrix Lestrange in a fight. Plus Bellatrix blew up for some reason. Went for comedy rather than epicness.<br/><br/>7. The final conversation between Harry and Voldemort was cut out. Plus Voldemort died without anyone watching and by somehow evaporating.<br/><br/>8. Where was Grawp and Hagrid in the battle. In fact where was everyone. The battle scenes were surprisingly short.<br/><br/>1) Scenes were awkward and dragged out 2) Shell cottage was on a cliff on a beachnot just on straight up sand 3)Bill's face was hardly maimed 4) If you hadn't read the book you'd have no idea how Hermione became Bellatrix or for what cause 5) Nothing is explained""<br/><br/>Everyone else said it for me. I hate Yates for ruining Harry Potter, but at least we have the books."
"fjhuerta-2","6","13","20","17 July 2011"," Such an epic disappointment.
","It actually took me years to watch the first 3 Harry Potter movies, which I considered to be aimed straight at kids. Once I did, I really found myself enjoying them (especially Prisoner of Azkaban, IMHO the best of the series), so I decided to get the books.<br/><br/>I've read them twice since them, and found them entertaining - and I thought the first three movies were very faithful to them, given the time constraints.<br/><br/>It all seemed to change with Order of The Phoenix, though. While the earlier movies felt like a story being told, OOP was more like a bunch of disjointed scenes that the viewer had to assemble into a plot. I thought The Half Blood Prince was the worst - from talking with friends, it was obvious there was so much stuff thrown out from the books some things didn't make any sense at all (as if, who cared who The Half Blood Prince was - the movie never made it obvious).<br/><br/>Enter the epic finale. Once I finished reading the last HP book, I was pretty surprised J.K. Rowling actually made simply the best ending I could ever think of, and wondered how it'd look on the big screen. One word: terrible. Director David Yates should have been fired a long time ago (after Half Blood Prince) - and the Deathly Hallows suffers under his helm. It's completely disjointed - even though he had two movies to tell the story, the MAJOR plot points are missing: the real Albus Dumbledore life story, Kreacher's conversion, Snape's story, Harry's decision to seek the Horcruxes instead of the Hallows, the real way Harry defeated Voldemort, the sacrifices some of the characters went through (and the deaths of some major ones) - it's all gone or severely cut, and it was replaced by tons of CGI and lame one-liners.<br/><br/>I suppose WB thought they'd rather go for epic fights, instead of telling the entire story as it was meant to be told, fearing people would not understand it. Sad.<br/><br/>I have to wonder whether people who didn't read the books understand where the mirror came from, why Dumbledore's brother was still angry at him, why Neville killed Nagini when only Ron and Hermione knew they had to, and why Dumbledore used Harry the way he did. I guess not."

Relief first because, thank goodness, the hype is over. They're done. The books and the movies are officially finished and we can obsess over something else (Hunger Games? Breaking Dawn 1 & 2? I digress.) However, I was disappointed with this movie for the same reasons I was disappointed with other installments - it lacked grit and was often poorly acted. Where it should have been dark and serious, it was polished and cutesy. I liked Part 1 a lot better, not because it was very close to the book, but because it seemed to follow the same pace and mood as the book without leaving out too many important elements. Part 2 rushed along plot wise without even leaving you time to digest what had just happened, yet it dragged miserably when it came to dialogue and actual acting. I was expecting great performances from these kids and it seemed as if they were either desperately running from one predicament to the next or just standing around. Overall, I think it was an issue with the director not setting the tone very well. The book delved swiftly and deeply into a dark and dramatic plot, and ended up concluding well. The movie shifted awkwardly from drama to cutesy kid-friendly crap."
"nilanna999","6","16","26","17 July 2011"," Explain, movie!! EXPLAIN!!!
","Everything that could have been said about this movie has probably been said.<br/><br/>WHAT I LIKED: -I feel like I was the only one who really appreciated the use of humor in the movie, it was perfect. I loved the jokes and their timing. While this wasn't close to a comedy, it kept the charming humor of the previous Harry Potter movies and I appreciated that the movie didn't take itself TOO seriously.<br/><br/>-Showing Hermione destroying the Horcrux. This was a scene I really hoped they'd show. In the book it was a brief mention. In the movie, they show the full scene. I also liked that, if they couldn't have Ron's comment defending the house elves as the reason Hermione kissed him, this was the next best reason.<br/><br/>-Neville and Luna had larger roles in this movie. I was particularly pleased with Luna's larger role and that she had the guts to put Harry in his place.<br/><br/>-The CGI was pretty good.<br/><br/>-The acting is VERY good.<br/><br/>-They change JK Rowling's plan in one minor way- by putting Neville and Luna together. TOO CUTE!! And just perfect!! -The original HP theme from the first movie at the end. It made me very emotional. I loved that they used John William's piece instead of making a new one. How sweet.<br/><br/>WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE -The timing was all wrong. The scene in which Mrs. Weasley kills Bellatrix Lestrange is just bizarrely placed, almost like they would have cut that scene if her one-liner hadn't become so famous.<br/><br/>-Since when do people explode when they die? -Harry kills Voldemort without using his famous spell... it's just a random burst of red light from his wand. Not only that, Voldemort bursts into ashes. Random. An there's no dialog between them, just fighting. There's no one to see Harry finish him. A terrible way to change a great scene from the book.<br/><br/>-There was NO explanation for ANYTHING!! I mean it, they set up Gridelwald's story... then never do anything with it. They never mention the third of the Deathly Hallows- the cloak. They never explain why Harry knows that Lupin has a son. They don't explain Dumbledore's back story, and so hinting to it is just frustrating. They never explain what happens to Harry's wand. They even don't explain why Harry isn't killed for real when Voldemort kills him. All in all, as a reader of the book, I understood it all but anyone who hadn't read it would be pretty lost.<br/><br/>-Snape's flashbacks. They were okay but I hated the scenes of him crying over Lily's body in Godric's Hollow. EW!! It was creepy, never mentioned in the book, and almost seemed stalkerish. It didn't make me want to like Snape, it made me cringe!! Not only that, they never really explain that Snape was never Voldemort's after Lily's death.<br/><br/>-Young Lily's eyes are very much BROWN in the flashbacks. They couldn't have put in some colored contacts? -No one looked 19 years older in the future scene. They looked weird. The prosthetic team failed miserably.<br/><br/>-The future scene didn't show the kids much. Actually there was no dialog except between Harry and Albus. They couldn't have made the movie 5 minutes longer? All in all, they really should have explained more like in the last movie. It felt rushed. And confusing. Not the worst of the Potter movies (Goblet of Fire was worst) but not the best (Chamber of Secrets was best). So I gave it a 6. Pretty good. But not great."

","SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>I can't believe the way they ended the movie, and when the epilogue came i got up from my seat and walked out early. I hated the epilogue in the book, so I decided not to relive the horror. WHY DID THEY NOT SHOW HARRY FIXING HIS OLD WAND??? They just forgot that he needs a real wand and the one he has that works he breaks in half(elder wand). Well, the movie was so far off from the book... i left angry... angry is not the feeling I should have felt; i am part of the Harry Potter generation and i feel cheated. I know that many people love the movie (most of the people in the theater) and maybe if i see it once more i will enjoy it more. I really hope that they have an alternate ending in the DVD or something to semi redeem it. Why did they add more action and take out little things that really made a huge difference to me when i read the book? This ISN'T supposed to be an action movie, but they sure seem to think it should be..."
"MovieGeekBlog","8","42","86","9 July 2011"," An emotional roller-coaster and the perfect end to constantly better series
","For many fans (and let me get this out now: I am one of them), this is  much more than just another film in the franchise: it's the it's the  end of an era, or simply the end of a journey which lasted for over 10  years (14 if you count the first book, back in 1997). There are no  precedents like this in movie history... There's a certain poignancy  that comes with it, because, as we all know, this is the last one EVER.  There will not be any other Harry Potter, no matter what. The film  clearly knows all that and consciously plays to it, tapping into our  deepest-self, reminding us about this journey we've taken and how we've  grown up with it.   The previously-unknown David Yates has slowly been able to find his own  voice with the latest 4 of the 8 instalments, by combining the sense of  magic the first 2 films had, the darker tone introduced to us by Afonso  Cuaron (with the third episode) but also that more grown-up approach to  the story, which has been brewing and growing with each chapter (and  book of course), but he also had the courage to actually hack to pieces  the overly-written source and actually make a better film (clearly  after book 3, no editor would dare to tell JK Rowling to cut anything  out). In this last ""Deathly Hallow"", he was able to basically stretch  the final battle over the course of the whole film, making it seem  greater and more epic than it's ever been in the book (In the end, box  office aside, it really did pay off to split the movie in two parts).  Considering the incredible amount of expectations which a film like  this can carry and, consequently, the almost impossible task of  bringing everything to a close, HP 7.2 does a really good job! Yes, of  course there will be some disappointed people, but I think the  disappointment will come from the fact that secretly each of us would  like this story to go on forever and, no matter what, you can never  please everyone. Considering what a massive commercial machine Warner  Bros is we must be so thankful for the way the franchise has been  handled. Producer David Heyman is obviously a man of heart, who cares  for his fans and set out to make the best films he could ever make,  playing on the strengths of its (let's be honest) not-so-perfect source  and in the end making it an even better product. In the end this film  must be judged with that same heart and not so much with the brain,  taking in consideration the series as well as this ending.  And you know what? My heart can't stop saying ""I just loved the  journey, thank you so much for it"
"mikepatterson77","Null","20","37","15 July 2011"," An Atrocity
","An atrocity was committed tonight. One of the highest order. Worse than the horror that was 6th movie. Dare I say worse even then the terror that Voldemort inspired? I do. It was absolutely dreadful. And how J.K. Rowling approved of this ending to her brilliant series, I will never know.<br/><br/>I kept a tally of the mistakes they made tonight. By my count, there were 95 of them. NINETY-FIVE! That is absolutely ridiculous. Now before I begin the list I must make note of two points. The first is that some mistakes were so atrocious that I multiply counted those for these are the ones that absolutely should not have been avoided. These are the ones that represent the spirit of the series and us, the fans. And thus by destroying them, the film has destroyed a part of us as well. The second point is that there were many minor mistakes as well. But these need not be counted for they are not the ones that matter.<br/><br/>Now I understand that there is a need to go for theatricality. But they could have done so and followed the books. Look at adaptations of LotR and Stephen King. Those follow the original works amazingly. And those books aren't nearly as popular as Harry Potter has become. Harry Potter is not only popular, but also a gateway. It is the start of a path for many to begin reading. And as such it deserves the utmost care and respect.<br/><br/>Do you know what happens when someone sees a horrible movie based off a book they haven't read? They almost always do not want to read the book. That saddens me greatly. The movies don't have to be as good the books. I'd never expect that. But they could try a hell of a lot harder. And by not trying they're effectively killing off a large portion of passionate readers, would be writers, and amazing creativity.<br/><br/>Worse than that though is the number of us who have essentially dedicated our lives to the series. And many of us have put so much stock in the series, that it is a huge slap in the face. No. Worse than that. It's like they've destroyed a part of our soul.<br/><br/>For myself at least, I identified so much so with Harry that when I first started the series, I longed for nothing more than to go to Hogwarts. To belong somewhere. To no longer be mistreated and ignored by friends and family. (For those of them that read this, yes, I was sorely mistaken about this then. But I never knew it at the time) And then strangely enough, I got my acceptance letter. I got into a college where I was accepted readily by my peers regardless of my beliefs. At college I found my Hogwarts, my Gryffindor, my Ron, my Hermione, my Neville, my Luna. And while at college, I lost my grandmother. She is my Dumbledore, even now. She guides me at every step.<br/><br/>Perhaps I am outrageous in my claims to many. In fact I hope that is the case because that would mean that only a few share my sad experience. Alas, I do not believe this to be the case. I think that many people connect with the books on as deep a level as I did even if perhaps they did not know why. It is to those deeper connections that I write to now. But even so, I write this for myself because my soul cannot sit idly by as a crime such as this is committed against it.<br/><br/>For the full review go here: https://www.facebook.com/note.php?note_id=10150225265191370 If you've made it this far, I commend you and thank you for reading this.

"Hockeyo92","Null","29","57","13 July 2011"," Good, but lacking the gravitas required to be Great.
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II was always going to be big and epic and pompous, all of which it delivers. It was also going to be the movie that ends the Harry Potter series, which is something it struggles with a bit more. <br/><br/>Beginning with a brief flashback of part 1's final shot, the movie picks of exactly were the last ended. It does so though, without ever feeling forced or abrupt, rather letting the first five or ten minutes be conversations (Griphook and Ollivander respectively) before turning the heat on. After that, the movie attacks you with such ferocity you barely breathe until the ending scene. <br/><br/>However, the action is always controlled. This could easily have been destroyed by trying to make it into a classic war movie, but though Yates dips in with plenty of battle scenes, he never goes the full Michael Bay. All in all, you end up feeling they might have shown more, letting a few key deaths happen off screen, but for the all-important PG-rating. <br/><br/>As for following the book, from the start of it keeps the distance needed to make it film able whilst still remaining true to the material. As we near the end of the battle it differs even more, yet still letting the events happen more or less like in the novel, and though it differs most in the climactic showdown, fans of the novel will be delighted to know the epilogue is translated nearly word by word. <br/><br/>The performances are stellar; Maggie Smith shines, as does Matthew Lewis and Radcliff does his best to carry the movie, a feat in which he mostly succeeds. For me though, the standout actors are, of course, Alan Rickman, giving his Snape a whole new dimension, but also, possibly surprising; Cieran Hinds as Aberforth Dumbledore. It isn't a big role, but he portrays it with such charisma and gravitas (especially one fantastic shot) I ended up wondering if he wouldn't have made a better Albus than Gambon. Alas, to late for that now. <br/><br/>Despite this I have only given it a 6. Why? Because it lacks the soul and warmth it should have had. Sure there are scenes (the forest springs to mind at once) that puts pressure on your tear canals, but it isn't enough, there is not a strong enough feeling of conclusion, it just doesn't quite deliver. In the end, it never manages to top the ending from Philosophers Stone. <br/><br/>As a conclusion, it is the same old criticism that has plagued the movie-series – the books were better. And though it is magnificently grand and spectacular, it sadly never really becomes the ""Return of the King"" it ought to have been."

"mcgriff1290","Null","26","52","11 July 2011"," Send the series off in style
","When something great comes to a end you can't help, but feel a certain level of sadness. The new millennium has given birth to two of the greatest franchise ( Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings) that cinema has seen since the original Star Wars.Its very rare to witness not only one film masterpiece, but two is just extraordinary. The Harry Potter films contain the best story telling, action, human connection to the audience and bring out the most emotion of the characters I have ever seen in a franchise. Its amazing to see the transition that the Harry Potter films have taken from innocence kid friendly movies, to when our generation matured, so did the films. They became more dark and more developed with intensity of story and character building. This film is fulfilling, sad and satisfying. The factor that has kept these movies looking amazing is the cinematography and effect that have stayed constant through the film through the years. The film has those two elements and more working for it which makes it the best film in the Potter franchise. This franchise has kept it's flame burning strong for 10 years and director David Yates sends this Wizard series away in the best fashion it could achieve. This movie has to be the best out of the 8 films and combined everything that someone would be looking for in a Harry Potter film and also displays everything that fans of the series have been looking for and that the amount of action.I thought that Transformers Dark of the Moon delivered the most action of the summer and I was wrong. Harry Potter gives the audience the most action that a film can contain combined with the highest level of emotion I have ever seen.Deathly Hollows Part 2 contains the most heart, pure emotion and extreme action I have ever seen in cinema since the original Star Wars. The pacing of this film does not let the audience catch their breath when witnessing this masterpiece. Their is so much to see and so much to take in that if you blink you will miss out something great. This movie delivers everything that someone from critics and fans would be looking for in a close out film. All credit in my opinion goes to the director, David Yates, for bringing this kid friendly movie up to speed with the maturity level that the books brought over the course of their time. Yates and all director of the franchise did the best job transforming the JK Rowling book series into box office hits that has been accepted warmly by fans and critic. But by far David Yates has done the best job of pulling emotions out of his cast, making them relateable to the audience and creating a certain tone for the viewer to witness and grasps the gravity that is going on in the closing journey of Harry Potter. He has done the best job of well rounding his movies that they are not only entertaining, but also makes the audience yearn for more Harry Potter films. I also give a lot of credit to the main cast members from Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Ralph Fiennes. They all have done a great job of shaping the memories of the famous novel character into visual ones that have made an imprint into the viewers mind and they have done the best jobs that young to old actors can do with this sort of property. They are all equally nice to watch and bring so much passion to the film that the audience cant help, but notice dedication to the movies.It's not only the main characters that show the greatest acting and hear, but also the secondary actors bring a lot to the film and all pleasant to watching. This movie franchise is made it's mark in the world of cinema as one of the greatest series that have ever been viewed and this film wraps the franchise up in the best way possible. This is possibly the best film of the year and of the past 10 years. All good things do come to a end sooner or later and it has been a heck of a journey, and I?M)m glad I was able to experience it."

","I don't think it matters whether you are a fan of the books or not to be able to come to the conclusion that this is the worst Harry Potter film of all and one of the most over-rated films ever! I have not read all of the books which means that I have a fairly unbiased view when watching the films-I'm not expecting the film to follow the books exactly.<br/><br/>This film was awful for several reasons: 1)Lack of dialogue- what's the point in paying the actors millions of pounds for them to say virtually nothing throughout...apart from Harry and frankly I would rather he remained quite throughout because his voice and wimpy demeanour irritate me! 2)Poor action scenes- for example an exchange between Harry and Voldermort- was pathetic. It wasn't an intense duel; it was poorly acted.<br/><br/>3)Wooden acting- for example the romance between Ron and Hermione- you could tell how uncomfortable they felt together! And the ending is incredibly poor- it was too abrupt and didn't connect smoothly to the rest of the film- a rush job I think.<br/><br/>I can't believe this film is expected to gross the most money of all the films. And I can't believe I actually PAID to see it...I would have to be paid to see it again that's for sure! Don't waste your money and time (2hours40mins)on this film even if, like me, you're going to see it just because it's the last ever films- it's the worst of the lot!"

"alexgrant-44","Null","25","50","13 July 2011"," An Positive end to a Memorable Franchise
","It has been a long time coming, but the Harry Potter series has come to an end, and on a positive note to boot. I was lucky enough to catch it at a midnight screening, where the atmosphere and anticipation was unbelievably high, as you would expect! Having read all seven books (albeit some time ago) and regardless of me knowing what should be happening while I watched the movie, there were many unexpected moments to savor. Aside from a couple of minor nuances, I left the cinema very pleased that the franchise was given such a wonderful end.<br/><br/>This movie is just about everything a fan of the series could want. A plot that manages to incorporate all major events from the book along with an ever-present haunting tone throughout. Virtually every major and minor character from the novel gets some form of appearance as well. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldermort's (Ralph Fiennes) battle was a little short for my liking, however its intensity made up for a lack of length. In terms of rounding off an adventure, this movie did a solid job.<br/><br/>The movie's intro is short and sweet, throwing you directly into the end of where the first left you, which is great. Pacing is, for the most part, cleverly done. The movie's action sequences are balanced nicely with some more reflective moments. This is where Snape (Alan Rickman) shines. His screen time was actually much less than what I was anticipating, but he makes excellent use of what time he has. You can't help but feel some form of empathy for Rickman's character as his story unfolds. It almost steals the show.<br/><br/>Tone and lighting were done to perfection. We've come a long way from the cheery and very colorful opening films to the gritty and dark ones in the past few years. The darkness continues increasing to an exciting crescendo in this movie. There is again a ridiculously limited color palette to the scenes, but it's appropriate. They've become evident since the third film, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Some don't and won't like it, but it all feels worthwhile now for the climax in this final chapter.<br/><br/>The film is by far not perfect though. The movie felt a tad broken up and rushed in several parts, particularly in some battle scenes towards the conclusion of the film. Sometimes we would be thrown from one place to the next unnecessarily. Some will like the chaotic pacing in these parts, but for me it gave an impression of easiness to the lead trio's task of destroying horcruxes (which the books show it was anything but). It's almost as if they were simple side tasks before the final confrontation, instead of crucial and necessary steps they should have been.<br/><br/>The biggest criticism of the film must lie in its ignorance of any character that happens to not be named Harry Potter. Because of this, many relationships between other characters don't feel developed enough. Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are constantly distanced from Harry. When you compare the book to the film you almost feel that anything outside of Harry was tacked onto the story line here. The concept of 'good' vs. 'evil' seems to be lost and substituted with 'Harry' vs. 'Voldermort.' People would argue that that's how it should be, but that doesn't do justice to the other characters present. There was nothing more painful though than seeing some people swept aside like they never existed.<br/><br/>But, for almost everyone, the intense build-up to the final encounter between Voldermort and Harry will make up for that. Ralph Fiennes as Voldermort is as menacing as ever playing the pale-skinned antagonist. Notable appearances that deserve a mention include Helena Bonham Carter (as Bellatrix Lestrange) and John Hurt (as Ollivander) with amusing and pensive roles respectively.<br/><br/>The attention to visual details is also amazing. Hogwarts, where majority of the film's setting takes place, changes dramatically as the film goes on. You almost feel trapped within the school with the other characters as the darkness draws nearer. The school, ironically, never felt so alive during this movie. Sound and music were as sharp as any of the previous movies, and contributed to this wonderful mood.<br/><br/>In the end, the film rounds off well. Although I despised it in the book, the final scene, and in particular the final shot of the film, brought a smile to my face. A superb ending to a franchise that's been magical in more ways than one.<br/><br/>7.5/10"
"on-the-road-so-far","7","12","21","16 July 2011"," Just enjoy the MOVIE!
","After three days I'm still a little torn when thinking of the end of the Harry Potter movies.<br/><br/>On one hand, I really liked the movie. They managed to bring the whole battle of Hogwarts on screen. But precisely because the last movie consists almost ONLY of the last battle at Hogwarts, I get the feeling that something is missing.<br/><br/>Currently, I'm trying to come to terms with the fact that there will be no more Potter movies and therefore no chance to ever see the parts they left out on screen. <br/><br/>One thing that will bother me forever - and almost ruined one of the greatest moments of the books for me - is the story of Teddy Lupin. In 7.1. Tonks starts to mention something that should hint at her pregnancy, but she doesn't really say anything about it and those people who haven't read the books will probably forget about that hint quickly. In 7.2. we never get told about Teddy's birth. And then, completely out of the blue, in the scene where Harry walks to his death (the most emotional scene of the books - I cried so hard during reading that!), Remus suddenly says something like ""My son will one day understand what I died for"". Everyone in the cinema was like WTF?! We never before - or AFTER in the epilogue - heard of Teddy. Why did they have to mention him in that scene then? Destroyed the feeling of that scene almost completely, because everyone in the cinema was just really confused and whispering about it.<br/><br/>They could have added the part in Shell Cottage where Remus comes in and tells everyone that Tonks gave birth to a boy. That way Remus' words in the forest wouldn't have been so out of place and it would have given the movie a peaceful scene apart from the whole battle.<br/><br/>One thing they really did brilliantly was the Prince's Tale (apart from the fact that they filmed it in a boathouse rather than the Shrieking Shack - why do they have chance something like this? I don't get it! I mean the Shrieking Shack has a deep meaning for the protagonists and is already a familiar place for the audience!). But otherwise that scene was great! Alan Rickman was brilliant in that scene! <br/><br/>It's disappointing however that Dumbledore's tale was never fully brought on screen. It was so important in the books and so very effective in showing that Dumbledore was also only human and had a dark past. In the movie Harry simply says that he trusts Dumbledore, but in the book he gets doubts about the man and rightly so. It bothers me even more because they once again gave so many hints about his past, but nothing of importance was filmed and it leaves us hanging with the feeling that his story is not being told.<br/><br/>That's something I feel in every Potter movie since the third movie. There are so many hints and half-told stories, but we never get the whole picture of it (except if you have read the books). I know that it is impossible to get EVERYTHING on screen that happens in the books, but I really feel like there could have been MORE. We never even hear of Voldemorts past and his parentage.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are a lot of little details that bother me, even though it doesn't really take away the fun in watching the movies. E.g. Harry's eye colour! In the books they are green. Just like his mother's. They even mention it in the movies that they have the same eyes. But the actors have different eye colours! Couldn't they have used contacts?? Also that Dumbledore doesn't wear his half moon glasses or that Tonks doesn't change her hair colour (except in the fifth movie) and many more little details that would have added to the simple magic of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>It also bugs me that we never see Wormtail die. I loved that part in the books where he strangles himself with his silver hand, but we never see what happens to him in the movies.<br/><br/>It's also a pity that Harry and Voldemort have their last showdown alone. The part where Voldemort realised that he can't hurt anyone in the castle anymore, because Harry sacrificed himself for them, was very powerful in the books.<br/><br/>What I loved and I'm really grateful for, is the fact that Neville still got to behead Nagini. I was already scared when he got knocked out that they would change that part and let someone else do the job, but then out of nowhere Neville appeared and killed Nagini - great moment in the movie!! I love the music and love all the actors - Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Dan Radcliffe and Tom Felton were especially brilliant here! I adore some parts of the movie, some had me left wanting more. But that was to be expected.<br/><br/>I think it's a real pity that there wasn't someone here who loves the books so much to consider all the little details and the whole background story, like Peter Jackson did with The Lord of the Rings. That love for details and that devotion for the story is really missing in the Harry Potter movies. The style of each movie is different. A lot of the story is missing. Details are being left out which are important - especially for real fans of the books. The Harry Potter series really would have deserved to be taken on by someone like Peter Jackson! <br/><br/>All in all, I think the movies as stand-alone are great! But as a real fan of the books you shouldn't compare it or you'll be disappointed."
"saarvardi","9","16","30","11 July 2011"," They finally got it right!
","While never an avid Harry Potter fan, I have watched all eight Harry Potter films on the big screen over the past decade. It's been a long, bumpy ride, with some films stronger than others - mainly the first few (in my own honest opinion). After a while, however, it all felt like the biggest cinematic tease ever. I mean, we've been told about Voldermort ever since the beginning, and we've known all along that the saga will end with this big, epic fight between good and evil... err, I mean Harry vs. Voldermort. However, that never came (except for a few teases here and there), and when the producers decided to postpone the inedible and split the last film into two, it became ever so frustrating.<br/><br/>Thanks god, then, that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 came along to right all the wrongs the previous films have made and to give us the proper closure we've all been waiting for. Finally, after all this time, we get to see the main protagonist for more than a glance. We get resolutions to plot lines that began in parts 6 & 7, Hogwarts makes an awesome comeback for one, final stand between forces between both sides, and there are even some twists and turns that echo all the way back to parts 1 & 2.<br/><br/>So yes, THIS is the Harry Potter we've all been waiting for all along: edgy, dark, more mature and complex than ever before, with solid performances from all involved (especially Ralph Fiennes, who gets some space to play with his character, and that guy that plays Neville Longbottom, who grew up to become quite a man from that mousy little kid he once was). But more so - and unlike any of the other films in the series – HP7b stands as an independent piece (alongside its 2010 counterpart), and doesn't leave the viewer unsatisfied. Here, we get a proper ending, we know this is the Harry Potter to end all 800 or so films that came before, and it seems that the producers knew this and gave it all they could. I only wish they've done this more often during the previous films, instead of saving the best for last.<br/><br/>All in all, this is THE best Harry Potter I've seen from all the eight, and a truly exciting roller coaster of a film, filled with top notch storytelling alongside impressive special effects (even the 3D felt appropriate and relevant). I gave it a very solid 9 out of 10."

The film in general wasn't bad at all... but there were certain things that made my disappointment inevitable.<br/><br/>However, let's start with the good stuff: - The visual & sound effects: I think that the visual effects (including the effects at the battle, the dragon, etc.) and the background music worked very well and gave the film a great touch. - Snape's tale: One of the rare parts of the film I really really liked. Sure, they left some things out (which was to be expected) but the overall scene and especially the performance by Alan Rickman was exceptional and touching. - Gringotts: A nicely done scene (speaking in general) and a great performance by Helena B. Carter. The flight with the dragon was short but nicely done and accompanied by some fine music. However I also have some complaints about it as well. - The scenery: I especially liked Gringotts and King's cross. - The epilogue: I think it was quite acceptable and the actors were well artificially aged. (Except for Emma but hey... how can you make miss beauty herself older?:D)<br/><br/>The disappointments (uh, where to start?) - It is more than obvious that Yates isn't really good when it comes to action scenes. (even if he is still my favorite hp director -or... was?) For starters at Gringotts, everything is too passive (they are detected but still get to the vault unharmed and climb on a dragon's back without getting hit by a curse.) That makes me question whether Gringotts is really that impossible to break in&out according to Yates? - Since when does pollyjuice potion not change your voice into the voice of the person you changed into?? If that was true, how could have B. Crouch Jr. pretended he was Moody for a whole year? Explain that producers/director! - They left out the entire Dumbledore's story? OK it may have been a 'sacrifice' but hey... I can't accept that. - Reemus&Tonks have a son? Well I wouldn't have known that for sure if I hadn't read the book. A stupid mistake... they shouldn't have brought it up if they weren't planning any explanation, then :/ - The death of Fred and the arrival of Percy... I got a feeling: 'it happened, let's go on with our lives.' - Voldemort's death... Not epic at all!! Probably the biggest disappointment. The end of the film should have been a blast not a by-the-way-scene. Not to mention his 'blasting into confetti' (as well as Bellatrix & Nagini) which was so not like the book. - NOT TO MENTION the scene after Voldemort's death. Harry comes into the great hall with a cup of tea, people talking like they are in a bar, no one notices anything, no joy, no emotion... all you hear is Slughorn's story how he once lost his wand and see Filch sweeping the ruins. - Which reminds me! The wannabe 'funny scenes' for example Filch, Ron saying: 'harry talks in his sleep...' (sooo not like in the book), Neville shouting: 'yeah, you and whose army?' (that phrase is soooo old! -.-) etc... may be an addition to the film but really didn't fit in. Everyone was in life threatening situation... why would they say something like that? It broke the tension and I didn't like that. - Harry snapping the Elder wand and not mending his own... Really? Is that the solution to make a scene that would last 2 minutes only 30seconds long? <br/><br/>Overall... I think the film wasn't epic enough. As a Harry Potter fan I expected this film to be an emotional blast... a film that would make your jaws fall to the floor and not sleep for two days. I expected a 'boom' at the end, I would have accepted a cheesy applause accompanied by a strong song when Harry victoriously returns after defeating Voldemort for starters! But nothing... it left me cold and disappointed. It was unable to capture the 'epicness' of the book on so many levels(except for Snape's tale). In my opinion, the franchise should have ended with a bigger emotional blast so that people would never forget it. Of course I will never forget it... but I will remember the books rather than the films."

","A decade, a generation and we can finally say goodbye to Harry Potter. It's an epic finale to a very long journey that seemed will never end. The movie begins with the last final minutes of Part I where Voldemort open's Dumbledore's grave to steal his wand which I think was a good opening. The story goes very fast from there on as there's much to be told and rhythm keeps the audience on their toes, it's a roller coaster.<br/><br/>David Yates has become better and better by each movie and especially in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 he shows that despite the critiques' he's able to control the pace and give us an insight into the characters beautifully. In the final movie I think he wasn't able to control everything as successfully which could be due to the fact that there was a lot to cover. Unfortunately this could be seen in the edit too and some of the cuts seemed a bit rushed and there was continuity issues, in fact the whole movie looked rushed. This was especially visible in the King's Cross sequence with the lack of linking shots between the cuts although not damaging the storyline but creating jumps between the cuts. Overall everything works and it's a pleasing experience, however, I think the book's fans will make a better connection to this film as many of the flashbacks in the movie are very short, vague and could be even a bit confusing. The Snape's back story for example which is a very critical piece of information could have been much better explained and visualised.<br/><br/>Acting is very good as expected from a line of prestigious British actors, and Daniel Radcliffe has a better performance as well and he is less dry when he speaks which I think it's his downside as his facial expressions particularly in the last movie are brilliant. I found Voldemort's character to be more creepy and sad than scary! His portrayal in the book is much stronger but movies don't and don't really have to follow the books line by line. The actor chosen as Harry's son in the epilogue is sadly very poor and I've found the entire epilogue's sequence not to be that great actually and somehow unnecessary if it was to be shown like this, but it's always interesting to see a glimpse of the future I suppose.<br/><br/>Soundtrack composed by Alexandre Desplat which carries on from Part I with a nicely frames shots of Eduardo Serra are nicely blended together and you can hardly notice the soundtrack on its own, a complement to how well it's been integrated.<br/><br/>The majority of the Visual Effects, if not all, are provided by the London Houses such Double Negative, Cinesite, MPC and Framestore where I was a part of their team. Overall outstanding work and definitely worthy of an Oscar nomination. I wouldn't say it's the best VFX work I've seen in my life but they are all serving the story extremely well with nothing extra just as it should be. I wasn't surprised but a bit disappointed that in the premiere the producers and director thanked everyone except the visual effects artist who actually made this happen. VFX's important is yet to be recognised.<br/><br/>It's not easy to say good-bye but it is the time. Harry Potter and the deathly Hollows Part II is an entertaining movie that tries to say a lot in little time. Despite the minor points I've mentioned I don't think anyone will leave the theatre unsatisfied and the movie even deserves a second viewing."

","By the end of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 everyone was ready for one thing, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2!!! And on July 15, 2011 at 12: 05 I got the privilege of experiencing the end of my favorite series. I was with other die hards so it was a great experience. <br/><br/>I remember watching the first Harry Potter movie when I was 5 with my mom in the theater. I was immediately hooked and looking back I didn't realize how much this series would shape my life. <br/><br/>The movie is a non stop action movie from beginning to end. By the time Harry kills Voldemort and he's sending his own son to Hogwarts 19 years later it was a very emotional film. Alan Rickman gives a truly heartbreaking performance as a tragic Snape. The film is a whole new level of epic. The CGI in the film might be the best all year. If this film does not win an Oscar for Set Design and SFX then something is seriously wrong. The score is also incredible.<br/><br/>On a whole this film will definitely be on the top of my Best Film's of 2011 list. It's easily the best HP film.<br/><br/>I loved this film and I will always love the series. I will cherish the memories thanks to the series. Thank you Harry for the best 10 years ever. And thank you for my childhood."
"user-433-255202","2","6","9","26 July 2012"," Why Yates Why!!!!!
","I am a large fan of the harry potter books and have enjoyed watching at least the early Harry Potter movies. I must say however this is a horribly disappointing movie seemingly made by a production team who have no intuition at all.<br/><br/>When adapting a book into a movie there are two things which distinguish the amazing movie from the disappointing ones: 1- The little things, the small details which the fans really want to see portrayed, even in the background.<br/><br/>2- The secondary characters are extremely important to the viewers.<br/><br/>My main issue with this movie is that it lacks both of these in a massive way, leaving out the little thins and focusing way too much on harry.<br/><br/>It is a terrible adaptation, removing the magic from the whole movie, making it a cheesy battle movie which MAKES NO SENSE ACCORDING THE THE WORLD WHICH WE KNOW AS POTTER!! Issues of stupidity in the movie- - Harry appirates to diagon alley, not under the invisibility cloak then waits around for a chat in the lane-way. Seriously this is just a ridiculous error when everyone is looking for him.<br/><br/><ul><li>WHY IS THE BRIDGE BLOWN UP OMG!!! In all seriousness this is so stupid. I was getting used to the fact that Yates decided the death-eaters can all now fly, so why blow up a bridge. It is just stupid!!! They can fly over and THEY HAVE MAGIC WANDS or go across another bridge.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>All of the snatchers! They don't even hit Neville as he runs, and he somehow manages to hit it behind him as he runs, (wat?) They instead of using their magic abilities they all just fall into the abyss! Another stupid error - Why did harry break the elder wand? No further comment - Why would the people hiding out in the room of requirement be happy enough to just go down to the great hall when Snape summons them.</li></ul><br/><br/>Issues of disappointment in the movie- -NO FRED DEATH, NO TONKS DEATH, NO LUPIN DEATH.<br/><br/>-Mrs Weasley vs. Bellatrix. The most fearful thing about Bellatrix is her taunting words yet in this pivotal scene we don't see any build up of taunting about Ginny and Fred - Why was Voldemort not destroyed in the hall in front of everyone. It was important that Voldemorts rage at Harry should have been shown as harry believes he will win the fight. We needed to see Mcgonagall, Kingsley and Slughorn fighting Voldemort to show his strength and show harry isn't the only one standing up to Voldemort. <br/><br/>Issues of annoyance in the movie- -SO MUCH OF HARRY AND VOLDEMORT JUST RUNNING AROUND, pointless and boring - Why is there no footage of Mcgonagall, Lupin, Fred, George, Dean, Seamus, Ginny fighting in the actually battle. Seriously they left all the good characters we wanted to see out of the battle.<br/><br/><ul><li>Mrs Weasley why do you know how to make a massive shield. WHY NOT ARTHUR WHO ACTUALLY WORKS AT THE MINISTRY. Another silly idea from David Yates.</li></ul><br/><br/>-Why do Bellatrix and Voldemort burst into little pieces WHY WHY WHY -We really wanted to see the Ravenclaw common room and Amycus Carrow abusing Mcgonagall. That would've been a great scene to see, Harry defending Mcgonagall with the Cruciatus curse. Yates has completely rejected the enormous power of words in conveyed hatred, menace and friendship.<br/><br/>The two massive issues Overall the most disappointing thing is the lack of secondary character involvement in the battle of Hogwarts. Characters which we needed to see actually fighting in the battle included Prof. Sprout, HAGRID Slughorn, All of the Weasleys, Lupin and Tonks. Some characters which it would've been nice to see is the fat lady, sir Cadogan, Nearly Headless Nick, Peeves,fang, Buckbeak, Grawp and the professors portraits.<br/><br/>Essentially Yates had removed the magic from this movie. Wizards not using any named spells and simply shooting light from their wand as if it doesn't even mean anything. The magical creatures all left out with the exception of pointless giants without Grawp even there to attack them.<br/><br/>Overall I give this 2/10 simply because I love the series and ultimately if i continued to speak on this movies failures i would downgrade it to 1/10. So disappointing for such a great story to be abused in this way"
"mobbielim","3","7","11","13 August 2011"," The wand of destiny the death-stick, the awesome-st branch of doom
","David Yates is one of those directors you either hate or love. If you have never read the book, there is a chance you might like/love his work. If you have read the book, there is a very high chance you want to grab hold of him and stuff the vomit-est vomit flavored Bertie Bott's beans in large amount of quantities in a particular orifice that ...well I leave it to your imagination. I have read the book and I hate his work, his sloppy story lines, his directing of the actors/actresses are hideously horrendous. If ever you want to make a comparison, watch Goblet of Fire and there is a distinct difference in the way the acting is done. This review is about HP7B- HP7B is better than the order of phoenix and very much better than the HBP. I like how he sped the entire 1st part up and yet made the storyline rather polished...then it slowed to crap. Like the HBP, if you have read the book & might have imagined Dumbledore's death much better than what Mr Yates had put out on screen; you know he clearly lacks imagination in delivering real emotion to cinema-goers. Such is the case when Harry finds out he is porky pig walking to a large oven filled with green green light that will bake him to crisp. I was surprised Daniel Radcliff acted pretty well at the end, the mud streaked face and perpetual soot covered all over look made him look very much like a potential murder victim. I also liked certain parts I thought clever like the shield around Hogwarts, very Final Fantasy like; oh an the elaboration of Ron n Hermione destroying the cup- thank you very much, I always thought JK rushed through that part rather carelessly. But again, the snog-ging o the snogging, must it be so well...necessary and fake. Then there was the ending, my point about Mr Yate's lack of ability to deliver proper emotion to ticket holders exact. Zap zap and zap zap and then Volde dies, then oh lets just waltz back to school. No yelling whooping cheering elation screams of joy clap hands stadiums filled with ecstasy. Just ... Nothing, the sickest baddest mother of naughty wizards without noses has finally been killed! zip nothing. It seemed like Mr. Yates ran out of budget, time, creativity towards the end and quickly sped through the script for the sake of making tons of muggle gold. Then the worst thing happened- the wand of destiny, the death-stick, the branch of doom, the amazingness fantastic-est bes-test most sought after stick of power! The ONE STICK TO RULE THEM ALL!! The one link to the DEATHLY HALLOWS was snapped like a brittle piece of instant noodle by a teenage boy. He wrangled that thing like an irritating wet fibrous piece of wood and tossed it away. All for the sake of not having to explain too much. Yes! Mr Yates, the reason readers really hate you is, you take short cuts just because of your inept ability to tell good stories in film- you did not want to explain too much how Harry could survive Voldy's zap, you were just too lazy to elaborate on the Deathly Hallows and did not trust us to understand wand lore. The result is, HP7B is very much a confusing movie for muggle readers and to those who have been magically blessed to read the book, it lacks imagination. 8.4 on IMDb! Pffttttt what a load of crock."
"suhar-leonheart","2","7","11","29 July 2011"," It's not Harry Potter but Cool Witch action movie
","The movie is emotionless. And in the climax the movie really lacks of heroic feeling, rejoice & hype. Actually the movie is only 2 hours, still got some free time to extend, maybe 10 more minutes in the scene when Harry Potter died, more time to explain about Master of Death & Deathly Hallows. It's so shameful, the essence & main story of the last series, like in the title ""Deathly Hallows"" has no portion in this movie. That's the climax part that should be has some heroic feeling, ""wow"" feeling and eager but it's just flat in this movie!<br/><br/>I understand that they can't put all stories to the movie because of the time limit, but that's one of the main story beside hunting the hocrux, ooo my :(<br/><br/>Through out the movie, I didn't feel anything, sadness, rejoice.

","(I apologize for any misspellings of character names in advance.) I grew up with Harry and the gang. I spent my evenings waiting at the bookstore until Midnight, eagerly expecting the next book of the series. I wasn't disappointed. I cried at the end of the 7th book; I expected to do the same at the end of the 8th movie.<br/><br/>I walked into the theater with 10 misty-eyed buddies, three boxes of Kleenex, and expectations high (I loved the 7th movie.) I walked out of the theater with 10 confused buddies, three unused boxes of Kleenex, and a feeling of slight disappointment.<br/><br/>What went wrong??? The Good: Gringotts was flawless. Loved everything about it.<br/><br/>Neville, Professor McGonagal, and Mrs. Weasely were awesome in every sense of the word. Their moments of epic earned well-deserving applause and standing ovations from the audience.<br/><br/>Snape's death. I never react to movies, but I gasped and grabbed my friend when he was killed. Only time I got tearful through out the whole film. Perfection.<br/><br/>Battle of Hogwarts. With a few exceptions (you'll read those later) it was well done.<br/><br/>And now....the bad.<br/><br/>Tonks and Lupin. Their whole 'we have a son' thing was really random and shoved in. How the heck did Harry know? He was traipsing around the countryside! Very confusing.<br/><br/>Dumbledore. His back story, his acting...I'm sorry, the guy was terrible. Him and Harry was an awful moment for everyone, regardless if you read the books or not.<br/><br/>Fred's death was way too underplayed. I don't know if they were shooting for the ""oh, he's just one amongst many' thing, but I was disappointed. You couldn't even tell it was Fred! It could've been Percy or Bill for all they showed!<br/><br/>The Snape/Lily Montage. It was cute....for the first 10 minuets. Then I all I could think was ""Can we speed this along, please?"" It was awkward and lengthy. I'm all for showing the soft underbelly of grouchy semi-evil Snape, but suddenly throwing a weeping, puppy dogged eyed Snape who moons after Lily for, like, ever, was a 3000 degree character turn-around and ruined his character for me. Too much, too fast.<br/><br/>There were several other moments of ""Well, that was disappointing"" or ""Whoa, that was amazing!"", but those were the big ones.<br/><br/>The bad moments were equaled out by the good....for the most part. The HP saga ended on a decent note, but it was not the tear-jerking awesomeness that I was expecting."
"mecandes","5","24","50","16 July 2011"," Disappointed. Remember Azkaban?
","I have to say I was really disappointed by the final Harry Potter film. This is the opening weekend, and the reviewers are all raving... and they are all wrong; it's like they saw a different film than I did -- is it because I didn't read the book? I've generally enjoyed the films, but this was far from the best Potter film -- and frankly it leaves me continuing to wonder how this series managed to stay so beloved and highly hyped for so long. Really, this is what it was all building to for all these years?<br/><br/>The kids put on Prisoner of Azkaban this morning; ah, the good 'ol days. That's the film I think of when I think of Harry Potter."
"reylagarto28","4","20","41","22 July 2011"," Harry Potter and a Scripting Shallow Part 2
","I'm taking no reserves by telling this film is awful. By far the worst film I've seen this year, and that wouldn't be if there hadn't been so much hype about it.<br/><br/>Every critic and every website praise this film, however I can't begin to understand how can they praise such a poor production. An irregular, cyclic, inconsistent and plot-hole-filled script, a lousy direction incapable of maintaining an action sequence long enough to have a good time and an edition work to be embarrassed (with a tighter edition you could reduce both parts into a single film). If part 1 was bad, this one kicks the bucket big time!<br/><br/>Acting doesn't improve too much, we still get all the wooden performances we're used to and the same plot line is filled with clichés and things we've seen over and over again. It's to admire the ability of J.K. Rowling to develop intriguing situations and by the same time her incapability to resolve them with wit and style.<br/><br/>The action sequences just pass by, the plot line is pitiful, the final battle doesn't leave a mark and the epilogue is completely unnecessary. <br/><br/>Maybe I'm insane, and maybe everyone will think I'm out of line by giving this film 1 star out of 10, but when you grow up admiring the greatest fantasy and sci-fi sagas ever made (either in the film or book industry) like Star Wars, Lord of the Rings, Dune, Blade Runner and the Neverending Story, you'll know Harry Potter just doesn't have enough to be in the same rank as them."
"olli1","4","20","41","16 July 2011"," Poor Adaptation
","I was looking forward to seeing the finale of the potter series, as the other films have been quite well presented. The latest 3 movies however have cutout vital bits of the story and the finale is just a joke. The film started off quite fast relative to the book, the whole breaking into Gringots scence was poorly adapted from the book. The final chapters of the book where 100 times better than the final parts of the film. When harry looks through Snape's memories it is way to brief, in the book a lot of emotion was shown as Snape saw the downfall to the relationship to himself and Harry potters mother. The battle between harry and Voldemort was truly disappointing as the director changed the engagement into battle between the two (and other main factors that I will not spoil for people reading this review). The positioning of Hagrid's whereabouts in the film pretty much show how poorly adapted the book was. They didn't even put in the line about Neville becoming a professor at the end.<br/><br/>In conclusion I found the film very disappointing, I don't know why cinemas are showing it in 3D as it barely uses any 3d effects. 4*/10* A huge disappointment."

"ryanh-00630","10","2","2","31 August 2019"," It all ends here.
","Regardless of your views on Harry Potter as a whole or whether this film really does this literary phenomenon justice (on balance it does), there can be no doubt that this is a great climax to one of the great cinematic challenges. There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history. But if one wants a true measure of how good this series has been, they should simply ask: what would the world be like if Harry hadn't been helped out of his cupboard?<br/><br/>I know that the answer is: poorer! The first novels that I read were the first two Harry Potter books. And to a child at the age of 6, as I was then, what wasn't there to like about a downtrodden young boy who discovers that he is a wizard and is whisked away to a magic school by a giant man? That is the magic of this series. Long after the special effects have been superseded and there has been a disastrous (American) attempt at remaking the films, it will be the stories that remain with us. We all want to be Harry, Ron or Hermione because we can relate to them. We believe that we can have Harry's courage, Ron's heart or Hermione's fierce loyalty and skill because we have experienced their emotions alongside our own. That is the reason for the success of these novels and films: We could just as easily imagine ourselves as<br/><br/>I think that the leads did absolutely fantastic in this film; and whatever people say about their acting at various stages, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson will always be Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. But the real star turn, as in the novel, comes from Severus Snape. Alan Rickman really steals the show, as he has done throughout the series. We have loved to hate this man for the last decade on screen, but the superb execution of ""The Prince's Tale"" leaves us feeling as devastated as Snape himself is when he learns that Lily Potter is dead. I think we all shed a tear for the incredible sacrifices that he made, as much as Rickman's superlative performance. Maggie Smith is as imperious as ever as Minerva McGonagall, whilst Helena Bonham Carter is sublime as the wildly cunning Bellatrix Lestrange. Ralph Fiennes simply exudes menace whenever he is on screen as our irredeemable villain, Lord Voldemort. He takes on a rather muted role here, strangely, although I do think that the way in which the menace of Voldemort is portrayed in the novels is almost impossible to bring to the big screen. The scene in the Forbidden Forest with the Resurrection Stone is also a brilliant emotional journey. Plus it's always nice to see Gary Oldman back in the role of Sirius for such a short amount of screen time he is wonderful and David Thewlis is great as well as Lupin. Michael Gambon as Dumbledore was great as always and his scene with Harry at King's Cross was fantastic.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent as one might expect, especially when the magical protection is created around Hogwarts, to then be destroyed by Voldemort in fury. Alexandre Desplat's score is also superb and really reflects the subtle moods and nuances of the story. If one good thing came out of the Epilogue, it allowed Desplat to use the brilliant ""Leaving Hogwarts"" theme for the last time! As a film, I think that David Yates has done a great job. This was probably the biggest challenge in film. Almost everyone had an opinion on how it should be done, along with the added pressure from Warner Brother's to make this film palatable for all ages, in order to maximise potential income from their most lucrative franchise. Left to their own devices, this film could easily have been a 15. For those who think that a lot of the humour is missing, then they are probably right. However, it is harder to establish this in a film. The Potter series doesn't really do black humour, so many of the jokes or asides in the novel just wouldn't fit the tone. I think the result would have been worse if the producers had attempted to shoe- horn the humour in.<br/><br/>All in all, it has been a magical journey since I first picked up ""The Philosopher's Stone as a 6 year old. As the credits rolled on this film, I suddenly realised that there was no more Harry, no more vestige of my childhood, to come. But then I thought that it doesn't really matter that there will be no more ""new"" adventures. The magic of the series, its values of courage and loyalty and friendship, will live on. And naturally, we will always want to go to Hogwarts."
"shanitajohn","8","2","2","18 February 2019"," So close. So close it hurts.
","What am I doing writing a review for, possibly, the most highly anticipated series finale-8 years after its debut?<br/><br/>Well, for starters, I'm not saying anything that hasn't been said, I'm sure. I took the Potter train at my own pace, reading all the books and watching all the movies in the past year. Frankly, it's a miracle it wasn't spoiled for me after all this time!<br/><br/>But I'm adding my two cents a few years late, maybe just to validate the feelings of those who felt them first.<br/><br/>I was head-over-heels excited about 93% of this movie. So much of it was spot on! In fact, it was so damn near perfect, 30 minutes in, I was dying to see the end because it was proving to be such an epic, faithful recreation! But then, right as we near the close there were some huge misses. Scenes Rowling's words formed so clearly in my mind's eye, the thought that they never got to be realized on-screen as a part of this series, truly breaks my heart. For me, it all revolves around that final showdown.<br/><br/>1. Harry and Voldemort's final confrontation should have taken place as it did in the book, in the midst of EVERYONE. Not just the battle, the verbal beat-down. One of the most satisfying moments is Harry just laying Voldemort's dirty laundry out for all to see. As they circle each other, once and for all Harry tells all who can hear exactly how it went down. He unmasks Tom Riddle and all his lies, he vindicates Snape, he obliterates all doubt about Dumbledore's true character and plan, he sets right a lot of wrongs and god, it's so satisfying! Why we were robbed of that I'll never know.
2. Related, the final ""death blow"" needed to come down to Voldemort's decision to risk using the wand. It's his hubris that finishes him. He had to rise to Harry's final taunt.
3. Because no one is around in the movie version of the standoff, Harry is never celebrated by his victorious peers! Tragic.
4. Similarly, the headmasters standing ovation (which brought me to tears in the book) was completely omitted. You forget that Dumbledore lives on in the framed portrait in that office, which makes everything just so much better.<br/><br/>There are other things that bugged me, like, I wanted more time in the pensieve with Snape's memories. What we got from Alan Rickman was so brilliant. Also, the Nagini chase was way too drawn out. But overall, it's those 4 points made above that rob this grande finale of its grandeur.<br/><br/>Man. The source material is what sold all those billions of copies and made the series worth being made into movies in the first place. How I wish the filmmakers would have resisted the urge to reinterpret those crucial final moments.<br/><br/>Maybe in another 20 years some new director will start the whole thing over again and this time, stick the landing.<br/><br/>I'll be waiting."

The fact that everything the previous films set up comes to a conclusion and that the film is also not burdened by setting future films makes this great! Also, it has the best story, acting, visual effects, storytelling, and twists, particularly that of Snape's past. If one rewatches the entire series with knowledge of Snape's past, Rickman's performance makes a lot of sense. (ALAN RICKMAN IS GREAT HERE!) Lastly, this is also the movie that made me realize that, aside from Bonnie Wright as Ginny, every actor was perfectly cast!<br/><br/>DEAR WARNER BROS., HAYDEY FILMS, HP FILMS PRODUCERS, ACTORS, J.K.

Also the bond between Harry and Tom Riddle is not explained as well as it is in the book. And the old magic inside Harry given to him by his mother, is not explained well enough for someone who hasn't read the book.Daniel Radcliffe is getting to be a better actor then he was in the dreary fifth movie. This movies biggest problem is that the battle of Hogwarts <br/><br/>is way to long, most of the movie is that battle.

"thepsychocritic","6","2","2","31 August 2011"," Not all that magical.
","The magic is over. The spells, charms and adventures that enchanted the world for over a decade have all come to an end. And as one might naively expect, the cherry on the cake ought to eclipse everything else we have witnessed so far. Does the eighth instalment in this seven part series live up to its staunch expectations? Well, maybe. Maybe not.<br/><br/>Giving away the plot would be a grave injustice to the movie, the weight of which I refuse to carry upon my shoulders. Maybe it all ends well. Maybe Voldemort is revealed to be Harry's long lost father. Or maybe the Director goes completely bonkers, trashes the book and decides to introduce bad bunny rabbits who like eating pig foetuses for breakfast. Instead, it is the intricacies of the film that need to be talked about – some well appreciated and some deservingly ripped apart.<br/><br/>The first thing that strikes you as you enter the theatre laden with popcorn, Coke and other movie viewing paraphernalia is the darkness. The movie seems to have been shot in a perpetual absence of light, and though this might seem appropriate for the tense, evil atmosphere, there are parts when it gets onto your nerves and you feel like hurling your 3-D glasses into your neighbour's face and watching the movie in blurred, yet bright two dimensions, which is a better bet than viewing silhouettes of god-knows-what. But, let's not begrudge the movie for that.<br/><br/>The acting department is an area that I bear no complaints against; not major ones anyway. Daniel Radcliffe dons the clothes of Harry Potter with ease. He has grown with the viewers, with the story, but hasn't outgrown his role – something that is further highlighted in the movie. From the puny, eleven year-old a decade earlier, he has transformed into a heroic man with stubble and all. Emma Watson follows suit with her portrayal of the know-it-all Hermione Granger. Rupert Grint acts about as well as a dead horse; and a grumpy one at that, but thankfully the director has kept him much in the dark. Ralph Fiennes is impeccable as the Dark Lord and manages to instil fear in you even through the screen. But the real torchbearer is Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. Dark; cold and deadly, he bring life to character unlike anyone else in the film. However, the other characters that have been given screen time – the Weasleys, Hagrid, Lupin, Professor Flitwick – to name a few, seems rather forced because they have a very pettifogging role to play despite the fact that they are some of the most important and well-characterized people in the series. On the contrary, these along with others turn the movie into a reunion of sorts in which the viewer is reminded of what each character previously meant to him. Touching? Yes. Commendable? No.<br/><br/>The movie certainly isn't an epitome of perfection and has its own flaws. Though it successfully transcends the paper-to-screen barrier, something that its predecessors have miserably failed at, it does so rather painstakingly. There are times when the movies ceases to serve its purpose and pretends to be an ode to its own past, and though these moments will fill you with a fuzzy warmth, it doesn't aid the progress of the film. Also, the film lacks goose bumps-raising moments which ones would expect from an epic of this reputation, which is further worsened by a weak soundtrack. When a person is dying, ones tends to expect a lamenting dirge in the background, but here all ones hears are the victim's nauseating gasps and groans. As a result of which even scenes where beloved characters are slain give rise to ennui than to sympathy.<br/><br/>The battle of Hogwarts is a farrago of red lights, green lights, giants, gargoyles, people running around and chaos in general, in which even the cameraman seems to have a hard time following Harry. It lacks sentimentality and adrenaline-filled moments which the book brought along with it.<br/><br/>On the whole, the movie might serve as an entertainer for some, but hardly so for aficionados who have stuck with this saga from its inception onto the reel. A lot is missing, a lot is undone and you are left pitying Voldemort for being unable to get a nose-job. To think that something that began with a man killing a boy's parents would snowball into something this awe-inspiring is an achievement in itself and reason enough to watch the movie. The realization that it all ends once and for all does make for a befitting conclusion."
"phoenix0879-1","5","2","2","25 August 2011"," Enjoyable, but too much focus on action
","First of all, let me say this: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is an enjoyable film, it's even a fitting end to the film series. But it's not a great film, in fact it's barely a decent one.<br/><br/>The key problem is that the director, Yates, seems to have gotten bored with story-telling in part 1 and hopped on the action action action bandwagon in part 2 to compensate. Gone are scenes about Tonks and Lupin expecting a child (and this gives rise to an odd scene at the end where Harry suddenly knows all about their son, who in the film comes from nowhere), Dumbledore's back story has been thrown out almost completely, Snape's back story is as thin as tissue paper (which only undermines his turning to Dumbledore's side: without fully establishing his love for Lily, his move seems foolish, since Voldemort was winning), Fred's death - what do you mean, you missed it? So did Yates, apparently. <br/><br/>The biggest flaws though, lie in the final confrontation. Part of me can understand why Yates decided on the Harry/Voldemort battle being an isolated, one on one affair, as it does take the battle full circle. However, this discards several key elements, the biggest of which is psychological: the wizarding community had lived in comfort once before after Voldemort had been ""destroyed"" and no one witnessed it, only for him to return and wreak havoc once more. By having hundreds of witnesses, the wizarding world can at last live in true peace. But by removing ALL witnesses and having Voldemort turn to confetti (seriously, I was astonished by that), so there is no body, Yates has created a world where everyone will doubt that the villain is truly gone. They will live in fear, no matter what Harry says, because he came back from the dead once before.<br/><br/>Also, the scene with witnesses establishes how much Harry has learnt and how it is knowledge, not strength, that is truly powerful. He shows this in front of everyone and thus shows them that if they have knowledge, they need not fear someone who has only strength.<br/><br/>Yates also abandoned Harry's wand completely - yes, a sub-plot, but given how it ties to the Elder Wand and Harry himself, a ten second scene of ""I preferred my old wand, they say this one can do anything..."" would have sufficed and made all the fans a lot happier - and made sense.<br/><br/>This film probably swayed the furthest from the books of any of the adaptations but is still enjoyable, if only for the incredible battle sequences; however it's let down by lots of small problems, from half references (Tonks and Lupins son) that make no sense, to glossing over the death of a major character (Fred). But as I said at the start, the big flaw lies in making this mainly an action film and not a story film with action in it. It's a solid end to the movie franchise, but as a Harry Potter adaptation it's very very sub-par. I recommend watching it only if you haven't read the book for at least 10 months, otherwise the holes and omissions with drive you up the wall."
"leplatypus","7","2","2","31 July 2011"," Happy Birthday Harry & Goodbye (screen)
","It's 31 July so it's time to say it, above all it's will be the last opportunity: From now, that's it: no more movies to wait for. <br/><br/>For this last movie, I could copy and paste my review from the previous movie: no introduction for beginners, the movie sticks to the book and it's beautifully designed with an amazing cast that we liked to see get mature.<br/><br/>However, the final isn't really moving: my best feeling was to watch Hogwart on a big screen and on 3D. Having played the games and thus run for hours in Hogwart, it was like visiting my old school again. <br/><br/>In addition, there are also big flaws as well: first of all, the score is a pity: Going from John Williams to Desplat makes a lot of magic disappear. The score pushes no moments and all the drama falls simply flat. <br/><br/>Thus, either it's Yates who is a poor director, either it's the screenplay itself that is badly written. I don't know. But here are my arguments: <br/><br/><ul><li>When Harry leaves for the old forest, he has no words for Ron... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When he meets there his parents, there is no effusion or great lines ... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>After the victory, he is like a ghost because no one pays attention to him... </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When he breaks the stick, he should have throw both sides of the bridge instead of using only one. </li></ul><br/><br/>And I think Voldemort was killed by himself with his spell bouncing back at him (as in his parent's killings) but watching the movie, it isn't clear. <br/><br/>Well, my point is to say that a scene can shot on a lot of ways but with Yates, it's always the one with less emphasis that is chosen.<br/><br/>Now, at last, i will wait the special collector DVD set to watch the entire story because I have only seen 5 movies so far (stone, chamber, goblet, and the two hallows). <br/><br/>And maybe, in 19 years, they will shot again the ending with this same cast: HP was as much important for them than for us thus it will be an happy reunion...(But Emma had a good point: for them, before this fantastic childhood, they were like their children and in a way, this last scene was like a circle completed!)<br/><br/>For now, if you are in need of more Potter, i recommend you the excellent HP Wizardry, a brilliantly lavished book about all those adaptations ! <br/><br/>""All is fine""...."
"Bogie27","7","2","2","31 July 2011"," Hallows 2 - fumbles at the goal line.
","While following the advice of professional critics I went to the 2D viewing Of Deathly Hallows part 2. Some of the recent installments had been pretty dark and the 3D glasses were supposed to make this worse.<br/><br/>The film seemed a little unlike the previous Potter films. Most Potter films have us seeing the story through the eyes of Harry, Hermione and Ron. Hallows 2 was a little impersonal toward our Heroes. The film seemed rushed and shortcuts were taken that eliminated the dialogue we needed to really feel the leading characters pain. Harry in the film can now 'feel' the Horcruxes when near, and sees their location through Voldemort's mind. Hard to imagine Voldemort making such a mistake, but this technique allowed the filmmakers to shorten the dialogue. This was probably a result of the story being delivered in two parts. The last real character development of Harry, Hermione and Ron was in Hallows 1. Hallows 2 it seems, was meant to be an action film. Also new to the film were efforts to create humor by throwing in one-liners from time to time.<br/><br/>I thought the film stayed fairly close to Rowling's story, until the end at least. After the Kings Cross scene, the film began to diverge greatly from the book. I wondered if this was because better 3D possibilities were attained with these changes. I watched the movie again in 3D. It wasn't darker than the 2D version and the 3D seemed to help the film. However, I'm completely puzzled why the ending was changed the way it was. After waiting for more than a decade for the final showdown, it's unfortunate we got shorted here. The original ending by Rowling was much cleaner and presented more cinematic possibilities, and simply made a better ending for the series. The CGI for the early dragon scene was very good and I'm left wondering if they just ran out time to finish the thing correctly.<br/><br/>I've come to believe most of the professional critics are clueless about this film. It's surely the readers and serious Potter fans that contain real insight into the series. However most people I've talked to that didn't read the book were completely happy with the film and loved all the action scenes in this movie. Many book readers of the series will be disappointed.<br/><br/>That all being said - it was a difficult story to tell. Most of the loose ends in the series were tied up. Not too much of Dumbledore's personality was revealed, and that's probably a good thing. The final fleshing out of Snape's enigmatic character were revealed. Will Rowling pick up the pen once more to give us more Harry Potter? A lot could happen in 19 years! I certainly hope so - but not enough to give this film a rating it doesn't deserve."
"robastyk","Null","2","2","30 July 2011"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing II
","So now we reach the end of Harry Potter and the Tortuously Extended Franchise with the final installment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Pacing. Who is at fault? Certainly not the actors young and old who give very serviceable performances despite, in most cases, being given next to nothing to do. Director David Yates can manage some serviceable pacing when he needs to. I rather think that the fault lies less with an unimaginative director than with the author and producers of whom Rowling was one. Ultimately I attribute this film's failings, as I did in Part I, to greed. Deathly Hallows, Parts I & II might make a very good 2 and a half to 3 hour movie. Instead they combine to form a deadly dull 4 hour and 36 minute snoozer. Take just 1 scene as an example. Harry, on his way to confront Voldemort, uses the Resurrection Stone, one of the Deathly Hallows that he obtained in the preceding film. The ensuing scene is utterly superfluous. It does nothing but slow the action. At a moment when we need desperately to get on to the confrontation we are stuck with a convocation that does not include all the people who have been closest to Harry and spends minutes that pass like hours in soulful looks and some babble that we and Harry all knew already. It is a waste of celluloid or disc space or whatever medium is appropriate at the moment. Even Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are given precious little to do in this film but I'm not sure that is a fault as much as I enjoy their acting. This film is, after all the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, the moment toward which we've built over the 7 previous films. It's more than time to focus on Harry and Voldemort to the exclusion of most of the rest of the cast. Still, that's not what we get. We get much tying up of loose ends with interjected back stories that only contribute to the deathly pacing. We learn things that we should have learned in Half-Blood Prince and several other movies. Though those interjections may have been part of the 7th book they simply interfere with action of this film. We also get boxcar loads of exposition to explain plot twists for which no one ever laid the prior groundwork. The movie is a mess that completes the story but becomes a disservice to to the actors and fans. At one point late in the film Maggie Smith's Prof. McGonagall casts a weary, quizzical look in medium close up that seems more to say, ""What am I doing here if not for the paycheck and how fast can I get back to the set of Downton Abbey where I actually can display my talent and craft."" I feel for her. I do blame the directors to some extent but the producers and J. K. Rowling even more. From the start of the series the money people made great casting decisions and then put their wonderful actors in the hands of hacks like Chris Columbus and David Yates while giving fine directors like Alfonso Cuaron the boot after a single episode. Perhaps, one day once J. K. Rowling passes on to some other worldly Enchanted Forest, someone really competent who loves the stories will hire an elderly Daniel Radcliffe to play Albus Dumbledore in a really good remake of the series. I surely hope Harry Potter gets better treatment one day. He deserves it though he didn't get it here."
"patrickwigington","8","2","2","24 July 2011"," The End of Harry Potter
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2D) (2011) Dir: David Yates ****<br/><br/>WARNING: This review may contain spoilers, read at your own risk.<br/><br/>After a decade's worth of movies, the Harry Potter series comes to a climactic and exciting end with The Deathly Hallows Part 2. Although the series has had its share of awful installments, these last two films have gotten the job done, and Potter goes out with a bang.<br/><br/>Now with the bulk of their journey behind them, Harry, Ron, and Hermione still have a few Horcruxes to destroy. This takes them to a highly secured wizarding bank with a dragon, and—eventually—back to Hogwarts, where the climactic battle takes place. Meanwhile, Voldemort has taken over all of wizard-England, and possibly wizard-Europe, but he still has to kill Harry if he wants to be truly unstoppable.<br/><br/>Director David Yates does a very interesting job with this final part of the series: instead of making an entire other film with a beginning, middle, and end, he simply makes this the third act of The Deathly Hallows. Part 1 was filled with adventure, plot, and character development; all building up to the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. Yates does a wonderful job of not making the battle too bloated, as so many are these days, but instead focuses on Harry searching for the Horcrux that is hidden in Hogwarts. When several of the main characters inevitably die, Yates doesn't even show their deaths. Instead, he shows us their corpses laid out after the battle, with people weeping over them. Yates handles the scene especially well; it's not too melodramatic or understated, but a truly heart wrenching scene.<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes really shines as Voldemort in this film. Having toned down on the flamboyancy, he has turned the character into what he was always supposed to be; sinister, unsettling, and evil. The main trio did most of their acting in the previous film, and as a result their roles are limited to emotions and plot devices, but it works. Ciaran Hinds is nice as Aberforth Dumbledore, and Alan Rickman does a wonderful job of finally giving Snape some depth during his death and flashback scene. <br/><br/>There are moments in the film that are less than stellar, including Ron & Hermione's kiss, the slightly awkward epilogue, and—for purists—the unexplained absence of one of Malfoy's cronies. The film could have also done more with classic characters such as Hagrid, who never really gets closure, and the ""romance"" between Harry & Ginny is practically absent.<br/><br/>Still, the movie is absorbing and entertaining, with intense battles and great special effects. The scene between Harry and Professor Dumbledore in the semi-afterlife is probably the highlight of the film. The eighth and final Harry Potter film does a good job of bringing the much-loved series to a close.<br/><br/>http://thatguythatlikesmovies.blogspot.com"
"samacts","Null","2","2","21 July 2011"," Well...Good but not Epic...Could have been longer and better
","I went to see Deathly Hallows: Part 2 with my 13 year old nephew. We have read all books and seen all movies. We fall into the hardcore 'Harry Potter' 'J K Rowling' fan category :) And given the fact how good the first part of Deathly Hallows was, we had very high expectations from the second part. But after seeing the movie we both were a bit disappointed and a lot unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Initial part of the movie was good, the director stuck to the book in most parts. But the later part and the most crucial part of not only the movie but the entire Harry Potter series was disappointing. The battle in Hogwarts was not epic at all and I mean at all.<br/><br/>Unless I give few details I can't justify why I was disappointed with the movie. So here are few spoilers...<br/><br/>****Spoilers*** The movie should have featured Hogwarts battle in more details. I was utterly disappointed with not showing following parts: 1. Fred's battle scene and how he dies. I didn't understand why this part was not in the movie 2. Harry and Luna's battle in Ravenclaw common room 3. Details from Snape's memories. Come on, Snape's secret I feel is one of the most important plots of the whole series. 4. Harry mending his wand using Elder wand. Why show him break the elder wand. Really??<br/><br/>I was also disappointed with Harry's dual with Voldemort and the way they have shown Voldemort's end.<br/><br/>End of ****Spoilers***<br/><br/>But again, we had read the book and went to see the movie with an expectation to see, if not all but most of the spectacular plots from the book. I always felt that for people who had read Harry Potter books before seeing the movies, it was always like a curse. You expect too much and get out of the theater a tad unsatisfied.<br/><br/>All in all a good attempt but as I said earlier not Epic. Could have been better, much better actually! But past 10-11 years were really good years of my life. There was always a harry Potter book or movie to look forward to :)"
"hqmusik10","Null","2","2","16 July 2011"," magical experience but something lacks
","harry potter returns to the big screen once again but for the final time. i have personally awaited this movie since the former disappointed me in a way unexplainable. the movie contains harry's usual heroics and the the help of his friends but it lacks in the department of plot development. if u haven't read the book, some of the viewers might be confused as to how harry returns from the dead and why he doesn't die when voldemort uses the killing curse on him. it seemed like the director David yates (whose previous pictures before harry potter were straight to TV films) focused on visual effects rather then properly following the structure of the book. that being said, this is still and undoubtedly the best harry potter film in the series. i might seem contradictory and foolish because of how i listed the movies flaws and how i still like the movie, but the movie contained outstanding performances from the main lead. the trio should be applauded for giving it their all in the last film. the special effects were nearly flawless and the execution was elegant.<br/><br/>all in all, i stick to my previous comments that the movie doesn't contain all the details the book has but on second thought, which one of the movies do? so i recommend all harry potter enthusiasts to watch the movie as they will not be disappointed but just slightly wanting more. i myself expected a better ending and a better take on snape's story but nonetheless a great movie. i expect the director and the actors to make a name for themselves in the future.<br/><br/>thank you j.k. rowling and the makers of the film series for giving me a magical and unforgettable childhood!"
"alexbrisan32","10","2","2","14 July 2011"," All in all a pretty good movie, but....
","As i already said in my summary, the movie was pretty good, and i also think that there were some elements which may have surprised some of the viewers, but i'll talk about that later. I think i have only one bad point for this movie, but i'm not sure if it was the movie or the cinema... I watched the movie in ""3D"", but the only things that were 3d were the ads BEFORE the movie, and some very short scenes in the movie. I didn't like that at all. To be quite frankly, though i secretly hoped that Harry would survive, i was quite expecting him to die. I don't know, but they said that some ""amazing deaths"" would appear, but i didn't find it amazing that Freddie(i think), Snape, Bellatrix, or Voldemort all died. However, Part1 made you expect that Severus was the bad one, but as i understood he was the good one. I think that the directors were a bit too cruel when they told harry that Dumbledore was a bit of a bad guy. There also are a couple of thing which i really liked about this movie: 1. I think that the graphics were amazing, respect for those who did the image editing. 2. Another interesting part is that in my opinion the producers made up the question whether or not James Potter is Harrys father, because at some point there are mentioned some similarities between Snape and Harry. 3. I was also expecting that if Harry would Survive, he would become the next Headmaster of Hogwarts, but instead he seems o haven a pretty normal Muggle life(come on?!). In my opinion, the most funny part of the entire movie is at the end, where Harry with Ginny and Ron with Hermione bring their children to Hogwarts. The funny thing is that Harry's Son is Called Albus Severus Potter, which in my opinion is interesting, because if it were after the name, he would be the greatest magicians of all time."

","I saw this on the 2nd july at a preview and was really really impressed. my favourites of the series up till now have been the third one directed by Alfonso Cuaron, and the half blood prince (6th one). I was tentative about the 3d but actually it worked brilliantly and made the pictures even crisper. This film is a great achievement, sometimes i have considered these films as sell- outs, only looking for doing well at the box office, but they have never failed to entertain and this one makes the characters and their motives much more interesting and deeper. <br/><br/>The acting from some is still not to my liking and not up to the standard it should be. For instance alan rickman seems to be making fun of his own particular way of talking by ramping up every syllable, and rupert grint is a very mediocre actor who they still give these terribly clichéd lines. <br/><br/>The ending is good but i had some better ideas which i wont say now as to not give spoilers. <br/><br/>in general though, the film has a great visual style, fluid storytelling. the world created feels more real than ever and the characters make the film compelling. <br/><br/>well worth seeing and the best of all hp films."

","OK so I'm a huge film fan and I've been on this Harry Potter ride for the last 11 years. Every film is just a piece of a grand puzzle that will all come to a triumphant conclusion. Well somebody forgot to tell everyone involved with the film. I have never been more let down by the end of anything ever. The main focus or my rage is to be focused on the 30 sec light show between Harry and Voldemort. Harry destroys all the Whorecruxes and finally faces off against the ultimate evil but now that his little trinkets are broken he's actually a pretty weak wizard. In fact Harry kills him in 2 seconds and he just melts away. We've been waiting for this battle for 11 years and all that happens is Harry's beam is stronger. No screaming, no yelling, no fight for their lives. Just 2 beams meeting and Harry's is better. <br/><br/>You don't diminish the enemies power throughout the films. To build suspense you increase his power, making him nearly unstoppable at the end and somehow Harry must overcome the unsurmountable to succeed. Instead Voldemort is now weak and his super wand is busted. Splitting this movie into 2 parts was simply a tool to make another billion. They stretched out boring story telling for the last 4 hours of this series and they didn't even wrap up the characters. They just jump 19 years into the future and Harry Potter is just some guy with a wizard for a son. The most powerful wizards seem to all be pivotal parts of the wizard world but Harry is just some guy in a sweater vest."

","Frankly it's sad, and at the same time happy. I simply do not belong to those who have always responded with a special enthusiasm for any of the movie franchise about a young wizard. However, I am glad that we always had to consciously approach the fact of its existence. Much has happened over the years. For some of us have been ups and downs in relation to the part of Harry Potter, for someone not. We are alone. Such stories - only a sign of how this loneliness we are trying to escape. When there is that it is able to unite us, and the same eyes we are able to watch the same story. Harry and his friends always reminded very much of themselves, because of two things - simplicity and good nature. Also, like any other person, we grow, mature, and it all happens under the influence of other factors. We observe and listen, exactly the same as the one when a little boy, in the course of years became a man. He had fears, and there were mysteries. He sought to solve them, and overcome all sorts of difficulties. He was tough, and friends were always glad to help. Is this not a reflection of our life in certain stages of her? Istoriya3D finally reached the tipping point that, when there was absolutely no childhood, and adulthood appeared views of the surrounding events. No more compromises, and as it turned out, it had to Yates to clear better film3D Potteriana.<br/><br/>Finals begin at the same place and finished last. Harry continues to search and destroy krestrazhem, revealing a truth long after the other. Each of the stories of how wonderful flower blooms on the quality of its on-screen incarnation, and this against the background of the war, that this time reached the very heart of the School of Wizardry - Hogwarts. So we have not seen it, and now never see. For many viewers Hogwarts was a kind of contact point values, which were always presented in the form of friendship and nastoyatelstva. And no more delays, no unnecessary chatter. Only Harry, only fidelity, and pursuing all the destruction. You can refer yourself to whichever of the categories of viewers, but the fact remains a fact for all - ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is the perfect combination of language and the magic of cinema, so perfect a form of which is sought or one year.<br/><br/>Yates throws us into an even more oppressive and heavy atmosphere with all the consequent seriousness from the first seconds. Conversation with Kryukohvatom each evokes the idea of ​​just how significant was the approach to creating images of goblins, only gaining full speed as soon as we find ourselves in a bank vault. Excellent work on the sound makes itself felt, balancing between the absolute silence, drama and suspense.<br/><br/>Yet in one part of the franchise was not represented in such a grand magic number, as here. If someone had thought of her lack of a rare and often repeated occurrence, there is an argument not able to find a way for his being. Scenes from the attack on the school and a further battle in its territory amazing imagination, especially by the scope with which this material came to the creators. Protection of Hogwarts gorgeous scenes extras are told by their size, and many characters appear in a surprisingly strong and significant way.<br/><br/>The entire color stunning British school of acting punches for most of the scenes, making us even more insight to treat them. Finally, the record screen time was Ralph Fiennes, whose ""you know who"" the destruction of each of the next Horcrux is even more direct correspondence notions of darkness and gloom. Neville takes off from their shoulders image of a modest and humble guy, and gives your episodes live energy of goodness and faith. Home trio strongly demonstrates a complete renunciation of those pranks that are brought before us in various amounts for previous years. Romantic issues are themselves short, direct and confident answers. This is not the children we once knew. Now it's two guys, behind which the power and courage, and a real woman, able to charm anyone looking right at it man. However, I think, a hero of the imagery comes to Severus. It is starting to deploy its history, it's not just Harry. It is not just the bar, which surely holds Yates first hour and a half. It is much more than that.<br/><br/>Severus makes history more than ever to penetrate the gap and in the emotional space in which Alan Rickman is calling us. Beginning to emerge as answers to many protracted and complex issues. What happens immediately taking shape full epics, which is so easily dissolved, knowing how long we were going to this. And the last conversation with Harry Dambusom only emphasizes the last time that a tipping point, when the whole world that was built many years around one person starts to go away from under his feet. Saying goodbye to them, leaving alone with the problem itself throughout his life that he so carefully prepared.<br/><br/>In the finals can be found inconsistencies with the book, but their role does not affect the plot by a radical way, and all the changes made by Yeats, were personally approved by Rowling. Staged ending only emphasizes the importance and drama of the whole junction, causing the heroes to face any one time with each other. Two opposing world, the best colors and shades, with unique emotional content and the history of origins.<br/><br/>Just supporting each other we are capable of much. Unsurpassed finale unmatched history.<br/><br/>Goodbye, Harry."
"nickrrrr","3","9","16","16 July 2011"," Ostentatious ending to a series that has lost its splendor of originality
","Story: Now this is where the film falls short the most, paramount importance is given to scenes where cheap romance occurs (retrieval of the basilisk teeth), which does nothing to enrich the plot, because it has no effect on the overall story, but the filmmaker does not seem o think it is important to explain Harry's ""loljks, I wasn't dead"", probably assuming that most people have read the book and the others will just say ""It was probably magic"", but this cannot be too much of a criticism because many of these weak storytelling mechanisms are taken directly from the books. As for the epilogue it seems cheap, gratuitous and completely out of tone with the rest of the film. It feels like it was left there to get a few cheap laughs and to leave the viewer with no uncertainty that Harry does live happily ever after. But most of these criticisms should probably go into a book review, because the source material is as weak as the film itself.<br/><br/>Camera-work and Direction: Average to low standard, especially considering the budget was $250 million. The shots where steady cam was not used only seem out of character with the rest of the film. The sequences where Harry and Voldemort communicate through their psychic connection seem incredibly redundant and have a tendency towards fake experimentalism, which has no motifs and seems to be completely self-indulgent. Under this category falls also the white Kings Cross station, which seems to be an optimistic attempt to form some sort of symbolism, but once again this optimism must go unrewarded. The animations are standard, not adding much to the plot, even when they are mostly visually pleasing.<br/><br/>Acting: The acting in the lead roles seems to be consistent with the rest of the series, even though our familiarity with the characters does not seem to make them more sympathetic. The supporting actors seem mostly relived to be over with this lengthy project and their performances are very weak, which is not saying that they are given enough screen time to give their characters any development. <br/><br/>Sceenplay: Steve Kloves' screenplay seems to be an incomplete work where the adding in of interactions with cute animated creatures through out the film, seem to have importance over the development of the plot. With the fact that his only large job has been in writing the screenplay for the Harry Potter series, his knowledge of the overall story should have aided in tying loose ends, but these remain completely unsolved and seem accentuated with lousy dialogue and lengthily emotionally dry scenes. <br/><br/>Soundtrack: Forgettable rehash of previous successes <br/><br/>Poor ending to the epic (in size not in merit) Harry Potter franchise."
"celebintown","5","12","23","16 July 2011"," Not quite the end I imagined
","The general idea is that you don't fix what ain't broken. Unfortunately that's what they seem to be trying here anyway. I was happy that the finale was split into two, seeing as 'Half Blood Prince' was such a disaster. But they did it unevenly and the bulk went into part one. So this part felt rather sparse and lackluster story wise. Still, what actually disappointed me was how they skipped and shuffled bits around trying to make it more impressive and in the process butchered everything I loved about 'Deathly Hallows'. The final battle for example. There were things I was really looking forward to watching on screen - small but significant scenes, characters rising up to the occasion, explanations, finally. Maybe because it's the finale, expectations are obviously sky high and on top of that I've always loved the books very much. But I get the feeling the people who made this movie don't really have much love for this universe. The acting is average, special effects alright, but nothing is impressive. It's not bad, but not very good either. At least not the end I was hoping for."

","I have read only a small portion from the books, but enough to understand the woman's approach. I have, however, attentively watched all the films. This comment applies to the entire saga with some attention to the final two.<br/><br/>Charles Dickens invented a style of writing that is well suited to some kinds of cinematic adventure. What he would do is invent a world, and thoroughly understand its dynamics. These really were invented worlds, though today they appear as though he was writing about his own. He was an absolute genius at discovering certain objects and characters in these worlds and giving them powerful names. Then he would let his characters loose; he literally would write and publish the first episodes of what we read today as whole books. He would send the chapters out, trusting that his named entities would weave their own story. The result is pure joy when reading because the world is whole enough to carry us.<br/><br/>It is also why his books all end clumsily.<br/><br/>Rowling works very much in this style, the first chapters sent aloft while the story is still soft; the impressive ability to name things; the creation of a universe of sorts. As though she understands this, her alternative world is extended not from our modern technological one, but from Dickens' Victorian England. The filmmakers, starting with Columbus, understood this and adapted what they supposed we supposed were Victorian manners, costumes and architecture. The dragons are sourced not from modern models but from drawings of that period.<br/><br/>So the strength is that we are sucked into the world. Usual offenses from clumsy plots, unnecessary events, artificially placed combat and all are made invisible because we care not about the story per se, but the world that supports it. We care less about any of the characters, than the names the carry. That is Dickens' gift. I do like a few names Rowling devised; they are worthy.<br/><br/>Otherwise (meaning without the Victorian art, and Dickensian names) we may just as well be watching a Michael Bay film.<br/><br/>The previous film had a folding device I appreciated. We are told a story that is supposed to be central, the story of the 'Deathly Hallows.' Now as it turns out, the three objects described in the story are not any more central than any of the other named objects, but we don't know that in the seventh film. The story is told in a shadow puppet form, one we have seen a couple times already this year. The level of abstraction is the same from the Harry Potter universe as that universe is from ours, which is why it matters in the end that Harry destroys one of the three objects.<br/><br/>Previous films, starting with the fourth I believe, had the 'pensieve,' a clever device which allows Harry to see movies of the past. The dynamics of the thing are strange because they are supposed to be recreated memories, but the viewer sees them cinematically. We gloss over the difficulty just as we do with alien invaders speaking English. I did appreciate the design of this thing as it evolved in the films, but it retains the inkflows. That works well in combination with the inkflow-like trails of Voldemort's flying minions.<br/><br/>Lily Evans as a redheaded girl is adorable.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","Before any fanboys, fangirls or IMDb users mark this review as ""not helpful"" without actually reading it (based on the 3/10 rating), I beg you to read this as a whole and not be a butthurt fan who can't stand someone criticizing the ""best movie of our generation"".<br/><br/>The final Harry Potter book was epic, the reason they split it was because the whole book was you couldn't really omit any important part of it without losing relevance. When I first watched the 7th movie I was really surprised since it was impressively loyal to the book. The first movie had been 90% true to the novel, they really couldn't mess up the second part, could they? But they did. The movie starts dramatically with shots of Hogwarts and Professor Snape staring at students from his balcony; the next scene showed the trio making plans for breaking into the magical bank of Gringotts... there was where the movie started to go downhill.<br/><br/>The book was perfect, marvelous, but after 10 or so minutes the movie started to focus more on humor than drama. Yes, HUMOR. There was a missing important character in the beginning and while funny somehow, the scene at the bank simply wasn't really loyal nor impressive.<br/><br/>Instead of pointing out every difference in the book, I'll just criticize how the second and third acts were more focused on humor than drama. Ron and Hermione being attacked by a tsunami and then kissing? The whole D.A. members looking more like scolded children than a suppressed army?<br/><br/>There's a HUGE difference between doing the final confrontation in front of everyone (explaining it all, as in the book) and making Harry and Voldemort chase around Hogwarts and throw themselves from a balcony. Destroying the Elder Wand with his hands and rushing a ""19 years later"" epilogue has to be the worst ending ever.<br/><br/>Way to go, Hollywood. I really couldn't believe that you could kill the whole drama in one of the best fantasy books in the last decade. If you want a GREAT fantasy book-to-movie adaptation watch the first Narnia movie, that's one the few cases when a movie's better than this book.<br/><br/>I might have left out how the movie had no 3D effects (other than the Dragon at the beginning) and was a whole rip-off my money..."

","I was really looking forward to this movie. The final parts of the final book are epic and very satisfying. And for most of the movie was very good, until the end.<br/><br/>I understand when directors change things from the book for brevity. For instance in the book the diadem is destroyed by the fire in the Room of Requirement, but in the movie they just stab it rather than spending time explaining.<br/><br/>However, when they make scenes worse that could have fit in the 2hr time, that is not good.<br/><br/>I wanted to see Mrs. Weasley show some uncharacteristic fire in defeating Beatrix, as in the book, but the scene was brief and passion-less.<br/><br/>In the book, Neville got a ""quest"" from Harry to kill the snake. In the movie they tried to turn Neville's killing of the snake into something more exciting, but it seemed forced and just luck that he was in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>In the book Harry battles Voldemort in front of everybody, circling, taunting and explaining who is the Master of the Elder Wand. In the movie, they battle alone and Voldemort seems to die inexplicably from no visible spell hitting him.<br/><br/>In an attempt to make the movie better, I think the director's changes made it worse, and it ruined it for me."
"Riddler666","Null","10","19","21 July 2011"," Not as deep as it thinks it is
","This is one of those films that is simply to hard to critique due to the millions of fans going into the film with unconditional love. I however did not have that problem despite greatly enjoying the books. This film suffers from a certain shallowness that plagues the whole movie. The themes which come into fruition are poorly developed and appeal to our tendency towards intellectual simplicity. Everything in the film is black and white. There are no middle grounds. Your either with Harry, or against him. This presents a template which just seems artificial and lacking depth.<br/><br/>Due to the fact this is the last of the series, the simplistic mentality of good and evil is much more apparent with the conclusion of multiple plots. The characters are all extremely dull as a result. They are either saints or sadists. With regards to the romances, I will not spoil anything, however it is my opinion what does occur was extremely forced.<br/><br/>In the end, this film suffers from Return of the King syndrome. It is self aware as a film of its conclusion to the series and thus attempts to drag its feet. The film only runs for a little over 2 hours, however it felt like a 3 hour long film at least. I say wait to rent it, skip the crowds with annoying children, and view it without your rose colored potter glasses."

","Compared to all the others it lacked detail and the plot was thin. It brushed through subplot by sub plot (destroying holcruxes) so quickly it was hard to follow, and I have read the book. The battle for Hogwarts was anticlimactic and lacked focus. The best part of the movie was the memories Harry watched from Severus Snape. Lastly, the 3rd deathly hallow, the resurrection stone, was found dropped and then never mentioned again. They made no reference to it when Harry ""amazingly"" awakened from the dead and won his battle.<br/><br/>I think the others were excellent and really draw you into the story.

"Prichards12345","6","6","10","16 July 2011"," Lacks the resonance of the book but not a bad way to end the series
","So, HP7.2 at last brings the saga to a close. I have to admit I was expecting something more after 7 previous movies; the film does nothing much wrong but is strangely ineffectual. Many of the characters - Malfoy, Hagrid etc, don't appear much - hell even Ron and Hermione feel oddly in the background in this movie.<br/><br/>The plot, of course, concerns Harry and his friends' hunt for the remaining Horcruxes, the destruction of which will make Lord Voldemort mortal again. Lots of actors from the previous movies reappear briefly, including Miriam Margoyles and Emma Thompson, and there's a nice reappearance from John Hurt at the beginning.<br/><br/>It doesn't take long for the movie to reach Hogwarts, however, and most of the running time feels like an extended finale to the series rather than a film in it's own right. Inevitable, I suppose. The scene I liked best concerned the fate of Snape (Alan Rickman - excellent as ever). But too many characters are reduced to small moments rather than being important parts of the story. The stuff about Dumbledore's brother felt forced and unconvincing - indeed, the whole back-story of Dumbledore has suffered greatly.<br/><br/>Still, there are some splendid action sequences and Daniel Ratcliffe gives probably his best performance in the series. On the whole the films have been pretty good, vastly better than flicks like The Golden Compass and the Lion the Witch and The Wardrobe; vastly inferior to a certain trilogy by Peter Jackson...."

","Despite being burned before about watching HP6 in 3D IMAX, I made it a point to see this one, for all its sentimental value, in that format. I must say that the 3D IMAX was worth every cent. The big images and the added dimension also added to our immense satisfaction about this film, added expense notwithstanding.<br/><br/>There action here was relentless as it goes from one highlight scene to another. From the exciting incursion of the trio into Gringott's Bank to get into the Lestrange Vault and their exhilarating escape, the unexpectedly (for non-readers) revelatory Pensieve memory of Prof. Snape, the very intense and destructive Battle at Hogwarts, the explosively watery destruction of the Hufflepuff's cup, the fiery aftermath of finding Ravenclaw's diadem, all the way up to the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. These scenes were all very memorably shot, with incredible visual and sound effects. The way the ultimate destruction of the Dark Lord was rendered (of course, you knew that good will triumph over evil) is a 3D moment to remember!<br/><br/>This movie is, for all intents and purposes, a perfect film to end the franchise. It was indeed the grand finale, if you will. I'm not anymore going to go into how the children all grew up in front of our eyes. Having gone through eight films with these people, we also share in their despair and eventual triumph. We all probably had a teary smile during that charming little epilogue showing a scene at the train station 19 years later. Okay I am going to say it now: This is the best movie of the year for me. Congratulations to David Yates and the excellent cast for perfectly recreating J.K. Rowling's incredibly intricate final book (some small details changed notwithstanding). This film is indeed a bittersweet victory for the creators and for the fans alike."

For those who haven't seen the movie don't read this.<br/><br/>Warning Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>WCS <br/><br/>Let me just start off by saying the movie does not deserve a 8.2. People have rated this on the fact that it's the last movie. There are many scenes in the final movie I hated.<br/><br/>WCS<br/><br/>They are the breaking of the shield, Harry nodding to Narcissa after his run in with death, the color blue and the final duel. Firstly the color blue is so annoying. <br/><br/>More Spoilers<br/><br/>=<br/><br/>MS<br/><br/>The color blue is heavily used in the battle of Hogwarts. There is too much of the one color and its really frustrating because the producers are better then that. This along with part 1 are the two worst Harry Potter movie's I have ever seen. The previous movie's are creative and unexpected were as this movie in particular is not. This is because they 're getting lazy towards the end. This is expected but for Harry Potter that's a low point in the franchise. <br/><br/>MS <br/><br/>I mean come on! The Voldermort and the Death Eaters took the easy anti-climatic way of breaking the shield. What they should have done was used the latest digital effects to make it epic. An example would be like the fire snake scene. <br/><br/>MS<br/><br/>The second scene I don't like is Harry nodding to Narcissa. This gives away the fact he is alive and that's not a good thing. If they kept the fact he was dead concealed a little longer it would have added more emotions to the movie.<br/><br/>MS<br/><br/>& <br/><br/>contains a Order of the Phoenix Spoiler<br/><br/>Lastly the final duel is also anti-climatic. It needed to be epic by using a variety of spells. If they used a combination it would keep you on the edge of your seat. For example the duel scene in the Order of the Phoenix between Dumbeldore and Voldermort. This was epic and the reason it is one of my favorite Harry Potter movie's. <br/><br/>The books by J.K Rowling are epic and everything you want in a book. The movie's take you back to reality that it can't be as good as the hype. <br/><br/>That's why I want those who believe this to give the movie a 1 to bring the movie done to its rightful rating( at least 7.4). <br/><br/>I have nothing against Harry Potter I just believe in fair voting and not just giving it a 10 because you like it."

","There's this superstition about Star Trek movies that all the even numbered ones are good and all the odd numbered ones are bad. By the Harry Potter movie adaptation reckoning, it seems to be just the opposite: the odd numbered movies were spiffy and the even numbered movies were dull. However, the fact that the first adaptation didn't work out too well off-sets that and splitting ""7"" into ""7.1"" and ""7.2"" seemed to create a curious result: that of the fact that 7.1 was almost spot-on and 7.2 almost completely (save a few good moments) dropped the ball.<br/><br/>David Yates has been one of the best Harry Potter directors (probably why the longest running) because of his closer attention to the characters and mood than just reciting plot points (Columbus and Newell) and focusing on the magic (Cuaron). Here it doesn't work. Previously, David Yates went the daring route of allowing the camping scenes to draw out the way they work in the book, focusing on the character's loss of direction and even boredom in a high stress environment as tension is building. This approach is unpopular in filmmaking because audiences don't like watching characters be impatient and bored--it makes them impatient and bored as well, and 7.1 had its critics for that. It seemed with all the careful mood-building Yates was doing, 7.2 was going to be the release we were all looking for in an ending: the tension explodes and the threads close.<br/><br/>...and though 7.2 certainly had its action, Yates managed to make the movie both slow... and rushed. For once his devoted focus to Harry Potter's mental working doesn't work out, because while we're sitting with Radcliffe in a room somewhere as he decides what to do next, information is getting straight skipped over in the Battle of Hogwarts going on outside. People've not read the book seem to all be reacting with confusion and require too much explanation from the audiences that have read the book as to what's going on. Deaths happen off-screen and are only mentioned in single lines of dialog, despite being important to both plot and often audience. The Snape's Story flashback scene is cut near to a third of the detail, but the limbo scene seemed protracted for no reason at all. The Battle of Hogwarts covers a good 80% of the playlength of the movie, but the actual action of that battle is regulated transition scenes where the characters have to run through it to get somewhere else--AND is shown more as crowded hallways with extras running wildly instead of showing the important elements of the battle regarding which characters end up fighting whom.<br/><br/>It's difficult because the movie stretches at over two hours in length and should not be much longer. But Yates seems to have forgotten Griffith-old well-established cross-cutting. Compare to Star Wars Episode 6. Star Wars balances three entire battles with their respective character beats while Harry Potter 7.2 cannot even balance one battle with Harry's personal discoveries. Star Wars Episode 6 may have annoyed fans with cutesy teddy bears but Harry Potter 7.2 annoys them major plot points being dismissed entirely. All one needed was some cross-cutting between, say, the Room of Requirement and the people in the entrance way of Hogwarts, but instead of showing WHY Mrs. Weasley was so protective of her daughter to inspire what was supposed to be an epic line, the camera lingers longer on stone soldiers fighting giants.<br/><br/>The split-up of book seven was intended to fit the amount of information in that book into a longer play-length, as well as increase the amount of tickets sold, but it feels like 7.1 was the movie that Yates wanted to make, and 7.2 was just him trying to shove some denouement in around studio-requested 3D shots. There is a lot of room for improvement but there isn't a whole heck of a lot that can be done now. So now its time to sum up the series.<br/><br/>Whereas its taken as a general rule that the books are better than the movie, a good adaptation can stand on its own and deliver the story to a new audience. Lord of the Rings is a good example of this, creating a pretty consistent movie narrative that most audiences can keep up with and enjoy despite deviations from the books. Harry Potter from the get-go was too focused on enfranchisement that it took quite a few entries before it gained its legs--and by then it may have been too late. Its later movies got a handle on how to actually adapt the books, but all told I'm not sure these movies suffice for non-book readers. They work better as visual counterpart than narratives of their own, and now that the event-ness of them is over and we can all stop dressing up to go to the theatre, I think it's safe to mark them down as mostly illustration.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"

"ironhorse_iv","8","3","4","10 February 2016"," Action packed, genuine heart and emotional drama made this movie, a very engrossing magical epic spectacle. It has everything, a finale should have.
","While, personally, I'm not the biggest fan of the books in which these films was based on, I do have to say, this movie is a great movie to end the Harry Potter film series with. 10 points to Griffindor & director David Yates! Author J.K Rowling would be proud. The movie is very memorable. It's so unlike the other movies, which I found to be somewhat boring or below average. For me, personally, this movie, by far, is the best movie in the 2001 to 2011 film series, because how entertaining, it was. To all of the millions of Harry Potter fans around the world; most of them, agree with my statement. Unlike the other movies that are cut into two formulaic plot directions; one being the subplot is which tells the student life of Harry Potter at Hogwarts, while the other, being about the mystery that Harry Potter must uncovered that year. This most recent one has Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his gang of misfits, Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) & Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) going to various settings away from Hogwarts, in a last ditch attempt to their school from the oncoming invasion of Dark Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). The only way, they can stop this, is to find, all the missing objects call Horcruxes; that hold a part of a Voldermont's soul, protecting him or her from death. Seeing how epic in scope, this main plot is, it was no surprised that this 2007's novel with the same name, was adapted into two feature-length parts, with Part 1, being released in November 2010, and Part 2 was released in July 2011. While, some people might have complaints about why the final book being split, I'm not one of those. However, I'm starting to hate the recent trends of films, split into multiple parts; in which this movie brought back. Still, I do understand why the studios felt like they had to. After all, there is still way too exposition sub-stories from supporting characters from the book to fit, even in two films. Despite the film omitting a lot of things, the movie is stil mostly faithful to the source material, with only a few things, change that I didn't like. One of the biggest faults of the film is how both young and old Lily Evans (Ellie Darcey-Alden & Geraldine Somerville) doesn't have the same eye color as Harry Potters. The reason why this is a big deal, is because how much, everybody in the film series, point out how Harry Potter remind them of his mother, because of his eyes. It makes no sense. Another big jarring confusing plot-holes, is how wizards, can or cannot being able to use, other people's wands. In the film, one thing that really baffled me, is how Voldermont thinks that he can't use the elder wand, until he kills Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Yet, it's show, before-then, that he can indeed use that wand to do magic and other people's wand. The same with Harry Potter. It's weird, how the film makes it seem like they can't do magic without a wand, but yet, they show, them, just doing that with potions. Also, why does people still die in this universe, if Harry Potter has all of the three deadly hallows? Oh Snap! Didn't they establish that one of the wizards knows, how to heal himself with magic, if it's a bleeding wound? How is that character, even dead? Also, how can a living object become a horcrux? It doesn't make sense. In my opinion, don't bother, trying to understand the logic of all the wizard terms, because it will take you out of the fantasy movie, and give you a headache. The movie is full of unbelievable, deux ex machina that is very confusing, and not very logical. You just have to go with it. Nevertheless, I still don't get, why this movie is continuing its insulting black & white one-dimensional views of good Vs evil. A good example in this movie, is how everybody still treat Slytherin's house as an evil community of people, when the movie show that, there are mostly not!? Another thing, that bug me, is the fact, that the underage students weren't evacuated from Hogswarts. I guess, the school is trying to continue, its high death count record of being one of the most dangerous schools, ever. I swear, it always seems like the castle is always in danger. So, I wouldn't call the battle plot, anything new. It is very clichÃ©s and prediction. Despite that, the battle sequences are well done. Visual and special effects masterpiece. Lots of heart-breaking, yet fun moments. The music by composter John Williams really set the tone of the film, as always. The pacing for this film is also not a drag. Very well-pace. It's the shortest of all 9 films. The main cast was surprising better, too. Yes, they still, have that wooden delivery in some of their lines, but at least, it's more emotional driven than a normal read-through. Also, the over the top hammy lines by the season actors weren't so annoying this time, because how few lines, they were given. However, I didn't like the Epilogue ending as much as other people did. I can understand why a lot of people don't like it; in a way it feels a bit jumbled because so many characters of this new generation are introduced too quickly, and it's a bit much to take in. I personally am not too keen on the idea. It felt like sequel baiting. After all, it's clear, by Warner Bros that we haven't seen the last of this world completely, as spin-offs movies are indeed, coming soon. Overall: In the meantime, I urge you all to revisit the world of Harry Potter for yourself. Check out all 9 movies. It will be a trip, worth taking."
"jackbanister16","3","3","4","30 March 2014"," Nothing but disappointing.
","It's been 3 years now since I first saw this, but after the very strong ""Deathly Hallows Pt. One,"" this movie came off as a rushed and incompetently written and directed mess (ironic considering they directed part one). I'm shocked J.K. Rowling put the stamp of approval on this heap.<br/><br/>This review won't be long because my complaints with the movie are as follows: Dumbledore's back story was given no attention (hugely important to the story). the Battle of Hogwarts (pivotal in the book) was glossed over with a few sweeping panoramic shots. Finally, Voldemort and Bellatrix's death was ridiculously anti-climactic and stupid- looking. I was ready to walk out when Voldemort did a Microsoft Powerpoint transition, but for whatever reason I stayed. <br/><br/>The epilogue was ""cute,"" but still couldn't excuse the mess that was the rest of the movie. I know they were strapped for time, but this movie seriously did nothing but tick me off. I remember people shaking their heads as they were leaving the theater because they thought the ending was so bad."
"ccamp89","4","3","4","2 November 2013"," Falls victim to the same missteps that have always plagued this series.
","I really wanted to like this movie. While the Harry Potter film franchise has never fully convinced me that it is capable of producing movies with any true lasting value, it has at least always spawned reasonably good films that, despite their missteps, are mostly enjoyable and entertaining on an initial viewing. However, the unbelievably excellent reviews for this movie really had me expecting something more this time. I was hoping to finally see a Harry Potter film that wasn't just serviceable and entertaining, but was truly a great film in terms of storytelling, pacing, craft, and execution. <br/><br/>Sadly, I feel the final Harry Potter film falls victim to the exact same missteps that have plagued the series throughout its production. Sure, there are a number of things that this film does very well. The special effects are absolutely through the roof, the atmosphere and camera-work are suitably dark and ominous, and there a few very emotionally potent scenes, such as Snape's death and the discovery that Harry makes about his past soon after. Yet the core elements necessary for the foundation of the film are simply lacking, almost absent in certain cases. The interplay between the characters, all of whom we are supposed to be emotionally invested in and cheering for, seems oddly muted. There is a distinct lack of emotional interplay between characters at times when these emotions seem like they should be at their greatest. The moment where Ron and Hermione realize that Harry has decided to sacrifice himself to Voldemort feels extremely underplayed. They barely even try to stop him and seem extremely ready and willing to make peace with the fact that their best friend of 7 years has decided he must die. Also, when Harry magically resurrects himself from the dead (still trying to figure that one out.. the way it is presented in the film is quite confusing), he doesn't receive the reception that you would assume he would. His companions respond almost as if they expected him to come back to life all long. <br/><br/>However, I feel the biggest and most damning issue with the film is the pacing and storytelling technique, especially in the latter portion after Harry is killed. The movie seems to speed hastily through the moments that require the most attention and should be the most emotionally resonant, while dwelling on and extending other scenes beyond their welcome. This absolutely kills the narrative drive of the movie, pulling you out of the action and lessening the scale and the potential emotional impact of the proceedings. The scene after Harry dies and where he meets Dumbledore is obviously a pivotal scene, but the length that it extends through coupled with its positioning squarely at the climax of the movie detracts from the flow and suspense. On the other hand, the scene that this entire decade's worth of movies has been building to where Harry and Voldemort finally clash is treated in an almost business-like fashion. The fight itself feels a bit hasty, but the real problem is that there is no emotional resolution after Voldemort is finally killed. None of the characters even mention or react to what has transpired. This is an absolutely unforgivable misstep because it undermines the entire event, as well as the 7 previous movies that have led to it. There is no emotional culmination and/or resolution with any of the characters after the evil they have been fighting for so long has finally been vanquished. Instead, we are led straight to the epilogue in less than 10 minutes with hardly a line of dialogue from anyone other than Harry, Ron, or Hermione, none of whom have anything to discuss except for details concerning the Elder Wand. The sense of accomplishment, gratification, resolution, or relief seems entirely absent.<br/><br/>At the end of the day though, this is not a horrible movie. It certainly has a number of entertaining scenes and, like the films that came before it, is mostly entertaining and relatively solid. However, it falls victim to the same narrative-driven problems that the other films suffer from and, in this case, the missteps are particularly unforgivable given that this film is the final installment and the one where emotional resonance and correct pacing is the most vital. For that reason, although it is probably one of the better films in the series, I can't give it more than 2 stars. Admittedly, it feels a tad low, but the flaws are simply too significant to be overlooked and they fatally wound what could've been a satisfying conclusion to a relatively solid franchise."
"hitmant92","6","3","4","22 February 2012"," The worst film adaptation of them all (a specific/subjective review for fans of the series but really does speak the truth)
","I don't even think its close to how poorly this ended off the series especially in its false interpretation of the book's sequences. I truly did enjoy the film for the first half till about three quarters in. In the theater you are of course excited, its part 2, its the end of it all and the film starts and progressively keeps its frightened but epic tone that it needs to build it into the battle that is inevitably coming. Acting is good and all, good cinematography as usual with interesting cameras and the great makeup as usual. But that part of the film is NOT what ended the final chapter of the era that is Harry Potter. The fact there is no dialogue nor anyone watching during the final battle between the 2 of them (not to mention, no ""expelliarmus"" to finish Him off) is just not right at all. There is no dramatic ending or any kind of serious film making being done in the final 2- 4 scenes. Its just quick shots of the three/Neville fighting off Nagini and Voldemort for a minute and then its just harry and him in a quick draw with no talking between them despite that being probably the most exciting time in the books history!!!! This is just unbelievably frustrating and disappointing to me as I watch DH2 for the 2nd and 3rd times. After watching and during watching this film I don't feel as a viewer at all that Harry is finally about to end it, finally going to literally save the world from the worst person to ever supposedly live. No drama built up, NO ANYTHING. All we get is harry, ron, and hermoine standing next to each other as if it was any old adventure they've been on, after a simple 5 second battle between harry and a mortal version of Voldemort. In my opinion as a Harry fan, JUST AWFUL:<br/><br/>2 MOST ESSENTIAL PARTS THESE MORONS MISSED<br/><br/>The final battle, with everyone watching at the very end as Harry schools him on how him and Dumbledore ultimately outsmarted him and had the advantage of Snape all along. In addition to the lackluster battle scenes amongst the death eaters and Harrys army. Molly Weasley comes in with a great victory but thats all we can get the entire time! I mean seriously, you can show quick shots of Harry looking at these people for a split second but cant show me a few quick battles as you realize its literally a war going on for Harrys defense.<br/><br/>The very end pre-epilogue! Harry just breaks the Elder wand (which Im sure was very confusing to those who only saw the movies, as no good, real explanation is given to its lineage) instead of returning like REAL HARRY WOULD HAVE to Dumbledores grave after showing off its real powerful talent after fixing his own original wand that he likes and wants more.<br/><br/>I don't see what is so hard about a heart felt, Harry Potter F**kin Did It, he is the humble hero we've spent years of our lives with, movie that this franchise deserved to end with."

","I have always been a huge fan of the books. The movies have always been good as well, although they have been in steady decline since the third. The story was good, and followed the books reasonably well. However, its production was over-dramatic, to the point where it was quite cheesy at times. I found myself laughing at parts that were meant to be taken seriously, as they were too drawn out and tried too hard to be gripping. I also felt some of the acting, particularly that by Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall), was quite horrible. A disappointing finish to the series.<br/><br/>4/10"

"dwhalen54","Null","3","4","3 September 2011"," Spoiler - David Yates Rushes
","My wife and I went to see the DH2 on her birthday. I was hopeful that David Yates would have broken his dismal track record with Harry Potter. My hopes were dashed early on when Mr. Ollivander talked about the Deathly Hallows instead of just the Elder Wand. It was also clear that Harry's Holly and Phoenix Feather wand was not going to reappear since Harry didn't ask Ollivander about fixing it. Of coursing blowing past Harry's birthday party and not allowing Hagrid to give Harry the mokeskin pouch in DH1 pretty much called that shot.<br/><br/>The story line, Voldemort ""feeling"" the loss of the horcruxes, represented a total lack of knowledge of book six where Dumbledore states that Voldemort's soul is too damaged and immersed in evil to be aware of this. Dumbledore guesses that at the point of death Voldemort might know but otherwise not so much. This is further highlighted in that when the ring horcrux a.k.a. the resurrection stone, is broken Voldemort isn't aware of this. He is also unaware of the breaking of Slytherin's locket. In fact, it's not until Voldemort is told of the break in at Gringotts that he kills everyone he can in his rage knowing that Harry is after horcruxes. He then keeps Nagini with him all the time and, in the book, begins to check the other horcruxes finding them gone. Yet he believes the one at Hogwarts is safe.<br/><br/>Snape's death was not as reflective of what Harry saw since he saw it from inside Voldemort's mind in the book. This allowed the horror of it, the total disregard Voldemort had for the life of a valued servant, to slip by though Snape's actual death scene was evocative. Unfortunately the death of Fred Weasley, Tonks, and Remus, seemed far more detached and quickly passed from the screen. Harry wanted to bury himself in someone else's memories and he had very little time and fewer answers in the screen version of ""The Prince's Memories"".<br/><br/>As has been said by others Hagrid showed no emotion over the loss of Harry. In fact, other than Ginny and Neville no one showed any emotion over the loss. By the way, it should have been just before daylight and there were only two giants both of whom should still be alive. Grawp fought for the good guys as did Buckbeak or should I say Witherwings and the Thestrals in the final battle along with the residents of Hogsmeade and family of the remaining students and even the house elves led by none other than Kreacher! That would have made a far more powerful end than people and snakes blowing up in smoke.<br/><br/>Molly came to rescue her daughter in a powerful way. Bellatrix attempted to laugh her off but quickly realized she couldn't. When Molly was victorious Bellatrix fell over and died. People cheered. Why can't David Yates show this kind of emotion. By this time Nagini was already dead. Killed in front of Voldemort, its head falling at Voldemort's feet.<br/><br/>If you wanted to show fear on the face of Voldemort follow J K Rowling's ending more closely. When Harry threw the shield charm to protect Molly and Voldemort looked to see who had done it and Harry came out from under the cloak the Great Hall exploded and then went completely still. In the movie Voldemort is forced off a tower by Harry and they somehow survive the fall crawl to their wands and fight until the snake is killed. Give me a break. Then when Harry kills Riddle, Riddle melts into nothingness so how do people know he's really dead? That was the problem with the first event; no body to bury.<br/><br/>To top that all off, no one, absolutely no one says good job Harry. Hagrid gives him a hug but that's as emotional as it gets. Then Mr. Yates has Harry break the Elder Wand. Now why didn't Dumbledore think of that? After all Dumbledore wanted to prevent Voldemort from getting the Elder Wand and here he thought he had to die undefeated. If he would have asked Mr. Yates he would have known to just break the darn thing.<br/><br/>The actors did a great job with what they were given. This was not a good end to a great series. It was an average end at best. I know I'm in the minority with this. I think David Yates was on a schedule and meant to keep it. I wish he would have invested a few more minutes into the movie and then he could have had a ten. Unfortunately it was too important to get to the end. The prologue even missed out on some of the touching emotion that could have been there. A movie, after all, is more than just about action.<br/><br/>Don Whalen"

"ayliff","5","3","4","27 July 2011"," Big let down
","I thought for the final film it was a huge let down. ( i haven't read the books so I'm just seeing it from film perspective) certain scenes that you would expect to see in the film weren't like deaths or certain main characters (Ron's brother) and the length of those scenes we did see were really short so had no emotion (e.g the death of snape, bellatrix)....the fight and the death of voldemort should have been much longer considering we have been waiting more than 8 years to see that happen. the battle scenes were short too and it jumped from calm to fighting really quickly...there was hardly any build up. And when harry goes to heaven or what ever that was...was just plain silly. The worst of all...Daniel Radcliffe was so wooden and boring to watch! I did like the bit where we saw Snapes memories that was well done. Think the film was more of a money maker than a film to signify the end of an era."
"Dandy_Desmond","Null","3","4","26 July 2011"," It all ends..... badly
","Harry Potter ends - so here it is the epic story reaches its conclusion and we have the complete set of films all finished. <br/><br/>Oh dear... Like the novels the movies were really building up to become something great and I write this in utter disbelief but the ending, the ending to end all endings is a huge HUGE disappointment. <br/><br/>I didn't think it would be possible to botch the end so much, I had my suspicions after the way the first part turned out but hats off to David Yates but he did it, he really messed it up big time. <br/><br/>First of all I hated part 1 but I was led to believe the first part was merely a build up to an all action emotion wrecking finale. I was wrong. <br/><br/>You may believe you are about to witness the long promised ""battle for hogwarts' involving all the characters you have grown to love over the past seven films. Wrong again. <br/><br/>In fact Neville apart you hardly see any other characters in it - you follow Harry alone, his thoughts, his decisions while the battle is happening elsewhere. Characters you have invested time in getting to know over the years die off screen with no emotional involvement, I wanted to follow Tonks, Lupin, George and Fred etc in the battle become tense as each of these are now fighting for their lives. ... I wanted to be devastated when these characters are taken away from us, I wanted to feel the vengeance that Mrs Weasley has when she kills Bellatrix <br/><br/>.....but no instead we have stone figures battling giants all because that looks better in 3d.<br/><br/>The only praise I will give is to Alan Rickman as Snape a real hero of the book reduced to a 5 minute run through of his thoughts that reveals the bravery and love snape locked inside himself. I would have liked to see this extended and cut out the stupid heaven scene. <br/><br/>I've never been so disappointed by an ending to a series, I cannot think what was going through David Yates mind when he decided to leave out most of the fighting and use lots of slow mo shots with strange music - urgh it was just awful. <br/><br/>The first six films were very entertaining but its all gone wrong at the final hurdle, what a huge shame, it could have been up there with the Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies as legend but thanks to the studios deciding to split the end into a 4 hour+ borefest and David Yates suddenly deciding to dismiss all of the other characters like Tonks and Lupin I will never be able to watch the Harry Potters anymore - there is no point as I just couldn't sit though the last 2 parts again."
"heatmser","6","3","4","24 July 2011"," Mediocre, at best
","I'd have to give every other Potter movie at least an 8.0 score, but I was really disappointed in the final film. It seemed like a whole lot of plot was smooshed into 2 hours, and some very important parts were left out or not detailed enough.<br/><br/>This was more of an action film than anything, where the others had suspense and drama.<br/><br/>It was also very lame how Voldemort died. The wand comes to Harry and suddenly Voldemort disintegrates. No epic battle between them....at most theist wands cast spells that counter each other...I expected a more dramatic ending in their fight.<br/><br/>The two things I liked about this movie was the twist where we found out that harry was actually one of the horcruxes Voldemort created, though by accident. I also liked how Nevil, who was rather soft wand weak in the earlier movies, suddenly matured into a man and took action rather than sit by passively and scared.<br/><br/>I would've liked to have seen Draco stay on harry's side at the end instead of going over, though reluctantly, to his parents side with Voldemort. And BTW, the director could've gone into more detail about what happened to some of the key players on Voldemorts side...like the Draco family.<br/><br/>What about Snape? He was totally dissed! He may have played the most important role in the outcome of the series fighting for Hogwarts but pretending to ally with Voldemort. So all he gets is a short scene, mostly covered by paper walls and silhouettes while Voldemort kills him?!?! At least they showed that he was actually a good guy with the tears that stored his memories<br/><br/>It was also lame that Harry breaks the most powerful wand in the world and just throws it off the bridge. Wouldn't it be best served in his possession to guard against future evil?<br/><br/>Also...why did they make the main characters seem like regular pedestrians in the final scene when they took their children to the train to Hogwarts? I would imagine Harry, Ron and Harmione could've played a role at Hogwarts....after all, the three of them combined to defeat Voldemort over the years. Harry was the chosen one who also taught the defense against the dark arts class in an earlier movie, and Harmione was often said to be the greatest witch of her time. Why make them ordinary?<br/><br/>I'm sorry that I can't score this higher. I was very disappointed in the movie. As i said earlier, the rest of the series was top-notch, but the final part was mediocre, at best. Giving it a 6 is rather lenient....it probably deserves a 5.<br/><br/>Don't let the ratings fool you. they are inflated by die-hard Harry Potter fans. had I known how average this film would be, I would have just waited for the video to come out. If you do see the movie in the theaters....and there is an IMAX theater around you, I would suggest watching it in 3D IMAX.....the sound and 3D effect made the movie more enjoyable in my opinion"
"marspeach","Null","3","4","23 July 2011"," Huge expectations not met
","I can't even describe in words how much I was looking forward to this movie! Deathly Hallows is my favorite Harry Potter book, and Deathly Hallows: Part 1 is my favorite Harry Potter movie. All of the trailers and featurettes and early reviews made the movie sound absolutely amazing. I try usually not to let hype get my expectations up too much, but in this case I couldn't help it. I was fully expecting the series to go out with a bang<br/><br/>Let's start with my general, spoiler-free opinion. Were my high expectations met? Sadlyno. It was a big let-down, actually. It didn't feel like part of DH 1. It was more similar in tone to the Half-Blood Prince movie to me for some reason. It was too short and just felt chopped up. Like HBP, it seemed like a lot more was filmed, but then it was hacked in the editing room. And then I read that this was exactly the caseAll of the actors, practically, from the previous films are back- for mostly blink-and-you'll-miss-it cameos. The battle was lackluster and anticlimactic. At points it felt rushed, at other points too slow. A lot of the dialogue was changed and didn't feel right. The relationships were handled awkwardly. This is just my purist side, but a lot was changed from the book. I didn't think it would be that way, after Part 1. It really let me down.<br/><br/>Was it a terrible movie? By no means. The acting was good, the special effects were great (though I wouldn't pay the extra money for the 3D), and some of the scenes did hit the mark. I know I bashed it pretty hard up there, but, really, the majority of my complaints are based only on the changes from the book. I'm judging it not really for the movie it was but for the movie it could have been, the movie I wanted it to be. The hype definitely ruined things for me. I feel like I would have liked it better if I hadn't read the books. But then again, my brother, who has only seen the movies, was also let down. He was disappointed by the lack of a bit epic battle scene that he was expecting there to be.<br/><br/>And now, to put in some spoilers:<br/><br/>My main complaint is that the film was too rushed. It was the shortest in the series, yet it didn't need to be. This was the ending, so I feel like they could and should have taken all the time possible to make it perfect. A lot of the key points and characters from the book are in there, but for a split second! Hardly anything made much of an emotional impact on me because it was just BANG, move on to another scene without any time to digest anything. The moments that moved me the most were The Prince's Tale and The Forest Again, because they were slower pace. Like a lot of Part 1, they gave the scenes time to breathe so I could actually digest what was happening.<br/><br/>I was so disappointed with the lack of the side characters. They were all brought back and there was all this build-up in the beginning leading the audience to believe that they would be featured in some epic battle scenes. But they weren't! We saw a couple cool shots of them getting ready for the battle and a couple seconds of them fighting, but that was it. Lupin and Tonks had one nice moment reaching their hands out to each other, but that was it before we see their dead bodies. We never learned about their son, so when Harry mentions it in The Forest Again, instead of being an emotional moment, it's just a head-scratcher. The same goes for Fred Weasley. The twins have a nice but waaay too brief scene on the roof and Fred's only line in the movie is ""yeah."" I was so mad we didn't get the wonderfully written, abrupt, and tragic death scene in the book- or at least have him featured in the movie a bit more! Lavender Brown is clearly brutally killed, but it's never mentioned again. Hagrid is mysteriously absent during the whole movie until he suddenly shows up as the Death Eaters' hostage in the forest. How did he get captured? What was he doing the whole time?<br/><br/>My next big complaint also has to do with battling- namely, the handling of the Molly/Bellatrix and Harry/Voldemort duels. Where were the audiences during these scenes? Molly vs. Bellatrix is over in a second with no one watching. The intensity of the book scene is totally absent because it's over in a split second and it wasn't treated as as big of a deal. Mrs. Weasley just smiles in satisfaction to herself afterward, which I felt was totally out of character. Harry and Voldemort's duel, on the other hand is terribly drawn out to be made more ""cinematic."" I didn't really care to see them falling over the side of the castle or the Dragonball Z-esque drawn-out shot of their spells colliding. And then Voldemort just disintegrates once Neville kills the snake? Okay, I get that all his horcruxes are gone, but he still actually has to be killed! I never saw the spell actually hit him. And once again, like Molly and Bellatrix, no one is watching. And afterward- where's the reaction from everyone? They're all just chilling in the Great Hall waaay too casually. No cheers and whoops or sobbing and laughter? It was too toned down.<br/><br/>Ah, my expectations were just way too high for this. The wonderful book and Part 1 just got my hopes up so much. Part 1 was so faithful and let the story breathe. This didn't have the same feel for me and of course I was let down."
"crt4291","Null","3","4","21 July 2011"," A majestic end, but not without some strange twists
","I gave the last Harry Potter movie an 8 because I wanted to like it. My initial gut feeling during the end of the movie was almost disbelief paired with mild disappointment. @ the moment I left the theater I probably would have given it only a 6 or so, simply because it didn't live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter books all came to life because of JK Rowling's wonderful language. The writing and the plots grew more and more into adult or young adult literature, with increasing maturity of character and plot. That takes nothing away from the great design that Rowling had from the first book to the last pages. Everything came together: clues from the Sorcerer's Stone found their solution or reunion with the events in the last book, and so on. It was as if each book was somehow addressed again in the last book and the final battle. Harry's first wand gets healed in the last scene; elves and hippocrypths come to his rescue in the last fight. It would be too much to expect to see all those things in the last film. But at least a few???<br/><br/>Why omit such wonderful scenes like Harry's welcome by Prof McGonogal after he curses the Caros brother, and she says: that was.. very gallant of you"". Why have the students march in military formation when it's plenty clear in the book how invasive the new school leadership under Snape has become. Why fabricate? Why reduce the final battle to mass engagement and special effects, when the story's real tension lies in the fact that Harry and Voldemort argue in front of the entire school. In the course of this, we finally all learn, and the students and teachers in particular, how everything fit together, how everything had been in motion since Harry's first encounter with Voldemort.<br/><br/>The final battle scene is much more than battle: it explains the intracacies of wand lore, horcruxes and protections against spells, protecting friends, the elder wand's powers and limitations and more.<br/><br/>Instead, we see Harry battle Voldemort in the ruined towers of Hogwarts with hardly anybody around!! The power of that last scene, in the book, lies in the fact that Voldemort does not dare use the elder wand against Harry for fear that Harry knows something he doesn't. And so he holds out until he realizes that all his plans have failed, no more horcruxes, just one last deadly spell. The movie has them exchanging spells like in the graveyard HP4, but the entire logic of Voldemorts demise lies in the fact that the Elder Wand will Not fight its rightful owner Harry. So why the cheap fighting scenes?<br/><br/>Why would Aberforth mention horcruxes when only very few people knew about them? Why cut short Harry's last moments when he decided to accept death and NOT talk to his friends, because they would have stopped him? The loneliness of that decision, the courage, and the sacrifice not to have that last emotional moment with Ginny or Hermione. Where was that?<br/><br/>In a summary, I would call it a good movie, but the plot lines where spotty to say the least, particularly for viewers who have not worked through the books. The acting was great, but many characters remained flat. Why find a different Aberforth than we saw in earlier movies? The teachers were barely in the story. Snape's emotional development was a pleasant surprise. The movie felt one dimensional, Harry, Hermione, a fairly flat Ron, that was that. No built up of Mrs Weasly really charging against Bellatrix. How come they weren't surprised to see Harry and his friends in Hogwarts? They hadn't seen our friends for about 7-8 months or so. No greetings, no hugging, no words. Why have Snape die in the boathouse when we all know it was the Shrieking Shack from HP3? Why cut the scene so short?<br/><br/>The retrieval of Snape's memories (tears not the usual brain wave of smoke?) and the pensieve scenes were lovely and slowed down to let the viewer enjoy it. Harry and Ravenclaw, ghostly beautiful, yes. Will continue this in a bit. A good movie, yes, but not the best one in this epic story."

","So sad that with the massive budget this movie must have had they chose to cut out some of the most important parts of this story and add other scenes that never existed.<br/><br/>The beginning of the movie was okay with the Gringotts scene, but changing the action after Harry's arrival at the castle was poor. A confusing tumult was added instead of the informative scene in the Ravenclaw common room. The film then redeemed itself with the battle scenes.<br/><br/>However, 8 years of being at Harry's side was wasted when the phenomenal scene of Voldemort's defeat in the book was changed. He explodes in to confetti (why?) in front of no one! And no where did Harry explain that because he Harry had died for everyone he had placed a protective charm on everyone in the battle. This was pretty much the basic message of the book was it not? That being selfless and brave against evil is rewarding in the end? No use of the name Tom Riddle in the end, no explanation to Voldemort about the Elder wand, and why the scene in the Chamber of Secrets? A devastating disappointment to those of us who cheered for Harry each time he had to roll with the punches. Voldemort died not realizing all the mistakes he had made. This movie turned out to be a major discredit to the books. And why was Hagrid randomly tied up in the forest as the first time we see him in the whole film.<br/><br/>Poor JK Rowling. Your masterpiece ruined by someone who had to put his own mark on it."

","This was perhaps the best of all the Harry Potter Movies. Although I think they rushed through the Gringgots story line and the main battle with Voldermort should have followed the book closer, there were many scenes not in the book which I felt made up for this. For example Longbottom and Finigan blowing up the bridge, or the simple five words added to Snapes death, ""You have your mothers eyes."" <br/><br/>The main problem with The deathly Hallows was not the movie itself but rather all the critical parts Yates neglected in the previous books, which ultimately limited the emotional scope of both Parts 1 and two. For example...<br/><br/>If you read the book you cried when Dobby died, if you did not then you were probably a bit curious as to why Harry was so torn up over the death of a House Elf which he hadn't seen in over five years and caused him more pain than aided and Ron and Hermione only met in the kitchen of number 12 for ten minutes. But those of us who read the books know that Dobby was so much more to all of them.<br/><br/>How did you feel when Remus and Tonks lay dead on the floor of the great hall? Odds are if you didn't close your eyes and sigh than you never knew how their relationship developed, how Remus battled himself and whats this Harry says about a baby after using the Resurrection Stone? <br/><br/>Would you have been as indifferent at Moody's death if you knew how he threatened the Dursley's on Harry's behalf?<br/><br/>How much better would it have been if Percy had been there to reconcile with his family only hours before crouching over his younger brothers body? How many who have not read the book recall the pompous older brother shown only a handful of times in past movies? <br/><br/>I know the books will always be better than the movies, for time and budget reasons, but when I look at books 4-6 and how little their movies cover, they seem like Yates merely skimmed through the books and worked from a memory of it. <br/><br/>I also know this seems more like an attack on the past movies than a review on Part 7, and I guess to some degree it is. But all that being said this was THE BEST Harry Potter Movie yet and I am very sorry to see the Era end. <br/><br/>Unlike so many I did not grow up with Harry Potter, I was already an Adult by the time I was dragged by my Ex to go and see Part three in the theaters. As soon as I got home tho I opened Book one and read all three and have been hooked ever since. <br/><br/>I will miss reading new books on Harry Potter, I will also miss getting angry at how much was left out of the movies and thrilled at some of the creative additions. Thank you J.K Rowling for such an incredible story, thank you Yates for bringing it to life (even if I hated you at times) and thank you Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint for sharing your childhood with us, to make Harry potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley possible."

","Harry Potter has touched many lives, and has been an inspiration for millions and millions of fans around the world. As such, the last movie of the series was expected to be a titanic experience, full of action, full of that feel we've had during the past 7 Harry Potter movies (most particularly in Prisoner of Azkaban), but most important, it had to remain, in Yates' words, ""fiercely loyal to the book"". <br/><br/>What we had, however, was a movie that was barely above what we can consider ""good"". <br/><br/>Why, you ask? For quite a number of reasons: For one, Deathly Hallows Part 1 was the best movie of the saga, because it did its book justice for the first time in the series and, logically, we had such high hopes for Part 2. However, its ""book loyalty"" was only 100% accurate and evident during a handful of scenes (Snape's memories and the Room of Hidden Things), unlike its predecesor, which was almost 100% loyal to the book in almost 100% of the movie. <br/><br/>For two, we barely had anything more than the infamous Battle of Hogwarts than some aerial scenes, and what we could watch when the trio ran by the fight, and that is NOT how you build an epic fight, Mr. Yates. <br/><br/>For three, the only dramatic and/or tragic deaths we see are Snape's, Harry's and Voldemort's, and barely a photoshoot of Fred's, Remus' and Tonks' bodies. <br/><br/>And last, and most important: The beauty of the book lays in the DIALOGUE, Mr. Kloves, and I think you did an astonishingly mediocre job with it. I understand it's *based* on the books, but seriously... You did a much, much, much, much, much better job on Part 1... What happened this time? Why did you decide to skip 3 seconds of dialogue on each character? Why did Harry have to remain silent at the end, instead of saying ""The wand's more trouble than it's worth, and quite frankly, I've had enough trouble for a lifetime? Why didn't Ron get to say ""Well, on the upside we got the horcrux, on the downside no sword""? <br/><br/>Seriously. We expected MUCH more from this movie, but what's done is done, and there are no more chances. Sad."

","Many other reviewers have listed all the differences between book and movie and I'm happy that it wasn't only me who saw them. There are just so MANY of them, it's unbelievable that Rowling herself approves of it. (Where was Dumbledores and Grindelwalds backstory? Why did they change Snapes character even more? And so on and on)<br/><br/>But even if you haven't read the books, you can find enough logical mistakes in the film itself to spoil everything. Here are just a few examples: <br/><br/>Snapes memories: Not only that they invented some new version of his life, but they also show scenes from Prisoner of Azkaban with Wormtail. During that time, Snape was unconscious! They could never ever been in his own memories! <br/><br/>Teddy Lupin: Every reader was waiting for the sensational news that Remus and Nymphadora got a son and when he was finally mentioned, it was so totally out of context, that everybody who didn't knew the books must have thought: Wait what? Since when does he have a son? One short line of information before would have been enough, but it seems that the time wasn't enough even for that! <br/><br/>Eye Colors: Really, it's okay for me, if Harry has blue eyes and not green. It was good that the older Lily had blue eyes, too, because he has his mothers eyes! But it was a blunder to have a young Lily with brown eyes! You can tell that they changed young Snapes eyes to black, to match it, what was so difficult to do the same with hers? That's just pure illogicality. <br/><br/>Voldemort hugging Draco Malfoy: That was just odd and totally out of character, even for the movies. <br/><br/>The Death of Voldemort and Bellatrix: That was the same. What were they thinking?<br/><br/>Sepcial effects were nice, but they would more enjoyable without all the previous mistakes and when all makes more sense. And they could have been a bit more outstanding during the wizard fights. They were in previous films, why not in the final one? Most of the acting was good, some was brilliant and some other was weak. Even the epilogue wasn't nearly as good as I had imagined it.<br/><br/>I was disappointed in nearly everything! What a waste of money, time and talent."
"grantss","3","4","6","26 January 2014"," Good riddance.
","The series ends, at last. Good riddance. (Until JK Rowling needs money, I guess).<br/><br/>The first Harry Potter was interesting, and good fun. Much of this was due to the novelty of it all. The first Harry Potter introduced us to the characters and concepts of the series.<br/><br/>The second used that template and provides another plot. The plot was fairly mundane and overwrought. At nearly three hours it was ridiculously long for a linear plot-driven kid's adventure story.<br/><br/>This is all said, there was a momentum that kept it going. There were some new concepts and characters. All this was enough to make it marginally likable.<br/><br/>By the third, however, it was a tired formula. From then on it was all about gouging more money from kids and nerds.<br/><br/>Rating for this last one should be lower, but it gets a bonus point for finally ending this seemingly-never-ending, sequels-for-the-sake-of-more-money series."

","In the past I have seen many awful films like last years After Earth and Iron Man 3 but this is the worst by many miles. It is so bad that I am hating writing this review.<br/><br/>So where to start. First lets talk about how very boring this film is. Most of this film is about how Harry Potter is tracking down items to stop Voldemort which ends up not working as he nearly dies once meeting him. Also there is less action scenes than After Earth and Iron Man 3 combined.<br/><br/>Next this film is 2 hours long and should have been half an hour less and I might have enjoyed this film. This is the first film that I was tempted to stop watching it and turn over to the BBC1 and watch Sherlock which would have been 1000 times better than this.<br/><br/>But the worst thing about this film is the ending. With it being the final film in the series I thought Voldemort would die in a big explosion but no he dies getting hit by Harrys wand which is disappointing. Also Helena Bonham's character dies in the same way. Plus after all the fighting we see Harrys and his wife's (This film was so boring I can't even remember her name)kids and Hermonies and Ron's kids go to Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Altogether this is one of the worst films ever made."
"jibalis","10","4","6","3 January 2013"," ""Come on Tom, let's finish this the way we started, together.""
","This movie was very special for me. Nine years ago I saw first Harry Potter movie. I loved it and in few next months read all books available at the moment. It was the first book franchise, I read and tough, it was never my favorite, it always had a very special place in my mind. And now nine years later, after I've read all the books and seen all previous movies, it was time to finish this. Movie started very good. It started just, where the first part ended. Soundtrack, that played in the beginning, was awesome and from the very beginning gave an epic feel to movie.<br/><br/>Storyline was not made by this movie's makers, but by Rowling, so I can't really judge it. I can judge only the way it was told. And that seemed very good to me. Nothing seemed forced or rushed, or going too slow. Movie was moving at a very good pace. Special effects were also good. Loved Daniel's, Rupert's and Emma's performance. Evanna Lynch (Luna) and Mathew Lewis (Neville) did an outstanding job in this movie. I thought they should've given Evanna more screen time, but I had the same thought after watching every movie she was in...<br/><br/>It's been a real while, since I read Deathly Hallows, and I read it only once, so I didn't remember much and couldn't judge any inaccuracies. Though, even if I could, I wouldn't, because, I think, movie doesn't have to go just the same way as books.<br/><br/>I really loved part, where Snape died and showed Harry his memories. For me, It was the best and most touching part in the whole movie. Battle for Hogwart's was also pretty good, tough I think they could've shown us more from it. <br/><br/>Now about things I didn't like. Nothing much to tell really. Special effects in scene, where Voldemort and Harry were jumping/flying (not sure) of the tower, seemed pretty lame. And that's pretty much all. If we wan't to be really picky, then I thought Molly's Weasly's expression after killing Bellatrix was quite strange. And no Fred's, Remus's and Tonks's death scene. So, in the end I loved this movie and enjoyed it very much. I give it 10/10, mostly because it's the last movie and it was very satisfying."
"khono","4","4","6","3 August 2011"," J. K. Rowling is a masterful storyteller. The makers of this movie are not.
","The movie only passingly reflected the second half of the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Corners were cut and a masterpiece of a book was turned into a misshapen and expensive failure. Oh, it may be a financial success, but because of what remains of the magic and greatness of the book.<br/><br/>In the book it was lies, hate, and abuse that separated one side from the other. Harry Potter's side was one of inclusion, of giving people choice and showing mercy. In the movie, both sides are vicious and stupid. The beautiful details and realism found in the fantasy of the book was cheapened and abbreviated in the movie. Where as the earliest movies also abbreviated from the book, as essentially all movies will, it was done in such a way that the true magic grown in the reading of the books could still be found in the movies.<br/><br/>I came into this movie with high hopes. I saw the high rating and I knew the last book really picked up in the second half. The makers of the movie had more time with which to delve into the details since they'd split the single book into two movies. Yet scene after scene in which I wanted to see and hear the mystery and beauty I imagined while reading the book, each scene was ultimately unsatisfying, unfaithful, and mediocre."

I wanted to hear more about Dumbledore's life and it would've been good to see Percy make up with his family. Even though it wasn't a big story in the films anyway. I didn't really like when people got killed they burst into confetti (taken from X-Men Last Stand, I think.) No doubt it won't end there though, they will probably create a film based on Rita Skeeter's book and another film about Voldemort (as they didn't use all the material from The Half-Blood Prince book.)<br/><br/>But all in all a good film, the acting has improved tenfold and the special effects were amazing.<br/><br/>I will leave you with one word for all people who will not stop complaining: ""ADAPTATION!"""

The battle feels rushed and you can't see any of the action :(<br/><br/>The story explains how Harry survived Voldemorts killing curse. The explanation flawed and shows how the story could pretty much end from the beginning (which would've ended this horrible story).<br/><br/>The story feels like an RPG finding 7 objects to defeat the bad guy and to be honest I wanted Voldemort to triumph instead of seeing a sickly sweet epilogue showing that J.K Rowling can make another saga at Hogwarts if she wanted to make more money.<br/><br/>All in all the end is a fail, for this to be considered good is poor stupidity and biased views.

And the climax that was book number 7. Never in my wildest dreams did I think that the book would be so good, but it was and is one my favorites.<br/><br/>It almost got tarnished and burned with the death mark because of the eight film. Why is that movie so poor? Because the production team had in its mainstream view's and perhaps laziness given themselves no time to get a feel for the book and the wizarding world the author created. Scenes and venues changed, the proper way something happened was changed and often utterly deformed from its original setting. I will lose your attention by starting to talk about ""that did not happened like this in the book"" so I will end my bad review shortly.<br/><br/>Do not watch this movie.

This key factor makes a movie IMPREVISIBLE, and that, my friend, did not happen at Harry Potter And the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.<br/><br/>But, first, let me talk about the soundtrack. It was just poor. If you go back to the other Harry Potter movies, you'll see a completely different story. Beautiful choirs singing (remember Double Trouble? Look it up on YouTube) were not seen in this movie. But, a choir singing like that wouldn't of course, appear on every single movie, until the last one. But AT LEAST something, come on?

","I was very unsatisfied when I left the theater. I felt like the creative team behind the movie gave up! I did enjoy this, but I also got board.<br/><br/>Here are ten reasons why;<br/><br/>1. The 3-D was a waste.+ Can't they make freaking lens free 3-D glasses!!?<br/><br/>2. There weren't enough fantasy creatures, and unique special effects that made the first couple movies feel as if you were in a unique world!! HP 7 felt old and boring. There was no environmental depth and this ties into the movie being ""setty"" (see 2nd to last point).<br/><br/>3. CHEAP. I was expecting big fight scenes not a average two man brawl. There were better fights on the last couple of movies. There wasn't enough blood and bruises (for a finale) and when many characters got hurt or died you didn't see anything! <br/><br/>4. The opening scene was like watching a really bad reality show where there were abundant pauses and script stumble and lots of awkward silence. Also after 7 movies I'm sorry I need to be refreshed. I can't remember everything!<br/><br/>5. PLOT HOLES! One that bothered me the most was in the first scene, Luna was present, later on she just seem to end up at a place Harry didn't know about. Why wouldn't she just tell him she was going there? If the world was ending and you and your friend split up wouldn't you tell them where you were going? He acted like he was surprised. I thought maybe she was evil an hiding it. <br/><br/>6. No Dobby. No Rubeus spotlight. These two characters are some of the best and neither of them made great appearances here. It's sad. A finale should have all the elements of the last couple movies combined. It would have been awesome to see Rubeus fight more! And to make it worst he has a lackluster scene with Harry that just plain sucked. There was no joy. It was boring. <br/><br/>As far Dobby, I feel like they are saving him for the nest series and I felt like it was a money issue...in that they needed a reason for me to watch the next series (though maybe this was from the book for if they make another Harry).<br/><br/>7. The ending!!! Good luck getting over the 30 year old Harry Potter and Hermione! I can't believe they didn't save that for the blu-ray extras! I felt like this was a SCAM and that they were just trying to set up the next Harry Potter franchise! Yuck. Great way to ruin a movie! <br/><br/>8. The dragon!!! Come on it's an awesome dragon! This is fantasy land! Do more with the dragon! Hey how about some 3-D flying angles?!??!! Instead he's chained up and BOOORRRRRING. Maybe they were following the book. I don't know.<br/><br/>9. Next this was ""setty"". FELT LIKE I WAS WATCHING THEM ON A SET. During one scene all these people are around watching a fight go down than the next thing you know characters run away and go fight in there own little rooms. A big scene get's set up than Harry and He Who Must Not Be Named literally walk away and fight in the same old cheesy castle. <br/><br/>10. The kissing scenes (if you want to call them that) sucked!<br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>With just a couple tweaks, this GOOD movie could have been GREAT!<br/><br/>*Also it seems to me, after reviewing movies for awhile now that a lot of Critics are afraid to review something so popular so poor due to the fact that soccer moms, and easy goers may start to dislike them and stop reading their reviews. There's no way on God's green earth this movie is as good as they say! Harry Potter 7 reminds me of M. Night's Last couple of films!!"

If you have bothered with the last movies then you find yourself wanting to just get to the end. Its hard to pick 1 particular scene out but to me it didn't flow well and the script was very wish wash. I could give examples but I don't want to give anything away to those who have not seen the movie. I never found myself once feeling sad that it was the final movie.

","Well, this is it. After fourteen years, we have reached the end of the Harry Potter saga both in print and on film. Like them or hate them, the movies were undoubtedly an entertaining experience to look forward to, and while I always preferred the books to them, I found myself feeling incredibly sad and moved as I left the theatre tonight. The end of an era, indeed.<br/><br/>This is by no means a bad movie, but it sadly fails to deliver as much as the first part did (which, in my opinion, was easily the best Harry Potter movie). The two installments are vastly different; it has been said that the first is a road movie and the second an action movie and the direction reflects that all too well. In fact, at times I felt I was watching a film by a different director. The change wasn't unwelcome, but a little eerie nonetheless. This is the end, and the director wants us to feel this to the very core, from the missing trademark opening theme, down to the feel of this film.<br/><br/>As with all adaptations, certain things have been changed for the transition to the big screen. Whether you enjoy them or not falls under personal preference, but the majority were welcome to me. The trailer makes this perfectly clear, so it shouldn't fall under the spoiler section, but the most noticeable change was inflicted on the very final battle. There is no crowd watching in this time, only Harry and Voldemort, both driven to the edge. The fight feels more personal. Yes, the other characters make it abundantly clear that by the end of the story everyone's lives have been affected by this war, but the burden still falls on Harry's shoulders; everyone else can only pave the way.<br/><br/>I won't waste time waxing rhapsodic about the film's special effects. The battle of Hogwarts is an absolute thrill to watch, though I never once doubted the well-trained Hollywood crew would fails us on that aspect.<br/><br/>Everyone gets their moment of glory in this film, be it as a character or as an actor. I had expected that Alan Rickman would steal the show this time around, and brilliant though he is, this is Daniel Radcliffe's movie through and through. Our little trio has grown up, and along with their blossoming into adults, we have witnessed them become better actors. Both Emma and Rupert do a fine job indeed --the latter thankfully not a mere comic relief- but it's Dan who truly shines. He has never embodied his role as much as he does here. The much-awaited forest scene is his crowning moment, where his performance had everyone in my vicinity in tears (or in the verge).<br/><br/>For specific nitpicks and personal favorite moments (including spoilers), move on to the lists below. If you're interested in my conclusion, skip to the last paragraph.<br/><br/>The Good: <br/><br/><ul><li>The opening scene </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The whole Gringott's scene. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Battle of Hogwarts as a visual spectacle </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The many shout-outs to the previous movies. From props to creatures and even a past running gag (Seamus blowing everything up), the creators of the film paid homage to the journey that led up to this, like a personal wink to the viewer. Very nice touch. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The way Harry makes his presence known when in Hogwarts, signaling the start of the battle. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The Prince's Tale. Understandably missing a few memories, but the way they blend into one another, and the way certain scenes seem to crop up to help the viewer place the later events during the movies made for a beautiful and touching montage. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The final battle</li></ul><br/><br/>The Bad: <br/><br/><ul><li>Voldemort's laughter when Harry's body is brought back from the forest. Never been a fan of Fiennes in this part (good actor overall, but he overacts in these films) and the laughter was just plain awkward. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Neville's 'rousing' speech. Corny to the max and badly written. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The many, awkward attempts for humor when it was not needed. The film has a very precarious balance here. Some one-liners are very well-timed and placed (Ron's line when the trio returns to Hogwarts comes to mind), but many will most likely induce more groans than chuckles. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Dumbledore's entire backstory gone. Wasn't expecting a detailed analysis like in the book, but they could've made time for a little more. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The off-screen deaths of important characters. Really hoping they end up on the director's cut or even as deleted scenes on the Blu-Ray. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Voldemort and Bellatrix literally disintegrating. What? Why? </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The epilogue. I like that it focused on the most important part (AKA Harry's private word with one of his sons), but I always thought the essence of the epilogue lies in Harry's final thoughts as the train leaves King's Cross. Thinking of past horrors, he rubs his scar absently as Ginny tries to reassure him that everything will be fine. This wasn't really touched upon here.</li></ul><br/><br/>Overall, the end, like the saga as a whole, was a bittersweet affair. As a film it has its faults and is certainly not a movie the non-book fans will easily follow, but it's the end, and it's thrilling, it's entertaining, a non-stop ride chock full of blood, sweat and tears.<br/><br/>All is mostly well."
"StijnDCK","7","6","11","14 July 2011"," It felt, disappointing..
","I saw the movie yesterday, and decided to go see it without any expectations. Otherwise, it usually ends up being worse then you expected. All I can say is, I thought it would be better...<br/><br/>Let me start by saying that I enjoyed part 1 a lot. It had everything I hoped for in a Harry Potter movie: the magic, the music, the acting and most of all; the loyalty to the book. I assumed that they would carry on the same as they did on part 1.<br/><br/>The opening of the movie is good, but after that it starts to bother me. The storytelling becomes a bit messy, and the beautiful cinematography of part 1 disappeared before my eyes. The editing is also a bit awkward.. it feels unfinished. The music is good, but most of it comes from deathly hallows part 1. <br/><br/>What I can say, most of all, is that this movie had one beautiful moment. WARNING SPOILER* The scene where Harry goes into the pensieve to see the Prince's Tale. That was beautiful put together, and it was wise to use Dumbledore's Farewell on this scene. <br/><br/>The acting was good, everybody stays very true to its character. <br/><br/>WARNING SPOILER* The ""final battle"" isn't really a battle, we see some people fighting, but that's it. It seems epic, but it isn't. <br/><br/>A few good scenes can't make this movie.. I'm going to see it a second time, I hope my perspective will change."
"Insaneuno","7","8","16","15 July 2011"," Great movie but it didn't follow the book well
","Had I not read the book I probably would have loved this movie. In the beginning it follows the book well even if the pacing is kind of uneven. However, when the battle begins it starts to slowly stop using what was already well written in the book. The part that really got me upset was after Harry died. 1. He doesn't hide under the invisibility cloak and reappear later. 2. They drag out the snake killing, but thankfully Neville still kills it in the end. 3. Voldemort and Harry do not get the epic showdown in the Great Hall. Instead they fight everywhere and the Elder Wand explanation is dragged out. All in all the movie was very disappointing because of how much of the end they replaced. It's like they took the major plot points and threw the book out the window."
"evan_harvey","3","5","9","22 July 2011"," Okay, but disappointing
","After the dull abyss that was The Deathly Hallows Part 1, I didn't think that Part 2 would really be much better. And it really wasn't. I have no idea how it got an 8.5 rating.<br/><br/>I have enjoyed the Harry Potter films, although I have never read the Books. However, I have found the films to be poorly written. The scriptwriters seems to eschew actual narrative and instead just drop scenes in here and there.<br/><br/>*HERE BE SPOILERS* Firstly, the plot holes. So the elder wand is this awesome powerful device. Except it doesn't really do much at all. Well, okay. Maybe ""powerful"" is a metaphor for something else. And the wand apparently serves Harry, not Voldemort, although that really doesn't make any functional difference at all. Poor writing. The Order of the Pheonix is destroyed, apparently. I'm not sure when that happened, exactly, since they never bothered to show that to the audience, and all the members are still alive til the end. Part 1 ended with no cliffhanger, and the whole subplot of the Deathly Hallows was largely irrelevant. The elder wand was pointless. The resurrection stone didn't make any sense. The invisibility cloak didn't even show up as far as I can recall.<br/><br/>The end result is that it's okay. The acting is the same as all the others, the special effects the same and so forth. Thankfully they kept the same actors throughout the series. The real problem is that the filmmakers never bothered to build a strong narrative. It's fast paced, but shallow.<br/><br/>My guess is that they tried to save all the interesting parts til Part 2. However, the functional result is that Part 1 sucked and sucked and they spent an hour in a tent doing nothing, and Part 2 had too much to cover to make a powerful narrative. What should have happened is a more even spacing of events.<br/><br/>6 out of 10."

"samratrc1417","10","12","28","12 July 2011"," Very true to the book!! Excellent Finale!!
","It was a very fitting finale for a saga that has endeared us to these three kids turned young adults. We literally watched the troika grow in front of our eyes, sharing their trials and tribulations, their joys and sorrows, their success and failure in equal measure. We now see them carry out the grand responsibilities entrusted on them and bring them to its logical conclusion. They suffer great losses while achieving it but they did manage to rid the wizarding world of its greatest scourge and in turn save us muggles (he-who-must-not-be-named had threatened to rid the world of muggles) as well.<br/><br/>Shot at great locales and powered by tour de force performances by our young thespians, aided by outstanding CGI effects the saga ends leaving an empty hollow in our chests. Whilst enjoying the cinematic journey in the theatre I was also overpowered by the sense of loss brought on by the realization that we wont be watching another one of these in the theatre again. I don't have any more to add as most of us know the books and so as a result knew what we were about to see. I had only one problem with this movie. There were some famous faces only seen in one or two scenes (Emma Thompson for instance). I wish they were given more screen time. All in all a great movie. Please go and watch it. Its a pity none of the HP films managed to gross over a billion. Some very pathetic ones did. Hope this one manages it aided by YOU."

","The Gringotts Dragon....are you kidding me? I could see the combination of plastic and paper maché from the back row. And the storyline was not followed in the most crucial part of the saga, the ending. Do we really need that many scenes of Ron and Hermoine, and Harry and Ginnie, getting all mushy like every ten to fifteen minutes? And Daniel Radcliff needs to stop trying to be a hero, you are and will always be a lame, end of discussion. I hope someone remakes the seven (I can't call them movies) pieces of trash who actually can stick to the story line with a set of real actors. Don't call me a harry potter hater because I love the books, for those who haven't read the books , this ""trash"" makes the book out to be not worth reading, while to those who did read the books, this ""trash"" makes it a disgusting portrayal of what did not even happen in the books. GAME OVER."
"mrfrodogetdown","10","9","20","13 July 2011"," Perfect ending for a movie saga that changed many of us
","After seeing the extremely good Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 in theatres last year, I started immediately waiting for the final movie. I have grown with the Potter books and movies; I was 11 when the first movie had it's premiere, and now I'm 21. So in a way, I am one of those lucky people who have actually grown up to adulthood with Harry.<br/><br/>As the first part was so great, it created very high expectations for this movie. But seeing the trailers, the movie looked very, very good.<br/><br/>I live in Finland, so I was lucky to see this movie last night, as it premiered here in Finland 13th of July. The movie started at 12.07 am, and it continued directly from were the part 1 had ended. It actually seemed, that the movie was skipping way too much stuff from the book. But of course, this wasn't anything to worry about, because most of the last book was already seen on the part 1, leaving only about 200-300 pages from the book to the last movie. So, as told, the movie started fast. Very soon it was the time to rob the Gringotts. The scene was very good, especially the dragon riding. This scene also proved, that the worry abut how the 3D would look was unnecessary. The 3D looked awesome, and this was a big surprise, as this film wasn't filmed in 3D, but converted to it later. The cinematography was beautiful throughout the whole movie. I paid a lot of attention to it as I study it myself.<br/><br/>And then it came the time for Harry to return Hogwarts. I must say, that the last battle was more than unbelievable. It was really something that we haven't seen yet in movies. It really was magic. The visual effects were astounding. And all the feeling of things to end in the book was shown very well in the movie. I must say that it was more than once or twice when I cried. The moment that many were of course waiting, was the death of Snape. In the book, it is very emotional. In the movie, it was emotional too, but the makers hadn't done it so that it would have made me cry - they kinda ruined Snape's death as they did to Dumbledore. But thank god, Snape's memories were all shown very well, and it made me really happy. And about deaths, they didn't actually show Fred's death, which was a shame too. Instead, we got to see some scenes that weren't told in the book so well - one of these scenes was Ron's and Hermione's visit to the Chamber of Secrets, which worked actually very well. It was funny too. And that reminds me of the humor the movie had. There were lots of it, and I was surprised how well it actually worked. In the moments of despair, there were lots of funny moments - Voldemort made me laugh more than once, as did McGonagall.<br/><br/>At last it was the time for Harry to meet Voldemort. The moment we had waited for the whole movie, and the whole movie saga. The Dark Forest scene was as in the book, and so was the moment with Harry and Dumbledore - which was great scene actually. It was bad choice from the director to show the final duel in different place than the book. As it is in the trailer already, the final moments of the battle are outside of the castle without people watching it, and not in the Great Hall with hundreds of witches and wizards looking at the duel. In the book, the duel is more like a moment when all time stops, there are only Harry and Voldemort. But in the movie, that feeling wasn't shown so well. The death of Voldemort was also a bit different than in the movie - I'm not yet sure if I liked it or not. There were no cheering people around Harry, next thing we saw was Harry walking peacefully in the Great Hall.<br/><br/>The ending was very similar to the book, even though Harry, Ron and Hermione didn't visit Dumbledore's painting at principal's office. 19 years later scene was as dull as it was in the book, it was actually pretty comical. And then the movie ended. It actually ended. I couldn't believe it. It was a strange moment. I watched the credits, and thought about how long time it was that I had lived with Harry. Ten years. And nothing new to read or to see anymore. Nothing new to wait from the world of Harry Potter. It made me happy and sad.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter saga had an ending that really was worth it."
"mccormick632","6","6","12","16 July 2011"," It's finally over, and I couldn't be happier!
","Up until this point the Harry Potter franchise has been a series of mediocre film after mediocre film, with a vast majority of them being just plain awful. Part I was one of the worst films I ever saw in my life, it was dull, long, and incredibly stupid. I could not have been less excited about this film even if it had been hailed as the best movie of all time. Yet, nevertheless, I dished out the $18.50 for Imax and 3D to see this film with some friends. Does this film transcend the c*** of the other films? Or does this final installment sink lower than Part I did? <br/><br/>(One viewing later...)<br/><br/>Wow...I mean, wow, that has got to be one of the most unintentionally hilarious films I have ever seen. I mean I laughed out loud while watching this s***. On the topic of whether or not it was good, I would say it was average. It's not as god-awful as Part I was but its not as good as Azkaban. The film is just bland, that is really all I can say. Hows the action? Occasionally exciting but otherwise its just okay. Hows the actual comedy? Not funny. How's the plot? God Awful! I cannot believe just how stupid this film is! It is so full of plot holes and things that just don't make any sense. When characters get injured I just feel nothing for them. When the film attempts to be humorous, I cringe. When the film ended, I proudly stood up, and left quickly.<br/><br/>As many of you know, this film has the ""climactic"" fight at Hogwarts between Harry and his friends against Voldemort and his allies. The actual battle at Hogwarts is by far the best part but it takes up 80% of the damn film! Within 20 minutes already the battle started. There was no buildup, nothing to foreshadow the fight, it just happens. Action scenes are epic and exciting when there is some actual dread to them, like the Battle of Helms Deep in Lord of the Rings. Had the battle started later, maybe like 45 minutes in instead of 20, then things would be better, but it starts early, goes on for too long, loses its intensity, and when it ends, the movie basically ends because there is nothing worth watching afterwords.<br/><br/>There are just too many things wrong with this film to nail down in this one review, but trust me when I saw the following...there is no point in seeing this in 3D, the plot sucks, the action is exciting at first then dull, the characters still suck, the ending sucks, it's unintentionally hilarious, and Harry Potter as a franchise is just not good.<br/><br/>And so, this is how it all ends. With a awful plot and insipid characters, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II is a bland, occasionally exciting film that just has the problem of being bogged down because it's Harry Potter. If you really want to watch this film, wait till it's released on DVD/Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>Good bye Harry Potter, you sucked in the beginning, and you are only slightly better at the end. This isn't the worst film in the franchise, but it is just too average to really be ""epic,"" as others have deemed it. There really is no harm in seeing this film because it really isn't all THAT bad. What is good is really, really good, what is bad, however, is also really, really bad. Hardcore Potter fans will love it, the rest of us, should just wait it out."
"atlihafsteinsson","5","4","7","15 April 2012"," As a Movie, It's Spectacular - As a Closure to the Story, It's Horrendous
","I left the screening of Deathly Hallows Part 2 in a jubilant mood. As far as I was concerned, it was a satisfying, thrilling conclusion to a long-running series that captivated us all. When I watched it again, however, and subjected it to further scrutiny, there are several ways in which Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a very poor conclusion to Harry Potter's story arc.<br/><br/>The good first. The film looks fantastic, that's for sure. The dragon in the Gringotts scene is nothing short of spectacular. The sight of a Hogwarts under fire is breathtaking. The scenes in the Room of Requirement and with the Grey Lady are memorable and linger with the audience. The performances by the actors are top-notch. Our three leads all deliver solid performances that do their characters justice. Matthew Lewis and Evana Lynch deserve mention as well, playing Neville Longbottom and Luna Lovegood respectively. It is indeed scandalous that given their vital roles in this film, theirs are names only included in the final cast. Same goes for Emma Thompson, who admittedly has a small role but still, the two-time Academy Award winning actress really needs a better agent if she is not top billing. Most impressive, perhaps, is Alan Rickman. His flashback scene to discovering Lily is heart-rending; an excellent performance.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, what pulls the movie apart is its really quite fetishistic attitude of ""look how many special effects we can do"", often at the cost of the story. The final battle between Harry and Voldemort is a particular offender in that; to anyone who has read the books, it is a ridiculously over-the-top sequence (with really corny dialogue, might I add: ""Let's finish this the way we started - TOGETHER!"" Oh please). Voldemort and Bellatrix meet their demise in ways that have no relation to anything that preceded them. Neither does Snape giving Harry his memory in the form of tears (that induced particular groans when we watched it again).<br/><br/>I was under the impression that the reason the story was separated into two films was to do justice to the story. It is extremely ironic, then, that the film leaves out many vital things. Dumbledore's past - everything about Ariana, Aberforth and Grindlewald - is not mentioned at all. And the things the film doesn't leave out, it insults the author J.K. Rowling by feeling the need to rewrite things. Harry snaps the Elder Wand in two - in the book, he used it to heal his old wand and then left it in the headmaster's office. Neville proclaims love for Luna even though nothing warrants that. There is a pointless chase scene with Nagini - in the book, when Neville dragged the sword from the hat, he killed her at that moment. One of the most infamous things is how Fred's demise is kept offhand - we're never even told whether it's Fred or George! The battle at Hogwarts was much more epic in the book, with centaurs and such creatures joining in the fight with the forces of good.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing is Harry and Voldemort's final battle. It happens in the middle of nowhere, and when it's over, there is no sense of climax at all. In the book, they battled in the Great Hall, in front of all surviving characters. When it was over, there was enormous jubilation, a sense of climax that it was all over. In the movie, nobody even acts as though anything happened when Harry walks back inside. No appreciation, no nothing.<br/><br/>Most aggravating of all is the ironic fact that for those who have not read the books, Voldemort's demise doesn't make sense. The rebounding curse because Voldemort is not the Elder Wand's master is never sufficiently delivered to the audience, so newcomers will not understand what exactly happened to Voldemort.<br/><br/>The flashback scene with Snape's story is then needlessly rushed and skips many points that pinpointed why, exactly, he and Lily fell out with each other and why they couldn't be together. Also, her eyes, would it have been so hard to make Lily's eyes green in post-production? They've only been talking about her eye colour for the entire series. Ron and Hermione's long-awaited kiss is set up much more poorly in the movie than in the book. In the book, it was Hermione seeing how much Ron had grown up - in the film it was ""Oh, we both survived, let's kiss"".<br/><br/>The way in which the Deathly Hallows themselves - the title of the film - tie into everything? Yup, that's left out too. Everything about being ""Master of Death"" simply doesn't exist in this film. But who cares about story inconsistencies if we've got loads of special effects to make up for them? Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a good film, but as a conclusion to the story, it is very sloppy work indeed."

"marcigabrielle","5","4","7","26 July 2011"," You Can't Make a Silk Purse out of a Sow's Ear
","Let's be honest here: the last book in the series is not good literature. It tries to combine far too many themes to be effective, and has recourse to deus ex machina far too often. While the series from the first to the sixth book is a classic, the seventh book turned what could be the Y-generation's LOTR into a rather convoluted, rather trite mess.<br/><br/>Spoilers follow.<br/><br/>Two main themes from the last book are at odds with each other, and are very anti-cinematic. For one, Dumbledore is brought down from his pedestal, and from being this father figure full of wisdom, we see him as a more complex character with a dubious past and rather selfish motivations up to the end. He puts Harry at risk, and basically forces Snipe to commit a sacrifice. Dumbledore, by the end of the King's Cross chapter, is someone we wouldn't really trust. That is the reason why his back-story was excised, it'd have taken too much from the character.<br/><br/>The second difficult theme is Snape. A complex character who, truth be told, is borderline bitter stalker, borderline Quixotic romantic. Once again a theme impossible to convey on film unless such character is the main one, and the story revolves around him. As is, we get to see too little of him, and we lose the dimension of love he presents (a nice antithesis to the love of Lily for her family, in particular Harry).<br/><br/>The other two themes are much more amenable to an action movie, but they are at odds with each other: Horcruxes vs. Hallows.<br/><br/>The book never resolves the issue. The Hallows seem an afterthought, material that could have been used in another novel, and are used instead to remark in the corrupting nature of power and the lust for it. But that is also Horcrux territory. Both deal with similar emotions, and serve (in the book) to create a parallel between Voldemort and Dumbledore, seeking power, and Harry and Aberforth rejecting it.<br/><br/>We miss on the most important element of the Hallows long history, how the fall is born out of pride (very well represented by the Gaunts, who are poor like rats but still consider themselves superior to everybody else as a function of their blood), and how the manifestation of pride is a lack of love (symbolized by Merope using an elixir to seduce Tom Riddle Sr.).<br/><br/>Without that information, the whole Hallows bit becomes irrelevant and takes time away from the Horcruxes, creating some confusion to the end.<br/><br/>We're left with the most simplistic messages from the series: the fights, the effects, the pain, and the victory. But gone are the elements of redemption (Snape, Draco, etc.), the idea that there is no perfect good and even the good can do evil due to zealotry (Dumbledore, James Potter), that pride and love pull in opposite directions, that friendship and love is above all being able to renounce to yourself, and that power by its very nature takes control of you, no matter how wise you may seem to be.<br/><br/>The ending speeches of the first three movies had more depth than the series ending, I must say. But this time the disappointment was not as bad as the first time, when I closed the last book."
"rwest-24","Null","4","7","19 July 2011"," Best of the series
","This film was by far the best of a sometimes patchy series. There has been quite a bit of adaptation compared with the book, but it is on the whole an excellent adaptation which is true to the story, well paced, and grips the viewer.<br/><br/>My complaint comes in and around the Battle of Hogwarts where I regret the horror of it all has been toned down, presumably in search of a child friendly certificate. Gone was the reconciliation of Percy with his family which provided such a contrast with the death of Fred - though there was the briefest of allusions to it in one scene.<br/><br/>Gone was the book's emotion as the dead and dying were brought in from the grounds during the hour's cease fire. What we saw was much sanitised.<br/><br/>There were no tears from Hargrid as he carried back Harry's body.<br/><br/>I was disappointed that Grawp, the house elves, and Buckbeak played no part in the battle. I suppose that was inevitable, but surely the presence of these foreshadows greater friendship between the races if JKR ever writes book 8 <br/><br/>My last regret is that the final dual between Harry & Voldemort was portrayed as a running battle in which Harry actively kills his opponent. In the book Voldemort effectively murders himself with a rebounding curse after declining an offer to repent. I understand why the film was done this way, but suggest it belies the true nature of Harry.<br/><br/>Against this, given how much it had to be compressed the explanation of Snape's true role was excellently handled, & the raid on Gringots as good as I hoped.<br/><br/>This is a film I shall enjoy watching many more times when it is released on DVD/Blueray."

There has always been key aspects left out, bits that weren't put together as well as the novels, etc. But coming into this film I was hoping to not leave the theatre thinking, I wish they had done this or that, and after waiting in line for 7 hours, I left the theatre with tears in my eyes and a feeling of utter content. Through out the movie each piece that has hung in the air through out all 8 movies, was finally tied together, finally you were able to understand what everything was for and why it happened that way. <br/><br/>The film finished with perfection, and although much did differ from the novels it was changed only for the better, and in this case (unlike in past movies) they actually succeeded in making that change, BETTER. <br/><br/>I recommend not only seeing this movie as soon as possible, but if you are not too familiar with the Harry Potter tale, please go to a block buster or a book store and either watch or read this series, because it is truly a masterpiece<br/><br/>Great way to finish the series, and i'm truly saddened that it is time for goodbye."
"hellotomato2","Null","4","7","14 July 2011"," A near-perfect end to a near-perfect tale
","In all aspects, this movie excelled, reaching beyond our expectations in the same way that Harry Potter's magical world reached beyond the realm of our imagination and settled into our hearts. The acting was superb, the pace riveting, the action scenes thrilling, and the storyline both true to the novel and unforgettable until the end. Each beautiful scene that Rowling illustrated in her novel is displayed in full splendor in Yates' adaptation, which will soon become as much a part of the Potter legacy as the novels themselves. You can read as many reviews as you want, but in the end this is a movie that you absolutely must see for yourself. If you've ever picked up a Harry Potter book and are seeking some form of satisfying closure, it exists in theaters now. Don't miss it."

","I saw first day first show and really loved the way they have completed the story with good note.... After seeing ""Deathly Hallow's Part 1"", I was desperately waiting for the last part. 3D too is amazing and story is fast moving with lots of magic and wands... I feel this part has much more magic compared to earlier. Also art, concept and characters are well portrayed. I had prepared myself by watching Deathly hallow part 1 one day earlier, to get the continuity feeling. Also there are many twists which will amaze you and makes the story more interesting. After seeing the ending, I had feeling that they should pull the story with fresh start for Harry Potter's next generation... :))))"
"ensnowed","8","7","15","13 July 2011"," Worthy
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II was in one word: awesome. First of all the cinematography, the visual effects and the directing was great. Second, the acting. Emma, Rupert and Daniel were once again great, and then yet again nothing special. It were the others that made it. Ralph Fiennes was the star, while he put down Lord Voldemort in a magnificent way. And frankly, it wasn't just him that set the tone, Alan Rickman was great (and interesting to see how Snape too has emotions), Maggie Smith was wonderful and didn't we all just love Matthew Lewis as Neville? Rarely have I seen a movie which was thrilling and seated me on the edge of my very uncomfortable cinema seat, from the very beginning. I must say I think it can be quite hard to act when 'under influence of' the Polyjuice potion, but I reckon that Helena Bonham Carter did a great job as pretending to be Hermione pretending to be Bellatrix. <br/><br/>Unfortunately there were some lows in this film too, for example a minor plot error occurred when Harry, Ron and Hermione entered the Room of Requirement with Neville. Cho was there, and I couldn't help but wonder, why? After all, she was a year older than Harry was, and should've had her NEWT's during Harry's sixth year. I was lightly disappointed that there were only hints given to Dumbledore's past, rather than telling the story itself. In my opinion, this story forms Albus and Aberforth in a way in which we missed out on in this film. Another low for me were the deaths of Bellatrix and Voldemort, shattering to pieces. To me, just plain dropping death would've been enough. I would've preferred seeing the film in 2D, rather than 3D, as I did. It didn't add anything special, instead it just tires your eyes. And lastly, I just didn't enjoy the epilogue. It was awkward, not just for the audience to watch, but also for the actors to play, or so it looked like on screen. Harry's little dialogue with his son made me, and others in the audience groan. <br/><br/>But to set this aside, David Yates has done a wonderful job, and the script was overall very well done. The film made you bite your nails and close your eyes in the most thrilling parts of the movie, and then yet again you burst out into laughter at some of those parts. I can honestly say, it was absolutely worthy of my time and money."
"dromero_21","9","11","27","12 July 2011"," Must see! A great ending to a spectacular series
","The end of the Harry potter series has now come, but the last film will surely make it one to remember. At least for myself I can say that I had quite the adrenaline rush to see how Harry Potter and his brave companions would destroy the remaining horcruxes and at last kill Voldemort. I must say Director David Yates really gave the much anticipated film it's character.<br/><br/>The film started literally where it took off in part 1. Voldemort got his almighty powerful wand and it seemed that chances were slim for Harry to succeed the dark lord. If you have not read the book, I won't drop a spoiler rather tell you that the young Hogwarts students have it in them to give the dark lord a run for his money(power). <br/><br/>What really gave me the chills was when Harry & Voldemort fought for the last time. Ten years we have been waiting to see what happens and trust me, it's worth the wait! I was in shock when I found out what happened to Harry before this, I would've never guessed. <br/><br/>Overall, 3-D is great, action is amazing, and the ending to an amazing saga could not be better!"
"Seisaku","6","16","43","13 July 2011"," Snape memories
","I will make this short : the most beautiful and ""overwhelming"" scene from the final book - and though the entire saga - that is the memories from Snape with/toward Lilly is literally butchered by David Yates' filming. When you listen to Alexandre Desplat's piece of gem for this sequence and if you read the book first...well... you could have asked for much much much better ! This was meant to be a CLIMAX ! Of course the final sequence at the train station is very moving since it pulls you 10 years backwards when you got into those three funny fellows. But I strongly believe the most accurate sequence has been ruined... I'm very pleased anyway to have entered this saga from the beginning to its end."
"pujya29","6","5","10","15 July 2011"," Harry takes on Voldemort in this last movie.
","Like all the anticipated Harry Potter fans I have been waiting to watch this movie. And while doing that i read all the books again and the book 7 twice - and that was the mistake i committed! Because when I saw the movie i could not help but compare the movie with book and I have to say this - it was not what I had visualized. <br/><br/>The problem was the name of the move: Harry Potter and 'blah blah blah... - so any thing other than Harry Potter was completely ignored from the movie. use of invisibility cloak, life of Lupin and Tonks, the whole room of requirement scene, Ron and Hermione, <br/><br/>Earlier movies established so much about dementors being a crucial part of Voldemorts army but no there were no patronuses ! <br/><br/>However Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort was amazing and so evil ! Another one who completely stole the show was Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). Short screen presence but brilliant performance... your heart almost goes out for him. <br/><br/>The best adaption of book in the movie was King's cross scene and the worst was the duel between Voldemort and Harry Potter. They should have stuck to the book. <br/><br/>Technically, I don't know that much but I didn't like the whole movie in black. There could have been more light, more sparks, I know it was evil and all but a bit of light would have made it easier to on the eye. <br/><br/>I feel Rupert Grint is a better actor than Daniel Redcliff. He has so much more to offer on screen.<br/><br/>Rating 5/10<br/><br/>One more point for just being the fan of the series."
"Spinetinglers","9","6","13","13 July 2011"," ""All was well.""
","I love Harry Potter and I'm not ashamed to admit it. From Platform 9 ¾ to Quidditch to that trusty old Invisibility Cloak, I love it all. In fact, I think I'm still struggling to get over the non-delivery of my own Hogwarts letter. But they say that all good things must come to an end, and so I regrettably find myself here – Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows - Part 2 - the final installment in the Harry Potter franchise, a movie that I was both beyond excited about and dreading all at the same time.<br/><br/>Last time we saw Harry and Co. things weren't looking too hot – The Ministry had fallen, the search for the Horcruxes wasn't going exactly to plan, and You-Know-Who had finally gotten his grubby hands on the all-powerful Elder Wand. Part 2 follows on perfectly from where the first installment of The Deathly Hallows left off, whereas the first half was all about building up the tension, this half is all action all the time.<br/><br/>All the main characters we've come to know and love (or hate in some cases) return for the final farewell. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson play Harry, Ron and Hermione to perfection, as they all come into their own during this last part of the tale – through bravery, love, grief and fate we watch as their characters become the people we knew they were always destined to be. Radcliffe has always done a great job of portraying The Chosen One, but in his final outing he is particularly brilliant. Helen McCrory is great as Draco Malfoy's mother, Narcissa, who manages to endear herself to the audience as, when it matters most, she finally seems to do the right thing. Helena Bonham Carter remains flawless as the excellently evil Bellatrix, especially in the scene where she is actually playing Hermione impersonating herself. However, it was Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who gave my favourite performance of them all, he's definitely come a long way from that bumbling kid swinging from the ceiling in The Chamber of Secrets.<br/><br/>The Snape Saga has been a major feature of the entire series - is he good? Is he bad? Does he possess the most dulcet tones of all time? Let's be honest, until the whole Dumbledore incident at the end of The Half Blood Prince it never seemed all that clear whose side he was really on. In Part 2 we finally find out exactly what Snape has been up too, why he said the things he said and why he did the things he did - and in a movie that is full of poignant moments, the most poignant may be when the heartbreaking truth about him is finally revealed.<br/><br/>Most of the film is centered around The Battle of Hogwarts, which is nothing short of a bloodbath, and, as anyone who has read the book will know, not everyone makes it out alive. At times it does make uncomfortable viewing - Hogwarts was the place that was always safe, it was always the shining beacon during even the darkest of times, and so to watch it turned to rubble isn't easy.<br/><br/>Of course the main crescendo of the movie is the final showdown between the artist formally known as Tom Riddle and The Boy Who Lived, as they finally finish what was started all those years before. This is what we've been waiting for from the start, this is what we knew would happen eventually and the movie does a brilliant job of reminding us that Harry's entire life had been leading to this moment. Thankfully when the moment does come it is every bit as spectacular as it needed to be.<br/><br/>As with all the Potter movies that have come before it, the special effects in Part 2 are great, and again they have created Harry's world perfectly. Throughout the series the adaptations have always stayed pretty true to the books and this one is no exception to that rule, and I don't think those who have read the books will be disappointed with how the finale is brought to life.<br/><br/>And so, it all ends  but does it really? As a very wise woman said last week, 'no story lives unless someone wants to listen  the stories we love best do live in us forever. So whether you come back by page or by the big screen – Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home.'<br/><br/>-Lauren, Spinetinglers"

"leonbastalic","10","7","16","13 July 2011"," EPIC, perfect ending for the story of a century!
","This film was just amazing, epic, dramatic, dark, happy and really the best of all Hp films! I'm one of the greatest fans of Harry Potter there are and I was stunned by the epicness of the Hallows part 2! The movie begins with Voldemort stealing the Elder wand, but it's shorter than the original.. then it takes us to WB logo and then to Hogwarts... Soon, we're at Shell Cottage getting ready to visit Gringotts. It's a bit short but epic and full of action (the Gringotts). A perfect start for an EPIC! Everything is going on pretty fast from that spot! I usually don't like violence and gore, but there is some... Voldemort appears to be walking with feet covered in blood in Malfoy Manor. There are some really light and joyful moments in Hogwarts... Until Voldemort comes by. There are some epic scene including McGonagall looking really sad and cheerful at the same time. So there are still some horcruxes to find. The Cup of Hufflepuff will be destroyed by a basilisk fang and then there is a kiss we'we all been waiting for.<br/><br/>Snape is a sad hero, a truly brave man. I cried when I saw his death and story... The part when he collapses when he sees Lilly's dead body made me burst into tears. The forest scene is very intense. And then there is the worst scene in the movie... Voldenort's disgusting fetus like blood covered disturbing body. It's not in a brief glimpse like Snape's death, It's fully graphical and disgusting! The final duel is epic and scary too... ""Let's finish this the way we started it.. Together!"" Then they fly over Hogwarts and it all ends in the courtyard. Voldemort is broken to pieces and that looks like a papermade Tom that falls apart! Those scenes make you think: ""The Chamber of Secrets was truly wonderful and joyful, but this...! Don't bring kids to this movie!"" The epilogue makes you cry and it is a proof that this is the best movie, with the most wonderful ending ever.. the happiest I have yet seen! **""The end is just the beginning!""**"

"abhinav-prkash","3","3","5","9 November 2014"," Deathly Disappointing
","Time for your OWL marks Mr. Yates and Kloves! No- don't bite your fingers; You don't get a Troll nor a Dreadful either- you have just managed yourself a resounding Poor though. Hmmm, better luck next time!- not for you but for HP fans who may want to see someone else re-doing the entire series in future. <br/><br/>Death Hallows Pt 2, for some time to come, will remain as the foremost example of a movie that could had been a classic if not for the grand opportunity missed, or rather wasted by the director and the crew. It had every resource at command- a very talented set of actors, latest 3D and computer technologies, and a 10 years old legacy to guide its way to greatness. But quite inexplicably it refused to even say 'accio' to these sources, and instead, after running impressively through half the way to summit, it wandered, stumbled, and then jumped off the path into same abyss where Harry is made to throw the Elder wand at end. The movie starts convincingly from part 1, and holds itself really well until the time the trio of H.R.H enters into Hogwarts. The scene in vault where artifacts start to multiply or the flight of dragon are superlatively done, there is no question to it. But once inside the castle, the fizz suddenly goes off the movie. <br/><br/>Yates wanted to rush towards boom boom explosions with such haste that it let the thing implode on itself. And so the second half becomes a rubble of montages and frozen frames crashed in a monumental heap where Harry Potter fans like me are still trying to find some meaningful pieces together. <br/><br/>To put it another words, the entire second half of the movie is just arranged together- there is no feeling introduced, no association built with the characters, no bridges created (but blown away certainly). It just compilation of images one after another. Pretty, no doubt, but Mr. Yates, ought to know that in wizarding world people in images also have soul; and the second half had not a shred of soul in it. <br/><br/>And therefore, I did not feel any personal sense of loss when Hogwarts shook and crumbled, when Fred, Lupin , Tonks and so many others died, and quidditch ground burned to ashes. Damn you David Yates- I had loved Hogwarts more than my own school, had ROFLed at Fred's quips and jeers, followed wizard quidditch more than Ron, and had made friends with Harry's batchmates. You dehumanized the entire saga, and left me with not even a feeling of mourning at these losses and worse-- neither one of jubilation at Harry's triumph. <br/><br/>And this is my principle discontent. In the movie, the climatic fight between Harry and Voldi occurs completely isolated and away from everyone. There is no one to watch watch this epic struggle which was building since last 7 years of the movie chronology. It was absurd and spoiled the movie for me. I had never liked the 7th book much, but still the conversation between Voledomort and Harry at the end was thrilling and enthralling – equally moving was Harry's conversation with Dumbledore's portrait. Yate's machination constructed an altogether different and vastly inferior ending.<br/><br/>As a foot-note, this is still a tolerable movie- and certainly not 'OMG-worst-movie-i-ever-saw' kind of stuff. Pity is that, it could had been much much much better."
"dkaden11","3","3","5","11 January 2013"," Just like its predecessors
","Just the necessary end of a book adaption which goes worse and worse with every part. For example, the first and second have been good movies. But then the third which turns the book with the, in my opinion, most exciting story into a boring whatever. The fourth could be named as a ""nice try"" but everything after that was just boring stuff with exaggerated and obsessive special effects. One could get so much more out of this story, but also the last part was full of these things I've sad before: groundless protracted, useless effects, lame gags and a final battle that could'nt be more unspectacular; by the way: no more ideas since the fourth part, except this strange black and white smoke flying thing which is just ridiculous. no innovation, no profundity, no good film<br/><br/>sorry for some grammar mistakes, but English is not my native language"
"themusicangel","5","3","5","15 August 2012"," A Big Disappointment
","I have been a huge fan of the series for 10 years. I waited so long to see this final film. When it finally started, I felt...almost nothing. Everything felt so rushed and all of the actors acted like they just wanted to get this film over with. I wanted it to last so much longer, but sadly it didn't. Pretty much all of the important details were cut out and barley any of the others characters other than the trio had lines. <br/><br/>Even though it's been a year now, I finally have the guts to say that it was a failure and a complete slap in the face. It's something that cannot be fixed, all thanks to the director who ruined it. I really wanted to love this film, but I couldn't because being the fanatic I was I didn't want to admit how awful it was. I think it's unfair that other famous movie finales got to be way longer and more detailed than Deathly Hallows Part 2. I will always love the books, but as for the movies, just the first two."

"cherold","6","3","5","20 June 2012"," Perfectly watchable, utterly forgettable
","Deathly Hallows was easily my least favorite of all the Potter books, representing Rowling's annoyingly grim, rather sadistic side, and at first I wasn't planning to watch the movie at all. I didn't watch Deathly Hallows Part 1, which got middling reviews, but since the sequel got better reviews I thought, why not take a look.<br/><br/>Like all the Potter films, the story has been reduced to a bare bones presentation that would be virtually incomprehensible to anyone who has not read the books. While I considered that a flaw in the early movies, for me it's somewhat of a strength in the later ones, because the agonizing deaths of deeply loved characters that infest the final few books are, in the films, nothing but unfortunate events set amidst the special effects. Even the best of the movies barely touched me emotionally, and in a book series that seemed bent on breaking my heart, I appreciated the movies' shallowness.<br/><br/>But having said that, the emotional disconnect of the last film is still a bit too much. True, I wasn't sad when characters died, because the movie did nothing to make me care about them, and barely even paused at their passing, but for the same reason, I wasn't especially happy when the characters succeeded. I really didn't care what was happening at all.<br/><br/>I saw the movie four or five days ago, and I already barely remember it. The only thing I remember is thinking that Harry breaks an awful lot of innocent eggs to make that omelet, making him a rather dodgy hero. Perhaps that is true in the book as well, but in the book I cared more about the principals than the extras. I cannot say that of this version.<br/><br/>Good special effects though."
"link1907-360-813540","5","3","5","15 June 2012"," You must be kidding right?
","I really trust IMDb for movie rating but for this one... no! thats just impossible too much fanboy! Have you just read the book? Everything is different from the book it's a terrible movie and it'S definitely not worth the 8/10 that people give. The first 7 movies were really decent like 7/10 not perfect but still really enjoyable but this one is just bad. It feel rushed and the ending is terrible because they changed everything. I don't get why people love this one so much its just not good at all. There so so much better movie that came out in 2011 and they don't have as much place as this one. I'm disappointed and I hope that eventually the rating will be corrected. I think this movie is worth a 5/10."
"gid_rulz","5","3","5","1 January 2012"," Just meh
","So before I'm judged to hate Harry Potter or not understand it, I've read all the books and seen all the movies, and apart from both the Deathly Hallows films, seen them all more than once. Now since the Goblet of Fire, the franchise has started to go a bit downhill. Number 5 and 6 were pretty bad in my opinion, and Deathly Hallows Part 1 was alright, nothing incredible.<br/><br/>To finish off a series of films that has inspired the imagination of an entire generation, everything has to go perfect and for so many people this was just incredible but for me it, well it was just meh. It kept with the most recent dark themes that the later Potter films carried but to say this film is incredible or to give it a top 250 spot seems ridiculous to me. It feels like people just wanted it to be so incredible because this was the last one and we aren't going to see Daniel, Rupert and Emma fighting the dark lord again. <br/><br/>So what did i think about what actually happened in this movie, well it didn't have much dialogue that you expect from a movie based on a book. It seemed that instead of trying to go so much on the themes of the book, they instead tried to make it one, rather long, non-exhilarating, attempt at being epic battle which just took away from the story and pushed the CGI based blockbuster aspect into the forefront. <br/><br/>This isn't a terrible film, nor would i say that people who find it perfect are stupid or wrong, and i certainly wouldn't say don't see it, i mean there are some great aspects of it, mainly Neville who no doubt steals the show. In my opinion though it fell short on what the books and series would've wanted it to end, and there is NO WAY that it should be in the top 250, with a higher rating then Rocky, Truman Show, Drive, Let the Right One In and many other incredible films. 5/10 for me, but you should make up your own mind"
"hardkre-220-990633","5","3","5","22 November 2011"," Worst of the lot
","I have enjoyed the Harry potter Movies as much as anyone, But i cant help feeling disappointed by this last one. Where the Deathly hallows part 1 dragged out a bit, and left you feeling bored at times, Deathly hallows part 2 is quite the opposite. It is Fast paced to a degree where it feels like the movie is on fast forward making you feel like you missed out on essential parts of the plot. They have also taken quite a lot of liberty in regards to the ending of the movie, and it is nothing like the ending of the book.<br/><br/>Personally i would say that Deathly hallows part 1 should have ended further towards the end than it did, so the last film did not have to cramp 10 hours of story telling in to 2 hours of film. Cause another 40-60 mins of film could have made this an epic ending, instead it just feels hastened and unfinished, like the director was running out of tape or budget, making him take some drastic steps to finish it prematurely and unfinished.<br/><br/>There are also some scenes in the movie that just doesn't make any sense, which was rather annoying as well. Overall the harry potter movies have been great entertainment, but this last installment is definitely the worst of the lot, especially for those whom have read the books.<br/><br/>5 out of 10."
"Rockwell_Cronenberg","3","3","5","18 October 2011"," A middling series ends on a low-point.
","I'll admit that I've never been big on the film series as a whole (only saying I even liked two of the installments), but after the major emotional improvement that was Deathly Hallows: Part I it just felt like they threw all of that way for Part II. They put 95% of the focus onto Harry and let all of the other characters fall by the wayside, so when major emotional peaks happened like the Hermoine and Ron kiss that had been building for eight entire films, it became this throwaway moment that had no significance. This happened a good dozen or so times throughout the film with moments that were supposed to be huge emotional payoffs and ended up just feeling like footnotes on ""The Harry Story"" for two hours.<br/><br/>This is the only film in the series where I felt like they should have actually made it longer, since instead of dragging like some of the installments it felt like so much of it was incredibly rushed to get to Harry's big scenes (several of which did drag a lot). Several of the big moments felt incredibly cheesy, but the action scenes were pretty well done other than the pauses in the middle of them for poorly delivered one-liners. My favorite character in the book series ended up being someone I couldn't have cared less about in the films and his huge moment here gave me absolutely nothing. Overall, a large disappointment to end a very disappointing series."

","Gave movie a generous 8. It may be unfair to rate it lower than others have done as I had read the book. If you've done the same, you may tend to rate the movie even lower than I did. It deserved an 8 for no other reason than it was exciting and provided fairly good acting. It differed so from the book, it was sad. The movie seemed to be in a rush to conclude the series and provided little in the background stories required to make it unforgettable. For moviegoers that did not know the story, I would expect some confusion. For those of us that read the book, I would expect plain disappointment. Unlike the conclusion to Lord of the Rings, this will not be an Oscar contender. I'm surprised that the stories author hasn't complained; my God they had two movie to do the ending properly and they missed entirely. As I read my review, I'm reconsidering the 8. Well, it was exciting, had good affects, and did bring the story to an end, although somewhat clumsily. Yet, I'm sure millions of younger fans will think it great so, the 8 stays."

The problem is that they DID NOT BUILD IT UP, as m0r0n Yates did whatever he wanted, JKR spent SO MUCH TIME creating this universe/story. It all makes sense in the books. Can u say the same is true 4 Yates's movies? No!<br/><br/>The whole point of the defeat of Voldermort was 2 point out his ignorance! 2 bad Yates was even WORSE than Voldermort! I doubt that Yates can read. I don't even want to capitalize his name anymore since it shows some respect towards him. I do not consider him 2 b a human being. Even worse than Voldermort. At least Voldy has excuses 4 being evil; in-breeding, abandonment, isolation, being different, genetic evilness, Slythern DNA, no guidance, & so on! Did yates even GO 2 school?<br/><br/>As many b4 me have pointed out ""The good, the bad, & the ugly"" I will 2! GOOD: NONE! BAD: ENTIRE MOVIE UGLY: yates!<br/><br/>Sure it was fun 2 c some of the things happening. BUT the action sequences r MEAININGLESS! It's the DIALOUGE that's important! 4 instance the Ron/Hermione kiss! 1st off u could not even c them kiss! Ron's head hid the kiss! It seems as if that idi0t that plays Hermione DID NOT want to kiss him!<br/><br/>Anyways the REASON NOT the ACTION was more important with this kiss. IN THE BOOK they kissed cuz RON CHANGED! The KISS was 4 THIS REASON! Not the ""reason"" in the movie! As ppl have pointed out b4 me; ""We're alive let's kiss!""<br/><br/>MORE PROBLEMS I have with this movie: Did not explain: many deaths, cover Dumbledore's past. (the sister, his friends, his mother, his childhood, his obsession with the DH, etc.), explain many of the relationships Ron/Herm, Harry/Ginny, Luna/Neville (stated by JK later).<br/><br/>The epilogue was HORRIBLY done & confusing; u don't know whose kid is whose, & they do not look that old!<br/><br/>They skipped the ending where Harry OUTSMARTS Voldermort IN FRONT OF THE WHOLE CROWD! Instead Harry disarms him! Totally different meaning!<br/><br/>Snape's memories/flashbacks WERE RUSHED! If I had not read the books I would have been confused as 2 what was going on! Can u imagine telling actors: Yeah let's do this ""$#!t"" get it out of the way & get back 2 exploding stuff!<br/><br/>The movie displayed Harry as being an idi0t, a reflection of yates! The ghost of Ravenclaw did NOT tell him where the crown was! HE figured that out HIMSELF! She only told him the story! Oops, story MUST b ignored by yates! Also the ghost DID NOT attack him in the books! Really yates u have 2 INSERT action where there was none!?<br/><br/>They put Slytherns in the dungeons? They were evacuated in the book! WHAT? It goes AGAINST the whole POINT OF THESE BOOKS THAT <3 IS STRONGER! So it was inconsistent when Harry saved Draco's life! D@mn yates! So the head of Gryffindor is as heartless as Voldermort? Umm the dungeons r UNDERGROUND! If u can't understand: Hogwarts is crumbling, u know FALLING DOWN! SoÂ… If they r beneath this rubble how the fu(& r they going 2 get out? Really, yates does not understand gravity? Oh yes he CAN'T EVEN READ how can he understand advanced things like SCIENCE!<br/><br/>Yes I UNDERSTAND that u cannot put every detail in2 the books. BUT u CAN TRY 2 DO SO! SO MANY PARTS yates just IGNORED the story & put other stuff! Like Harry pushing Voldermort off that cliff. Couldn't we have used that time 2 DO STUFF THAT WAS ACTUALLY IN THE BOOKS!?<br/><br/>Y does this movie have ANY good reviews!? Oh yes ppl can't read."
"kluseba","6","3","5","19 July 2011"," Assimilated to Hollywood standards
","If you like overambitious special effect based event cinema with 3D animations and a lot of epic sounds, you will surely adore this movie and think that it is a perfect ending to the series and final highlight for the whole family. Anybody that tends to look a little bit beyond commercial Hollywood cinema and prefers something more profound and intellectual might get a rather negative surprise after so many overrated positive reviews from the fan boys on this site.<br/><br/>This movie has so many negative points that I don't know where to begin. First of all, I might chose the characters and the acting. I remember reading the last three hundred pages of the final novel was an emotional and touching thing and I wasn't able to put the book aside. I had tears in my eyes when some of the characters were struggling in their battles, losing all hope and ultimately even dying in some cases. In the movie, this all seems so secondary that it's a dishonour to the actors and a decade of more or less touching attempts to recreate the magic of the novels. Many tragic fates, last breaths and deadly conclusions are just side notes to fill a whole in between two overwhelming battle scenes with many artificially flavoured special effects. That's what I call a shame and a lack of subtlety from the production team and especially the director. Everything is concentrated on Harry Potter that there is almost no place for the other actors to shine. Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger play no important role and even the main character's girlfriend Ginny Weasley has only a few insignificant passages. It seems as if this was a movie about the one and only Harry Potter and the other characters only had cameo appearances for the memories of old glory and older movies with much more equilibrium, depth and magic. The only characters that were able to shine next to Harry Potter were Neville Longbottom and Severus Snape. Even Lord Voldemort had a ridiculous and childish megalomaniac attitude while Albus Dumbledore seemed surprisingly arrogant to me.<br/><br/>Another annoying aspect were the reoccurring cheap attempts on childish puns. Each time there was a dramatic or dark scene, any of the characters said something stupid or ridiculous. Well, many people laughed in the cinemas but it was more a hesitating chain reaction and nothing funny or appropriated to the situation. We don't need any simplistic jokes in the darkest and most gripping parts of the Harry Potter universe just to satisfy the youngest generations and avoid harsher critics from angry parents who may complain that their seven year old daughters had nightmares after watching this movie. The Harry Potter novels had evolved alongside the age of its characters and they had become more mature, dark and serious. This last movie breaks this progression down and tries to return to some light entertainment for the whole family.<br/><br/>Many things in the movie were truly predictable and not because I had read the novel. The speech of Neville Longbottom for example was filled with so much kitsch that I rather had to laugh out and shake my head than to feel touched by it. The comments by Albus Dumbledore were predictable and as unclear and imprecise as always but this time with a quite arrogant and bored touch in it. The annoying paranoid curses of Lord Voldemort against his enemies and especially Harry Potter were repeated to much and limited the character to a rather one-dimensional, clueless and predictable personality. The characterizations of the different personalities were underlined and stretched in a stereotypical way but not lifted on a higher level as the novel did.<br/><br/>Another important point was the lack of depth in the movie. Only the scenes around Severus Snape were great but still far away from the novel's quality. We don't get to know more about the main villain and his horcruxes. What about the background story of Albus Dumbledore? What about the details surrounding Teddy Lupin? What happened with Percy Weasley and his decisions? What about the deeper and matured romantic relationships between Harry and Ginny or Ron and Hermione? What about the new connection between Harry Potter and Draco Malfoy? If you decide to cut the last novel into two movies, please do it properly at least.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the whole thing is entertaining and a funny popcorn cinema ride but it lacks of depth and something truly outstanding. The movie doesn't have this little glimpse of magic and subtle emotion that the novel had. Where Peter Jackson almost equalled the original ""Lord of the Rings"" novels, David Yates is far away from only getting near to it. The biggest surprise of the movie was that at the end of this superficial commercial entertainment, there wasn't written ""directed by James Cameron"" in the credits. This movie is comparable to his last works like ""Sanctum"" or ""Avatar"". The last ""Transformers"" and ""Narnia"" movies are also horribly close to this last Harry Potter movie. I am honestly shocked that a British novel has been transformed into a copy of Hollywood's actual standards. The movie doesn't have the British soul of the novels. I honestly preferred the earliest movies of the series. The whole thing got stretched and over-hyped too much. One should have made one single final movie about three hours, cut out the boring lack of events in the first part and the overwhelming special effects and childish jokes of the second one to fusion the whole thing into a more equilibrated and human mixture with a few additional background scenes. That would have made less money and got less popularity but would have been closer to the novel in order to honour a legendary piece of art in a significant way. The unsatisfying final result may not be the actors' or fans' fault but the studio's and director's mistake."
"giyanks22","Null","3","5","18 July 2011"," It all ends, but it is a good end
","So here we are, after 7 books and 8 movies the epic saga of Harry Potter comes to an end, having captivated the hearts and minds of an entire generation. I can most certainly assure you that whatever you may have thought about previous Harry Potter movies this 8th movie is an excellent film that is a satisfying ending to an incredible franchise.<br/><br/>The film picks up right where part 1 left off, showing Voldemort acquiring the elder wand from Dumbledores tomb, we then see a shot of professor Snape overseeing the students ""marching at Hogwarts"", which nicely sets the tone for the film. We then see the title shot, and are then reintroduced to our familiar trio as they hatch a plan to break into gringots bank to steal a horcrux from Bellatrix Lestranges vault. What ensues is an excellent scene where they break into the vault. From the start it is clear that Director David Yates is giving his all to make this movie as good as it can possibly be. The rest of the story that ensues stays very faithful to Rowlings text, a feature that lends greatly to the film. All of the sequences are excellent, but The Battle of Hogwarts is the centerpiece of film and it is handled beautifully, on the same level as Pellenor fields from Lord of Rings. We see the sheer size of Voldemorts forces, and the battle is nothing short of epic. The giants, the stone knights, the snatchers, the death eaters, the snake, and the massive magical battle keep the audience on the edge of their seats. The afterlife scene is also done perfectly, and is an excellent interpretation of the novel, and the emotional climax of Voldemorts destruction hits home with the audience. We then have a tear jerking ""19 years later"" scene where we see Harry's children go off to Hogwarts.There's no need to go into the rest of the story, but I will say that is nothing short of spectacular for those who have not read the books<br/><br/>I want to focus more on the production aspects of the film, because they really stand out in this one. First off the acting is really on a completely different level, every actor from Daniel Radcliffe to Maggie Smith is giving it their all this time around. This saga is unique in that nearly every famous British thespian is involved in the films, something that many take for granted. The trio of kids is excellent, and it is amazing to see how much they have grown as actors. Radcliffe in particular does a wonderful job of showing the audience the sheer weight of the daunting task that he faces in destroying Voldemort. Ralph Fiennes does an incredible job as Voldemort, who he has turned into a villain far greater than Emperor Palpatine or Sauron, yet in this film, he shows us Voldemorts vulnerable side, and we see Voldemort actually fear something. Maggie Smith is excellent as Professor McGonegal, who really gets to shine during the siege of Hogwarts. Helena Bonham Carter is superb as the vicious witch Bellatrix Lestrange, ands captures the personna perfectly. The standout, however, is Alan Rickman as professor Snape. I have always thought that Rickman's performance as Snape was a perfect interpretation of Rowlings text, but in this movie he nails it. He deserves an Oscar just as much as anyone does this year. He nearly had me in tears during the scene where Harry relives Snapes memories.<br/><br/>The tone of the film is also superb it just has this feel that all hell is breaking loose, and that no one can stop it. The script that Steve Kloves delivers also deserves an Oscar nod, because it is the first script that stays true to the book and actually improves upon Rowlings sacred text. The production staff headed up by Stuart Craig does an excellent job once again, especially with the Gringots sequence. Yates also deserves an incredible amount of credit for the sense of scale that this film has. We see thousands of Death Eaters charging and fighting thousands of aurors and Hogwarts students. We see what an impact Voldemort has on the world.<br/><br/>The visual effects and cinematography have to win Oscars, because they are excellent. They even bring back John Williams original score from 10 long years ago.<br/><br/>The fact of the matter is that no matter who you are, no matter what you're feelings towards the series are, there is no denying that what these producers have pulled off in this series is nothing short of remarkable. To have kept the same cast throughout the 8 movies, and to have pumped them out over the course of 10 years with high productions standards is an achievement worthy of ""Return of The King-like"" Oscar recognition. This movie should win best picture, if not for this individual film, but for all of the films as a whole. This film puts Harry Potter on the same epic level as Lord of the Rings and the original Star Wars trilogy.<br/><br/>10 out 10"
"suvopyne49","6","3","5","17 July 2011"," Yates' Best is not good enough
","First of all, it is indeed David Yates' 'Best'. BUT his best is average in comparison to other directors' great works. It is one of those cases where someone's best is just not good enough. The movie's opening scene was good (For a second, I was like 'Can this be? Can this be the one from David Yates'?'). Well, what did I know? There were undoubtedly some moments. There was humor in some occasions. Examples: A) The thing which qualified this movie as the best amongst yates works ( which is only the 4 HP movies :P) is the way he showed the prince's tale chapter. A lot of the credits has to be given to Alan Rickman. I have only seen him showing that much emotion in 'Rasputin'. But Yates also deserves some credits because he got the great out of his actor and portrayed it well. B) Then the moment when Mcgonagall (Maggie Smith) draws herself between harry and snape and start duelling. C) The moment when snape said 'You have got your mother eyes'. D) Helena Bonham Carter did well in portraying 'hermione trying to be Bellatrix'. E) Some moments from the war at hogwarts too.<br/><br/>--All of these moments deserves plaudits.<br/><br/>But a great movie is not just about a fistful of moments. The movie 'Deathly Hallows' is divided in two parts. Still it could not fit some of the events which could have made into great scenes. J.K.Rowling provided a story which, arguably could have been made into a series which surpasses LOTR trilogy. Well forget about LOTR now. Here are some examples of those events I am talking about : 1) Harry and Luna go to the Ravenclaw common room. They see Amycus spitting on mcgonagall. The intensity in harry in that scene could have been a treat to watch as he performs the cruciatus curse. But I guess yates does not know what intense drama is. Someone advice him to watch Daniel Day Lewis' Performance in 'There will be blood'. 2) Fred's death seemed more tragic and hard reality to us because the reaction of Percy. J.K.Rowling knew what she was doing. Alas! the same could not be said about Yates. 3) Now it maybe my personal observation, but somehow Lord Voldemort seemed very vulnerable and less powerful and ruthless in the movie. Except a random scene where he killed his death eater for calling him 'My lord'. Maybe I am mistaken, but what I gathered from reading the series of books for roundabout 200 times, is that lord voldemort is a very hard person to duel. There were scenes in the movie where harry actually matches him in the duel, whereas Rowling had mentioned only one spell from each one of them in their duels. Those were Avada Kedavra and Expelliarmus. She made us believe that the reason harry triumphed over voldemort is love and not because harry is more powerful wizard. 4) Sorry! I could not find Yates creativity very appealing or fascinating. Grabbing voldemort and jumping of a tower. Not great. But the worst is Bellatrix and Voldemort burst into confetti. What were they? Boggarts of Molly Weasley and Harry? 5) Hagrid plays a cameo role here. As far as I remember he was very much involved in the war with grawp. 6) Though I mentioned that the scene where mcgonagall starts duelling with snape is good. But the actual duel which followed is very poorly shown. Yates' himself once portrayed dumbledore v/s voldemort. Why could not he do the same here? According to the book snape and mcgonagall did much more than just sending sparks at each other. 7) The Epilogue is pathetic. Except Emma Watson everyone seemed pretty much awkward in the roles of mid-age moms and dads. Emma Watson was good, she made herself look like a really caring mom. All the humor of the epilogue is gone.<br/><br/>I stop at this as I have mentioned 7 flaws. ( Could have gone further but as 7 is the most magical number..) The finale along with the past few parts will always remind me that how great the movie could have been."
"oir23","7","3","5","16 July 2011"," Good but Disappointing
","This movie is a lot like that Genius student we all knew in College, who could have had a 4.0 but did not study and instead got a 3.0. The fact that this movie is good is more a testament to how great the story is. If you read the book you know some of the most important parts were either; excluded, rushed or just done badly. But in the end the overall story is so amazing that even a stripped down version is satisfying. Still the most disappointing part is that by splitting the book into 2 movies they had enough time to cover everything decently well. Instead they wasted time on irrelevant added scenes instead of showing the main fight/ending the way it should have been. In the end Harry and Voldemort circle each other as EVERYONE watched and Harry explained to Voldemort just how badly he had beaten him. In the end he even gave him a chance to feel remorse which he did not, Voldemort Loss is the ultimate Lost and Harry victory is the ultimate victory. But in the movie this is reduced to 3d effects. On top of that after the fight was over you could not tell if they had won or lost. There was no celebration, Hagrid patted Harry in the back like he had just won the spelling bee. I mean even if you did not read the book this is disappointing at that moment Harry just beat the most dangerous wizard of all time! he just ended the war! where is the celebration? There is more i could go into like how they rushed the pensive scene with the memories of Snape, but is useless because in the end people who just watch the movies are satisfied. But people who read the books know that it should have been amazing and instead it was just good."
"swanandsaw_19","Null","3","5","15 July 2011"," Disappointing End
","Well the story is just in the book, thank god for that. but still the director has not shown the important scenes of the book, like the place where Beatrix is killed or the place where Neville kills nagini, in short the whole end of the movie is total disaster. For example when harry kills voldemort its shown as if he has killed some normal troll. The movie lacks dialogues, bad screenplay, it all ends very abruptly. In the start the movie is very little fun to watch, well the most boring part was when Harry talks to Dumbledore. only girls will be crying in this movie. Its not for boys at all not even for geeks. Strictly for HP fans and no one else should go and waste their time."
"frz_vmp","Null","3","5","14 July 2011"," A REVIEW made by a REAL FAN, of the harry potter BOOKS.
","FIRST OF ALL THIS IS A MOVIE RATED 13+ ,SO.... (no lots of blood, no nudity, no corpses)<br/><br/>OK, i have read lots of reviews made by movie fans, but i wanted to make a review made to all of you that are seeking for ""the changes"" if it ""sticks"" to the book and all that stuff....<br/><br/>Let me start by saying this is an AWESOME movie, full of action, you will certainly cry in a moment, or you will always be crying... amazed, and all that stuff, but... YES, it is full with CHANGES from the book, but really they are all perfectly made, they put a little more here, a little more there, they cut some parts that for us the ""fans"" are important, but hey this is a MOVIE, if you want the real deal read the book.<br/><br/>So said that, i have to say, that all the fights are amazing, the acting is REALLY REALLY so upgraded, from everybody.<br/><br/>There are gorgeous visuals, and the 3D really complements all the spells, and all that stuff, in the Hogwarts battle scene, it looks like a video game, like i don't know it looks so good, awesome, you WILL be stunned,but...<br/><br/>if you are looking for the BOOK, if you are looking for THAT for the real thing, you will be disappointed,Voldemort's dead scene is bad. REALLY bad. That is all i will say.<br/><br/>What i have to recognize is that, they really gave Snape all the emotion he needed, i have to admit i cried like a starving baby during most of his scenes, it is perfectly written, his part, all of it, ALL.<br/><br/>There are no scenes with ""ron, Hermione"" fighting, i really wished there where, not just running from side to side.<br/><br/>The love between Ron, Hermione is perfect, they added more emotion to their kiss is BETTER than in the book, the scene is written just for THAT kiss and it's totally worth it, but Ginny's and Harry's kiss is awful, i feel like they never gave them a try to have their love moment, it always feels so rushed, with no chemistry at all.<br/><br/>This movie has so many little details, that make you remember all the past ones, and they are so perfect, so well made, from the songs, the music, to little things that you will say: oh!!, remember that?. I really appreciate that.<br/><br/>I will finish this by SAYING, thank you, Harry Potter, thank you JK Rowling, your books are, your world, you made me believe in it. But THANKS GOD the movies are over, THANKS GOD for real.<br/><br/>It's certainly the best, it cannot be compared of course, this is all action.<br/><br/>But hey, give it a try, you WON'T , and i mean it you won't have a bad time watching it, it's pleasantly enjoyable."
"ameyask","8","4","8","16 July 2011"," Messed up the end scene, still pretty good
","I absolutely love the Harry Potter books. I think Deathly Hallows part 1 was best in a sense that it stayed true to the book. Part 2 takes from where we left off.<br/><br/>The Good : Very well made scenes of Gringotts,Battle of Hogwarts,Snape's memories,King's cross.(Although King's cross could have had more details). The movie captures the tense mood in the book with some comic relief scenes jabbed in. Very good acting by all cast. Alan Rickman is perfect Snape book readers could have asked for. Movie keeps you on edge even though you know what is going to happen.<br/><br/>The Bad: 1. Lack of use invisibility cloak. I mean COME ON ! That is so important part of the book ! <br/><br/>2.No Shrieking Shack,the final battle does not happen in Great Hall.No back story of Dumbledore, just one liner hints by Aberforth. No scene of Ravenclaw Common Room ! <br/><br/>3.Movie really rushes through the confrontation of Harry telling Tom Riddle who is true owner of the wand and after everything is over Harry explains it to Ron and Hermione. Then Harry SNAPS the Elder Wand and throws it away. What the hell? I really don't understand point of changing these things from the book. WHY? WHY?<br/><br/>4.Movie does not establish the fact that Harry becomes Master of death. So non-readers will feel Harry defeated Voldemort only because of Wand.<br/><br/>5.Unintentional funny scenes. The scene where Voldemort declares Harry is dead and laughs is pathetic. Everybody was laughing.Gambon I think is worst Dumbledore, with his ridiculous dialogue delivery, he spoils the ""Of course it is in your head Harry ..."" line. That line is epic and people laugh because it sounds like Dumbledore is making a joke.<br/><br/>8/10 only because whatever they did right,they did it very well.I am being generous since it is last movie. Thank you J.K.Rowling for this series and as JK said ""Whether you come back by page or by the big screen, Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home"""
"quinnringo","10","4","8","15 July 2011"," Epic Performances
","The film was epic. I am a huge fan and arrived at the theater at noon dressed up in anticipation. However, nothing could have prepared me for this. It was incredible. Enjoy and savor it. You will not be disappointed in a single performance. The kids have grown so much over the years and Alan Rickman gives one of the performances of his career. Very very rarely do you gerecieve the opportunity to witness the total completion of something that you have loved for more than 10 years. Especially on screen. While many tears were dropped, it is a feeling of completeness. Those who worked on it should be more than proud as it was an honor to watch."

Specially real character of Snap is revealed in this part, i think which is the best part of the Movie. The secret of the death of Headmaster(In Harry Potter 6) is also shocking. Death of some characters is not so appreciable. But all over the final part will be the biggest hit of the series.<br/><br/>It's Oscar Winning Movie. Acting of all the actors are outstanding. Direction of the movie is very good. Music and Special Effects are really mind blowing.<br/><br/>The Perfect End of the series of Harry Potter. I can say that ""It couldn't be better End than this"". It's really a must watch movie."
"tanjotasu","10","4","8","15 July 2011"," Very well done! Huge Spoilers...
","Just got back from watching HP 7.1 and 7.2 back to back. Let me first say that I've never been a fan of HP movies. I preferred the Dumbledore in first two movies. The new one wasn't calm at all, as the one in the book is. So, that had always put me off from the movies.<br/><br/>HP 7.1 - Once I saw it again tonight, I realized how boring the movie was. The story didn't move smoothly. It was as if the director had tried to cover the major plots from the book, but in a very spotty fashion. Also, I noticed how the actors had very blank expressions, and thought maybe it was done to maintain the dark and grim tone. Time and again throughout the movie I found myself picking out details and thinking ""this was changed"".. or ""that whole part was missed!"", etc.<br/><br/>HP 7.2 - The movie started exactly where the last left off. In that regards, it was good that we saw the first part right before this one. Right away I noticed that the flow of the movie was MUCH smoother. After the scene with Griphook and Ollivander, pace was maintained with the Gringotts scene. There were definitely some details missed, but this was the first movie where I didn't find myself being distracted by the differences in the movie and the book. I think it definitely held its own! The dragon sequence was amazing! The scene with Aberforth was done well too. I like how they mirrored his skeptical tone from the book and at that point, I think Daniel Radcliffe showed his improvement as he looked much more in control. There were some elements where I thought ""What!"".. Like when Harry jumped out and challenged Snape... or the long sequence of Harry fighting Voldy in the end.. or how the deaths were kinda skipped over (but still shown for important characters...) However, there were things that I think were done VERY well... such as -> <br/><br/><ul><li>The scene with protections being enabled around the school.. the bit of humor with Prof McG saying that she always wanted to try that spell! </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The scene with the ghost of Ravenclaw. I liked the interaction between Harry and her, as it was to the point, but still mysterious (only readers would've known she was pointing to the Room of Requirement!) </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Snape's memories. Yes i know a LOT was cut out! But I think the important bits all remained. It was cut out extremely efficiently. The bit about the eyes, the doe, his promise to Dumbledore.. I really liked how it was exactly what was needed.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>King's Cross scene. Yes. This was short too. But again... it mentioned exactly what was needed. It moved the story forward with a good pace. Dumbledore explained very well what the dying fragment of soul was..</li></ul><br/><br/>Neville's speech and him killing the snake was a lil long winded. But understandable. It is Hollywood. The ending in the book was rather short. I was hoping that Harry would ""vanish"" like he did in the book and protect his friends. But I guess that would've taken time away from his wrestling match with Voldy.<br/><br/>Another thing I liked towards the end was.. how Voldemort could more and more feel that his Horcruxes were being destroyed (yes I know that was different from the book!).. This in turn made him look weaker and weaker. And at the last minute when Harry ""resurrected"", and Voldy was at his weakest, all his supporters started running away. I think that was good. Not sure that it was in the book. But I loved it. Showed how he was truly defeated, even though he wasn't yet dead.<br/><br/>Overall, for me, this was the only movie in the series which held its own. The rest of them made me pick at details, but this one allowed me the extra edge as a reader, while still enjoying the story. Now I hope JK Rowling loses all her money and has to write 7 more books to become a billionaire again! ;)"
"bencurrey","10","4","8","15 July 2011"," it was amazing
","This movie was amazing, the experience was quite indescribable. Seeing the last two hours of the biggest part of my childhood was painful but the quality of the movie helped ease the pain. It was remarkably well done David Yates was certainly a great pick for this movie and he was light years ahead of Cuaron and Columbus. Although the movie changed some of the original parts, such as the Grey Lady knowing the location of the Diadem instead of Harry figuring it out or the fact that Percy didn't make his grand apology and that they didn't show Fred's death (there are a few more but I don't want to bore you). But I let all these things slide because in the grand picture everything came together seamlessly. The acting was much better, all of the actors matured and had greatly improved (Daniel Radcliffe especially, he's come a long way from the crying scene at the end of the fourth movie.) Best of all they did the book justice and did the scenes just as I had hoped, I thought the scene of Snape's memories was fantastic. All in all this movie was a spectacular end to a spectacular series and a great send off for the Harry Potter franchise."
"Alise_shenle","6","4","8","14 July 2011"," Exciting but Hilarious in a bad way
","So the effects were spectacular--come on, we've all fantasized about how Hogwarts would be torn apart, haha, and how the stone soldiers will fight giants. But it was really funny in an unintended way. 1. Moldy Voldy seems to be a weak doddering old man, with no menacing air at all. 2. Snape makes me want to fall asleep as he talks to s-l-o-w-l-y. But he looked quite handsome when he's in love with Lily Potter, and as a kid. Hehe once in his lifetime probably. 3. Dumbledore looked evil 4. Harry suddenly became really pro at dueling. 5. Ron is a idiot who just states the really obvious 6. Hermione becomes dumber after just one kiss from Ron. 7. Neville suddenly become a hero that always carry his sword around. 8. Prof McGonagall rocks. The funny parts: When Voldy kill Harry, he purposely drag out the ""AVAHDAR KEDAVRA"" which he thinks sounds epic but which really sounds hilarious. Bad dialogue. Voldy: ""the boy who lived..."" no longer? Harry: ""You-know-who"" sucked? Yeah, he sucked. Funny images including baby Harry with the weird lightning scar. When Voldy laughed and kept on repeating Harry Potter's death. seriously the whole cinema laughed. When the death eaters storm into Hogwarts with Harry and giants roll off the cliff--OMG those dumb giants were farming and then they're too fat and roll off, HAHA. When Neville woke up admist the fighting and he looked dazed, really funny. The giant protective sphere being attacked by ""fireworks""--looked like sperms attacking an egg lol. I guess some people will cry because they're sentimental, but to me and my friends, it is just hilariously funny. I love Harry Potter, but to me this seems more like a TV final episode than a stand alone movie."
"dvc5159","7","4","8","13 July 2011"," Time for the main event, Mr. Potter.
","""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part II"" continues directly where Part I leaves off. Part I, standing alone, may easily be the best film in the Potter franchise, because of its faithfulness to the novel and for bringing in superb characterization between the three main characters.<br/><br/>Alas, Part II suffers slightly from lack of back-story from other characters and somewhat rushed action sequences (which really do look intense, to give it credit). But since this is a direct continuation of the story and not a sequel, I guess it can be excused.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's not a bad film. Far from it. It has a good screenplay, witty dialogue, a dark atmosphere throughout, tense direction by David Yates, and good performances from the actors. There's nothing wrong with that at all.<br/><br/>Having said that, there's not much to be said about the movie that is different from the first part, apart from Maggie Smith, Ciaran Hinds and Gary Oldman popping up to complete the cast, some sweeping cinematography and some (not all, some were obviously made for blatant 3D) good visual effects make it quite the exhilarating watch.<br/><br/>There's some things which I didn't like. Recurring characters showing up and suddenly dying (off-screen, no less!) The action sequences were plentiful, but each of them were quite short, in my opinion. The final duel between Harry and Voldemort could have been more epic, too.<br/><br/>However, there are some very good scenes that stand out and overshadows its flaws. Alan Rickman's Snape is fleshed out in a very proper manner and the audience sympathizes with him. Then, Albus Dumbledore returns briefly for an engaging and meaningful final talk with Harry (while the production design for that scene alone has shades of Kubrick). Finally, the film (and the series before it) ends with an epilogue that will surely leave the fans teary-eyed once the credits start to roll.<br/><br/>Is it spectacular? Yes. Kind of. You get what you paid for. Those who walk in the cinema hall without reading the books or watching the previous seven films will be dumbfounded to what is going on in the film. Those who have, and those who endure the series, will find it hard to say goodbye to their beloved characters that they have come to know and love for the past decade.<br/><br/>In short, it's not as great as I expected, but it's not too cheesy and not too overblown, it's actually pretty darn good. And the ending is sentimentally joyful and a fitting farewell to Harry and his friends.<br/><br/>Taking ""Deathly Hallows"" as one entire film, it is a big, grand, epic, dark and emotionally satisfying conclusion to one of the most successful film franchises of all time.<br/><br/>Kudos to J.K. Rowling, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and others. It's been a wild and nostalgic ride, but like all great stories, it all ends here. Farewell to the Boy Who Lived, and may he enchant us again when we revisit him either by book or by Blu-Ray.<br/><br/>Part II rating: 71/100<br/><br/>Part I rating: 75/100<br/><br/>Overall rating for Deathly Hallows: 73/100"
"imkatelyf","10","6","14","13 July 2011"," Awesome.
","OHMYGOD. As a fan who has stuck with them from the first book. I loved it. I found it rather disappointing the way that Voldermorts died. I would have preferred to see that played out as it was in the books. However. That is the only thing i disliked. No film has captivated audiences so much for so long. Alan Rickmans acting was amazing. This movie was amazing no film has had me crying tears of sadness, tears of joy and tears of farewell all in the space of a few hours. I loved it. 13 years i waited to see Ron and Hermione kiss. 13 years well spent in my opinion. Short and sweet review as i was at a midnight showing it's 4am and i'm about to pass out."
"Chalice_Of_Evil","8","6","14","12 July 2011"," Harry Potter pulls his wand out for the last time...
","I was right! The Harry Potter theme's pretty much non-existent at the beginning of this final film in the series (though we still float through the WB logo/film title). Unfortunately, we have to trudge through a recapping of where the previous film finished and some painfully slow exchanges with Olivander and a backstabby goblin. Yes, let's waste time on slow-talking/pointless moments of silence, movie (especially when you have the shortest runtime of the whole series)! Thankfully, things improve when Hermione assumes Bellatrix Lestrange's form so they can break into her vault. Wonderful Helena Bonham Carter doesn't get much to say/do in this film, but she makes up for it by perfectly capturing the facial expressions/demeanor of Hermione awkwardly pretending to be the complete opposite of herself. It's some nice humour in an otherwise pretty serious film.<br/><br/>There's a memorable scene involving a 'Gemino Curse', which causes anything that's touched to double. I felt sorry for the poor dragon that was trained by those nasty goblins to expect pain when it heard a certain sound, so I was happy to see Hermione not only rightfully call that out as 'barbaric', but also set it free, as the trio hitched a ride (and it paid back its tormentors with fire!). The trio eventually reunites with their fellow Gryffindors (an actual *fitting* time for the HP theme), looking for a Horcrux at Hogwarts, but don't know what it actually *is*/where it's located (there's a funny line acknowledging how little they have to go on). Kelly MacDonald's role as Helena Ravenclaw, a ghost who's less annoying than Moaning Myrtle (but still angry...and only vaguely helpful with finding the Horcrux), is small but important/memorable.<br/><br/>It's good to see Luna again (even losing her 'cool' at one point, raising her voice to Harry...not that he didn't deserve it), and apparently Neville has a thing for her. Luckily, Neville's grown more confident over the course of the films and not proves himself worthy of someone as cool as Luna, but also that he's as much a hero as Harry. Ron and Hermione finally express their true feelings for one another...using their tongues, while other characters are lucky to get a line here or there and simply stand around, saying nothing. At least McGonagall had some stand-out moments, both funny (remarking on a spell she's always wanted to use) and showing she means business (putting Slytherin House in its place...namely the dungeon, which felt a bit harsh, lumping an entire House together for the actions of some. Unless it's assumed everyone in Slytherin is a jerk. Seems a tad counterproductive to stick all the 'bad' ones together, doesn't it? This question could've been addressed at the very end of the movie with the discussion of the Sorting Hat's placement of students. Alas, we'll never know).<br/><br/>Draco, who I'd originally thought was going to be a bigger enemy to Harry than he ended up being, doesn't seem to have 'grown' much as a person, remaining his 'foul loathsome evil little cockroach' self (thanks for that description, Hermione...and for punching him in the face that one time) to the end. His best moment here is when Voldemort gives him the most awkward hug ever. While Narcissa plays an important part, in the end the Malfoys scurry away (as you'd expect). One wonders how students are even still getting sent to school considering what a hellhole the place is under Snape's control as Headmaster. We find out that this whole time he hasn't been quite what he seemed...but I still question WHY he had to be such a JERK (even if flashbacks revealing how much he cared for Harry's mother/how much he and Dumbledore knew about what would happen is intended to explain/excuse his behaviour). His ending is somewhat surprising and quite nasty, but the 'reveal' of his true allegiances will probably elicit more of a ""Huh."" reaction than anything else from non-book readers.<br/><br/>There're some mighty big battles (Slytherin's probably thanking McGonagall for sending them to the safety of the dungeon, since Hogwarts takes major damage. Goodbye, Quidditch pitch!), which are quite memorable and result in casualties on both sides. I was most sad to lose Bellatrix (HBC was SO awesome in the role and I found it disappointing/unsatisfying that she got taken out by...Ron's mum. At the very least it should've been Neville who did her in, considering what she did to his parents) Tonks (we hardly knew ye!) and Lavender (might be an unpopular opinion, but I found her entertaining at least). I guess I should've felt sadder about Fred Weasley dying, but didn't they learn anything from how little impact Mad-Eye's off-screen demise had in the last film? There's a point where Voldemort seems to have won and Harry has a spiritual meeting with Dumbledore (gross Voldemort fetus-looking thing alert!), but you *know* Harry will triumph. Harry/Voldemort's 'epic battle' amounts to little more than lightsaber clashing with wands (speaking of, Harry snapped the 'all-powerful' Elder Wand pretty easily).<br/><br/>When the films started, the actors chosen were somewhat awkward in their roles, but they've proven themselves to be the right choices. Radcliffe, Grint and Watson grew up onscreen with these characters and the most effective/emotional moments are with them together, especially at the end. Speaking of, we get an epilogue (that apparently some weren't fond of) where the actors are 'aged up', and I'm glad they did this. Having actors we'd never seen before to play the trio as parents in the final scene of the movie would've been the wrong move, in my opinion, as we would've felt no 'connection' with them. This was an epic movie series with more 'hits' than 'misses', that had so many great British actors/actresses assembled together (the likes of which we're unlikely to see again), and it's nice to get a proper conclusion to a teen movie franchise (when others aren't so lucky). So long, Harry, Ron and Hermione...thanks for the magical memories (and all the obvious 'wand' jokes you inspired)."
"felixvancamp1","1","5","11","30 April 2012"," Not worth it as a movie
","As much as I liked the books, I hated the movies. Although I must admit that The Deathly Hallows part 1 was pretty close to the book, I still didn't like how they split up the movie in two parts of the book. So when I saw Deathly Hallows part 2, it was everything I thought it would be: not much. The entire movie is basically one big scene. I have no idea why they would promote it as an entire movie, because it is just not. Walking out of the cinema I felt disappointed beyond believe. There is nothing that makes this movie ( scene ) special at all. Although I must say that the acting of most of the actors is pretty good. All in all, if you would see this right after Deathly hallows part 1 ( in a marathon kind of way ) it could be okay, but not as a movie on itself."
"MovieFanGuyy","1","12","35","20 July 2011"," Deathly Hallows part 2 is another headache inducing nightmare, thank god the Harry Potter film series is OVER!
","I have never really been a fan of Harry Potter, and I truly do view this series as a passing fad, nothing more. I have never read the books, and I am only reviewing this as a film, nothing more.<br/><br/>Well, folks, we have finally come to the end, the last Harry Potter film, THANK GOD.<br/><br/>How does this film end? Not well. Instead of a coherent story, we get flashbacks and other excuses for a lack of a decent script this time around.<br/><br/>The plot, or lack there of, finds Mr. Potter and his two friends looking for pieces of the villain Voldemort's soul while at the same time, their boarding school is attacked by minions of his enemy.<br/><br/>What should be an exciting scene, or battle, instead becomes a frustrating experience, with scenes cutting back and fourth, back and fourth. We get a scene with Harry, then cut back to the ""battle"" over the school, then back to Harry, we see people seriously injured or dead, but we don't know how. That is another reason why these films are so frustrating to watch, because a person should not have to read a book to know what is going on.<br/><br/>Another case in point, Voldemort clearly kills Harry Potter at one point, but then he ""miraculously"" comes back to life, and in their final wand fight, Harry clearly kills his adversary, but the film clearly doesn't not explain why very well.<br/><br/>I found the ending completely anti-climatic, confusing, and dull as well. Even worse, many of the performances are completely wooden, including Harry's red headed girlfriend. At the end of the film, which takes place 20 years later, she looks about as uninteresting as a person can be.<br/><br/>I'm sure that many Potter fanatics will disagree with my review of this film and the others in the series, but oh well, I'm entitled to my opinion and I am sticking with it and I always will.<br/><br/>The Potter films have always been a frustrating and dull experience for me and this film is no different. Give me the Chronicles of Narnia any day over these headaches any day. The best thing I can say about Deathly Hallows parts 1 and 2 is that Harry Potter is FINALLY OVER. Thank goodness! Please Academy, ignore this tripe and give the awards to far better films this year!<br/><br/>Overall this film is FFO, For Fans Only, nothing else!"
"sorenmike","10","2","3","24 August 2018"," It's amazing to see how far it's come
","This is a movie I cannot stop watching. We've come so far with this series, and seeing it end in such a brilliant way was just awesome. It was amazing to see the growth of Daniel, Rupert and Emma in their performances as the big three, classic actors like Alan Rickman (RIP), and many others. I can't wait to see the future of this franchise with Fantastic Beasts and future projects Rowling can cook up."
"AnishMisra","10","2","3","13 July 2018"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 Review
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a film directed by David Yates. This film just firmed up my belief that however good or bad the start is the ending of any story should be shockingly awesome.<br/><br/>Plot: Harry Potter and his friends decide to stop Voldemort and the Death Eaters once and for all.<br/><br/>Story and direction: This film is much shorter in comparison to the other parts (130 minutes). And this is actually justified because all of the setting up was done in the past 7 movies. Here we jump straight into the action. I would like to commend on the action sequences. They felt every real and each and every time I felt scared for the characters in that particular scene. The film is fast paced and not much time is wasted. The set design and cinematography is just awesome. I can just go on about the wonderful score by Alexandre Desplat. Also, the VFX is just the best of the entire series. I was just gobsmacked by the improvement the series hads shown in the VFX department. The level of maturity these characters have is very well defined in certain scenes. There are certain scenes in the film that make sense in this final part that are explained very well without deviating from the tension in the film. And I have to commend the makers on splitting up the novel into 2 parts. This was needed as many storylines and plot arcs have to be wrapped up. This film just brings the storyline to an end so beautifully that I couldn't fault the film for one moment.<br/><br/>Performances: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as usual are great. Maggie Smith has some scenes in which she was great. Ralph Fiennes was in his best form as Voldemort. The same can be said for Helena Bonham Carter and Micheal Gambon. It was also good to have certain actors back for this one epic battle.<br/><br/>Favorite Scene: It would be the one where Snape orders the students to give up anything they know about Harry Potter's whereabouts. Then Harry steps up and challenges Snape and Minerva comes to the rescue. This scene was just amazing on another level as I saw a battle that I may have been waiting for since the last instalment.<br/><br/>Verdict: This film is just great on so many levels. I honestly can say that in each and every scene I had goosebumps. This film series ends on a great note and delivers a very satisfying finale. This film series should be a lesson to some people on how greatness, novelty and creativity when mixed together provide an art that just cannot be forgotten and is just relished by the person watching it. My heartiest congratulations to the team of Harry Potter on celebrating our favourite characters in the best way possible.<br/><br/>I am going with a perfect 10."
"romano-49857","2","2","3","19 March 2016"," Complete disgrace
","This movie (the 2 parts) is an absolute disgrace. It does not respect the book, it does not respect the world of Harry Potter. It's just a big joke, they decided to cut half of the book, including some important scenes, but they also decided to change what happens and when it happens. They added stuff and made some impossible things possible in the movie. In the end, it's a movie showing off all you can do special effect-wise, they focused on that and chose the scenes they would do from the books based on whether they would allow theme to show off or not, and left big chunks of the story. I re-read the book just before and it's just a shocking movie in the end. I can not believe JK Rowling said yes to that. She must really like money. But it's not like it's a new thing in the Harry Potter series. Half of the movies are lame, disrespectful to the original world, and focused on minor parts while leaving important story parts left abandoned."
"lastdomino","5","2","3","27 December 2014"," Alan Rickman - Yes! The rest of movie - NO!
","Alan Rickman did an awesome job with his portion of the story - his character was never separate from the book character. But the story was so rewritten as to miss many points that were important to the story. I understand how writers want to make the story their own from the original book writer but the value in the story comes from characters. Harry Potter was an introvert played by an extrovert actor. There were bits of the story from the book such as the final between Voldemort and Harry that went so much deeper to me in the book. Some of that value was lost in how the film portrayed the scene.<br/><br/>Many shots were filmed so dark as to be almost too dark to be seen. It was a dark story but did not need this lack of creative styling. As much as I love the books is how much I hate this film.<br/><br/>The only other positive credit I would give this film was to return to John William's music for the final scene into the beginning of the end credits! Because I appreciated Rickman's and William's parts, I gave higher points than this film deserved."
"felix-bergman","5","2","3","18 April 2014"," Falls short for expectations
","In some cases it is unfair to compare a movie to the book from which it was adopted, but when you split a movie into two parts to get as much of the story onto the screen, I see no excuse for a bad adaptation. After waiting years for this finale and after reading all the books, I was sure nothing could be bad about this, until I started watching that is. The first half hour - hour or so is not only quite accurate, but also really good, but as the Battle of Hogwats begins everything go downhill. It is all just a blur of people running around screaming and shouting inaudible curses at each other until all the character you should care about, but can't in this mess, are dead and not even after the battle has ended do we get to see what happened to all the people we worried about and that at least I felt sorry for while reading the book."
"cj_flying_dutchman","5","2","3","6 April 2014"," What is the point of making a two-part movie if you still can't put everything that matters in?
","The 2nd part of JKR's best book, proved to be a quite mediocre film, directed in the wrong way and having also the script too much alternated. The first film was OK, although they wasted too much time. They could have begun directly in the 2nd movie with the Battle of Howgarts, saving time for their precious 2 hours and 15 minutes of the second instalment..<br/><br/>Seriously, you can't have the first movie longer than the second, when the first one serves as the background and the hors d'oeuvre for the second one. The first occupies 147 minutes of watch time, while the second only 130. Can someone tell us why the probably most important movie of the eight is at the same time one of the shortest ones? Why, Mr. Yates? It just doesn't make sense at all...<br/><br/>The good points: -The scene where Snape dies,done in the boathouse rather than the Shrieking Shack. -The adding of the Chamber of Secrets scene, and the kiss between Ron and Hermione. -The Statues scene and the whole fortification of Hogwarts was done in a nice mode.<br/><br/>The bad points: -Snape's memories. Although a good effort was made, they still have excluded important pieces, such as the memory in which Snape communicates with Dumbledore's portrait, for instructions regarding the Sword of Griggindor, and how Snape learned by Phineas Nigellius's portrait of the forest's location. We also don't see the scene where Snape confounds Mundungus after he tells him for the Plan of the 7 Potters, the scene when Snape accidentally cuts George Weasley's ear, the scene when Snape reads Lily's letter and the scene where Snape and Lily meet James, Sirius and Lupin.<br/><br/>-The terrible alteration of the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. It SHOULD have been done in the Great Hall, as in the book, and in the middle of the crowd, with everyone holding their breaths, as they moved in circles. Furthermore, nearly the entire explanation for the Elder Wand not serving Voldemort is omitted. We do not hear how it passed from Dumbledore to Draco, and finally to Harry and the rest of the dialogue which explains all. We only hear the explanation in the end, to Ron and Hermione. This is probably the most attended scene of all 7 books, and it is destroyed.<br/><br/>-We do not learn how the Cloak came into possession of Harry, and generally the Deathly Hallows' importance is not mentioned as they should be.<br/><br/>-We do not understand how come Harry is still alive after 2 Killing Curses. Explained in the book, not in the film. <br/><br/>-The Helena Ravenclaw scene could have been done better.<br/><br/>-Neville's speech was good, but they should have put instead the Sorting Hat scene. And how comes he know that Nagini must die? Whereas in the book Harry tells him, in the film he does not. And why include Ron and Hermione to its chase?<br/><br/>-We do not see Harry under the Cloak, and afterwards himself to defend Molly.<br/><br/>-Fred Weasley's death scene was omitted. Seeing him only in the Great Hall with the rest of his family mourning him is not enough. We should have seen it, since he was an important character. Instead of the bridge explosion, they could have given at least 30 seconds to honour Fred. And besides, we do not even hear which one of the twins died. Fred or George? George or Fred?<br/><br/>-No aftermath shouts of gratefulness for Harry in the Great Hall. Everyone is so busy doing other things, rather than making a standing ovation for the man that saved them countless times..<br/><br/>-You cannot possibly snap the Elder Wand and throw it away! No Dumbledore portrait congratulations after the battle, no standing ovation from the portraits and neither do we see Harry returning it to Albus, to his tomb. So, according to the film, Harry is left with with Draco's Wand? Why do we not see Harry repair his beloved phoenix wand with the Elder Wand? We do not even hear the final quote of the 17 year old Harry ""That wand's more trouble than it's worth. And quite honestly, I've had enough trouble for a lifetime."" Pity..<br/><br/>-The battle was too short! The vast majority of the duels in the battle is omitted. Most important, no Bellatrix vs Hermione+Ginny+Luna, no Voldemort vs McGonagall+Slughorn+Kingley. Why?<br/><br/>-The confrontation between the Carrows and Harry with McGonagall is missing. No elves, or centaurs, or thestrals either, and mainly, no Trelawney.<br/><br/>-No mention of Colin Creevey dying.<br/><br/>-Voldemort and Bellatrix are turned into dust when they die. Seriously?<br/><br/>-In the King's Cross scene, we do not see the dialogue up to the point that we can forgive Dumbledore as in the book and a large portion of it is missing. No mention of the Aberforth-Albus-Arianna-Grindelwald story.<br/><br/>-In the scene for the 19 years after, I feel that they should have used adult actors. And they could have included some more details, such as the mention of Neville being Professor. Too cheerful scene, when in the book is not.<br/><br/>-Teddy Lupin's role is notoriously missing.<br/><br/>The conclusion to the review is that in little more than 4 hours, many of the most important features of the book were missing and the magic of the book is never seen in the second movie. I am conscious that I just watch a cinema movie. I am not feeling that i am part of the battle of the rest of it. I do not get the sense of mystery and excitement I was getting in the previous films. A whole generation was obviously expecting something much better. If you have never read the books, it is a pleasant film. If you have read them, you will be absolutely disappointed. So much for 2 parts..."
"saad-azam4-719-547239","7","2","3","4 April 2014"," Great
","Harry Potter and Deathly Hallows part 2, directed by David Yates is a thriller and an adventure film, based on J.K.Rowlings novel. It stars the same actors as all the others: Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint; Emma Watson the three wizards on the hunt for the horcruxes which are the magical items that must be searched and destroyed as they are the keys to Voldermorts existence, it is vital to destroy them before the dark lord finds them. The action begins with the fight between good and evil, who will win? This is the last of the eight and is surely the one to sum it up with its gripping action and strong plot which gives you different ideas to how it may end. With different directors each time, this director made an impression which will last, besides first impressions always last. Compared to part 1 of Deathly Hallows which did more talking rather than fighting, but this one is the completely opposite. Harry confronting his enemy and with sacrifices, loyalty and betrayal it all spells out disaster. This is how Rowling puts the pieces together to make the Harry Potter a book for everyone, who knew it, would even get adults crying. Also what I think was great about this film was the clever music, which was very eerie and simple which gave every scene its clutch. We also get to see some of the new enemies such as the dragons, voldermorts gang as well as Snape's motives, who is what good or bad? As the film goes on we get an understanding of why Snape took the actions he did, this is what I like about Rowling how she turned a misunderstood character into a hero. Voldermort is another one which will catch you out as the fact that he is similar to Harry. When Harry is knocked out by Voldermort and meets Dumbledore who explains without Harry's existence there would be no Voldermort due to the fact that harry is the last horcruxe. This was again very clever of Rowling how she explains why harry can sense voldermorts feelings and why he can speak snake language which all begins to make sense. I personally felt that Snapes scene where Harry sees his past was the most emotional and most felt part, as you see a part of Snape which we didn't see before, how he was madly in love with Harry's mother, bullied by Harry's father and what he did to sacrifice his life for Harry. When Harry has to fight Voldermort, the first thing that came to my mind was that Harry might die because you don't know what is going to happen next. The director has been able to build tension throughout the film. He has been able to draw the attention of the audience into the most important scenes throughout the film. Another thing which the director did that court my attention was his creativity with the special effects and what summed it all up was putting it up in 3D which brought the whole thing to life. It made fans of Harry Potter such as I feel surrounded in the magical world of wizardry, which is a great experience to have if you love Harry Potter like I do. What I think may have been a spoiler was the fact that not everything written in the book was mentioned in the film and this is a real shame. Also the fact that everyone else in Gryffindor is allowed to fight except from slithering who were locked in the dungeons and were not allowed to fight and there wasn't enough interaction with the characters as when Fred (cousin to Ron) dies there isn't any sympathy not even from Harry. Other than these negative the rest of the film was great and was rated 8 out of 10 for everything also with 408 critics which gave more ratings, no wonder this was the best film of 2011. But a positive would be that the directors kept the same actors for all 8 films as we have seen them grow from young children into adults. Also the battle at Hogwarts was very heart grabbing as we saw a lot of character's who gave themselves up especially Neville who did all he can do protect harry which I thought was perfected as this was the exact same thing that was written in the book about him. The ending was where we all got the message that this is it, there isn't any more of the Harry Potter adventures when harry and his wife (Ron's sister) and Ron with Herminie sending their children off to Hogwarts, we sense that this is it for Mr Potter. This is a great way to say farewell to the Harry Potter adventures along with this film this one made it worthwhile as it started and ended with action what is more we got a better understanding of Harry Potter and all the characters. If I were to rate this film it would be ten out of ten so if you are thinking of watching it then you should."

","(Read PS first, if you please.) This final HP halfway makes it. Yes, we all love HP. Yes, all the films have been done with great style. Still, there was an onus on DH2, and Yates (and screenplay) miss here and there. - On the plus side, Radcliffe finally becomes a real actor. - On the plusser side, Rickman is BRILLIANT and he was robbed of a supporting Oscar. - Bad news (and, as with other quibbles, the movies should stand independently from the books): Bellatrix. She is equal to Vol in sheer evil, and she is grossly responsible for many gleeful murders and tortures. It's fine to have Molly kill her, but the moment was far, far too brief. This needed to be real revenge, to satisfy fans so hating of LeStrange. - The Kings Cross limbo. Egad. I know it's in the book, I know Albus needs to redeem himself to Harry, but the device was annoying and trite. - The Ravenclaw ghost scene was far too protracted. Yes, there had to be suspense about getting this horcrux, but it felt overdone. - Dumbledore's mysterious past and hunger for power: why allude to it strongly, then leave nothing answered? It was like the Bagstock presence in DH1. We movie watchers knew it was important, but the film did not clarify how. - Finally, the end. In LOTR, Jackson understood the audience needed to hear Frodo stop in wonderment, that the ring was gone. Same thing. When the 3 friends are kicking stones around, there had to be SOME expression relating that a vast doom that's haunted them all (and the world) was gone. Not too much, mind you, but some astonishment from Harry, certainly. - Epilogue. So, it was all about the kids? Generation Next? How dull. Better to have only referred to Harry's naming his son after Severus, which was right and touching. PS More bad: how, if you don't read the book, can you rationalize Harry being alive after the forest? All we know is The Vol throws the killing spell, not the kill-unintentional-horcrux spell. Also - far too much of gratuitous, aimless running around of students during and before the battle. Seriously. These kids all acted like they had no idea of what was going on, and were utterly defenseless. Oh, yes: the script itself. It's pretty weak. Maybe Neville's awful speech is how teens talk, but this needed to be stunning, not trite. PS Read the books. Egad. Makes Helena Ravenclaw's ghost worse here, and why on earth is she referring to a 'boy' who wanted to destroy the diadem in the past, when there was no need to destroy it before Riddle, the boy, got it to begin with? Lots of mistakes now really glaring, and the lamest part of the film is that it fails to explain Harry's sacrifice properly, as it echoed his mother's. WHY, oh, why, did they not want the tension of the final duel in the film, and that wonderful bit with Harry calling V by his real name, and schooling him? This humiliation of V then makes his quick death all right. I know a film must make changes, but to ignore the very best of the book is just plain criminal."

"jon.h.ochiai","10","2","3","2 August 2011"," The Hero's Destiny
","In the darkened misty Forbidden Forest, Daniel Radcliffe as avatar Harry Potter reunites with the dearly fallen in his journey, in possession of the Resurrection Stone. Surrendering to his destiny, Harry asks, ""Does it hurt to die?"" His mother Lily Potter (gentle and strong Geraldine Somerville), who sacrificed her life to protect her son from the dark Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes), tells her beloved son, ""We never left."" Neither did us, after 10 years and 8 movies. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" has remarkable gravitas boldly embracing mortality and destiny. Director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves poignantly complete the hero's journey in the eternal conflict of good and evil.<br/><br/>Also coming full circle with J.K. Rowling's earlier books, ""Deathly Hallows 2"" is a return to the realm of wonder and possibility. At the narrative arc with Harry in spiritual transformation, his late mentor Dumbledore (powerfully calm Michael Gambon) reminds Harry to pity the living, and those without love. The resonance of ""Harry Potter"" is that the most powerful magic is love. And I have not read the Rowling's novels, only seen the movies. Alan Rickman as the seemingly duplicitous Severus Snape is awesome in the story's provocative twist. Harry had witnessed Snape murder Dumbledore, before assuming his post has Headmaster at Hogwarts. However, much like life: All is not what it seems. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is the timeless tale of love, honor, and redemption.<br/><br/>The ""Harry Potter"" movies strong suit has always been the supporting cast, and ""Deathly Hallows 2"" is the culmination. Ralph Fiennes is the visceral commanding dark force, yet nuanced in his malevolence. His performance forges the rage and inner power in Daniel Radcliffe's evolution of Harry. Radcliffe has matured into a strong actor. Harry's journey has always been about rediscovering his true power, and reconciling his darkness and fear. Michael Gambon even in abbreviated presence brilliantly fosters the possibility of the man Harry will become. Alan Rickman as Snape virtually steals the show in an authentic display of courage and compassion all veiled in darkness. Emma Watson has grown into a compelling actor, who wields deceptive strength and presence as her Hermione has evolved into a young woman. With Rupert Grint it is difficult to distinguish, whether he is really doing anything special or that he is so present as Ron Weasley.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is leveled with high spirited action and vibrantly paced, as opposed to the deathly slow pacing of Part 1. There is the spectacular siege of Hogwarts by Voldermort and his minions. Yates creates amazing catharsis as Harry confronts his fate as he takes on the Dark Lord, ""Let's finish this the way we started it."" Harry, Hermione, and Ron must destroy all the Horcruxes that possess vestiges of Voldermort's soul, the leverage point of his immortality. But Voldermort must kill Harry Potter before he can become the Master of Death. Here destiny and conspiracy blur. The profound battle of good and evil and the possession of Harry's very soul are left in the powerful and convincing performances of Fiennes, Rickman and Gambon. Like Harry's Mother reminds, ""Harry, you are so lovedÂ…"" We were always for Harry, and will always be."

Daniel made an incredible job in portraying Harry Potter. Rupert is so funny, he made Ron Weasley a great man. Emma as Hermoine is the BEST! She did an amazing job in every movie especially in this movie where she gave 200% of her effort! The sounds and the visual are great. The effects are so amazing, every scene is worth the watch. The other cast is great as well as the main characters. Everything in the movie was magnificent! The directors, producers and every staff made a wonderful job.

","With the amount of money thrown at this franchise, David Yates had practically anything he wanted at his disposal. This definitely goes to show in the visual and technical elements of the film:- great sets, props, special fx, visual fx, camera-work, music.<br/><br/>What always lets a film down? Storytelling.<br/><br/>So many missed opportunities and odd decisions.<br/><br/>Perhaps my biggest 'er, why?' moment was when I realised they weren't going to take Harry & Voldy inside, but no, just have him dissolve into little pieces without anyone watching. It had so little impact I felt grumpy right then! This was the moment that 7, yes SEVEN films have been building to!!! This is not LotR but take a cue from Peter Jackson, David Yates! This moment is meant to be EXPLOSIVE!<br/><br/>I'll leave it there as others have pointed out the rest of the pros and cons.<br/><br/>See excellent reviews by DoctorBatmanPotter & akash_sebastian for a full list of the Good, the Bad and the Ugly."
"michelle-lynn13","Null","2","3","26 July 2011"," Yates Does It Again! Another Disappointment for Fans of the Books!
","So, like all the David Yates films, Deathly Hallows, part 2 is an action film, but Harry Potter is about more than action. I blame both David Yates and Steve Kloves. I think Kloves lost sight of the fact that the books are character driven, not action driven. The Snape memories could have been and should have been more robust, allowing us to really see Snape's love for Lilly Potter and also his loyalty to Dumbledore, his distaste for Dumbledore's seeming willingness to offer Harry as a sacrifice for the greater good and not to mention his own conflict with having agreed to kill Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Which brings me to Dumbledore's back-story...there was nothing mentioned about Gellert Grindelwald and his relationship with Dumbledore. The back-story between Grindelwald and Dumbledore would have explained the conflict between Aberforth, Albus, and Ariana, as well as how Dumbledore came to possess the Elder Wand. Which had any of that been included, it would have explained the lore and lure of the Elder Wand."" Yates/Kloves left out the significance all together of the Deathly Hallows which is the title! They left out that Harry was a descendant of Ignotus Peverell , one of the three brothers that created the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>Because Yates/Kloves had not shown anything about the developing relationship in DH part 1 between Kreecher the House Elf and Harry, (Harry gave the replica of the necklace to Kreecher, which then endeared Kreecher to Harry, so much so that the house had been cleaned and Kreecher was making meals for our three heroes), there was no moment depicting how the House Elves of Hogwarts, lead by Kreecher also came together to fight against Voldemort.<br/><br/>The final battle where Molly Weasely goes after Bellatrix - I was so looking forward to that and we were only shown the one line ""NOT MY DAUGHTER YOU BITCH!"" But what about the rest of the duel when a few students were coming to her aid and she said, ""Get back! Get back! She's Mine!"" And Bellatrix retorted taunting ""What will happen to your children when I've killed you?"" and ""When Mummy's gone the same way as Freddie?"" And Molly yells back, ""You - will - never - touch - our -children - again."" There were many powerful moments during the final battle in the book with other characters besides Harry. What about the final dance between Harry and Voldemort as they circled each other in the Great Hall with the others pausing to watch, when Harry lays it all out for Tom Riddle Harry: ""You won't be killing anyone else tonight. You won't be able to kill any of them ever again. Don't you get it? I was ready to die to stop you from hurting these people - "" Voldemort: ""But you did not!"" Harry: ""-I meant to, and that's what did it. I've done what my mother did. They're protected from you. Haven't you noticed how none of the spells you put on them are binding? You can't torture them. You can't touch them. You don't learn from your mistakes, Riddle, do you?"" Voldemort :""You dare - "" Harry replying ""Yes I dare!"" And going on....Harry whispers, ""So it all comes down to this, doesn't it? Does the wand in your hand know its last master was Disarmed? Because if it does...I am the true master of the Elder Wand.""<br/><br/>That would have been great to see...seeing Voldemort realize just how much he had gotten wrong and how he had been defeated. The final curses yelled (in the book) were ""Avada Kedavra"" from Voldemort and ""Expelliarmus"" from Harry, and because of the Elder Wand's true loyalty, the spell backfires on Voldemort and he essentially kills himself as the Elder Wand is driven from his hand into the hands of its rightful master, Harry. Instead we got a twenty second explanation on the bridge and the Elder Wand snapped in half.<br/><br/>The epilogue was reduced to smiles and nods from ""older"" looking Harry and friends, but made no mention of Teddy Lupin, of Harry having been made his Godfather, of Harry and Jinny deciding to take Teddy on full-time, as he and little James were best friends. Malfoy looked over at Harry with a smile? No, no, no...Malfoy and his family shrank away from the final battle and in the book, he demonstrated more contrition when nodding at Harry on the platform. They had also left out that during the final battle, Ron and Harry had saved Draco's life twice...which added to the meaning of the look he gave Harry on the platform as described by Rowling in the book. Yates and Kloves really dropped the ball.<br/><br/>It really was disappointing that Fred's death was handled so dismissively. He deserved better.<br/><br/>Where was Grawp, Hagrid's brother? He helped in the final battle.<br/><br/>The final conversation that Harry had with Dumbledore's portrait, in the headmaster's office, where he tells Dumbledore that he dropped the stone in the forest, and asked about the power of the wand dying with him if he put it back where it came from and then he repaired his own wand. Oddly, there was a moment when Draco alluded to how using his mother's wand wasn't the same as using his own...which is why Harry held on to the broken pieces of his own wand and used the Elder Wand to repair it. That was all left out.<br/><br/>There were so many parts left out and replaced with scenes that were never part of the book and it needn't have been that way. I wonder if J.K. Rowling is happy with the movies, seeing how they were all (with the exception of the first two directed by Christopher Columbus) butcheries of her great fantastic words. If I'd have been the author, I'd be upset. Perhaps, if you've never read the books, you might have enjoyed the movies more. But to me, we were cheated."

Why did Snape join the Death Eaters? Why did Albus's brother hated him? Why did people think that Albus was evil?"

","Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 is the epic conclusion to the movie series, and the final piece of the Harry Potter lore. It was a great and heart touching send off, with many tears shed.<br/><br/>The movie clocks in at 2 hours and 10 minutes, but I really wanted it to be much longer than that. For a final movie that says good bye to the characters, a lot was cut out from the book, and many deaths of important characters( not spoiling who ) were not, how do I say, good enough. You'll see. <br/><br/>Reading the book, I almost cried because the preparation for the epic battle was awesome, and the battle itself ( in the book ) was explosive, full of action, and full of tears, laughter, and danger.<br/><br/>In the movie however, the battles take place in the background, while the Harry and the crew go and hunt onward. This scaled the epicness back for me, and had me wanting more. The book explained much more in detail, and I hadn't read the book, I would have been lost. My friend hadn't, and all he did was ask questions after the film was over.<br/><br/>The movie was a good time, a sad time, and a good enough send off to this series of wizards and witches. I just wish it had more substance, more to give the series an epic final goodbye, like the Lord of the Rings series did. I'll take it for what it is, and this film will be remembered for a long time."
"saurabh_dashora4091","10","2","3","23 July 2011"," Magical Ending to a Magical Series
","****MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS******* The finale that we've all been waiting for is finally here and surprisingly, we get the best HP film to date. It is like a final spell that concludes the entire efforts of a decade to perfection. <br/><br/>There are several reasons for this being probably the best movie in the series but the greatest one is undoubtedly, the elevation I have seen in Harry's character. From a teenager struggling against the odds, he has risen above the masses of his Hogwarts co-students, to the level of a great wizard who can look into the eye of the most terrible dark wizard of all time and challenge him for combat to death. This change of tone in Harry's character was displayed right from the moment he spoke to Ollivander that he is gonna get Voldemort anyhow and this made the movie so much better than any that preceded it. It was at this moment that one realizes that Harry has changed into an action hero who is not going to give up at any cost. That is why the entire movie is worked in a direction so different from Rowling's presentation in the books that I end up feeling that I'm watching an altogether original movie and found it equally enjoyable as the book. And what's more--we get a tremendous dose of Voldemort's character (superbly done by Ralph Fiennes) which makes the movie very focused. This movie is all about the two most important characters in the book (Harry and Voldemort) and their battle to death. <br/><br/>Many people have grievances against this direction. Some of the other characters have been left behind and not much has been shown about what happened to them. However, I found it perfect for this movie. For 10 years we have waited for the final showdown between Harry and Voldemort. Everything that had happened had led to this moment and Yates ensured that we get uninterrupted supply of that throughout the movie.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe was stunning as HP. And for the first time i felt that no one could have carried the role better (even if you consider the brief prologue--he looked perfect as the guy who beat the greatest dark wizard of all time). He was running up and down the castle spurring the proceedings and the people into action and the atmospheric build up before the Battle of Hogwarts was filmed with great detail.<br/><br/>Voldemort gets his best role in the series and he shines perfectly. I find this villain very convincing--more than even Rowling's portrayal. Taking nothing away from the books, I found that Rowling, somehow, ended up making Voldemort look like a fool in the final part. She was not able to grow Harry's character into an adult and it felt like the mighty Voldemort couldn't even handle a bunch of kids properly and neither protect his horcruxes. However, in the movie, Yates chose an intelligent path. With each horcrux getting destroyed, we see Voldemort struggling and feeling the pain. It was like he was getting stabbed repeatedly and this made him look more and more vulnerable. Also, he was feeling frustrated because nothing was going according to his plan-- his wand was not doing well and Harry was becoming stronger by the minute. And hence it became completely believable when Harry became alive again and we see the despair in Voldemort's eyes and then we see him kicking and punching Harry rather than using magic. This defeated Voldemort mentally and this makes us believe that he can now finally die. This was not evident in the books and there we see a clever and completely powerful Voldemort getting foxed by a kid who doesn't even know magic. Whether you would like this move or not would all depend on which interpretation you like. <br/><br/>This movie had several touchy moments which made me swell emotionally within (specially Snape's memories which were portrayed quite perfectly). Not everything from book can be translated on reel but most things were pretty good. It was no nonsense and a lean but efficient direction by Yates who was able to condense the vast number of pages into a gripping tale that doesn't deviate from its motive which was to beat Voldemort once and for all.<br/><br/>The ending was also quite different from what I had expected and again I felt that it was better suited to the overall tone of the film. I have found people who have complained thatin the book everybody cheered when Voldemort died. Here, everything was rather quite as we see Harry roaming among the injured people who were silently happy (as if after a storm had passed). Almost every person had lost something in the battle and even though they are happy but they don't feel the energy or the emotion to celebrate. This felt more natural somehow.<br/><br/>Although it was a near perfect movie but there were a few things that could have been better. On the level of story, the final fight sequence could have been 5 minutes longer just to expand on the epic feel of the whole Harry vs Voldemort thing. Some more screen time should have been given to Harry and Ginny's relationship. After all, in later life Ginny would be the most important person for Harry and in fact, the first true family Harry would come to have. This being the story of Harry Potter, Ginny automatically becomes important as the love interest of the central character. <br/><br/>However, in the end, this takes nothing away from the movie on the whole. The only bad part is that things have finally ended and it was too sad a moment for me and i'm sure for many other fans because we won't get any more Harry Potter--the boy who lived and defined our childhood in many ways."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 as far as special effects and 3d were concerned were quite spectacular. The story and the acting were also very much head and shoulders above that of when the young actors started the franchise. I have to say I really enjoyed this film but that's only because I had a Harry Potter translator to get my through it. I have never read the books so my only look into the life of Harry Potter is through the films and as they are films they can only ever be adaptations from a much larger story that wouldn't be feasible in film to try and recreate. However with the story stretching over eight films now you would think there would have been a little bit more explanation as to why everything was happening. I got a general outline of why but no depth into what I have been told is a very well thought out and deep set of books. Don't get me wrong I really enjoyed the film I am just saying it could of been closer to a great film if there had been just a little bit more time filling in the cracks in the Plot. I'll finish with this Harry potter book fans will love this Harry Potter film fans get the book fans to explain why things are happening and sit back and enjoy its wizarding goodness."

"Lifexinxrewind","9","2","3","18 July 2011"," Satisfying Finale to the Series
","10 years after it began, the Harry Potter franchise has achieved something unheard of in film. Never before have we seen a film series that has not only kept up the overall quality through this many installments, but it actually got better as it went. There was never a bad Harry Potter film, and we can expect that there never will be. Whether ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is really the pinnacle of film making for the series is debatable, but what isn't debatable is that it resolves this elaborately crafted story in fitting fashion, one that will surely please anyone who made it this far.<br/><br/>It is hard to rate this final installment by itself. Since it is really the second half of a movie that was split up because of time constraints, it's really more appropriate to combine both parts of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"" into one when judging it on quality. I enjoyed Part 1 a lot, feeling that although it lacked some of the excitement and wonder of the best of the series, the increasingly dark atmosphere and fantastic performances made it a worthwhile film. While Part 1 did feature far more character development, it paid off in setting up all the action and heroics that are seen in Part 2. Together, they make a marvelous picture, even if they do need each other to achieve proper balance.<br/><br/>Part 2 does feature the same solid direction and scoring we've come to expect from the Harry Potter films, and since 7 films of character building has led to this, the film makers don't have to worry about us caring about the outcome. The length is just right, not feeling rushed or letting things cool down too much. Most of the secondary characters get their moment in the sun, properly closing arcs in dramatic (if sometimes predictable) fashion. What really sets this film apart is the truly excellent backstory segment seen 2/3 through. Beautifully filmed and edited, it ties the entire saga together to give even more depth and meaning to everything that has come before. Alan Rickman shows once again what a brilliant casting choice he was back in 2001, as he in my opinion has been the backbone of the series, commanding our attention in every scene he has ever been in.<br/><br/>In the previous 7 films, we as an audience never really got to see the epic scope that the story promised. We caught a glimpse at the end of ""Order of the Phoenix"", but Part 2 definitely brings the heat. A convincing courtyard battle sets the stage in grand fashion. There is finally some proper consequences to all the threatening the villains do, which is much appreciated. It makes the series as a whole far more compelling when there are sacrifices on both sides and not every character is made to be simply black or white on the morality scale. Indeed, some of the most interesting material in this film has to do with a character who isn't even alive to see it.<br/><br/>Is ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" the best Harry Potter film ever? It is easily one of the most exciting, engaging films of the series, and the scope is unmatched. The effort put forth to send the series off in admirable fashion is clear. It's hard to imagine anyone having a negative reaction to it, something that no previous installment can claim. I would still put my money on ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" as the overall strongest Harry Potter film for a few reasons, but this definitely not far behind. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is a terrific ending to the series. Overall score: 8.5/10"
"BigWhiskers","9","2","3","17 July 2011"," Wonderful movie and I've never read the books
","A wonderful movie and when Snape is dying I got choked up even more so when Harry finally sees who Snape really is and why he acted the way he did towards Harry. A lot of fighting that is brutal and graphic and also very sad when you see who dies. There is a scene of the death eater who is a werewolf gnawing at Luna Lovegoods dead corpse which gave me chills until Harry blasts him out the window which I applauded. Also the duels between Mcgonagall and Snape and Molly Weasley and Bellatrix that are scene stealer's. I loved how Mrs Weasley went ballistic on Bellatrix after she nearly kills Ginny. And tough old broad Maggie Smith shows you why you shouldn't mess with McGonagall - now whether or not Snape had no attention of fighting back, she really lays into him with some serious curses regardless. I wish though that they could have had a better ending , I blame that on Rowling who simply ended it without any wrap-up to the surviving characters -even though I didn't read any of the books i had to see how she ended it compared to the movies ending and its the same so i couldn't blame it all on the people who adapted the book to a movie although from what I've heard from the people who were devoted Potter fans who read the books that a lot of stuff was either cut out or redone differently and really ticked off a lot of the more devoted fans of the books. I can sympathize with that as I thought Lord of The Rings overblown inclusion of Arwen when she was barley mentioned in the books to be more so for the hormone ravaged young boys to gawk at than any real importance .And while the epilogue ending written by Rowling is meant to be heartfelt and sentimental , it was not really fitting in my opinion .skipping ahead 19 years for some reason ,why 19 who knows but it felt forced,with little dialog and no real chemistry between the characters,the makeup effects to make them look older were rather poor and that is why i give this movie a 9 and not a 10."
"jfgibson73","Null","2","3","17 July 2011"," Scene by Scene Spoilers
","I'm going to rate this movie very high because of all the work that went into it. It is a very detailed, impressive movie in a visual sense. The story follows the book pretty closely, with a few minor changes that I didn't think detracted much. Most of the movie worked very well. I'll go through each sequence: <br/><br/>1. Shell Cottage -- My favorite thing here was the cottage itself. I didn't really understand, in the book, why it was so important for Harry to decide between finding the Deathly Hallows or destroying the Horcruxes. A big problem I had with the book was all the backstory given to the Hallows, only for them to not really matter. Some people seem to think that by choosing not to try to get the Hallows, he is avoiding the temptation to pursue power, but I never really got that. The whole subplot was confusing and felt unfinished. The movie pretty much avoids Harry's conflict as much as possible, which I thought worked in its favor.<br/><br/>2. The Bank -- everything here was perfect. The dragon was amazing, maybe the best cg creature ever.<br/><br/>3. Diagon Alley -- much of what we find out in the book is avoided here. I think this also makes it easier for the viewer, because just like the Hallows, the subplot about Dumbledore's past and his motivations didn't feel like it needed to be there, and left a bunch of unanswered questions.<br/><br/>4. The return to Hogwarts -- Harry reuniting with his friends was exciting, and the scene with the Grey Lady took something that wasn't especially memorable from the book and made it a highlight. I think it's interesting that two creatures who only got a little bit of screen time--the dragon and the Gray Lady--were done so well, I thought they could have an entire movie built around each. The dragon could be amazing in either a fantasy film or a giant monster movie. The Gray Lady was scarier than most horror film villains, and I could immediately imagine her in her own haunted house feature.<br/><br/>5. Snape's memories -- not as much of Lily's childhood as I'd like, but a fine condensation of the main points.<br/><br/>6. The final battle--a lot of it went too quickly. The movie was only about two hours. I would have liked more time to really stop and see what was happening, but it all went by at lightning speed. The standoff between Bellatrix and Molly Weasley was the biggest casualty. I really wanted to savor it, from the moment the kids start fighting her. Instead, it felt like it lasted about 10 seconds. Really, from the moment Voldemort walked back in with Harry's body, I started to feel like it was losing steam instead of building to the climax. I wasn't a big fan of most of the choices, especially how they changed that moment in the courtyard with Neville and the sword. Also, be prepared to have a lot of explanations not show up, especially as concerns Dumbledore. Like I said, I would have been fine if the whole conflict over his past had never been a part of the book, but thankfully the movie doesn't confuse us by making an issue out of it.<br/><br/>The ending felt a little bit rushed also, which I think undercut what should have been an emotional payoff from 10 plus years of movies and books. We needed to see the main characters really show that the strain was finally lifted and have a moment of private celebration with just the trio. Instead, they were kind of cold and emotionless as Harry destroyed the elder wand. And the epilogue just left me wanting more time with the characters instead of satisfied at how their lives had turned out. This has to be the biggest movie production to ever leave me feeling vaguely unsatisfied."
"madnsx","6","2","3","17 July 2011"," Accelerating, thrilling, but yet, disappointing
","To give a damn comment about how wholly boring the movie is, is an exaggerated act, but to really praise the movie for its seeming 'loyalty' and exceptional performance is, in all, an unworthy deed.<br/><br/>The movie was, as said above, accelerating. The pace at which the Gringotts Battle happens is thrilling, and yet it still keeps your mind fluid and fluent with all the details. That is one thumbs-up for the movie.<br/><br/>Another thumbs-up is the scene wherein the degree of horror in the Hogwarts Battle is climatically shown. Yes, it shows all the horror, and all the bad. It also shows emotional scenes of death (however little time is devoted to such moving scenes as Fred's body laying beside Ron who was weeping incessantly). Harry though, seems not to care about the Lupins--I either missed it, or did not see Harry show any emotional side to that one. Talking about Lupins, first thumbs-down is how Ted Remus Lupin is omitted.<br/><br/>Another thumbs-down is the fact that Prof Dumbledore's story is completely forgotten, fallen into oblivion, or so to speak. The reason as to why Harry survived the Killing Curse should not be (as I interpret it) that the Elder Wand is truly his, but yet no question or answer was given by Dumbledore or by Harry about such matters when they meet up @ King's Cross. Speaking of King's Cross, flashy lights did not help to lower the loss of Albus' messages like how Lily's blessing is in He-who-must-not-be-named. Kids cannot help but ask questions about that.<br/><br/>Overall, I give the movie a 6/10, which I think is already a high mark to all that are left out. The movie, with JK acting as a co-producer, did not live up to my expectations.<br/><br/>P/s. I do not really understand how, of all things, Harry Potter is SO unpopular amongst kids cuz I saw absolutely no folks staring back @him @King's Cross 19yrs-later-scene. Again, the battle-won thingy scene was unexpectedly low in emotion (no bursting into tears thingy, no cheering, etc.)~~~"

"devcybiko","Null","2","3","16 July 2011"," A confusing ending to an epic tale.
","ONE LINE REVIEW : A confusing ending to an epic tale.<br/><br/>RATING : See it in theaters<br/><br/>(Rating scale : ""See it in theaters"", ""Wait for the instant download"", ""Don't waste your time"")<br/><br/>NO SPOILERS<br/><br/>In this final chapter to the Harry Potter series, Harry (Daniel Radcliff), Harmione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) must find the three Horcrux's and destroy them to prevent Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) from becoming immortal.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is that you must have read the book in order to understand what is going on. I haven't. I've seen all the films up to this point and I had a hard time knowing what was happening.<br/><br/>The story starts out with Harry, Harmione, and Ron burying Dobby, the elf. They then interview a goblin who sort of fills us in on all the events leading up to this point. Then they interview a wand maker to tells us who is good and bad in this film. And we're off. Except we aren't. The trio then travel around the Potter Universe to try and find three Horcrux's (a term never explained but are magical items that link to Voldermort's immortality). As they find each one they destroy it.<br/><br/>I am trying to write a review without exposing any of the plot points. But it's hard. Because to explain to you just what is wrong with this film I'd have to give away key elements.<br/><br/>I believe that any film must stand on its own. You shouldn't have to have seen the previous film to understand it and you shouldn't have to have read the book. ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" fails in both cases. The film meanders around the Potter Universe finding objects and destroying them. The biggest confusion on my part is why must they destroy all three of these ""Horcrux's""? If Voldermort needs all of them to ""regenerate"" then why not just destroy one? If he doesn't need all of them then why doesn't he regenerate with the one he already has?<br/><br/>The ending is equally confusing and you'll see why when you see the film. But basically I don't understand what it is to die in the Potter Universe. Apparently it is optional.<br/><br/>We are never let in on the details of what is necessary to kill Voldermort. And the wand he stole from Dumbeldor's grave has some very fluid rules as to who owns it at any particular time.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is everything I hate about fantasy fiction. There are no rules. The writer makes them up as they go along to serve whatever is necessary to extricate the hero from whatever corner the writer has painted him into. I have seen fantasy done well (Lord of the Rings, eg) and Harry Potter is not fantasy done well.<br/><br/>Still the visual effects are stunning and you may never get another chance to see the movie on the big screen. That is why I recommend you ""See it in the Theater."" Not because it is a great story, but because (despite its many flaws) it is a treat for the eyes."

The book ending was absolutely perfect!! Unfortunately, it seems I will have to continue to imagine that perfect ending because the movie ending bears little resemblance to the book. The producers and writers mucked up yet another ending.<br/><br/>I was sorely disappointed with the ending of HBP (Dumbledore's funeral?) but after DH Part I came out and it actually followed the book for the most part, I had high hopes for the ultimate ending to part II and to the series. As a devoted fan of Harry and his friends and of the books and the movies, I feel cheated. We deserved that perfect ending.<br/><br/>Having expressed my disappointment with the ending, I will say that the rest of the movie was fantastic, superb! It was everything I expected and more.

","This will never happen again, this kind of film series, made with such attention to detail, care, and love, and brought to such a stunning breath-taking, emotionally satisfying conclusion. The generation that were brought up on these films can count themselves blessed.<br/><br/>This is by no means a perfect film but who cares when the cinematography, acting, costumes, directing, soundtrack, effects, and plot are so brilliant? Radcliffe is genuinely astonishing in this film, the breadth and depth of emotion he brings to the screen is unsurpassed. The whole cinema was in floods of tears in the forest scene and many others besides.<br/><br/>Alan Rickman delivers a huge performance, revealing Snape's secrets with poignancy and a moving, horrific, death scene. All the adult cast step up to the plate. Ralph Fiennes makes Voldemort's remorselessly agonising demise and psychopathology seem terrifyingly real, Helen McCrory excels in her few key scenes, and there are nothing but superb performances from all the young cast, the standout one being Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, who managed to be awkward, courageous, and funny in one fell swoop. Wright was a rock as Ginny, Lynch superb as Luna, Felton outstanding again as Draco, there wasn't a single weak link amongst them.<br/><br/>But its the direction and cinematography that make this film deserve the epithet classic. The glorious imagination, the visual ambition, the sheer scale of the film took real nerve and supreme skill. Yates gets the most outstanding performances from all the cast. The battle scenes were superbly conceived and choreographed and even on the periphery of the screen duels between individuals are played out as though the actors very lives depend upon it. The special effects are at last on a par with the rest of the film, which is a blessed relief.<br/><br/>The attention to detail remains as acute as ever despite it's being applied on an insanely grander scale. The Death Eater costumes alone were sublime.<br/><br/>But in the end this film belongs to Radcliffe, Rickman, and Fiennes on the acting front, and the status of the trio (both Harry, Ron and Hermione as well as Radcliffe, Grint and Watson) as icons of our age is secured forever in the final scenes. This really is an exceptional film on every conceivable level. I've seen it three times including on IMAX and on each occasion the audience came away elated, exhausted, moved, astonished, entertained, and best of all, satisfied."

I was very underwhelmed by the action sequences. They had all been done before. I was hoping for emotion from the defense of the castle. The deaths of major characters were just glossed over in about 30 seconds. I remember reading the book and being heart broken when people died, and I didn't feel any emotion during the movie towards them.<br/><br/>Don't bet me wrong, I enjoyed the movie. I just craved more! I almost felt like there should have been a colaboration with Michael Bay for the action sequences, to make them bigger and just more spectacular. I mean Hagrid had like 3 lines and didn't show up until like 3/4 the way through the film. I felt if they would have added another 20 min of action it would have been a spectacular film for the ages.

","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" was yet again directed by David Yates and is the second part of the seventh instalment of the franchise. In order to finally defeat Lord Voldemort, Harry Potter and his friends have to find and destroy the remaining four Horcruxes. Little do they know that the Dark Lord is in possession of the strongest wand to ever be created - the Elder Wand.<br/><br/>This is it, the big finale everybody has been waiting for for nearly ten years and it delivers. All the previous movies have set this up to be the big showdown the series deserved. The only thing that feels lacklustre is its pasting. At times this film can feel a little rushed, as there is still a lot to cover (the destruction of four Horcruxes) over the rather short runtime (at least for a Harry Potter movie) of merely two hours. This is just a minor issue I have and is probably a result of some other movies not contributing as much to the set up of the finale as they could have. Nevertheless this is still a brilliant ending to the franchise and overall an amazing movie."

"renegadeviking-271-528568","8","1","1","27 December 2019"," Lives up to the book's hype
","It ends well. After eight films in 10 years and a cumulative global box-office take of more than $6.3 billion, the most successful franchise in the history of movies comes to an obligatory -- and quite satisfying -- conclusion in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. Fully justifying the decision, once thought purely mercenary, of splitting J.K. Rowling's final book into two parts, this is an exciting and, to put it mildly, massively eventful finale that will grip and greatly please anyone who has been at all a fan of the series up to now. If ever there was a sure thing commercially, this stout farewell is it.<br/><br/>It has been an extraordinary run, really, marked by careful planning as well as very good luck. When some quick shots at the end remind how incredibly young Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson were when this all started, one marvels that they've all grown up to be as physically plausible for the roles and sufficiently talented as they have. With a parade of wonderful British actors filling exceedingly vivid parts, casting has been the series' most consistently strong suit throughout; remarkably, only one major actor, Richard Harris, died over the course of the decade, and he was undisruptively replaced by Michael Gambon (though regret still lingers that Peter O'Toole wasn't cast as Dumbledore in the first place; was it thought he wouldn't survive this long?).<br/><br/>After Chris Columbus launched the franchise capably but with less than dazzling flair, producer David Heyman smartly chose Alfonso Cuaron and Mike Newell to stage the next two --the best of the series artistically -- then settled on TV director David Yates for the long march to the end. Initially working in what seemed too straightforward and briskly efficient a manner, Yates has finally come into his own in this last installment, orchestrating a massive chessboard of events with impressive finesse and a stronger sense of dramatic composition than he has previously displayed.<br/><br/>But perhaps the key player all along has been screenwriter Steve Kloves, who made what must have been a vexing decision to put a promising directorial career on hold for more than a decade to write all but one of the Potter episodes (though confessing exhaustion and the need of a break, he later expressed regret over not adapting The Order of the Phoenix). Tricky in that so many characters, including quite a few from the past, needed to be shuffled into the dramatic deck without sacrificing forward momentum, this final chapter suggests an even greater-than-usual attention to narrative balance and refinement. Simply put, it's clear the filmmakers felt the responsibility to do this job right, and that they have. See what other critics have to say about the movie here.<br/><br/>Of course, Deathly Hallows Part 2 is all about the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort, the ultimate showdown between good and evil, the climax the entire series has built toward from the beginning. With Voldemort wielding the coveted Elder Wand with blinding power even before the Warner Bros. logo appears onscreen, Harry, Ron and Hermione at the outset are still in the wilderness, commanded to find and destroy four remaining Horcruxes (all of which contain fractions of the Dark Lord's soul) and obliged to make a deal with disagreeable goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis) to gain access to Bellatrix Lestrange's bank vault, where one Horcrux might be hidden.<br/><br/>The subsequent break-in involves a wonderful charade in which Hermione disguises herself as Bellatrix (some amusing work from Helena Bonham Carter here) but also a roller-coaster ride that feels like a prototype for a theme-park attraction. This sequence also calls attention to the fact that, after an aborted effort on the previous installment, this is the first Harry Potter film to be released in 3D. Those with a purist streak will probably wish Warners had left well enough alone and not adopted the fad purely for the extra dollars, as if it needed them. Still, apart from a few isolated effects that look phonier thanks to the extra dimension, the 3D works pretty well for the many spectacular visual effects as well as with the greater sense of depth with which Yates stages many of his scenes here.<br/><br/>As Harry and his friends converge on Hogwarts -- now run by Snape like a gloomy concentration camp and guarded by hovering Death Eaters -- an admirably sober, melancholy mood cloaks the proceedings; Aberforth Dumbledore (Ciaran Hinds) details unsavory aspects of his family's early history and portents of what's to come reverberate as Harry and Voldemort increasingly share what's in their minds, while Harry's welcoming committee at school resembles a stalwart bunch of loyal soldiers gathered for a none-too-promising last stand. Among the many who have been recently little seen, the one who most surprisingly rises to the occasion is the largely forgotten Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis), whereas Harry's girlfriend Ginny (Bonnie Wright) offers entirely expected solidarity.<br/><br/>Similarly marginalized in recent years, Maggie Smith's wonderful Minerva McGonagall reasserts herself for this last campaign, helping to create a shield around Hogwarts that will at least temporarily delay Voldemort's army, which has converged on a cliff overlooking the school. As preparations are frantically made for the final battle, time is nonetheless found for crucial narrative trips into the past, including one final and particularly revelatory dive into the pensieve to explore the early relationships among Snape, Harry's mother and Dumbledore, as well as the murders that started it all so many years before.<br/><br/>Even the final wand duel between the evenly matched Harry and Voldemort has its distinct stages that reveal final layers of information. It's also nicely leavened with slashes of humor, leading to a brief coda set 19 years later that, in the way it comes full circle and reconnects with the relative innocence with which the series started, feels just right.<br/><br/>The squabbling of Deathly Hallows Part 1 happily a thing of the past, Ron and Hermione lend stalwart support, but the burdens of the consummation lie squarely upon Harry's shoulders and lead one to appreciate Radcliffe's accomplishment here and throughout the series; whatever quibbles and shortcomings have existed in the past, he is Harry, once and for all, and goes out on a high note. A number of departed or otherwise absented characters make brief appearances here as a means of tying things together, enabling such actors as Gary Oldman, Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Timothy Spall, Miriam Margolyes, Julie Walters and others to make brief curtain calls along with their fellow great pros.<br/><br/>Technically, nothing has been held back. The eventual sight of Hogwarts as a crumbled ruin is striking, Eduardo Serra's cinematography outclasses what he accomplished the last time out, and some of Nick Dudman's makeup effects -- especially with the goblins and a shocking glimpse of a fetal Voldemort -- are sensational. Alexandre Desplat's score is arguably the best yet for the series, briefly incorporating echoes of John Williams' original themes while richly boosting the already heightened drama of this sendoff to such a tremendously successful series."

","Perhaps this is the best place to review the series as well as the last installment. We have seen Daniel Radcliffe mature from a fairy bad actor to one that is fairly convincing, particularly in his standing up to Aberforth Dumbledore. Emma Watson has gone from awkward kid who wore her emotions on her sleeve to Maxim's top 100 Hottest women. The passing of Richard Harris was a major let down to the series as Michael Gambon couldn't really fill his shoes. The most interesting and complex character was that of Snape. Alan Rickman made the series with his portrayal. The casting of the quirky minor characters made the story most enjoyable, all the way down to Mrs. Fink. Rowling's use of classical mythology, astronomy and the occult made the series an incredible educational experience. One of my favorite characters was the under used Luna Lovegood. She was a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>The direction of Chris Columbus was by far the best as well as the screen adaptations, which more closely followed the books. Starting with the third installment, the audience got short changed (There, I said it) especially those who didn't read the books...such as myself. This wasn't a bad thing as it led to a bonding with my niece who did read the books and I would take her to the films so she could explain them to me. Like Hermione, she is one of those ""insufferable know-it-alls"" who loves to let you know what she knows. (Good luck with that brain surgeon thing.)<br/><br/>In this final episode, the gang of 3 go after the remaining Horcrux(s) which are now easier to locate than in the last 2 films. This one follows the later films in that it lacks the humor of the earlier ones.<br/><br/>The movie, like the series drives home the ideas of teamwork, friendship, and courage. Goblins, spiders, troll, elves, death eaters, a dragon, and of course he who we do not speak. Personally, I would have done the ending differently, especially with Snape and Malfoy. But I don't want to discuss any possible plot spoilers."

Rowling not only revolutionized children literature through her winning streak of best-sellers but inspired what would become a landmarks of a genre relying both on spectacular special effects boosted by computer technology but traditional three-act structure (exposition with the first three films, second act starting halfway through the fourth, and the climax in the last two films) with all the compelling elements of storytelling: the fight between good and evil, the coming-of-age and the whole escapism into a world never seen before. Like Lewis Carroll, J.R.R Tolkien and George Lucas, Rowling created a whole new universe, a myth.<br/><br/>Hogwarts, Dumbledore, Gryffindor, Aveda Kadevra... and so on and so forth, all these words have become part of an international lexicon, a staple of pop culture bound to be passed from generations to generations and to enchant children and adults all over the world. It is no surprising that the film concludes with Harry, Hermione and Ron playing grown-ups taking their children to Hogwarts through platform 3/4 like in the first film, we've all grown up watching Harry, Ron and Hermione from their baby-faced years to their maturity, and then will come a time where we'll look back at the 2011 film with equally powerful nostalgia. Oh yes, I'm sure the films will all live up to their reputation in nineteen years... and beyond.<br/><br/>And from that emotional finale, we guess that Hogwarts have probably been rebuilt and the harrowing and deadly journey that culminated with the final fight between Voldemort and his forces of Dark magic and the resistance that combined all the cumulated knowledge of centuries of wizardry will be part of the new mythology. And I feel less like reviewing the film than concluding my seven reviews by saying that the franchise couldn't have a better conclusion. For simple reasons that don't take much analysis: first of all, it is set in Hogwarts, and while it's heartbreaking to watch so many places we're familiar with being reduced to ashes or ruins by bolts of lightning and random attacks, it's captivating to watch all the players defending the place to death.<br/><br/>And there are deaths. Many are particularly tough to handle. And for those who have the chance to live, the story provides them chances to outdo themselves, Neville ends up having one of the most interesting arcs in the series, Mr. McGonagol and Mrs. Weasley have also their moment of awesome, and there are two reveals about Dumbledore and Snape that made me question my previous reviews and the way I instantly jumped to conclusions, underestimating Rowling's smart writing. I knew there was something enigmatic with Snape from the very start and by maintaining such a mysterious character for so long over the series, Rowling proved that she didn't have a talent for writing stories but also -as it's the case with Harry Potter- stories within stories.<br/><br/>And this ""Deathly Hallows Part II"", as far as storytelling is concerned, is fueled with spectacular action like a fitting climax, it doesn't waste time for exposition as no introduction is needed anymore, we're already familiar with the characters and the themes. So the film plays like ""The Return of Harry"" echoing the Jedi's or the King's. And for all the action-packed scenes that are traditional offerings but never get ""routinely"", the integrity of the narrative is maintained. And the heart of the story is kept as well through reveals of relationships that were the core of the saga all along. Reading about Rowling that she lost her mother of Multiple Sclerosis before she could enjoy even the first book broke my heart but it might have shaped her inspiration when writing about the relationship between Harry and her mother, and a few other characters, or even between Harry with Voldemort.<br/><br/>And one can't of course review this film without praising Ralph Fiennes's performance. The actor's been kept away for too long to finally implode, proving to be more than a menacing presence. He steals the show with a glare, a joke, or his hideous nose-less face... it's like the film or the book couldn't fail because it had just the perfect villain. As they say, a film is as good as its villain... but it's also as good as its ending, and while not all the chapters of the saga are equally entertaining, this last opus is a masterful conclusion and I understand now why it's the only one to be on the Top 250. It's entertaining, thrilling, suspenseful, sad, deep and comes full circle through an ending where you can't just help but shed a tear while saying goodbye to these character we've seen evolving from their childhood and even when the wizardry world was as its ""infancy"" from our perspective.<br/><br/>How fitful that the ending scene is in a Train Station, like Hitchcock another master storyteller, Rowling loved trains and it was trains that inspired her the first vision of Harry Potter, a kid taking a train to go to a wizard school... it's only appropriate that the film would end with that note, maybe telling children that everything is possible, that they also can have their own ""train"" of inspiration and image a little something that can grow out of magical proportions. She wanted a character who could do something she couldn't: fly, she created Harry Potter and became an inspiration, a billionaire, and a name that would be mentioned in the same breath as Tolkien when fantasy literature would be approached by fans or scholars.<br/><br/>If only I let my curiosity win over me and watch the first film, I can't believe I waited so long. Maybe I should take it as a lesson now and give a try and watch ""Fantastic Beasts""."

"samuelroberts-45076","8","1","1","6 November 2018"," A very god ending
","I was enthralled from the opening scene to the start of the credits. Very few films capture me like that where I am so in tuned with the story. The film takes you on a roller coaster ride starting off slow, until you reach the first action sequence, then rushes headstrong into another series of scenes, focusing mostly on Harry and his charge of destroying the horcruxes. This is Harry's story. This is his moment to set the wizarding world right. Along the way, several characters stand out. Neville Longbottom makes a stand and Professor McGonagall goes to war. There are many moments in which supporting cast members take the foreground for a moment or two, but it is still Harry's story throughout the movie. I must mention the genius of Alan Rickman as Snape here, he was a defining point in this film and one of the reasons it was so special. Now, was it a perfect movie. No. The CG at points looked amateurish and some of the dialogue didn't fit well into the movie. Does it deter you from enjoying the experience. It shouldn't. These are just little things that annoy me. The whole movie looked amazing. The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy. This film was great, and the best finale a fan could have asked for. It's an incredibly memorable movie and one that i will never fail to enjoy."

"alyonkyast","10","1","1","8 October 2018"," «The boy, who has survived»
","It is the most famous screen adaptation in the history of cinema. Even people, who have not ever seen it, know this story about the wizard which came to our world to overcome the evil. There were seven books and eight films, because the last part was shared into two flicks due to new Hollywood standard. If you have not guessed yet, we are talking about the novel by Joan Rowling. The last film about Harry Potter was realized on the 7th of July in 2011. And it was the highest-grossing film of this year and the tenth-highest-grossing film of the all times. 
What is the secret of success of the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2""? To solve this mystery let's focus on the key factors of a movie success such as: plot and story, their relevance to the audience, star power, director, special effects, budget, release date and critics' reviews. All of these constituents are here. 
It is obviously that the plot resonates with the dreams and beliefs of target audience. Harry finally met with his enemy and the greatest battle is going to start, but surprisingly Voldemort become stronger than Harry has excepted. What way the inseparable trinity, Harry, Ron and Hermione will found to protect their school and their world? It seems to sound impossible but Harry decides to sacrifice his life to bring the death to Voldemort. The audience froze in anticipation, everyone would like Harry to live. Despite all fans of Harry Potter know the end of the book they are truly worrying during the film. 
It is going without saying that the most part of actors, who has been shooting for more than ten years at the all previous films, has a large and enthusiastic fan base. Not only main characters which were played by Denial Radcliff, Rupert Green and Emma Watson but actors of supporting roles too, like Allen Rickman or Helena Bonham Carter - of course, they were gained recognition from the audience. 
A well-known director is one more important factor. David Yates shot three movies about Harry Potter before the last one, but none of these parts has such huge box-office. They all made a great profit over 900 thousand dollars but the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" has raised 1,3 billion dollars. David Yates has brought whole his experience into his last film, he knew how to make the perfect picture.
Since the 2000s ""Harry Potter"" has changed significantly. The last part was not a fairy tale like the first part, it was amazing, mysterious and scaring world. And director needed the computer-generated imagery to integrate magic world into a real life and make film more gripping. Needless to say, that the ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" was recognized by the Academy Award for the best visual effects and was awarded by BAFTA at this nomination also. Thanks to the soundtracks by gorgeous Alexandre Desplat the film won the Annual Grammy's Award. 
""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" had a budget of 250 million dollars and was co-financed by Warner Broth. Pictures and Heyday films which were very generous for whole necessary things. 
Another reason of the film's acceptance is a good labeled from the critics. Roger Ebert gave the film three and a half out of four and said, ""The finale conjures up enough awe and solemnity to serve as an appropriate finale and a dramatic contrast to the lighthearted (relative) innocence of Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone all those magical years ago.""
At last, the release date. It was the middle of the summer, when cinemas became full of Harry Potter's fans. Not all previous parts were turned out in summer, lots of them were screened in autumn or in winter, when many of viewers has not opportunities to visit cinema palaces.
To sum it up, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Part 2"" is an example of a commercially successful movie where various factors come into play to bring millions of viewers and provide the renown from the world cinema to all members of the film's production unit."
"MrBayren","7","1","1","23 August 2018"," Much improved over Part 1 and a rather satisfying way to go.
","Aaaaaaaaahh redemption. Much improved over part 1. The acting and dialogue were still a bit stiff and my comments previously on how magical combat it handled still stands but there is much more going on this time. The battle of Hogwarts was surprisingly rather well handled. Despite my issues with the combat, there were some little bits of creativity like a quick time freeze and large fiery beasts. Although basic, the terracotta army was pretty cool to see also. Many character deaths made the stakes and consequences feel more real adding some emotional depth that wasn't there for me in part 1 (other than Dobby). The action was much more competently filmed but there were quite a few moments where it felt like the extras were running or standing around not doing anything. More of a nitpick though. <br/><br/>Overall a rather satisfying end to this cultural phenomenon of a franchise. I still think there was a lot of missed potential in terms of magical creativity but I'm glad I finally got around to seeing Harry Potter off."

","Although I am bothered by some of the changes they made from the book, this film is a fitting finish to the Harry Potter series. It packs a powerful dramatic punch and shows how far our characters have come from the original movie. I'm sad to see the series go, but it was a great ride."

","Cathartic on many levels, this is an extremely satisfying conclusion to a beloved film series. On a production level the direction, cinematography, score and visual effects are sublime, but the most impressive aspect is an emotional narrative that ties up many loose ends while providing amazing moments for many characters.<br/><br/>The ending is also beautiful in its ability to make the audience reflect in the nostalgia they have for the series, but also to poignantly accept that this is the right note for the series to end on.<br/><br/>It's a final film I couldn't have asked for much more from. I'm glad everyone in the cast and the filming crew were able to complete a stellar job."
"TheNabOwnzz","8","1","1","29 June 2018"," A very worthy farewell
","It seems that after the pure filler that was Deathly Hallows: Part 1, David Yates finally seems to get down to business in Part 2. Whereas indeed nothing happened in Part 1, Part 2 provides a wide range of narrative, revelations & emotional outbursts.<br/><br/>Like in Part 1, the cinematography is top notch, although it is more of a lightshow this time around, as it shows the full scale war of Hogwarts in a visually impressive fashion. It is however not one of these productions that becomes lazy in its visuals due to modern technology, as every shot and every angle seems carefully planned out and the CGI is handled with utmost care resulting in stunning visuals. ( Except perhaps the broom escape from the room of requirement scene, which looked pretty bad ) The score by Alexandre Desplat is also excellent, and while he is not John Williams, it uses a fair bit of nostalgic scenes in which Williams's themes from the first film make a long awaited return, and since nostalgia is ofcourse such a powerful emotion ( Atleast when it reminds us of great things, such as the first couple of Harry Potter films ) this should provide the audience with a very 'satisfying' feeling, which is also primarily what makes this such a good finale.<br/><br/>The most fascinating part for me was the revelation of Snape's intentions and his changed depiction from villain into a hero. When we watch the pensive sequence, everything that has happened before makes sense, and this will leave you all the more sad about the fact that ever since the Sorcerer's Stone Snape has mostly always been seen as the villain of the story, and his true intentions are only shown at the end, when it is too late for him. There is no doubt that the pensive sequence is the greatest scene in the film, as its sheer emotional power & the incredible character transformation will leave you in awe for a long time afterwards. <br/><br/>I was quite worried that since Part 2 relies on loads of action sequences that these sequences would look the same as they did in Part 1. ( That is, loads of shakycam and quick cutting so you never see what is going on ) Fortunately Yates seems to have learned from his mistakes and as a result Part 2 features great action sequences with fantastic angles and subtle camera movements, instead of the shakycam nonsense the first one had.<br/><br/>On the contrary to Part 1, Part 2's narrative instead DOES seem to be going somewhere, as there are less overly melodramatic scenes and more plot-driven ones. It might be shorter, but loads more Horcruxes are destroyed in Part 2 as compared to 1, while in the meantime we witness Voldemort's assault on Hogwarts, which creates a 'race against time' kind of picture in which the tension and immersion is fantastic, since pretty much every likeable character still alive from previous films joins in the fight, and since there are so many likeable characters in the franchise you genuinely care about their fates. Harry's melancholy stroll through the hospital which shows the death of long time characters such as Fred Weasley & Lupin really tug at the heartstrings since we have grown to like them so much over the previous films, and it definitely results in you becoming immersed in the moment, as you know Harry Potter is no longer the fairytale it once was, and in contrast to the first few films shows that its world is not a perfect place and that the good guys can die too. It also features the by far best performance in the series of Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, who finally seems to truly capture the essence of the feelings of his character perfectly. The camaraderie between Ron, Harry & Hermione might have been terrible in Part 1, but they once again grow closer to eachother in Part 2 and coupled with the many nostalgic sub texts to its previous films their character bonding once again seems genuine.<br/><br/>However, i won't state that it couldn't end any better than this, as it does have some slight negatives. It should have obviously been longer, since running at 2 hours and 10 minutes it is the shortest of all Harry Potter films, and this seems a bit underwhelming when you know that this is the one where everything is going to end, which in turn results in the picture sometimes being slightly too hasty. Voldemort's death was extremely anti-climactic, as in the end he easily kills himself with a backfired curse because the elder wand never belonged to him. While a lot of Harry's clashes with Voldemort are brilliantly filmed, with a lot of slow motion added to it to increase the tension to a fantastic degree, the way he meets his demise in the end is not as satisfying as it could have been.<br/><br/>This all results in a final installment that features excellent action sequences, impressive visuals due to outstanding cinematography and a great use of CGI ( which was for once not lazy ), many nostalgic references to invoke emotions in the lifelong audience, genuine interest in all of the character's fates, the definitive Radcliffe performance, and save for Voldemort's death, a very satisfying experience which results in it being one of the best entries to the HP series ( Prisoner of Azkaban is still objectively better, but it would rank second. )"
"Spike-Washington","8","1","1","11 June 2018"," The final confrontation
","As the second of a two-part series finale, this was it. Harry Potter has to destroy the last of Voldemort's secret life forces and end things once and for all. And the battle all comes down to the showdown at the now-overrun Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Who will survive? Who will die? The answers to these and all other questions will be revealed when you watch the film. There were some changes but they didn't bother me in the slightest. As the final chapter of the film series, this is how it really ends. It's been a while since I've read the book and seen the movie, but I enjoyed both and I'm not sure which is better; they're both good. If you're more of a movie buff and love Harry Potter, this is the crown jewel. Don't wait. See it."

"Johnny-the-Film-Sentinel-2187","10","1","1","24 November 2017"," Harry Potter is not just one of literature's greatest achievements, but also one of cinema's finest moments!
","Harry Potter became something of a surprise sensation in the late 90s; media-titans were after the media rights since it garnered a massive following, Nintendo tried turning the series into a gaming franchise that would go alongside the likes of Zelda and Castlevania; then David Heyman, who was working for Warner Brothers at the time, found 'The Philosopher's Stone' on the 'low-priority' shelf of the WB-UK's development catalogue. Then in 2001, Harry Potter hit the big screen and became one of cinema's most potent franchises then onward. Seven films later comes 'The Deathly Hallows: Part 2' and makes itself out to be the finest conclusion to a film series since Lord of the Rings, Return of the Jedi, and Toy Story 3. Harry Potter has become one of cinema's greatest accomplishments in the medium's entire canon.<br/><br/>I grew up watching the series in cinemas every time a new film came out; I loved every second of every film and this conclusion is not just great Potter-fan satisfaction; it's a great film and a resounding conclusion to one of the defining stories that helped mould my childhood and teenhood. It's literal and visual cinematic magic. Harry Potter has remained a classic for damn good reasons, because it's a contemporary fantasy that co-exists within our reality without needing to worry about real-world baggage at all yet the world of wizards is still plentiful on drama, lovable characters and one of the most gorgeous cinematic universes ever constructed on film.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is truly one of my favourite film franchises and it's a story as timeless as Star Wars, as eternal as a good old fashioned fairy tale, and a saga showing the challenges of growing up.<br/><br/>If you somehow STILL haven't seen the Harry Potter movies yet, I implore those of you who haven't to do so. It's a universally appealing saga that is a timeless story; so join the ride millions of others have been riding on for years now."

I've always though of them as unoriginal and easily thought up, but that doesn't mean I don't like the movie. The scene with the dragon was really well done, having every little part look good.

I was really glad to see the entire wrap up and it was nice to see this series I have invested ten years of my life in be wrapped up in a nice fashion. I really liked the final battles in those movies. I remember thinking that the effects were just some of the greatest things I have ever seen in my life at the time, and while that isn't as true now, they are still great now. 2011 was an amazing year for movies and this helps prove it. The experience watching it when it came out though was different. There was this one random and annoying girl who cried when Snape died super loudly and then a bunch of annoying younger than me (I was 13 at the time) kids running around the theater like a bunch of idiots for no real reason.

"miriamseshadri","6","1","1","16 October 2012"," Not true to the book
","I think as a movie it was OK, definitely not awful. It did follow the general theme. Other reviewers have done a good job pointing out where they thought the movie was disappointing and I concur with most of those. However, the point which stands out most to me and where I really felt that Yates and his scriptwriters had not read the book properly was when Harry entered the Room of Requirement and found Ravenclaw's diadem. The book quite pointedly says that it was not one of the many glittering tiaras that Harry found. In fact, he was despairing of finding it but then he had a flashback to the fourth book where there was a mannequin with a dusty old crown on it's head. There was no reason to make it a glittering one in a box, it would not have taken more time to stick to the story with this particular scene. The movie really did feel that Yates just wanted to get it out of the way and do it as cheaply as possible ( since there would be no more prospects of making mints of money off future movies). It's a shame and I feel that if they had put Cuaron in as director and made it a 3 hour film like some of the earlier ones, they could have made one of the greatest finale movies ever which would have made them more money over the long term ( instead of having to sell it for $10 which is the price I bought it at). If the movie had been awesome, I would have been willing to pay $40+. Review written on phone so please excuse typos."
"Royson58","6","1","1","10 December 2011"," An ending, just not a stand alone movie
","Perhaps more than any other of the series, this movie has no standing on it's own. While better viewed in order, any of the first six could be viewed and enjoyed on their own with someone unfamiliar with the books or previous movies. This movie requires having seen the seventh movie at the very least, and probably really needs all the previous movies to be enjoyed (but those that have seen those movies are the prime target).<br/><br/>The movie contained your typical good/evil battle, with no real surprises amongst the characters. Yes, I know that.... Again, obvious.<br/><br/>There was lots of action, lots of explaining. Just not a lot of fun. Although it would have been rather long, the final book as one movie would have been better, with the explanations woven in the longer movie, rather than needing to dominate this movie. But that simply would not be as profitable for the Potter industry."
"jfilmer-544-494694","5","1","1","8 December 2011"," Unsatisfied
","If you're a fan of the Harry Potter books, you may understand director Yates' reasons for many of the scenes in the film but an adaptation of a book should still be its own entity, emphasizing and taking advantage of the strength of film as a visual medium. Staying too true to the book, in my humble opinion, really left me unsatisfied for a number of key scenes.<br/><br/>Yates has done a terrific job in the past Harry Potter films and Deathly Hallows Part 1 was no exception. Extremely well done and well paced, leaving us feeling hopeless and alone. However, in Part 2, many beloved and detested characters alike were too briefly passed over including the Dark Lord himself.<br/><br/>Due to this, the film's final battle seems rushed and anticlimactic. The outcome of poor Remus and Nymphadora are relegated to a 4 second shot of their lifeless bodies. Bellatrix, the most blood-thirsty of all the Death Eaters, was taken out without much fanfare and near comic ease. And Lord Voldemort exchanged, what felt like, no more than 3 clashes with Harry Potter before being reduced to ashes by an altogether different battle.<br/><br/>As one reviewer stated, the final ending at the station gave the film a solid sense of closure and was done splendidly. However, I still walked away feeling truly cheated. A good end to the series but not as great as I would have expected from Yates. I really hope they release an extended version. Five wands out of ten."
"evanston_dad","6","1","1","6 December 2011"," It All Ends -- And Not a Horcrux Too Soon
","So the whole damn ""Harry Potter"" thing finally ends, only to leave me wondering: if Professor McGonagall could shoot fire out of her wand and muster up a whole army of suited knights all along, why didn't she do it a whole hell of a lot sooner? <br/><br/>And there lies my problem with the entire movie series. If you didn't read the books, which I didn't, you don't understand the story's logic half the time. Apparently it's all well explained by J.K. Rowling, but if so, the filmmakers did a bad job of transferring her explanations to the screen.<br/><br/>All of the movies suffer from laziness, and ""Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" while much better, almost by default, than ""Deathly Hallows Part 1,"" is no exception. It assumes that the series' die-hard fans will fill in the blanks the filmmakers are too bored to fill in for us, so key moments, like the standoff between McGonagall and Snape, or the one between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix LeStrange, just sit there on the screen instead of causing us to leap to our feet in excitement.<br/><br/>Let's just say I'm looking forward to reading the books with my sons when they're old enough. Maybe then the whole story will make more sense.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

I love that she takes charge.<br/><br/>The scene at Gringott's was very well done - almost exactly like it was in the book.<br/><br/>Harry's Mother does a really fantastic job. It's the first time in the movies that she gets any real screen time.<br/><br/>Snapes's memories are well done - the scene with him crying over Lily's body is heart-wrenching.<br/><br/>Neville is adorable. He did a really great job. It was also hinted that he had a thing with Luna (which wasn't in the books) but I really liked.<br/><br/>I thought Danielle Radcliff, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson were pretty good - I don't think their acting has really been that great throughout the series, but they managed to pull it off in the end.<br/><br/>The scene where the teachers are performing the spell to protect the castle was really cool. Yay Slughorn! <br/><br/>The Harry death scene is really touching. With his parents, Sirius, and Lupin and then with Dumbledore.<br/><br/>Mrs. Weasley vs. Bellatrix duel was awesome!<br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>NO chemistry whatsoever between Ron and Hermione - there was much more chemistry between Harry and Hermione <br/><br/>NO Dumbledore back story - it's sort of hinted at in the bar about Arianna, and then the bit about Grindewald....but that is it! I was disappointed with that<br/><br/>NO Fred death scene! I was really upset about how Fred's death was portrayed! I just shows him lying there dead for like a half a second and then the scene moves on! I wanted more! <br/><br/>Crabbe replaced by Zambini. This wasn't so bad, and didn't make a difference to the plot, Goyle dies instead ofCrabbe. It still irked me though.<br/><br/>Percy never reappears.<br/><br/>Harry snaps the elder wand instead of repairing his wand! Again, not really important, but it irritated me.<br/><br/>How does Harry find out about Lupin's son? There is no mention of him previously in the movie? <br/><br/>Voldemort's death wasn't as dramatic as I would have liked it to be. He just disintegrates into paper wispies? LAME!!! <br/><br/>The final scene was a little upsetting. A) they didn't actually look older - especially Hermione B) NOTHING was explained! You don't meet the rest of the children, and they all just stand around and give each other significant looks! This whole scene could have been left out for me.<br/><br/>With all of that said, it was a movie and if you've read the books the movie is NEVER as good as the book. I think with that in mind, the movie was done pretty well overall. Most of my complaints were only because I HAD read the books, if you hadn't, you probably would have found the series, and the final movie, very satisfying."
"FatMan-QaTFM","Null","1","1","24 August 2011"," A tangled mess that only confused
","This is it: the end of a saga, a massive undertaking that has resulted in so much screen-time, some new stars, Harry Potter becoming a household name, and a disgusting amount of money. Part 1 was barely watchable. Part 2 supposedly had more fighting and action, but I am always skeptical.<br/><br/>I had honestly forgotten how the last movie ended. Hint: somebody/thing died. And it's not the last time in the two-parter. While deaths seemed shocking early on in the series of movies, the body count piled up pretty fast as the movie seemed to have no regard for the characters you loved and adored. I'll tell you right now, I didn't like the movie. One of the main reasons was the offhanded manner in which deaths occurred, often as a side note or in the background. If you spend 7 (and a half?) movies molding characters in to either well loved or completely hated, you can give them 2 minutes on-screen to have a proper exit.<br/><br/>The poor pacing that plagued Deathly Hallows, Part 1 continued in Part 2 with mix of frantic scenes that seemed to be trying to keep the runtime down followed by moments that dragged on for eternity. What ever happened to building towards a climax? They do a superb job of setting up tension with the attack on Hogwarts by a huge army, but keep interrupting the action with flashbacks and other, less exciting locations. While those were pivotal to telling a complete story, their placement completely derailed any excitement and flow.<br/><br/>Some high points of the film do include the battle scenes – magic hasn't looked this good since The Covenant! Those battles only accentuated the slow parts and made me wonder why there weren't more scenes like that in the previous 18 hours of movie. Also very good was a lot of the acting from Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson, as well as a lot of the more seasoned cast members. Or maybe they just seemed amazing in comparison to Rupert Grint, who has at this point become even more of a bumbling clown that he's lost all dimensions from earlier films.<br/><br/>Overall, the charming, interesting plot lines that started in the first few films has become a tangled mess that only confused me and left me with more questions than the flashbacks and long conversations could explain. I'll completely agree with Queer: this was a pure greed move on the part of the studios. Part 2 could have easily been pared down and shown with a cleaned up Part 1 and not insulted audiences with promises of a better ending this way. At least it's all over, until Rowling decides to write the next big children's hit series that will be successful regardless of its quality."
"tomgillespie2002","6","1","1","17 August 2011"," Exciting finale that improves on the book's climax
","So the Potter machine is finally at it's end, with the decision to split the final book into two films proving a financial masterstroke. Ten years on from the first, the films have had a number of different directors, used practically every fine British actor there is that's still alive, and have ranged vastly in quality. They have also become extremely dark, with the 'love will triumph over evil' moral and the never-truly-threatening bad guys of the early two films being replaced with murdered house elves, tortured children, mass murder, and main characters being mercilessly killed in the blink of an eye. Author J.K. Rowling wanted the fans to grow up with Harry and mature with the books, and on many levels it works very well.<br/><br/>Part 1 left us with Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) having to bury one of his trusted friends, and Lord Voldemort (Ralph Feinnes), along with his Death Eaters, are closing in on Hogwarts. Harry, Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have still got some horcruxes (pieces of Voldemort's soul, for those you haven't watched it) left to find, and arrive at Hogsmeade to find a way into Hogwarts, which is being run by the evil (?) Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). They find a way in thanks to Dumbledore's brother Aberforth (Ciaran Hinds), and are quick to take control of the school. But with Voldemort approaching, teachers and pupils alike must join forces in a climactic battle, while Harry scours the school for the horcruxes.<br/><br/>While Part 1 seemed to be stretched out and become rather slow in the middle section, Part 2 is action-packed. I'm not ashamed to say that I am a fan of the books, yet I was disappointed with the last one. After so long reading, the finale was anti-climatic and wasn't as dramatic or revelatory as I was expecting it to be. This is the main reason why Part 2 works so well. It extends the final showdown, making it rough, exciting and worthy of watching seven previous films, as Harry and Voldemort cross wands and fists. A slight disappointment though is the Battle of Hogwarts, which was a great section of the book. Giants, werewolves and stone men alike clash with the wizard and Death Eaters as Hogwarts is reduced to rubble. The build-up to it is great, but then the action shifts away to Harry, and his search for the horcruxes is less interesting than the battle happening around him.<br/><br/>It is as big a climax as you could hope for though, with every penny of the massive budget visible on screen. The special effects are virtually flawless, but the majority of the huge cast are give little or nothing to do. The likes of Emma Thompson, Jim Broadbent, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Gary Oldman, John Hurt, Julie Walters and David Thewlis, who are the pinnacle of British talent, are given little more than a few lines. I know, these were major players in previous films, but with this kind of talent reduced to little more than cameos, it makes it upsetting that we're stuck with Daniel Radcliffe for the duration (likeable as he is). Ralph Fiennes though, who only appears briefly in the previous films, is given a lot more to chew on, and revels in it.<br/><br/>A fitting climax to a memorable series of films. Although never achieving anywhere near greatness, Harry Potter notched up some decent films (forgetting the first two), especially Alfonso Cuaron's third instalment, Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban. It will be interesting to see where the three leads go from this, as none of them are the most gifted of actors, and it's a wonder if they'll ever manage to shake off the phenomenon that is Harry Potter.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","I am giving this movie a 1 out of 10 because so many morons on this website chose to give it a 10 out of 10. <br/><br/>Were the special effects amazing? They dumped a couple hundred million into it so they better be. <br/><br/>Were all of the familiar famous faces around? Of course they all got paid to mail this bullshit in.<br/><br/>Was this the worst adaptation of a Harry Potter book to film to date? By far the worst, I didn't think they could mess up an ending when the perfect script had already been written but Hollywood managed it again!<br/><br/>This film sucked for so many reasons I tried to list them all and the review length couldn't even contain them so I gave up even trying.<br/><br/>If you read the 7th book and think that this movie was ANYTHING but a TRAVESTY you must be working for the movie industry. <br/><br/>IMDb IS BROKEN giving a horrible greedy movie like this an 8.5 out of 10. I remember a time when I could come on here and rely on the raw score of a film and read reviews and actually trust the people who had written them to give me a decent unspoiled account of a movie and a recommendation on whether I should see it or not. Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic must be broken to because this movie SUCKED. It was the funniest epic i've ever seen for all the wrong reasons, overly violent in all the wrong places and underwhelming in all the places that mattered, dark when it should have been light and light when it should have been dark. Pretty much exactly how it shouldn't have been in almost every way imaginable.. Worst of all it got every single characters spotlight moment ABSOLUTELY WRONG. They have made some terrible adaptations out of the books to this point but this one takes the cake. Why would you change an ending everybody loved? Why would you take an epic battle and turn it into a cgi snooze fest. Why would you ruin every emotional moment in the finale of the most epic series of our generation by changing them in nonsensical ways. I cannot understand Hollywood or this broken website for that matter.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and whack it instead of seeing this rubbish, you'll save $10 and have a far more satisfying conclusion."
"Irishjean7","Null","1","1","6 August 2011"," The movies could have ended so much better
","I feel that the directer of the Harry Potter Movies could have done the books and plot of the stories so much better justice. It is great that the main characters were explained but for a fan of the books like myself I had issues with the lack of build up on the supporting characters, such as Neville, Luna, Nymphadora Tonks,and Remus Lupin, to name a few, who I thought where important to the storyline and they are my favorite characters in the series. I was appalled to find that the relationship between Tonks and Lupin was only hinted at in the movies because their relationship, marriage and the birth of their son Teddy was huge in the books because Harry was named Teddy's God father and I thought that was pretty important. Luna and Neville where supposed to have been in the epilogue showing the unique and amazing wizards they had become since they helped Harry defeat ""You Know Who."" I felt that with a little more effort on the directors part, more of the actual story could have been included in the movie."
"bennyhagen","8","1","1","4 August 2011"," Good enough.
","Though the story is forcing the movie to further diverge from its essence and it tends to go really cheap on most of the sub-plots (I don't see how 10 more minutes on the supporting cast would have ruined the sales) I must honestly admit, that this is a fairly good solution to solve the impossibility of wrapping this monster up. Most of the decisions are justifiable if considering length, box office sales, rating and all the usual s/*t and when it comes to epicness, The Deadly Harlows 2 will not let you down. I don't think, that there ever was a realistic possibility of this movie being any better then what it has become in the end while there was a huge chance of producers ruining it.<br/><br/>But I think, the question never was, whether it's going to be good or not, as the work has already been done along the last decade. The question was: is it going to be GOOD ENOUGH. It is good enough.<br/><br/>With this, the Harry Potter saga is found its way into eternity and is now officially a legend, comparable, but in many ways surpassing Star Wars. And most of it didn't even suck.<br/><br/>This actually was one of the historical cinema moments of this generation and I am kind of proud, of having witnessed it."

"valadas","6","1","1","29 July 2011"," Too much destruction
","Of course one day the Harry Potter movie saga would come to an end also because the main performers are becoming older and sooner or later would not be able to act the characters of the children student wizards. With the books by J. K. Rowling it's different since they have no images. I must begin to say that I have not seen Part One therefore what I am saying here must be read having that in mind. This movie favours violent action and a lot of destruction to the detriment of the poetry of magics we have seen for instance in the H. P. AND THE PRISONER OF AZKABAN movie. However we must recognize that the special visual effects are unbeatable, thrilling and of excellent quality. The story is not very rich and original in terms of suspense but we can be properly entertained while watching all the adventurous scenes. One last word to the final scenes that re-establish the above mentioned poetry."

Ya i watched the film as it ends the series.i will not deny the fact that i saw most harry movies and liked some of them. I follow IMDb .. been following it for the last two or three years if a movie is rated 7-8 or above i would run to theater or buy a DVD but fans giving movies like this 9 or 10 disappoints me a lot.i suggest watch the movie only if u love harry series other then that prefer captain America or horrible bosses or Transfomers 3"
"The-Sarkologist","6","1","1","23 July 2011"," And it all comes down to this
","Well, after seven movies it all comes down to this. The final Harry Potter movie in which he finally confronts Voldermort in an epic pitched battle. This movie begins where the last movie finished off (which is not surprising since it is part 2) and fortunately it does manage to tie all of the loose ends together. Harry continues his quest to find and destroy the remaining horcrux's to give him an edge over Voldemort.<br/><br/>Once again this film comes across as the old children's novel in which the original children who have read (or watched) the films from the beginning are now teenagers (in a sense Rowlings intended that her readers grow up with Harry Potter). However, while the books and film releases could be staggered, now that they are all released, the joy that the first generation of readers had in growing up with Harry Potter is now lost. But that is beside the point.<br/><br/>The movie does managed to tie up all of the loose ends that were in the first movie, and this is one of the problems with creating a two-part movie: first one must have recently seen the previous movie to follow along the new movie. A lot of sequels tend to be stand alone with only a vague understanding of what happened in the previous movies, however this is not the case here, and moreso with the entire series. Unfortunately there is a lot of reference to what went on before to understand what is happening in this film.<br/><br/>We learn of who Harry's father really is (a Darth Vader moment – well, not quite, but in a sense I'm not surprised). We also learn what is so special about Harry and why he is such a danger to Voldemort. Not quite earthcrushing or revelatory, but still, it does make it a little interesting. However the who main character dies and then comes back to life again is a little thing.<br/><br/>I mention that because of Harry being one of the Horecrux's (and once that Voldemort does not know exists). That means that to defeat Voldemort he must die. A lot a people have jumped up and said 'hey, here is a Christian allegory to Christ's death on the cross. When it because clear to me that this was the case in this film, I considered at it is not an allegory at all. The main reason Harry comes back to life is because, unless we are dealing with tragedy, it is anathema to kill the hero in a modern novel. If Harry was going to die, he couldn't remain dead. It was never going to happen.<br/><br/>As for the Christ allegory, once again it is not really so. Granted Christ's death defeated Satan, but it goes far beyond that. First, Christ's death was as a sin offering, that is, if one sins, then one must die as a penalty for that sin. Because we all sin, then we all must die. However, Christ was without sin, and because of that, he could act as a substitute for those of us who have sinned. Now, the resurrection is two fold: first, it is a demonstration that Christ is indeed God because he had mastery over death, and his resurrection is proof that he has mastery over death. Secondly, it is to demonstrate that he had indeed defeated death, and that death no longer has any power over us. None of these elements (with the exception of needing to die to defeat Voldemort) is the case in Harry Potter.<br/><br/>While Harry Potter may be an enjoyable story, and that it promotes bravery and dedication to what is good and right, let us not try to turn it into something that it is not – Christian Allegory."
"bilcoolABU","10","1","1","22 July 2011"," Emotionally satisfying and visually breath-taking, heart-breaking yet beautiful
","Deathly Hallows Part-2 has achieved something which no other Fantasy film has achieved, its definitely a fantasy but a very realistic fantasy.Every single ounce of agony and pain is real. From the start till the end its a roller-coaster ride, with no pregnant pauses in between. one of the many plus points of the film is that the battle never over shadows the main tale, and David Yates shows his expertise by dealing with two three story tracks going on at the same time as the main battle progresses in the background. As earth-shattering discoveries are made, the past is questioned and true loyalties are revealed,love still manages to blossom even in times of such darkness, thus giving out a strong message that LOVE indeed is universal.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows Part-2 has a strong script,beautiful but heart-breaking background score, top-notch performances from the veterans and the younger cast,tight editing and absolutely brilliant direction and mesmerizing cinematography ( actually devastating-oh to watch Hogwarts destroyed is heart wrenching ). As said earlier there is not much space for talking and pondering over things in the last Potter film (except for the beginning), there is only an urgency to take action and not just sit and watch your friends and family die and thus 'all hell breaks loose'.<br/><br/>Hallows part-2 borrows heavily from its predecessor Hallows part-1 (which was necessary) for its one complete epic tale. the screenplay writer wastes no time in establishing the references from the past,he treats you as the all-knowing audience yet allows you to derive your own conclusions on several things including the poignant ending. one cant complain because even if after 10years of watching Harry potter films, you have still not got the tale right then you are at fault not the cast and crew.<br/><br/>the beauty of Deathly Hallows Part-2 is the balance between the lighter and the heavier ,more emotionally demanding moments , the scale of the film which never becomes too opulent, the moving performances from the stars and the technicalities and nuances of film-making not to forget the spell-binding special effects.1O years from now Deathly hallows part-2 will become sort of a Cinematic legend, something which will be equated with Titanic and Star-Wars saga.<br/><br/>this is one of those films which you can watch again and again and never get bored of, the more you watch it the more you fall in love with the film. IT is definitely the best in the series and so far the best in the Genre of fantasy because it not only has dazzling effects and visual magic but also because it has a big heart which would help any-one and everyone connect with it easily and effortlessly. it sums up the tale beautifully, there could not have been a better ending to the EPIC SAGA. i will give it 10 out of 10."

Overall, the movie was really enjoyable and the action scenes were perfectly portrayed. <br/><br/>But, the only bad feeling is that the movie was a bit short. Not everything in the book were mentioned. That was a slight disappointment. But, David Yates did better in this movie. <br/><br/>I must say this. 3D experience has been so good. I really enjoyed it during the title. Look out for the ""WB"". Its a great new experience in Harry Potter. Thanks for considering 3D option in the last part at least.

"haxleyandrew","1","5","12","4 February 2012"," Really Silly, So Disappointing That It Fails To Entertain The Audience
","Harry Potter of course is based on the book by J.K Rowling and is about Harry. But the most bad part of all is Harry himself.<br/><br/>This movie again fails. It's the worst film to come out after Batman & Robin, And when did the studio start remaking this film. Because clearly Harry Potter is not popular at all anymore. Again the books taught me nothing and neither have the films. So all this means is basically that it's all just complete Garbage which fails to entertain the audience yet again.<br/><br/>This film has to be like Christopher Nolan's The Dark Knight, It has to be suspenseful, Menacing, Disturbing, And yet Violent at some points throughout the film. But also the Humor is not supposed to be placed in this film. It's completely dumb and silly and is not supposed to be even involved. They could have made this film into a World War 3 sort of type of film but yet failed.<br/><br/>Harry Potter used to be for kids. But it's ruined yet again and this franchise just proves that the original films of Harry Potter really made the people realize that they just messed up the franchise yet again.<br/><br/>Also Dumbledore was not shown in this film. Nobody portrayed him or even showed him in this movie. Complete failure! Another thing i don't like about Harry Potter is that in this movie he fights with Lord Voldemort and that Voldemort dies in the end is completely ridiculous to me. And the same could be taken for Hermione Granger and Crabbe the villain who did not even appear in this film also which is horrible.<br/><br/>The wand coloring that is taking place in Hogwarts battles and fights is quite annoying. For example when Harry fights Voldemort his wand turns blue for some reason and it really makes the audience confused as if saying why is his wand blue for some reason. Well it's because the filmmakers wanted it to be that way. Not to be confused with the color or other things either.<br/><br/>Second J.K Rowling could have made a better film franchise then Harry Potter because it just feels as if he was not too dark to star in this movie. Wow! Seriously because i feel sorry for all the people out there who like Harry Potter. But we just hated him because he did not look all that great.<br/><br/>Also this was a book adaption of the same story from the books. Of course this movie is not the best and is plain average for a superhero movie. Either the actors could have acted better and their performance could have changed. Or the producers who made this film better would have did something to make it more scary and dark like The Dark Knight was with it's elements and of course the story. Also let's not forget that Voldemort's death was really silly and that it could have ended in the grand hall or something like that.<br/><br/>Seriously if a film is good at first. But then it turns lame and just plain ordinary. It's not suspenseful and does not have too many fight scenes. Because the fight with Harry and Voldemort is plain cheesy. Plus the way the Characters react in different situations is just dumb because they don't know what is happening.<br/><br/>I advise you not to watch this film, Don't buy it or rent it, And worst of all don't even plan to see it if you are a Harry Potter fan because this remake is going to be just plain horrible. Plus if it gave us more scary scenes and more fight scenes then it would be a lot better. But if it's not too violent or scary, Then it is not scary. It was supposed to have a World War 3 plot added into it. But if you're going to rent this movie. Then please don't, This movie takes away from the dark scary scenes and makes it too childish to see in theaters.<br/><br/>Also the script as i would say is dumb and silly like the film Batman & Robin. Trust me! If you are going for a good Movie, Then see Spider-Man or The Dark Knight. But don't go out spending your money just to watch a piece of junk that nobody loves anymore. It's just getting old these days and besides it could have done better at the box office no matter what the directors say about this film. It could have been better, But i am sorry for the people out there that can't act properly.<br/><br/>There used to be times when a film would be darker and violent. But still talk about horrible casts, Acting, And performance, this movie is just plain garbage. That you will have to throw it away in the trash. Because seriously who would wanna watch a film that is so horrible it fails to please the audience.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is just a plain ordinary film. The remake is not all that great. It should have more suspense, Scary, Disturbing, Or violent, But instead the jokes and humor are what ruined it. But still it should have happened at least."

It was very enjoyable. For those who have not read the books, there will be surprises that you cannot foresee. For those who have read the books, the surprises will be well done.

","I've seen it and after reflecting on it, and indeed the entire series, I don't think I have very much to say. There are heaps of people who have valid criticisms with both the books and especially the films. Neither are perfect. I always thought the films were mainly targeted towards the existing fanbase as opposed to reaching out to an ignorant audience. I think the films can be forgiven, then, for not always doing the books complete justice. But despite those flaws and more, I was left deeply touched by the end of it all. And that's all that matters to me.<br/><br/>It's not a critique. I'm totally biased. And it's the 9 year old child in me telling me that. It's been a huge influence in my life. I was never encouraged to read or to write as a child, and the first Harry Potter novel was my first real exposure to any kind of literature. Because of that, I can't help but associate writing as being something magical and wondrous. My first stories were Harry Potter fanfics. I credit my love of English and my passion for writing to those wonderful books. So yeah. I loved the film. I love the films. I love the books. I'm a hopeless and shameless supporter. And I'm very grateful for the impact it's had on my life and many, many others. That is what, I think, will be remembered."
"bobblablog","Null","3","6","24 July 2011"," The Movie put a Sick Charm on me
","No matter how hard they worked on this movie, it was going to make a billion dollars anyways, and frankly they did not really seem to work that hard. Despite the rave reviews from every kid who still thinks their letter from Hogwarts was lost in the mail (even though owls deliver it) I'd like to make a claim on the contrary, it sucked.<br/><br/>I realize that there was nothing they could do about the acting, it wasn't like they could find a new lot of kids to play Harry (despite how good Daniel Radcliffe is in How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying), Ron, Hermione and the rest of the magical crew, but frankly they're not great and there is more than one reason that Emma Watson decided to make the change from acting to modeling, and is getting a real American education. But the directing and production staff new these short coming coming in and would logically try and work around them by focusing more on the action and the dramatic silence of the emotion situations the seventh book was chock-full of. This didn't really happen either This was the first Harry Potter movie shot in 3D, and they probably should have done another in 3D to work out the kinks first. Every major action scene in the movie, which was a lot because the whole thing was essentially one big battle, was changed from having over the top CGI effects and stunts, to having the scene inexplicably go into slow motion and have something flying at the screen. I'll admit, it probably looked awesome in 3D, but in regular definition it just looked goofy, taking away from the dramatic effect of the situation.<br/><br/>As for the non action scene dramatic situation, they were nothing more than a lightning round of awkward situations and over the top one liners. Whether it was strict adhesion to the book, trying to get in every 'important' scene and subplot, which they kind of gave up on in the first movie, or that they were really trying to play on the awkward boy-girl coming of age angle that most of the viewers are probably going through themselves, I don't know. What I do know is that Ron and Hermione spent more time making out than grieving over their (very) recently killed friends and family, and that every few minutes there was a scene were some random wizard dude (Ron, Harry, Nevil) sat next to some random wizard girl (Luna, Hermione, Ginny) and didn't say anything, making me almost wonder if they just happen to be sitting there not talking and suddenly realize the camera was still rolling.<br/><br/>All in all I revert back to my original analysis: it sucked. Many of my friend called seeing this movie the end of their childhood, and frankly it was the end of mine. A loss of innocence to even consider wanting to go see some kid-friendly, over-hyped, poorly done, Warner Brothers poor excuse for a movie ever again."

","‎""IT ALL ENDED"" an I felt Nothing! Thanks to Mr Yates for making such an insipid and heartless series of movies. It was all about action to the next action, then a plot hole, then the next action, blah blah blah, plot hole, wait, was that a dead Weasley in the background? was him George? we won't know unless we read the book, hole, next action. The guy is Just a Technician, NOT a Storyteller!!!!! Yates assumed that everyone in the theatre read the book before they entered, which must be 80% true, but in adaptations from books to movies the movies must stand by themselves, and not to require to consult the book to understand what the ""bloody hell"" happened out of camera, forgetting the unexplained ""holes"", the movie, his movies from the 5th to this last one"" become so mechanical in the way the story were told, and seemed so rushed"", Yates forgot to bring up the emotions and feelings in the characters, I wanted to be emotionally touched by Dumbledore's death in the 6th but he died like a dog and i didn't see a bloody tear in any of the characters ""no funeral for the headmaster?"" even when we had a funeral for some x dude called Cedric in the 4th?'I was expecting George's death to be a big EMOTIONAL event in the movie, I am not bloody sure if he was George at all because they didn't mentioned his name. Yates focus importance in events, in taking the story from one point to the next, forgetting the emotional psychology that should be in the characters. Many are saying that the books are too big to be totally faithfully adapted to the big screen, BULLSHIT, Lord Of The Rings was bigger and it delivered! why, they had a director that knows how to tell the stories from a more human and intelligent point of view. others said that we expected too much from the movie, Come on, Its ""HARRRY POTTER"" it HAD to be BIG! not just in scale of ""events"". As any other movie conclusion one expects to be emotionally thrilled and moved."
"eneguepogi","Null","3","6","18 July 2011"," you are left with many questions
","First, I would like to state that I just recently viewed the entire Harry Potter series and I got hook. I haven't read or even seen the book yet. But I suppose I need to read the entire book to fully appreciate this epic movie. When I finished watching the preceding Harry Potter movies I was able to grasp and enjoy the plot with a lot of twist. Thus, I was determined to watch the ending movie DH2. But when the movie was done. I tried to feel the atmosphere of the movie house and everyone was quiet. I didn't even hear a whisper or a hush of their excitement watching the final saga of Harry Potter. I was seated to a group of people who was chatting about the story and from the sound of it they have read the book prior to seeing the movie. There are movies that puts you in a position wherein the movie takes you on a journey and it carries you to a ride. I would describe this feel like a ferris wheel. It peaks when you go the top but then drops again then goes up and the cycle goes on.<br/><br/>It was as if the director was putting anticipation on to the viewers and not the other way around wherein the films give you a full view of the outcome and satisfaction but it lets you crave on it and wish for more (may sound vague but that's what I felt). The overall pacing was awful as in my point of view the movie didn't peaked at the right time and the ending was too anti-climactic.<br/><br/>The actors performed at par with the exception of Ralph Fiennes, who did a marvelous job with being the villain Lord Voldemort. I don't think the story is bad. I just think that movie could have been better considering there are two parts for this installment. 5 of 10 stars."
"drama_boy2","6","3","6","18 July 2011"," The Boy Who Lived... Returns To Cast One Last Spell in Messy Potter Flick
","It seems like only yesterday that the first Harry Potter flick, ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" was having it's first TV spot on Nickelodeon after an episode of ""Spongebob Squarepants"". But like many kids of my generation perhaps we don't actually remember that happening but I wouldn't be surprised if it did. <br/><br/>After almost a decade of ""He Who Shall Not Be Named"", Dementors, new characters and different directors, it seems that everybody's favorite wizard will finally cast his final spell for the last time as the Harry Potter phenomenon comes to a close. In ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2"", Harry, Ron and Hermoine are on their final search to find the last remaining Horcruxes created by none other than Voldermort, in order to stop him from continuing destruction in the Wizarding World. <br/><br/>After breaking into Gringott's Bank in the beginning of the flick, Harry, Ron and Hermoine set out to return to Hogwarts to battle it out and retain a Horcrux that apparently is hidden within the school. The trio return to the school, finding out now that Snape is the Headmaster of Hogwarts who after finding out Harry has returned, sets out to warn Voldermort. Soon, the battle between Voldermort's followers known as Death Eaters and the students & staff at Hogwarts begins. What starts out promising, is too fast paced for it's own good. <br/><br/>The film partially moves from one scene to another, practically going from Harry to searching for a Horcrux, to Voldermort, to a battle scene, to Harry again. What was suppose to be the Battle of Hogwarts turned out to be nothing but a disappointment. The battle moves on too quickly and just skips straight to the next scene and so forth. You hardly see any teacher or any student battle it out with a Death Eater. Mostly, their seen running away. Because of it's too fast pacing, the film hardly gets any deserving moments that it rightfully deserves.<br/><br/>The film is mostly covered up with humor which to me, is the second film in the Potter series to do so other than ""Order of the Pheonix"". The humor isn't bad, but it seems that the only purpose of this film was to take it into a much lesser dramatic approach than the previous installments and make it more funny.<br/><br/>Potter fans won't seem too disappointed in their favorite hero since the film practically ends on a good high note, but what seemed on like a thrilling adventure during it's TV advertisements, ""Deathly Hallows-Part 2"" moves on too fast and hardly matches the sense of deathly adventure that ""Deathly Hallows-Part 1"" had. It's pacing is quick, it's timing is limited and the story is told too rapidly. I won't lie and say I didn't enjoy the movie but I felt it skipped all the important elements of the book and just went straight to a high end screeching road. I am astonished that this is the best reviewed Potter film in the series and all I can say is; how can it not? <br/><br/>""Deathly Hallows-Part 2"" is the shortest flick in the series and also the poorest by director David Yates who did a wonderful job with ""Deathly Hallows-Part 1"", the only film I think Yates did any justice to. though some great things that happen in the film are the break in at Gringott's Bank, the search for the Horcrux, Nevil Longbottom's sudden heroism (he practically shines in this movie) and Harry's suspenseful near de... well I won't spoil that. The film will leave you to tears so I suggest you take a box of tissues because it seems that Harry's journey has finally come to a close... rather too quickly."
"prashanta_guha","10","3","6","15 July 2011"," A perfect finish to a perfect series
","I don't usually review Harry Potter titles although I'm one of the biggest fans. I went for the final installment first day first show (couldn't wait any longer like I did for the others) and I wasn't disappointed at all (I never have with this franchise). <br/><br/>The movies have gained as much of a following as the books itself, but this one takes the cake. I'm assuming that the Director, story-writers etc all worked under a lot of pressure as they had to live up to the expectations of millions of fans worldwide, and they did a hell of a job of it. The visuals are excellent, and since this movie only captures the second part of the book, there wasn't any need to gain momentum as the story progresses; the movie had us enthralled from the very beginning.<br/><br/>I'm thoroughly saddened that this is probably the last Harry potter movie that came out (fingers crossed). It's like there's nothing more to look forward to. Yet, J.K. Rowling and everyone have enchanted us beyond our dreams all these years, so I bid adieu to you, Harry Potter, the boy who lived. Excellent. 10 on 10."
"blackmambamark","7","3","6","15 July 2011"," A very memorable finale'.
","Two years ago, i finally sat down and watched all the Potter films. I will admit, they were well put together and pretty entertaining. However, i didn't see why people hold it up like it's the greatest story of all time. So i took their advice and read all the books. Is there a difference? Not really. Sure the movies miss some minor details and leave out a few characters. But the overall essence of the story is captured very well in the movies. But still, i didn't feel this overwhelming sense of joy that everyone else seems to be experiencing. Never the less, they are pretty entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Even though i thought Part 1 of this was a complete bore fest, i knew what was later to come in this entry. And the movie does exactly what i expected it to do.......hit the ground running. Most of these Potter films give constant build up towards a giant climactic battle of sorts. Whereas this one constantly moves forward with it's action and never let's up.<br/><br/>The special effects and 3D display are absolutely amazing. Everyone already knows that the 'Battle of Hogwarts' is what everyone was waiting for, and let me tell you, it looked pretty damn impressive. But here in lies my only problem with the film. The 'Battle for Hogwarts' was kind of weak.......allow me to explain.<br/><br/>After reading the books and watching all the movies, one would expect that this would be an end all be all battle. In a way, it is.......however, they constantly direct your attention away from this, and focus more on Harry finding these horcruxes. In fact, they focus on that more than the actual battle. Yes, i understand that this IS important......but, i want to see this ultimate good vs evil fight take place, minus the constant cut to's.<br/><br/>I would go into one more thing i didn't like, but for those of you who know nothing of the story, i wouldn't want to ruin it for you. But other than that, the film is pretty damn entertaining. <br/><br/>Bottom Line, would i say that it's my favorite Potter film? No, but it does give an amazing sense of closure to the series. I wasn't emotional.....to tell you the truth, i don't see how i could be since the story didn't really MOVE me. But the entire theater was blubbering throughout the entire third act. So i guess it really hit home with the die-hards. Never the less, WB did an amazing job with this series. They didn't slip up like most, and they gave the audience exactly what they wanted. Job well done."
"harryplinkett14","1","6","16","14 March 2015"," Retarded
","This stuff is retarded. There is virtually no plot. Half the film is filler and the other half is meaningless action. Moreover, the film demands that the audience knows the name of every single protagonist (of which there seems to be an endless supply) and remember everything they have done and said in the previous films. Basically, unless you are a hard core fan who has watched all the films several times and read the books, you will be confused time and again. This film is not shy about introducing a new character every five minutes. Do we need this many characters to tell a story about a magical kid with glasses? The characters are so numerable that virtually every British actor has been given a role. I thought by the end that they might run out of people to cast.<br/><br/>What else is wrong? Well, the same things that have been wrong from the start of the franchise. The tone is all over the place, shifting from ridiculously childish to failed attempts at serious drama and dangerous encounters with sinister antagonists. I am sorry, but you do not fight an evil prince of darkness riding a broomstick and waving a magic wand. It does not work. It is ridiculous.<br/><br/>The second problem is the magic itself. Too much magic removes all the magic from the film. If anything is possible, why do we care? Sooner or later some form of deus ex machina will save the day.<br/><br/>Furthermore, there are inconsistencies. The protagonists can teleport themselves when they want, yet they travel by train all the time. They can go back in time when they need to, but forget they have that power when it can come in handy. In general, protagonists can forget they have certain powers when the plot needs them to, or they can produce new powers at will when the writer is too lazy to get them out of the jam some other way. This is extremely irritating because it blocks the involvement of the audience. Basically we are left as passive observers who wait for some contrived solution to save the day.<br/><br/>Finally, the film is not emotionally satisfying. The ending is prolonged and convoluted and basically this final film in the series loses the rhythm completely. My guess is that the screenwriter was too eager to shove every plot point from the books into the film, and thus sacrificed the cinematic experience for the sake of not leaving out anything from the story. This is poorly adapted material.<br/><br/>There you have it. Why so many people kept watching this mess is beyond me."
"fernandius","10","4","10","14 July 2011"," This is it and it's excellent
","I just saw the movie and I have to admit that it is an impressive film, it has it all. Unlike the more recent prequels, this time we enjoyed a good story and not just teen romance. This film has a visual quality that is worthy of 3D. It has great colors and textures, although it is known that it was not done from the beginning in this format but it is still pretty good at it. The picture is a bit dark, I hope it's only because of the 3D glasses. If you did not read the book you can see that this history is full of surprises, twists and unexpected and exciting moments. However I recommend that if children are going to see this movie they do it only in the company of their parents because of certain scenes which area a bit strong, specifically deaths. I'm sure every fan of the series who watch this movie will be pleased and those who are not will also enjoy it very much. I feel fortunate to have been part of this part of history for the cinema, no doubt this latest movie is the best of all of the eight. It is full of information, emotions, romance, drama, fights and everything that is entertaining and heartwarming we can think of. Maybe this is not the best movie of the decade buy I am sure Harry Potter's movies will be some of the ""you have to see movies"" for any movies lover. As a fan of the saga I can say that even when this film is not perfect, it's really close.<br/><br/>By Fernando Núñez"

","It's over! It has finally ended! After 10 years of watching Harry Potter growing up and becoming a great magician it's finally time to say goodbye. For me it's still kind of sad seeing I really grew up with Potter, I was about 6-7 when the first movie was released, so keep in mind that this review isn't really about criticizing the actors, the story, the effects because for me as a big Harry Potter fan, I couldn't talk about these things without having my own Potter glasses on.<br/><br/>So how was the ending? Well it was awesome! For me, this was as close to a perfect ending of a series as it could have gotten...almost! If I'd have to find one little flaw about this movie it would have been that, and its probably better in the book that, (!LITTLE SPOILER!) after it had all ended, you don't know what happened to most of the characters how they continued living and what they made out of themselves, except for a few one, but like I said, probably better in the book.<br/><br/>Well, what is there left to say? For me there's only a big big THANK YOU! Thank you Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and all the other great actors who for some part, really took me by the hand and grew up with me, gave me thrills throughout the entire series and kept doing a great job till the very end. Thanks of course as well to J.K. for writing this most important series of books of the millennium and also thanks for all the directors, all the editors of all the movies for making the Harry Potter movies more then just films but a journey through which an entire generation could watch a great story with great characters having a great adventure.<br/><br/>Thank you!"

"mvrkfncb4","10","3","7","15 July 2011"," Absolutely and Unequivocally Brilliant
","What can be said, really? Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 truly pulls out all the stops, and very incredibly blows away all expectation as each character receives his or her proper send-off and the much-anticipated final battle between Harry and Voldemort approaches, and approaches beautifully.<br/><br/>The story begins exactly where we left off, and from there never fails to do what it needs to do, and that is satisfy us. Old characters return to battle, and each scene is viscerally incredible, making for not only a fantastic viewing experience, but a truly faithful one to the books. I believe it can be said that this is, expectedly, the darkest of all the movies, though that is how it should be.<br/><br/>I must applaud, in particular, Daniel Radcliffe's and Alan Rickman's performances as Harry and Snape, respectively. Daniel truly gives the best performance of all the movies, and very emotionally carries us through to the end; as with Alan, his infamously complex character of Snape is so heart-wrenchingly portrayed as his loyalties are finally revealed, it is just stunning. This is not to say, of course, that every single other character's performance isn't incredible, for everyone truly does a fantastic job, and gets their shining moments.<br/><br/>Being a Potter fanatic, I couldn't have been more pleased. Reader or non-reader, I assure you you will not be disappointed during this final Potter film. It is staggeringly good, and truly one of the best finales of any franchise I've yet to see. Bravo!"
"griffolyon12","10","3","7","14 July 2011"," It All Ends!
","When the final frame of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows-Part 2 flickered across the screen, it finally hit me, there are no more adventures with Harry, Ron, and Hermione, this finale is it, and what a finale it is. This is a movie! In the best sense of the word. There just seems to be no time anymore to complain about what was cut, what was changed, and what wasn't included from the book. This adaptation succeeds in streamlining the story and turning it into a story that meditates life-and-death, awash with operatic tones and emotional heart tugging.<br/><br/>What more does anyone need to know, this is the final battle between Harry Potter and the evil Lord Voldemort, as the armies of Good and Evil collide! Their battlefield...? Hogwarts, of all places. Every actor and character gets their due, but with the movie being called Harry Potter, Daniel Radcliffe has the most emotional scenes to pull off, as it has been in nearly all of these movies. Radcliffe carries this movie's emotional nexus on his back and does so brilliantly. Though let's not forget Alan Rickman, as the good guy pretending to be a bad guy, Severus Snape. People have always loved Snape's drawling voice and utter lack of emotion, and seeing the flashbacks of Snape actually showing emotion and how he came to be who he is, was eye opening, and allowed Alan Rickman to deliver one of his finest performances to date. But this is not a movie about the actors, but about the story.<br/><br/>We literally see the grand castle of Hogwarts ripped to shreds, as spells, giants, and animated statues, tear through the rubble. With so much propulsive action, the movie is moving forward from the first frame, never looking back, moving with the assumption that if you didn't see the last few, then why are you here. We are always in the present, never having to be told what is going to happen or be explained what has happened, we just get to see what is happening in the present of these characters and allow the natural surprises that come with the territory, making the heavy emotional beats in the latter half of the movie really hit the viewer hard, and be presented with so much drama and importance. Though action is not what makes this movie important, it is the deeper ponderings of life-and-death.<br/><br/>Death comes for us all, and that being the true master of death is understanding how to greet it when it comes. Harry has to deal with death, as he literally marches to his own funeral with the spectral forms of his parents beside him, or when he reunites with Dumbledore in the after life. These moments are touching, thought provoking, and filled with so much raw emotion through the actor's performances that you will go through an entire box of Kleenex before you're through. The lessons of death change how we live if only we can accept it when it comes, like Harry does.<br/><br/>Simply put, when a movie is this beautiful and heavy with emotion, no amount of evil can keep our hero down. Looking back over it all, it's rare for me to feel so emotional over an ending, but these were my friends too. And they were the friends for countless millions of people around the world. Thanks Harry, Ron, and Hermione.<br/><br/>I give Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part II a 10 out of 10!"

","I've been a harry potter fan since Philiosophers stone first came out. It completely amazed me and had me spellbound from the first 5 minutes. And then we had chamber of secrets (which was my favourite), prisinor of azkaban, goblet of fire, order of the Phoenix, half blood prince, and then the beginning of the end in deathly hallows part 1.<br/><br/>And now comes the bitter sweet end to this superb franchise. I was super excited to finally see this movie but was nervous and sad at the fact of saying goodbye to harry, Ron and Hermione. From the first scene of DHp2 it has you hooked right away. The way they have covered the book was fantastic and fans will not be disappointed as it is a fitting farewell to the characters we have grown up with.<br/><br/>The movie tells the last story about how harry, Ron and Hermione have destroyed some of the horcruxes and are closer to killing voldemort (who is played by the great Ralph Fiennes who does an amazing job). The trio now have to break into gringotts and hogwarts to find the final ones and destroy voldmort for good.<br/><br/>There are some powerful scenes that may scare younger viewers such as voldemorts tirade at gringotts and *SPOILERS* when snape is killed which may be the strongest moment in the film. We say good bye to other favorites as they fall to voldemorts army and also some very emotional scenes which had me and the rest of the cinemas in hysterics and crying more then I expected.<br/><br/>The action scenes are amazing and special effects deserve Oscar acknowledgments. This is the best movie I have seen in years and maybe years to come and i strongly urge everyone to see it.<br/><br/>Congratulations to all Actors with special mentions to Emma Watson, Alan Rickman and Maggie Smith. And to David Yates you have done an amazing job and made this harry nut proud.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 is a phenomenon, spectacle, and outstanding.

"Kane20","9","2","4","2 July 2012"," Review - Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","The tagline for ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is ""It all ends."" That's right, the ending has finally come to the movie series that started ten years before this movie, the movie adaptation of the classic Harry Potter book series. Like Roger Ebert wrote in his review of this film, we have a big class reunion here, and a great, epic, dark, dramatic one, too. I remember when I first saw the (comparatively) light and innocent Sorcerer's Stone. I was nine years old at the time. Here I am, eighteen, and writing the review for the last film, which I saw on Wednesday. I watched over the years as the movies got progressively deeper, more emotional, more mature, and darker, to the level of darkness at which this film is (tone-wise, and light-wise, in certain scenes). The movie picks up where the last movie left off, and covers the last third of the seventh book. This movie continues with the excellent balance of action, suspense, mystery, character and story development, tone, emotion, etc., and excellent special effects, only it has even more action.<br/><br/>When we last left off, Harry had left the Malfoy Manor, and Dobby had been killed. Now he continues his quest to hunt for the final horcruxes and kill Lord Voldemort once and for all. His quest eventually takes him back to Hogwarts for some epic action and showdown. The film, meanwhile, takes us on a roller coaster ride through thrills, excitements, excellent suspense, and dark magical fantasy, thoroughly entertaining throughout. Although the film is over two hours long, it doesn't fee that long – it seems to zip by relatively quickly. And the film ends well, not just for is film, but for the entire series as well. It was a very well handled, well wrapped-up, strong, and emotional ending, almost as strong as it was in the book.<br/><br/>An epic final installment to a series such as Harry Potter, which requires such a finale, is hard to achieve, and requires a lot of hard work, talent, writing, effort, and thinking. David Yates handled it very well. Granted, it's not perfect and he could have done several things to make it even better, but he does very well nonetheless. Some of the acting could've been better, too, but it was alright, especially since the main actors have gradually improved their performances as the series progressed. I even enjoyed the musical score, composed by Alexandre Desplat, especially in the parts where he references back to the themes from John Williams' old score for the first three films. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is one of the better installments in the Harry Potter franchise. It all ends, and it ends well, very good ending to the series. Harry Potter goes out at full speed and with all wands blazing.<br/><br/>My Rating: ***1/2 (out of ****)<br/><br/>For more reviews, visit my website: http://robertsreliablereviews.blogspot.com"
"arginnon","4","2","4","4 May 2012"," Potter for ever
","This film is absolutely brilliant. The makers of the Harry Potter franchise finally pulled themselves together, and made something awesome. I am a huge fan of the books, but I haven't been a real fan of the films, because they've been constantly disappointing me. I've read all the books at least five times, so I now them almost word for word, so maybe that's why the other films (especially the fourth one) were such disappointments for me. But this one, the eighth film in the series, was everything I could hope for.<br/><br/>It was true to the book, the visuals were striking, the acting was over the top, the music was moving and the script was (finally) well-adapted. Maybe all these things are due to the fact that J. K. Rowling was an executive producer on this. I liked that there were some funny moments and some extra action in the movie which weren't in the book, but I missed one thing they left out. I won't tell you what it is, because I don't want to spoil the movie for those who haven't seen it yet (shame on you! go see it).<br/><br/>I'm glad John Williams didn't come back for this film to compose, Alexandre Desplat's music is so full of emotions and has great tunes. I actually cried at one scene (because of the music and Alan Rickman's great acting), although films don't usually have that effect on me anymore.<br/><br/>All in all the film was great fun, in some way better than the book, so for a Potter fan it's a must see."
"Leofwine_draca","5","2","4","6 January 2012"," Passable conclusion to a largely disappointing series
","Well, it's better than the four films that preceded it and also an improvement on J. K. Rowling's novel, so this final instalment in the HARRY POTTER series is doing something right. After an awfully po-faced and mock-serious opening, this film soon settles down by concentrating on sheer spectacle – and when it comes to on-screen magical mayhem and destruction, even director David Yates can't mess it up.<br/><br/>The film is split into two halves, the first focusing on the set-up to the final battle between the forces of good and evil. This section slightly improves on what's come before, although there's still an unwelcome reliance on needless flashbacks and over-complicated scripting. Radcliffe isn't bad, but both Grint and Watson are on autopilot and their supposed chemistry is non-existent, making any romance scenes a real laugh. The good news is that Alan Rickman gets (slightly) more screen time than before, although there's so much happening that nobody else does.<br/><br/>The second half is all about the special effects, and splendid they are too. The story isn't so great, but I can ignore that for the sheer energy that's gone into bringing the climax to life – an energy notably missing from most of the series. There are still glaring flaws – like the cheat ending, which doesn't follow through with necessary consequences and instead follows Rowling's embarrassing insistence in protecting her little darlings. Just this once, I wish they'd changed it from the book."
"huhabi","6","2","4","11 August 2011"," 3D version not very exiting
","I've watched the movie in a 3D version. During the movie I noticed that quite often you see a sort of Schiller like theater setting in layers appearing on the screen. First layer is sharp, other layers are often not sharp. In photography terms we call this the depth of field. I actually haven't given 3D a lot of thought since it came available, but seeing The Deathly Hallows I realized that when you watch a 3d movie, you want a high level of dept of field. In that case most layers will be sharp giving you a good 3D experience of the movie like looking through a window. Lot's of detail become visible. As the Deathly Hallows don't often use a high DOF, I can't recommend the 3D version as an extra feature to the movie experience, often it's rather annoying to watch this version compared to the 2D movie."

","I'm not a die-hard fan of Harry Porter, I'm not even a fan of Harry Porter series. But I have watched three Harry Porter movies. They are all OK for me.

When I heard the news of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" record-breaking weekend box offices worldwide, I think I should watch it as soon as possible. I watched today, I have to admit that Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best-plotted, most-entertained one compared to its previous series movies.However, it's not as good as the ratings here IMHO, someone might say i'm being biased, but if you look at those top 50 movies which got the same ratings, i don't think this movie stand a chance to be equally great as the others."

"vikas_rawat","10","2","4","18 July 2011"," Sheer spine-chilling awesomeness and absolute heart-thumping brilliance
","It is no easy task to make a film carrying tremendously high expectations of being a finale to the most popular series in the world, not to mention the fact that the majority audience already knows every possible plot point. And yet, it is in these circumstances, or rather in-spite of it, that 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' rises to a level of cinema that previous films only fleetingly approached. Knowing fully well that millions of Potter-fans across the globe would either way lap-up the film in any form, the makers of DH-P2 have gone that extra mile in ensuring a fitting climatic end for the series, thereby elevating the already popular franchise to another dimension.<br/><br/>The film picks up exactly from where Deathly Hallows Part 1 left off, with Harry, Ron and Hermione continuing their search for the remaining bits of Voldemort's soul, which eventually takes them to (where else but) Hogwarts. Be-fittingly, it IS Hogwarts that plays host to the final showdown, with Voldemort and his army of death eaters, snatchers and giants landing up at its doorstep hunting for Harry. What ensues is a battle of the likes of which Hogwarts has never seen before. It is in the middle of all this that one of the most important escapades from the action takes place, as Harry dives into Professor Snape's memory. You have to be made of stone to not have cried or at the least have gone watery-eyed in this sequence, where the true nature of Snape is revealed. It is followed with another escapade, where another beloved character makes an appearance. The movie also has its share of deaths, with some important characters being bumped off. The film builds up brilliantly to the ultimate climax between Harry and Lord Voldemort, with characters like Neville, Professor McGonagall and Molly Weasely playing major parts.<br/><br/>Having been a true-blue die-hard Potter-maniac for 10 years now, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' HAD to be spot-on in its execution to get a thumbs-up from similar million others, and yet had to be elaborate enough to make it understandable for the movie-fans of the series. DH-P2 scores full marks in adapting J.K Rowling's final book as accurately as possible, with the few changes actually making the film better. Steve Kloves finishes off in style with his bang-on, sharp script that clears all ambiguities he'd left in the previous adaptations. The cinematography of the film, although not as breath-taking as previous installments, manages to create the perfect atmosphere for the finale. The release in 3D, however, does not create any particular jaw-dropping effect, with the exception of the initial gringotts-dragon scenes. The music of the film is considerably improved upon (compared to DH-P1) by Alexandre Desplat, with the right mix of hard-hitting orchestrations and soulful melodies to counter both the fierce-action and gentle emotion in the film.<br/><br/>Director David Yates, who started his stint with 'Order of the Phoenix', successfully steers the series to its epic conclusion, with his most brilliant film till-date. Of the performances, all actors give their characters their best final shot, especially Helena Bonham Carter as the eccentric Bellatrix Lestrange. The principle characters of Harry, Ron and Hermione are given the perfect send-off with accurate performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. Daniel manages to restrain himself at the crucial moments, and it only shows the amount he's grown as an actor since that first film 10 years ago.<br/><br/>The film however belongs to Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman. While Fiennes manages to bring all-out evil in his no-holds performance as Harry's evil nemesis Lord Voldemort, Alan Rickman as Professor Snape does magic to the film in the shortest screen time, a la' Antony Hopkins in Silence of the Lambs. It may possibly be one of his career-defining performances that should be awarded with, at the very least, an Oscar Nomination for Best Supporting Actor. Though the Harry Potter series has always received the cold-shoulder by the Academy, 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2' may very well break the mould with a nomination/s in the top categories.<br/><br/>As fans across the world bid adieu to the most loved phenomenon of this generation, they couldn't have hoped for a better send-off to the series than 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2'. For sheer spine-chilling awesomeness and absolute heart-thumping brilliance, I'd give the film a 4.5/5.<br/><br/>Adios Potter!"

Overall this film created a bar and reached it with great style and I think it could be capable of getting an Oscar nod for best picture and more than capable of being an unforgettable blockbuster.So to finish it all off I'd like to say Ron,Hermoine,Harry you will be missed."

","I have now been to see the second part of harry potter twice and both times have been impressed with how good the graphics and acting of the three main characters are, however i was disappointed that it did not stick to the book as much as part 1. My main problems were:<br/><br/>teddy lupin is barely mentioned Freddie's death is barely seen <br/><br/>snapes memories are rushed<br/><br/>not enough screen time on professor mcgonagall or snape<br/><br/>my least favourite part is the ending where harry defeats voldemort and afterward he goes back into the great hall but nobody says to him well done or finally voldemorts dead which is a little bit weird.<br/><br/>However it has some great music and brilliant acting especially by Alan rickman who is portrays snapes emotions brilliantly and shows a more vulnerable side another great performance was by Mathew lewis who plays Neville, Neville steals the show for me being the surprising hero.<br/><br/>overall this is a must see film but if you are a big fan of the books you may find the film slightly disappointing"
"cathie454","6","2","4","16 July 2011"," Why do they do this?
","To be fair, it wasn't the worst HP film; that was Order of the Phoenix which was totally butchered. Most of this one was OK. All the changes in the movie from the book, up until Harry's final battle with Voldemort, were true to the spirit, plot and theme of the book. But Harry's final battle, and the fact that Hogwart's was destroyed (which did not happen in the book) were totally wrong, and there was no point to it. In the book, Voldermort and Harry face in one short battle, inside the front hall of Hogwarts, with all the combatants around them, watching. Neville has already killed the snake outside, and rallied the ""good guys"" by crying ""Dumbledore's Army"" and standing up to Voldemort. There was NO point to changing that, so of course they did. The duel between Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix was way too short and without enough drama to make you care. I had expected the audience-- and myself-- to cheer at the end of that duel; no one did. The book's final battle between Harry and Voldermort was meant to be simple, one-on-one, in the place they both loved; it was meant to show that love was the strongest weapon, and that Voldemort was no more than Tom-Riddle-gone-bad. On dying he collapsed dead before them all, vanquished. It will never make sense to me why they changed such a basic part of the whole plot. The best I can say for this one is that it could have been much worse. My advice to anyone is to read these books before you see the movies, so you understand what you're missing."
"dr-mambo-754-23612","Null","2","4","14 July 2011"," Harry Potter and the deep emotional connection
","The time is 3:00am and I have just returned from a midnight showing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II. With the final Harry Potter film and the release of Toy Story 3 this year, I have suddenly become aware how brief childhood is, and how rapidly the last 10 years have played out. Being born in the early 90s had it's benefits, one of which being that I grew up on Harry Potter. My parents would read the books to me as a child, and had it not been for Rowling I probably would not be reading novels today. Harry Potter first came to our screens in 2001 and we saw for the first time, Daniel, Rupert and Emma in their roles. As the books grew darker, the films grew darker, as the characters grew older and developed so did Radcliffe and friends, as did so many people my age. We all followed Potter on his adventures as we had adventures of our own. However, needles to say the Potter saga is over both on paper and screen and this has left a hole in my heart. I have to say, I have never been more excited for a film in which I already know what is going to happen. However, I have also never been so nervous about a film I am about to see. Would it deliver? Would it live up the books and our expectations? I found myself praying that this would not go the same way as ""The Goblet of Fire"" (a particularly sore spot of mine). The clock stuck midnight in a small but packed cinema and as they announced that they would skip all the trailers the entire audience roared with excitement and sheer happiness. The film started as it should, where we left off in Deathly Hallows Part 1. Did the film deliver? Yes it did. The pace of the film was relentless, but gentle enough when it needed to be. Potter literally had the audience in the palm of it's hand, making us laugh during scenes of death and destruction and weep during scenes of happiness. In the films previous to ""Hallows: Part 2"" I have found myself frowning and cringing at some questionable acting from the cast. I don't like to poke at talented people but I honestly felt Radcliffe in The Goblet of Fire and the Half Blood Prince did not achieve his potential, and for me was not Harry Potter. However it all changed... Daniel Radcliffe gave the absolute performance of his career and was utterly enchanting to watch. A real pleasure to have on our screens. Not only Radcliffe, but the entire cast gave it their absolute all and it showed. A few personal favourites were Alan Rickman as Snape, Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Helen McCrory as Mother Malfoy and the brilliant Fiennes as Lord Voldemort. There was not a single flaw in the performance given by anyone and it really makes me proud to be a fan of Harry Potter. As for the 3D? It certainly added to the film but did not distract you from what was actually going on. It was subtle, and beautiful and not at all in-your-face. *cough* Avatar *cough* I've been to see many films at the cinema but have never had such a wonderful, meaningful, emotional and exciting experience other than watching the final Potter film. I kind of don't want to take off my Gryffindor uniform! Potter part 2 left me feeling mesmerised, satisfied and ecstatic but also extremely sad. It also rewarded long-term Potter fans with many references and moments of nostalgia. This film certainly has it's place in history, and I think all would agree it deserves it."

This movie had almost the same level of surprises as Prisoner of Azkaban did, but the action was better in Deathly Hallows 2 and it also had more dramatic scenes (like the resurrection stone scene, Voldemort's final defeat etc) than Prisoner of Azkaban. My only minor criticism is I think the movie was a tad too focused on action, some more dialogue between Harry and his dead parents would've been lovely. Deathly Hallows Part II is the 6th best movie of all time in my opinion."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) is the final film in the series, and once again directed impressively by David Yates. The film was highly satisfying to watch, and is primarily concerned with the final and most important battle between good and evil; Harry and Voldemort.<br/><br/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue to find the rest of Voldemort's Horcruxes, and as Harry discovers that one is at Hogwarts, they flee there, but Voldemort instantly finds out about their mission. The battle is drawn at Hogwarts as many people fight to protect Harry. As he realises that people are dying for his mistakes, he fights Voldemort for the last time. Along the way, crucial secrets are unravelled, and the mysterious, Deathly Hallows reappear.<br/><br/>I actually really like how Dealthy Hallows is divided into two parts, as these are clearly the most slow-paced of all of the films. Where Part 1 is concerned with horcruxes, Part 2 pick off right at the same premise, but with an increased focus on the final battle.<br/><br/>It is beautifully shot and overall realised by Yates, the cast, and all involved, and the way in which this film brings it all together in the final conclusion for me was something to behold.

","Everyone returns, including the brother and dead sister of the beloved Professor Dumbledore, who live in an oil painting, and even the ghost of Dumbledore himself, played once again by Michael Gambon. Hogwarts is now in the malevolent hands of the sinister Severus Snape (hissing, sniveling Alan Rickman), who is holding students and staff hostage as they wait for Harry to rescue them. The walls and platforms that hold up Hogwarts crumble and collapse like Tinker Toys in a masterpiece of destruction, turning the school of magic into the world's most colossal rubbish heap. A humongous man-eating snake with fangs that strike the audience in 3-D almost devours Hermione, while Ron narrowly escapes a cauldron of flames on a broomstick. With Hogwarts gone and almost every member of the cast killed off by Voldemort, there could obviously never be another installment. But there's still time for tender-hearted Professor Minerva McGonagell (Maggie Smith) to save the day with a spell she's been waiting for years to try. There is even a flashback that explains the sinister role Snape played in Harry's life story that I found unexpectedly touching. The only thing left to do to bring this saga to a heart-stopping conclusion is for Harry to enter the forbidden forest of death like a true hero and face his destiny with Voldemort, played one last time by the hatchet-faced Ralph Fiennes, who actually shows his human side for the first time. Frankly, I'm sorry to see him go.<br/><br/>None of it makes one lick of sense and a lot of the dialogue is pure jabberwocky, decipherable only by those who know the books by heart. This includes billions of rabid fans, so I don't think anyone is even slightly worried that a little formality like incoherence will affect the box office. The movie never wore out my patience like Part 1 did, because the awesome effects take over where the plot used to be, and although this is the end, my guess is that it will fire the imagination for years to come. What fun to feel like a kid again. I had a marvelous time."

","So here it is, the 8th and final instalment of a film franchise that has lasted 10 years and runs at just under 20 hours in total. Following straight on from the frustratingly incomplete scene setter that was Deathly Hallows Part 1, we continue to track Harry, Hermione and Ron as they search for the remaining Horcruxes that will render the evil Lord Voldermort as a mere mortal. This narrative thread is run concurrently with the Voldermort movements, where he now has in his possession The Elder Wand (the wand to rule them all) and has gathered a vast army to descend upon Hogwarts and achieve his ultimate goal of killing Harry. Meanwhile vital character story arcs are filled in and secrets will out...<br/><br/>David Yates directs and Steve Kloves adapts to the screen, both of whom were perfect choices given their considerable input to the series. Smartly the pic has been kept to a 2 hour and 10 minute run time, and thankfully it flows nicely and the pace never stalls. Being one of those who has never read the books I can't say what has been left out or if anything has been tampered with for dramatic licence? What I know for sure is that the emotional investment garnered from being with this story for so long, to be part of these characters lives, watching them grow, ensures that this closure piece pounds the senses. Sitting down to watch it you realise that we are going to lose people we care for, and Hogwarts, the wonderful place we fist glimpsed across the night time water, is going to be attacked and reduced to a battle scarred place of war.<br/><br/>As the effects work dazzles and the one time child actors come shining through as mature actors who have casted off previous wooden traits, the story filling strands show just what wonderful work Rowling achieved on the page. Some of the characters never stood a chance in life, some carried deep emotional scars, and others held secrets so crucial to the whole Potter universe. For a series of such fantastical genre sparkle, the Harry Potter world eventually reveals itself to be a deep and fortified humanist drama, and engaging it most certainly is. That this is achieved as battlefield carnage is raised, with wand wars booming up on the screen, it means credit is due to all involved in the making of such a cherished and intensely followed Octalogy.<br/><br/>Is it the earth shattering finale one hoped for? Well not quite. Story wise for sure that is the case, but with the whole story driving towards the final battle between Harry and Voldermort, it's disappointing to find it's rather brief and in truth anti climatic. Harry the boy now burgeoning into a man versus the snake faced despot surely should have been a crowning glory, but sadly not so. To compound this irritating disappointment, we then get the epilogue that is bogged down by aging make-up design that is almost laughable. But these are just annoyances, not film killers, for this has been a magical ride for 10 years. Fans will feel a gap in the heart now it's over, maybe even shed a Snape like tear as well? Yet ultimately it has been a triumph and the rewatchable factor for the whole series will always remain high. 8/10"

If one has not seen the prior installments, then one will not like this movie as much as they should. Oh, well. Their loss. There are a few reasons why this film is the best of the series. The directing style is probably the biggest change, with many artfully-placed shots highlighting exactly what needs to be at any given time. This is one of the last movies I expected to give a serious compliment to the director for, but I have been forced to eat my words. The art style is the next. It is in complete and utter service to the story, as it is almost ceaselessly bleak and dark. Major characters die on both sides. Evil triumphs for a spell (pardon the pun). War has arrived in the wizarding world. The final reason is the acting, which is easily the best of the series. Each actor and actress seems to have realized that they would never be revisiting these parts, so felt that they had to go out with a bang. And what a noise they made! All of these elements by themselves are not what makes this film so great. None of these aspects individually are anything truly spectacular. However, the fact that all three are so consistent in terms of quality throughout the entire thing make this film a noteworthy one. While there are no standout scenes like the one in Part 1 with our trio being chased through the woods by Death Eaters, this actually speaks as to the overall quality of the final product. The reason there are no outstanding scenes is because there are never any falterings, and dips in terms of the elegance or substance of the filmmaking. The overall tone of the film is another differentiating factor, and is one of the things that most people won't even really notice until the movie is over, that there is virtually no comic relief anywhere in the film. Instead, there is an almost relentless onrush of battle scenes which are so well done that they are worth the price of admission alone. Seeing the movie, it is obvious how much the cast and crew cared about this series, through all its ups and downs over the decade of the franchise's existence. It is thanks to this obvious dedication and commitment that truly makes this film and landmark title. Not in terms of cinema by any means, but in modern culture. Only a handful of other films are ones I can say the same for. And if you check my other reviews, they really aren't that hard to spot."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 isn't just a great fantasy film, but it's also a great film as it understands how to wrap up a once-in-a-lifetime franchise. The acting of the main three stars has improved so much that you really can't get enough of them. Snape probably gets the most amount of depth in this film, which makes the whole viewing experience of the franchise completely different. Ralph Fiennes as Voldemort is fantastic as Voldemort as he really goes above and beyond to kill Harry Potter and survive on his own. One of the best parts of the movie is the Courtyard Apocalypse scene as, accompanied by incredible music, it shows the trio going through Hogwarts and facing almost every possible emotion that you could think of. This movie has some of the most satisfying moments in the franchise you wish had happened sooner. Prepare to be feel all kinds of emotions hit you in this epic conclusion to the amazing franchise."

"HotToastyRag","8","0","0","20 June 2019"," You can't help but cry
","The final movie in the 8-part film franchise is the one everyone's waiting for, and not just because it's the last one. There are so many elements that make the audience feel invigorated and validated, and so much we've been waiting ten years to finally see. Have you been waiting for Maggie Smith to show she can play with the big boys? Have you been hoping Julie Walters would blow her top? Have you been waiting for Harry to choose between Hermione, Ginny, Cho Chang, and Luna? Did your heart go out to Professor Snape in the books, and you've been anxiously awaiting the film's reproduction of his backstory through flashbacks?<br/><br/>Well, the great part about this movie is it has incredible special effects. As you've been expecting since the story took a darker turn, there's an epic build-up to a pretty intense battle. Ralph Fiennes is a very formidable bad guy, and as he and his cronies surround Hogwarts, Maggie Smith and the other good guys cast protection spells around the castle. It's a very ominous scene with quite an emotional feeling for the students and audience members, since we've all grown up watching the castle for the past ten years. The battle scenes themselves are quite upsetting, so be prepared if you've fallen in love with certain characters that not everyone gets a happy ending.<br/><br/>Finally, the moment everyone's been waiting for: Alan Rickman gets his day in the sun. His character, Professor Snape, has become a universal cult favorite, even among those who haven't read the books. A warning to those who have read the books: the page-to-screen conversion got severely cut. The seventh novel was a very emotional read, and as you immersed yourself in the pages and pages and pages of Snape's childhood and teenage years, you were probably hoping he'd get an entire movie to himself. While he doesn't get the majority of the movie's screen time, you can still love those scenes.<br/><br/>You can't please everyone, and J.K. Rowling received more than her fair share of criticism about the way her book series ended. If you don't end up liking the end of this movie, just remember that the books ended the same way, and Steve Kloves and the rest of Hollywood probably wanted to be faithful to the original story. There is one omission from the text that did bother me: Harry makes a speech in front of the entire school, and when he finds out he was wrong, he doesn't make another speech, as he does in the book. If you know what part I'm talking about and you loved that part of the book, it might be a good warning to know it's missing from the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, it's a very good adaptation of the final book, including most of the text in the last two movies. You'll cry, both out of sadness and out of heartwarming nostalgia that these kids you've connected with since you and they were ten years old are now grown ups. It's a true experience watching these movies, let alone growing up alongside them and going to the theaters to see them, so with all the history between you, it's not really possible to hold lasting grudges or express more than a little disappointment in the way the story turned out. And, of course, the very end is priceless.<br/><br/>Kiddy Warning: Obviously, you have control over your own children. However this one's pretty violent and upsetting for kids, I'd wait until my kids were pre-teens or older before letting them watch it."

Anyways, we should admit that her books are magical and indeed very interesting. I'm a fan myself since I was 12. <br/><br/>When it comes to the movie, the acting and the visual effects were almost perfect and the director did a memorable job. The sound effects and music are also amazing. <br/><br/>I can't stop watching the final part. And, I'm sure fans are always waiting for more.

As always, good special effects to complement the story and a satisfying ending that was much to be expected. With a series that spanned an entire decade, perhaps the most intriguing thing for me was seeing how the characters grew and matured over time. You have to wonder whether the principal players regretted the end of the story or whether there was a sigh of relief that it finally came to an end. Either way, you have a substantial legacy of movies here that will live on for many more Harry Potter fans to come."

This last installment is all about Harry(played by Daniel Radcliffe)who goes head to head against his long time nemesis Lord Voldermort(who wants him dead,and he is played by an unrecognizable Ralph Fiennes)and its a battle against evil with Voldermort's companions(one played by Helena Bonham Carter and Jason Issacs)and Harry must try and save Hogwarts from the deadly hallows.<br/><br/>After 10 years debuting on the Big Screen,this final film was very good.

"borkasztik","7","0","0","30 January 2013"," week Battle
","My greatest problem with Yates is obviously the battle of Hogwarts. The battle scenes in both Order of the Phoenix and the Half-Blood Prince were disappointing, but I have always been under the impression that this was not so strange because they hadn't enough time to show a decent battle. When I heard DH was split into two parts, immediately I dreamed of a heroic battle of Hogwarts. I thought they would show us everything Rowling described in the book, and so much more - because in a film you can do this. Instead they showed us nothing but two rapid action sequences where the camera flew rapidly over Hogwarts. We didn't see anyone actually dueling, nor did we see the main characters dying. In the book Professor Trelawny fights with crystal balls, and even the centaurs attack in the battle. Did we see any of this happen in the movie? Did we see the battle in the Great Hall? In the book it is described that every character dueled with other characters - George Weasley and Lee Jordan against Yaxley, Flitwick against Dolohov, Hagrid against MacNair, Ron and Neville against Greyback, etc. Did we see any of these duels? Every character that had a role in the first seven movies was asked to return for DH - Part Two. Professor Trelawny, Professor Sprout - they where all on the set. But David Yates didn't think it was necessary to show any of the previous characters fighting or dueling, except one tiny little duel of Mrs. Weasley against Bellatrix. And now we see a huge difference with Lord of the Rings where every minor character gets his role."
"jason-thomas-lawson","Null","0","0","5 November 2011"," This movie does not stay loyal to the book....
","The best way to review this movie is to criticize all the 8+ star reviews that it has been given. If anyone tells you that this movie (or that the two Deathly Hallows movies combined) stay the most loyal to the book, please ask them to submit to a drug test for their own good. This movie portrays the most important scene in the series, the final duel between Harry and Lord Voldemort, COMPLETELY different from the book. I mean folks....this is THE MOST IMPORTANT SCENE in 7 books and 8 movies....and the director decided to throw the book out the window, come up with his own version of the scene, and pretty much ruin it in the process. In all honesty, the only Oscar that this movie should be nominated for, if it existed, would be ""Most Anti-Climatic Defeat Of A Major Villain"". While the battle scenes at Hogwarts are barely decent (could be better but were far overdone with CGI), those scenes are still much better in the book. Another major faux pas on the part of the director was to hint at the back-story of Dumbledore throughout both of the Deathly Hallows movies, and in the Half-Blood Prince, and then never tell the actual back-story. Sorry, but this director had 5 1/2 hours across two movies and left out key portions of the story, and then proceeded to ruin the most important scene. Fans of the Harry Potter series should be severely disgusted to end the movies on this note.<br/><br/>And BTW, this movie is not going to get the nod or even a nomination for Best Picture just because it's the last movie...this isn't the same situation that the Lord Of The Rings series was in. You had different directors throughout the movies, and you can't just reward the last one for grins."

","First of all, the movie stands for itself...but for the fans, the readers of the books, not quite.<br/><br/>I bet you David Yates hasn't read the books, and if he did, then his head wasn't right. He probably only read the scripts, that could explain the misguidance of the characters. Since the Order Of The Phoenix, he's made the same mistakes. No character development except for Harry, Ron and Hermoine (or whatever you spell that). He also made the films feel like a rush, as the scenes are also fast-paced. Since he took command, he made the supporting characters be treated as background characters. May as well not put such valuable actors if they're just going to be serving in the background, almost as if they were forgotten. <br/><br/>I mean, for example, Lupin and Tonks' death...one word, BOOM. One moment they're alive, the other dead. No mourning over them, no mention too...just a two-second glimpse at their bodies. How can you put Lupin (Thewlis did a magnificent job with him) in just a few minutes in the movie, with one mediocre line, and just kill him, when he was one of the main driving forces on the third movie, The Prisoner Of Azkabam? Or as well, Gary Oldman, just a minute on screen, barely a cameo? what's the point? The readers are not dumb, they wont be satisfied with such scenes like these. Ralph Fiennes...I like him, and sometimes he manages to make Voldemort look like a freak and sick bastard, such as when he ""hugs"" Draco, but there's no driving force behind him, just killing Harry Potter. The driving force for killing Potter is never explained, therefore, his character loses the interest of the audience.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman and Jason Isaacs are pure gold in this film. Even though their scenes are not as big, they make gold out of every moment they appear on screen. But then again, all these supporting characters may not be the heart, but they're the structure of the story, they hold it together as they surround Harry Potter.<br/><br/>And last, the final battle (sigh). We barely get a glimpse of it, because we were following the main characters all around, sometimes with boring moments. Some call the battle epic, but it's not. Epic should have moments of glory, and there was barely any moment of glory, except for Neville. <br/><br/>Excuse me for my bad writing."

","After eight films in 10 years and a cumulative global box- office take of more than $6.3 billion, the most successful franchise in movie history comes to an obligatory – and climactic, fulfilling conclusion in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. To say the least, this is a massively eventful finale will take fans on a ride of pure adrenaline. <br/><br/>It has been an extraordinary journey – an adventure for the producers, the performers, and the audience as the once young, naïve, and, in all honesty, mediocre actors Daniel Radcliffe,Rupert Grint,and Emma Watson have become remarkable thespians. Their emotions are palpable as they take viewers on one last, heart-stopping, breathtaking journey into the magical world of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>With the knowledge that the end is near – in a number of ways – the production team holds nothing back. The eventual sight of the once mystical and ethereal Hogwarts in absolute ruin is striking. Although the cinematography was excellent throughout the series, with the most recent installment it is taken to a new level as the audience members find themselves overwhelmed by the reality of the wizard world. Furthermore, the makeup is at its best – especially when it comes to the goblins and Lord Voldemort, (one instance in particular is truly astonishing). Alexandre Desplat creates what may very well be the best soundtrack of the series, subtly incorporating echoes of John Williams' original themes while richly boosting the electrifying, intense dramatic scenes with brilliant compositions.<br/><br/>The only disappointment of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the harrowing knowledge that this film represents the end of one of the greatest film series' of all time ."

","The ten-year wait is finally over. Daniel Radcliff and company shine yet again in Part II of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows, an emotionally magical culmination of a generation. At first, the decision of director David Yates to split the last movie into two parts annoyed and confused me. As much as I didn't want to say goodbye to these characters that I feel I have grown very close to, I didn't want to wait for almost a year to see Potter prevail and defeat Voldemort in the final battle. I mean I would have sat through a five-hour feature that I already knew the ending of but I may be in the minority on that one. Actually, that part's probably not true. But, after seeing Part II, I see why Yates prolonged the series—and I am very glad that he did. Obviously, the final installment is all about the ultimate showdown between Harry and Voldemort. After a drawn out, basically action-less Part I, its counterpart was packed with explosive and heart-racing action, emotional turmoil, and ""unexpected"" plot twists from the minute the familiar logo slowly crept onto the screen in time to the unmistakable Harry Potter theme music. Although Part I was great for character development, it was really just used as a stage to prepare for the non-stop epic battle that was Part II. The floodgates of the film opened with the gang trying to steal a horcrux from Gringotts bank. Part humor, part seat-gripping thriller, with a huge dash of special effect, the 2-hour and 10-minute movie-- the shortest of the series-- was as mind blowing as I expected. As with some action movies, battle scenes and special effects can get drawn out to the point of exhaustion and annoyance. I can only watch things blow up in my face and people punching one another for so long. Luckily this was not the case with my beloved Harry Potter. When the fighting, spell casting, and fire breathing dragons got to be almost too much, the characters would be right there, peppering the scene with a subtle yet humorous remark or a deep comment, which helped the viewer stay interested and connected to the plot and the characters. Faithful fans of Harry Potter have been following the trio of friends since the movies hit the big screen in 2000. Many began the journey when JK Rowling released the first book in 1997. Being one of those Potter patrons from before the turn of the century, I feel as if I have grown up with the characters, so to see the whole franchise end as magically as it began was very emotional for me, as well as my fellow movie goers. After seeing all seven movies in the same two theaters—the local theater on Main Street in Ramsey, NJ and at the Garden State Plaza Mall, I had the privilege to see this movie on a random summer Thursday afternoon in Boston with two of my best friends. Not so surprisingly, the crowd that joined us was no different from the crowds I have experienced when viewing every other Potter production. Despite it being 2:30 p.m. in the middle of the week and almost two weeks after the movie was released, the theater was sold out. The crowd ranged from young children to their grandparents, all who remained enraptured the entire time. I expect that everyone was on the edge of their plush, red seats, ignoring their obligatory and over-priced bag of popcorn and large soda as the story unfolded on the large screen. We all gasped at the appropriate moments, laughed at the cleverly delivered wittiness, and all held our breathe at the highly anticipated, ""AVADA KEDAVRA,"" bellowed by Lord Voldemort, striking Harry down in the center of the Forbidden Forest. When the lights slowly rose after the final scene, in which we see Harry, Ron and Hermione, creepily portrayed as adults with children, I had tears in my eyes. Walking out of the theater, I was pathetically crying, realizing that it was actually over. Being the same age as the characters, I have grown up with them and the final movie solidified an end of an era for me, and many others. As sad as I am to have reached the end, I am pleasantly content with how strictly the movie adhered to the book. It tied up every last detail of the whole saga. Now, I just can't wait for it to be released on DVD so I can revisit this epoch anytime I please."

","I have never read the books. Before you stop reading this review because of that fact, I would like to say that I think that gives me a unique perspective. I was not comparing this movie to the books, I was not expecting specific scenes or events to happen. I had no idea what would happen. I was able to view this movie for what it is, a movie. And after watching this 2 hour masterpiece unfold, I can say with confidence that this was the best movie I have ever seen.<br/><br/>I never really had much interest in Harry Potter growing up and like I said I have never read the books. A few weeks ago I was at my brother's house and he started watching the movies so I thought I would give them a try. The first two were alright, but by the 3rd one they really started getting good. I watched all 7 of them in under 2 weeks. Then we went to the theater to see the final movie and it just blew my mind. I left the theater feeling like I just experienced something that I will never forget. The movie was so powerful, it sent chills down my back like I have never experienced in my life, it nearly had me in tears, and it never failed to completely captivate my attention. There is just something special about the movie, no movie has ever impacted me like this.<br/><br/>Some user reviews written by hardcore fans of the book were disappointed in the film. Their disappointment was usually centered around omitted scenes they wanted included, or elements of the film that were different than those of the book. I even read some reviews that claimed this movie was emotionless?!?!? That just seems ridiculous to me. But I wonder if, perhaps, I would of felt the same way had I read the books first. I guess I will never really know. Maybe people who read the books experienced something that I won't fully understand or experience because I will constantly be thinking of the movies and comparing them. But comparison kills contentment. This movie was perfectly paced, powerful, emotional, just completely memorizing. Personally I think if you fail to see it you are comparing it to a book that was probably just as powerful and becoming frustrated in how they are different. But if you can somehow view the movie as separate from the books, which is very difficult if you have already read them, if not impossible, then perhaps you can appreciate it. And I do plan on reading the books, but this experience will live with me forever. Watching the first 7 movies leading up seeing the nearly perfect final movie on the big screen.<br/><br/>One final note to the power and emotion of the film. The themes in the movie of self sacrifice, love, and friendship are so powerful and they were portrayed extremely well in the movie. I left feeling like it was time to start living for something more, something bigger."

Joe Rowling created a world that touched the hearts of millions, and David Yates brought that onto the screen for ALL to see. Even though there were many 'liberties' taken by the director, it didn't even effect the grade of quality. The plot of thick, the effects were top-notch, the music out OUTSTANDING, and the cast had the great chemistry that makes you fall with love with their work. Over-all, the final installation of the Harry Potter series truly head up to its expectations. I watched it eight times in theaters, I own it on DVD, and the soundtrack is next on my list.

","Ten years ago Harry Potter began and now, ten years later, it ends with a beauty and majesty that is unmatched by any other film in the series. Here is where everyone went all out, both in performance as well as artistic wise. Our beloved three main actors; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, put on on the performances of their careers in this final Harry Potter. They unleash an emotional side of themselves that we haven't seen before in their movies while also showing the strength of their characters unlike we've ever seen in any other Harry Potter. However, alas, it is still nearly impossible for any actor in the movie to stand by the imposing figure of the scared and angry Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) as well as the intimidating and secretive Professor Snape (Alan Rickman); who also has an almost Darth Vaderish feel about him in this movie, and not be out-shined. Either way, besides the outstanding performances, the special effects team worked the most amazing kind of magic for the climatic final battle of Hogwarts. The posters show that Hogwarts is in ruin but seeing how it got there just sets an almost tearful mood for decade long fans (and even non-fans shall be tempted to shed a tear for the painful sight). The technical aspects of the film will blow anyone as much as the performances will. Altogether it will cause your eyes to blaze with the power from this film.<br/><br/>In this final Harry Potter film the secret of the ""Deathly Hallows"" will finally be revealed as well as what secret Dumbledore had kept from Harry all these years. The great battle for Hogwarts will begin and Harry most face his toughest challenge of all. It all comes together and of course we all know that it could've ended either good or bad but, happily, it was not the latter. The story takes a hold of you and will keep you firmly grasped until the very last powerful scene of the film. It's ending is a fitting end to one of the greatest film franchises in history, bringing about emotional power that will finally make the restraining tears burst through.<br/><br/>In this film you will laugh, cry, and even applaud as the final reel ends. As Harry Potter comes to a much anticipated close the feeling will be bitter-sweet, after all, it's not easy seeing everyone's favorite wizard leave the big screen for the last time. But, the wonderful cast and crew who worked tirelessly on this decade long project will definitely have a bright future in Hollywood. Me, personally, cannot wait to see what else they do and ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2"" has my vote for Best Picture of the Year at the Golden Globe Awards."

"Queer-qatfm","Null","0","0","6 September 2011"," A long awaited and actually rather welcome end.
","When we last left The Boy Who Lived, I was all in a bitchy uproar that they decided to split the final film. Warner Brothers claimed it was because there just was so much good stuff, it'd be improper for them to do otherwise. I said that was b.s. and it was all about the money. Now having seen the completed portion of Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows, I can further confirm that I was the one who was right, not that it really matters now.<br/><br/>What I can't believe is that even in the second half of the film, it seemed like they simply didn't not know how to pace themselves correctly. Maybe they feel other things were just more important, I dunno. I could spend all the rest of this night and probably a full week trying to tell you how I would have done it differently. But to do so would give too many spoilers than I'm comfortable with. However, as one example, I would have excised so much of the mindless forest hiding out in Part One and put the sequence from Gringots from Part Two in its place. That would have given that first movie a bit more excitement -and- gave them more time to focus on the hurried events towards the end of this concluding piece of cinematic history.<br/><br/>Most reviewers are taking this opportunity to gush about how amazing everything's turned out with this series. They love how the whole lot of films got produced with the same cast, spanning many years with different directors, and now that all the cards have been shown, we simply have one long 8 film epic fantasy film that should be given the highest accolades and honors. But, I protest that movie critiquing doesn't work that way. No matter that this is the conclusion of a two-part film that shouldn't have been separated in the first place still stands in my book.<br/><br/>Yes, the battle over Hogwarts involving so many of our beloved characters is pretty darn close to perfect. With so much kinetic energy sown into this one moment, it really had to deliver and it so very much did. I felt peril. I felt a strong lurching in my chest that I was being pulled along at a rapid clip. Perhaps it was because we'd been dilly dallying around for so long. Or maybe, like Harry, I was ready for the end to come. And yet, even in the midst of moving from one grandstanding moment to the next, director David Yates continues to fail me. Many heartfelt and powerful moments become more like blink-and-you'll-miss-them after thoughts in narrative. Major things are happening to people not named Harry Potter that fans of this series care desperately for, and we've been brought all this way, often spending far too much time repeating the same mantras: isolation, sense of purpose, fate/destiny. And yet we can't give these other moments just a bit longer to spend in the forefront? No. We have to rehash it all. And I mean everything from the very beginning as Harry spends some time in a scene very reminiscent of Neo visiting with The Architect in the much maligned Matrix Reloaded. Fortunately however, this incredibly lame scene where all is revealed to the most inept audience member is counterbalanced with a lengthy sequence giving the entire history from Severus Snape's point of view. While technically a flashback, it also ends up being one of the best parts of not only this Harry Potter film, but maybe of the last three. Also of note, it seems that Daniel Radcliffe's acting ability has started to far surpass everyone around him. While most are just chewing scenery, he seems, for what may be the first time, really coming across AS Harry Potter who has experienced all of these things.<br/><br/>I guess what I'm saying is that Harry Potter's ending is much like a giant ship bobbing up and down on the ocean filled with many dangers, and I don't think that David Yates was the right tugboat for the job. He might of gotten us into harbor and home, but we've seriously wrecked most of the rigging, the franchise, and other boats in the process. Essentially, it's a satisfying end as the story is finally given its theatrical so long, but I think a better job could have been done and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 does little to improve on that. We haven't gone into outstanding territory again, more like, just marginally better than it was when we were back at Order of the Phoenix and it was his first try at the series."

","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2"" completes the story of Harry Potter's quest, begun in ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" and continued in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part1"", to find and destroy the ""Horcruxes"", items in which the evil Lord Voldemort has hidden parts of his soul. Once all the Horcruxes have been destroyed, Voldemort will become mortal. Neville Longbottom, who in some of the earlier films was a minor, rather comical character, here emerges as one of Harry's key allies in the fight against Voldemort; indeed, he plays a larger role in this film than do Harry's best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br/><br/>The earlier instalments in the ""Harry Potter"" film series, especially the first two directed by Chris Columbus, were closely based upon the traditional British boarding school story, Billy Bunter or Angela Brazil with magic. The tone of the series gradually darkened, until ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part1"" more closely resembled something like a supernatural version of Orwell's ""1984"". In Part 2 another literary influence is clearly at play, namely Tolkien's ""Lord of the Rings"" and Peter Jackson's three epic fantasy films which were based upon it. The climax of part 2 comes when Voldemort and his followers, the Death Eaters, launch an attack upon Hogwarts School, a sequence clearly influenced by the battle scenes in Jackson's ""The Two Towers"" and ""The Return of the King"". The Elder Wand- one of the three ""deathly hallows"" of the title- plays a similar role here to that played by the Ring of Power in ""Lord of the Rings""- a magical artifact which can bring great power to its possessor, but which can also corrupt him.<br/><br/>This is perhaps also the most explicitly Christian film in the series. The film's moral principle is the need to fight against evil which, it is emphasised, can be something internal as well as external- something symbolised by Harry's realisation that, in a very real sense, there is a part of Lord Voldemort which lives inside him. If Ralph Fiennes's Voldemort has always been a satanic figure, Michael Gambon's Albus Dumbledore here takes on the characteristics of a benign deity. Although Dumbledore was killed at the end of the sixth film, ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"", he returns here, seen not only in flashbacks to the past but also in an afterlife. Fiennes and Gambon give two of the three finest performances in this film; the third comes from the consistently excellent Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Dumbledore's successor as headmaster of Hogwarts. In the previous films Snape was always a morally ambiguous figure; in this one the question of whether he sides with the forces of good or evil is finally answered.<br/><br/>When I reviewed ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part1"" I commented that it felt less like a film in its own right than a very lengthy introduction to something else, and expressed the hope that Part 2 would be better. I was not disappointed in that wish. Part 2 is, in fact, in my view the best of the Potter films, generating more excitement and tension than any other entry in the series. If Potter fans are disappointed by the thought that there will not be any further instalments in the canon, they can at least console themselves with the thought that David Yates has saved the best till last. 9/10"

","As a fan of the Harry Potter franchise (Books & Films), I must say that this absolutely was a fantastic film. It is rewarding in all ways; dialog and acting, visual effect, camera angles, the score etc. This movie begins right where the other left off (SPOILER!!!!): Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) breaks into Albus Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) to obtain The Elder Wand, the most powerful wand ever created. After that, the Warner Bros. logo appears and Part 2 ensues.<br/><br/>Our heroes are right where we left them at (SPOILERS!!!!!: at Shell Cottage. They plan to break into Gringotts to get another Horcrux (magical object that conceals a part of Lord Voldemort's soul). Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermoine (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) do so with the help of Griphook (Warwick Davis), a goblin that works in Gringotts. Now, I'm going to give too much away. After they do what they have to do, they go to Hogsmeade, where they are being searched for by Death Eaters.<br/><br/>Now, to Hogwarts. Our heroes go to Hogwarts to find it has been turned into Auswitz (A Nazi Death Camp). And the new headmaster? Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman). ABout Alan Rickman, he steals the show. I found his character to be very dynamic, and heart breaking. His portrayal of Snape is the best work he's done. You actually feel bad for his character. His lines that he says after before his death, (SPOILERS!!!!) ""You have your mother's eyes..."" are heart wrenching. And then his memories. The memories of Snape make the rest of the movie anti-climactic. Alan Rickman deserves to be given the Best Supporting Actor Oscar.<br/><br/>But, anyway, the battle ensues, and it is amazing. The visual effects are amazing. In the end, the final showdown between Potter and Voldemort, is very good. I enjoyed how they (SPOILERS!!!!!!) kept moving around the castle, battling until they got into the courtyard. It is a truly emotional film with a great cast. I personally think it's the Best Picture this year. 11/10 is my rating. And it's well deserved."

","After 10 years and the best part of 20 hours of cinema, J.K Rowling's Harry Potter franchise is departing from our big screens. The cinematic finale of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2″ sticks with director David Yates for a fourth outing, but has the second part of this epic adventure done justice to the grand source material, and can it be anywhere near as good as its eerie and beautiful predecessor? Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) has located the Elder Wand; one of the three components that make up the Deathly Hallows. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) are aware that his discovery has granted him incomprehensible power and are in terrible danger. When Harry becomes aware that a Horcrux is located in Hogwarts School, the trio must head back to the place where their adventure began and defeat the vicious wizard who so eagerly longs for Harry's blood.<br/><br/>When adapting a work so adored, it's difficult to know how an audience will react to any changes, realistically however these are only made to better the cinematic experience, not to devalue the novel.This movie finds a balance between the two, it's incredibly faithful to the book and only has a very few slight alterations which work perfectly well within the world of the picture.<br/><br/>Part 2 is easily as good as its predecessor; rather than having the calculated suspense of the first part, this picture bursts with action and energy right from the start. Both films are so different from each other but perfectly capture the spirit of Rowling's final book. This film is a marvellous spectacle; it's exciting and intoxicating with its glorious battle sequences, but as well as its cinematography and set design.<br/><br/>Yates' direction is sumptuously executed. He knows Harry Potter so well and he direct the films with dedication which is clearly evident throughout. This film doesn't just rely on its action and spectacle to be brilliant because the real success story lies in the character drama and emotion.<br/><br/>Without a doubt the finest moment is the lengthy montage of Professor Snape's (Alan Rickman) memories and how he has impacted on Harry's life; it's a beautifully sculpted and timed piece that really digs under his hard façade. The film also fantastically pulls at the viewer's emotional strings with the death and destruction of all the characters involved. For those who have read the book, you already know it has an awfully high body count and we see the effects of this in distressing detail proving how adult this franchise is.<br/><br/>However this last chapter does share one major thing with the 2010′s first part; tone. This film is dark in every sense of the word. It has a deeply unsettling and brooding nature, created through its dim and ambient lighting; some rooms only have light from a flickering candle or the trio's wands aided with the ""Lumos"" charm.<br/><br/>The success of the story is highlighted through the performances of Dan, Rupert and Emma who, like the story itself, have grown in strength over the last decade.<br/><br/>Radcliffe is certainly strong; particularly with the emotional content. His portrayal of Harry is so beautifully defined and controlled. It's the same story with Grint and Watson too – both have high emotional sequences and indeed intimate as the pair's love for one another grows. As always, the finest performer is Rickman. Snape is such a brilliantly complex character. He is a tragic hero, a tragic villain and a hopeless romantic for a lost soul. Rickman uses and portrays all these elements with such skill.<br/><br/>Verdict: ●●●●● <br/><br/>It's a brilliant farewell to ""The Boy Who Lived"", and although the departure is deeply saddening, the last chapter makes sure his exit is the one he deserved; an utterly unforgettable one.<br/><br/>Red more reviews on www.theupcoming.co.uk"

","This was an interesting series of film to follow. I don't share any of the excitement that brought hard core fans of the books into these films for the last 10 years. I never read any complete book, although i did have a very close contact with some very freak fans of the series, so i know what their motivations are. The discussion of these harder fans moves around how each knew film was or not able to grasp all the contents of the book, and produce the image(s) that the book suggested to each reader. Or was it acceptable to leave certain elements of the story that a film Always has to leave behind. I never cared about those arguments, because the films create a universe of their own, slightly close to the one in the books, which can even coincide at some moment, but still autonomous. So in a way, the books are to the films, as Hogwarts is to the real world In the films. Rooted in it, but no It. <br/><br/>What kept me coming to the franchise was the fairly interesting idea of seeing how these films would follow a story than span over 7 years, using the same (teenager) actors, that would grow up with their characters. The main interesting idea was this: the films grow as the characters in it, as the actors that represent those characters And as the target public grows with them. We see the films mature in content, we see the actors get older, we see the fabric of the cinematic world change before our eyes. That was an interesting path, mapped into my own evolution as a viewer in the last 8 years (when i started to watch the films). This was not a linear obstacle free course. The owners of the franchise messed up a lot in the way, but they were trying something never done for those matters, so we'll have to give them a break.<br/><br/>So they chose Columbus for the first 2, a master of children's films, someone whose mind specifically works to understand how children's heads function, visually, and narratively. Both his films had a theme, visual, cinematic. Than the third one, probably the best, added notions of time and space as one, and called to do it a master in that cinematic kingdom, Cuarón, the best director to work on this franchise. Azkaban was a maturing film, evolved like a teenager would, and added cinematic deepness into the seducing yet flat world of the first 2. Cuarón gave us the best Hogwarts and the best cinematic use of the story. The dramatic shift came after that one. Numbers 4 and 5 were absolute disasters, suffering from the same mistakes that any bad teenager movie suffers, pretending to be special and appealing to the uniqueness of each one's personality while being itself a boring copy paste sub product. This was bad, i was really sorry that Yates wouldn't follow the leads of the first 3 films, he broke a chain. But he redeemed himself in the 6th installment, and he did that rooting once again the series on space. Hogwarts again, but with a new vision. That was a fascinating film which, coupled with Azkaban, gives us 2 great visions of cinematic space. After that the story required that the next film would be disembodied, and it was. I talked about that one elsewhere. It was an interesting move, though not specially powerful in the end. <br/><br/>And we get to this film. As it was expected, this would be merely a conclusion. It had to be grand, it had to have fireworks, flashy scenes, dramatic kills, suffering, pain, redemption. It had a battle, central to the film, where all the forces collide, all the tensions are released, all the schemes come to an end. It's modeled after the third lord of the rings, and it doesn't bring much to the table, a mere conclusion, certainly required, but not so much interesting.<br/><br/>One thing is interesting though. We have a great number of loose ends that are tied up in this film. Dumbledore's brother, Snape's past, Harry's ""half death"". How each of this knots is tied up to the larger narrative uses interesting narrative cinematic devices. Dumbledore whose image is reflected in a piece of mirror Harry carries with him. Snape through the pensatorium, which basically creates a film inside Harry's head. And Harry's death, although lame on the way the set has been taken care, which slides two characters (one of them already dead) into a 3rd abstraction, over the abstraction which is Hogwarts and the magical world, in relation to the ""real"" non magical world of the film, in relation to our real world as viewers. I'm sorry that the film had to spend so much time in battles and grandeur to allow itself to explore these devices.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call it essential nor even close. But i won't harm to spend to spend time with this franchise, and watch it as a whole, in its context.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5 (for this film)<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"
"jtmytake3","Null","0","0","22 August 2011"," The boy wizard who was destined for greatness finally comes into his own.
","The end is finally nigh, the conclusion of one of the greatest modern fairy tales of our time is now consigned to literary and movie history. I scarcely believe that J K Rowling herself could have imagined such a worldwide phenomenon that has made her one of the most respected novelists who ever put pen to paper. The story of a young boy who we have watched become a young man over the last ten years is now destined to meet his destiny and meet the dark Lord Voldermort. It all ends read the posters but who will it end for? Ms Rowling had already hinted that many of the characters would not survive with Dumbledore falling at the hands of Snape in part I. The task for our heroes is simple to destroy the dark lord you must destroy the horcruxes that contain a part of his soul. With three horcruxes destroyed in part I the trio must now find the remaining horcruxes which is no easy task with Voldermort extending his reign of terror to every corner of the wizard and muggle world. Time is running out and a confrontation of epic proportions is on the cards can good triumph over evil and can the boy who lived....live? A part of me is a little sad that's it over the global spectacle that has engrossed cinema and reading audiences is now coming to an end and it's going out in supreme style with the biggest weekend gross in history and paling into significance the box office takings of its predecessors and became the fastest movie to reach the six hundred million dollar mark in just eight days . But is it any good? In simple answer to that question yes it is! The magical world created by the J K Rowling has had some time to ingratiate itself within the hearts of minds of millions of loyal followers and casual cinema audiences alike and what's not to like. The cast assembled for these movies has been immense with the cream of the crop of British talent on offer and making stars out of the young actors chosen to carry the burden for all these years.<br/><br/>The finale is packed with action sequences and amazing special effects but the story is the real winner here the interweaving narrative that has encompassed so many characters is brought to a thrilling conclusion. The acting as we have come to expect is excellent with the three leads coming of age in quite glorious fashion. The supporting cast are excellent and it's rather difficult to choose one person who has risen above the rest. Fiennes is excellent as the evil one on the verge of achieving his self proclaimed prophecy.<br/><br/>If I had to choose one however it would be Alan Rickman whose back story is truly revealed and once again another hat tipped to J K Rowling for such a rich and multi layered story. There are not any bad points in this movie, epic battle check, and superior special effects check and couple that with excellent performances from a well crafted story and what we have here is cinematic heaven and a movie that is going to most certainly outdo the previous chapter in box office takings and make Warner Bros even richer than were before. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II receives 4 out of 5 and is in cinemas everywhere now so don't be silly go see it!"

","HP7-Part 2: The wait for every HP movie was long and this one seemed even longer as this is where it all ends. But the wait was worth it. Probably the best of Harry Potter series. Yes, Harry is back one last time and in a way which we all waited for so long. The Movie works like Magic, especially in 3D.And this was my first 3D experience also, Loved every bit of it. It had everything we want in HP series, thrill, action, magic, fun Smile Overall, it may be said that the movie was good. The direction,the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. The children have grown so much.hop every one also enjoyed like me!!"

It was an epic ending to an epic series and I don't know if there will anything as epic ever again. I begin reading these a while back and now I own all the movies and books plus a tee shirt. I never imagined I could be so hooked. So if you are a fan, or you're looking for a movie to see, I recommend Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The ending death was epic, along with the sadness of losing Tonks, one of the Wesley twins and many more. So, sit back, relax and enjoy it. It will last for generations to come."
"Hocklife","Null","0","0","17 August 2011"," The Failures of the Previous 3 Films Bring It Down.
","Being a fan of the series (not that big) I've read the series and seen the movies a few times. It was inevitable the longer the books of J.K. Rowling's fantasy world got the more difficult they'd translate to the big screen. Ultimately Harry Potter is a series and this means the stories carry the weight of information learned in the earlier books into the next one. This is where the great fault for the overall dull and butchered adaptation of Harry Potter series lies.<br/><br/>David Yates the director of the last 4 Potter movies is the biggest flaw in the series. While it did create a better continuity directing style it allowed him to change priorities in story. Half Blood Prince the book was about Voldemort's past and his desires, but Hollywood saw fit to turn a small side plot of Harry's love for Ginny into a romantic comedy with a little magic mixed in. By not establishing the details on the horocruxes and other significant charterers everything in this movie and the 1st part seem random , silly and illogical. At points in the narrative it looks like the actors are simply making it up as they go and guessing there way to the next clue using no knowledge.<br/><br/>Now onto the film itself, essentially this is a bank heist ( with a dragon) followed by a battle to end all battles. 99.9% of the story by this time is told and its basically all fighting and destroying horocruxes from here on out. Unfortunately the battles never capture the epic scope of the bigger LOTR battles and are poorly constructed. The main bad guy of the entire franchise Voldemort is a complete bore doing just about nothing until killing one of his henchmen for some silly reason.<br/><br/>Another big problem with this movie is too much attention on Harry, Ron and Hermoine. There are a ton of good characters in Harry Potter and they merely are seen as cameos they have so little screen time ( Lupin , Every Wesley except Ron, Tonks).<br/><br/>While I may make it seem like this movie was awful it really isn't accurate for how I felt. Its only a disappointment but some of what it did was really well done. Snape's character throughout all 8 movies was played and used flawlessly, he ends up having the best scene in the whole film by a mile ( which was done brilliantly). The scene not only steals the audience emotions revealing Snape's past it also does what the rest of the film failed miserably at doing, slowing the pacing down. The visuals are stunning and although the scope isn't as big as LOTR it still feels grand in its own right. Its a massive undertaking adapting books to film and Harry Potter did above average all together.<br/><br/>Overall this movie was a disappointment because of the failures of the previous few movies. But when the director did those himself, ultimately the fault is solely on David Yates. Congrats you have brought the world of Harry Potter to life with your amazing visuals, now how about you bring the story to life? In the meantime one can only hope Peter Jackson comes and does a more faithful reboot this franchise deserves .<br/><br/>Final Vote 6/10"
"Conradical19","10","0","0","17 August 2011"," A spellbinding ending to an unforgettable tale
","My 10/10 doesn't just go to this film but also the franchise and the books. With the 'Deathly Hallows', I chose not to read the book so it wouldn't spoil the film for me (that and I had A-Levels). It worked! Also, the extended trailer shows a lot of action and may spoil your film experience so it's best to watch that after the film, in my opinion. Despite the film being the last one, surprisingly I didn't feel sad at the credits.<br/><br/>This final installment seemed to mention and explain the key parts of the story that were needed for the ending. However, I have read parts of the last books since watching the film and they are still really enjoyable to read. They provide more explanation with plot details. What annoyed me with some of the previous films (E.g. 'Order of the Phoenix') was that some important plot details were never mentioned; such as, why Harry must stay at the Dursley's until Voldemort is defeated. Whereas, other details were mentioned in later films to make up for the absence. It has been fairly obvious how each Director has imposed their own interpretation of the story and appearance in the films. Still, the books and the films together create a complete understanding of the story.<br/><br/>Also, I've noticed that the films got progressively darker over the years and I don't just mean the plot (we all know that), I'm referring to the actual lighting. In the 'Half-Blood Prince' with the fight scene in the toilets, the scene is virtually black and white. Even the sunlight in some scenes has this golden tinge rather than bringing out the colour in everything else.<br/><br/>Interestingly, this final part also puts a focus on the fear of dying. The book has at the very beginning 2 poems about death. There is a flashback scene in the film that is perhaps the most powerful scene because it is such a revelation. Even Dumbledore speaks some wisdom but he shows a slight dark side as well (It's remarkable how similar he is to Gandalf in 'Lord of the Rings'). At first, after Richard Harris died, I was sceptical of Michael Gambon as Dumbledore but over the series, he fit into the role, allowing me to take Dumbledore more seriously.<br/><br/>Furthermore, some of the side characters had really prominent parts in this final film. McGonagal, Molly Weasley, The Malfoys and especially Snape and Nevelle. Hagrid not so much. Nevelle has changed so much over the franchise, physically as well as characteristically. He is very heroic and gives a cliché yet well-spoken speech in front of everyone in the film. Snape also plays a completely different character to the one we know. Alan Rickman plays him perfectly in my opinion. I love the way he puts emphasis into every word he speaks.<br/><br/>The film is also pretty action packed throughout and gets started immediately, even before the title shows. I like the sneaking behind enemy lines aspect in the films. My friend was disappointed that the centaurs were not featured in this one. However, I was pleased that the duel was beefed out for the crescendo rather than just the simple connection of wands that we had already seen in 'Goblet of Fire'. There was even some cheeky slapping going on! The showdown was all the more satisfying that Voldemort was clearly peeved off. You can tell things are gonna kick-off.<br/><br/>On the other hand, there didn't seem to be much 3D effects. The latest 3D shows best when there are tiny things floating around in the scene, such as ash. It's up to you whether or not to watch it in 3D. I guess it is the last chance to.<br/><br/>Another thing I like about 'Harry Potter' is that it is British. There are so many American films (don't get me wrong, most of them are great!) but it's nice to have one that makes use of our landmarks and employs a fantastic British cast and crew, thus helping the country's reputation.<br/><br/>I think what made 'Harry Potter' more enjoyable, for me, was that I grew up with the characters. I could equate with their teenage angst and relationships and schooling. I can't say the same for what it feels like to lose parents and be hunted by psychopaths at a young age though, thank God! The narrative has always conveyed good morals and a fierce battle between good and evil. For all that Harry has suffered, he remains not to be a vengeful character. This film, just like most of the others, is a perfect blend of action, wit, romance, horror and fantasy, enough to give a lasting emotional enjoyment that films are meant to provoke. Even if this film wasn't that good, It would still be watched in order to complete the story.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling has created such a fascinating wizarding world which I'm sure leaves a possibility for developing more wonderful stories, despite this story being called, 'Harry Potter'. It certainly makes a refreshing change to the countless films containing guns. I don't think a new story can be as great as 'Harry Potter' but I'm up for it regardless."

"mgrroh001","Null","0","0","16 August 2011"," Harry Potter saga concludes on a spectacular note!
","We have finally arrived at the end of the best fantasy series of our time: Harry Potter. Uhm...that distant bustle you are hearing are millions of Potter fanatics still rushing to their local cinemas to watch/re-watch the last installment of the HP movies. And their eagerness will be rewarded because this film does not disappoint! There is just one word to describe Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2: Wow! And if you're going to see it in IMAX 3D: double wow! This may be the last film in the series but the producers have made sure that nobody will forget it easily.<br/><br/>In this movie, Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their mission on hunting down and destroying the last remaining Horcruxes of Lord Voldemort. Their quest takes them to the wizard bank, Gringrotts, and back to Hogwarts where they face the final battle against Voldemort and his Death Eaters. Along the way they encounter, in true fantasy style, various dangerous characters and creatures from the mythology.<br/><br/>Apart from religious controversies, the Harry Potter series has never really attracted negative reactions. Film critics and audiences alike were fanatical about the bespectacled wizard and his adventures at Hogwarts. The only complaint about the movies was that they were prone to neglect certain elements of the books.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows: Part 2, together with its predecessor Part 1, is the only film that does justice to the books on which it is based. Every element that has made the books so enchanting is present in Part 2. Be warned though: this movie is far from the charming children's movie, The Sorcerer's Stone we came to love back in 2001. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is more dark, intense and violent than the previous movies in the series.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows: Part 2 reminds us what the word ""action packed"" actually means. The tension runs high long before you have consumed half of your popcorn. This movie definitely has lots of stamina – in fact, Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a mad roller-coaster ride full of colorful sparks, falling bodies, and flying debris. One hardly gets a chance to breath.<br/><br/>Don't think, however, that this movie is merely a visual extravaganza. Deathly Hallows Part 2 maintains a good balance between character development and the best computer effects since Avatar. The producers clearly had one goal when shooting this movie: to have the viewer's adrenaline glands pumping for more than two hours. And they have achieved it without a doubt. Deathly Hallows Part 2 makes the recent fantasy movie (and competitor), Chronicles of Narnia: Voyage of the Dawn Treader, seem like an innocent tea party.<br/><br/>Speaking of competition: The Harry Potter movies have always been put side by side with the Lord of the Rings trilogy. This time around a comparison between these two movies is also inevitable. Deathly Hallows Part 2 at times feels just like Peter Jackson's Return of the King. Giant spiders? Check. Dragons? Check. An epic battle at the end? Check. The dramatic downfall of the Dark Lord? Check, check, check. It is as though Jackson donated a few leftover scenes from his movie to the team of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Do not disregard the word ""Deathly"" in the movie's title; fans of the books will know that there are lots more deaths in this movie, which bring about some poignant moments. And those who haven't read the last book by now can brace themselves for a shocking discovery at the film's climax.<br/><br/>After seven successful movies, the words ""I would recommend this"" will be futile in a Harry Potter review; the films have really established themselves as a must-see franchise over the years. The lead actors will surely not win an Oscar for their performances, but hey...who are we fooling? We don't go to see a HP movie for the acting, but for the amazing special effects and the beautiful young actors on offer! All I can conclude with is: TAKE EIGHT BLOODY WELL DESERVED STARS HARRY POTTER!!!!"

","Harry Potter, the boy who lived! Every child will know, and remember that name. The worldwide phenomenon has, I regret to say, indeed finished. How did it end? Magnificently. The idea of splitting the seventh part of the book was a brilliant economic trick (prolonging the flow of money given by the franchise). The first part gave a slow-paced introduction to the grand finale of the second movie. But, not without it's negative aspects. The tension that builds up to the end of the first part and continues from the very beginning of the second part dies somewhere at the middle of the second movie! It lasts for two hours, and somewhere at the end of the first hour the movie starts to slow down to a rate that is just not adequate to the first half. With a lot of tension and suspense, the movie does quite a bad job holding on to it. I must say that this is the very best HP screen adaptation in the franchise, but I just couldn't shake the feeling that it was just 5-10 brilliant sequences (e.c. the death of Snape) combined with not so great connection sequences (e.c. the constant interruption of battle with monologues). Also, the movie lacks characters! I had a feeling that Ron and Hermione had a lot less screen time than Nagini. Characters like prof. McGonagall, Hagrid, prof. Slughorn... had an embarrassingly small amount of screen time. Yes, the idea of the movie is the battle between Harry and Voldmort (who is the best-played character in the film) but that does not give the right to literally push out everyone else out of the picture. Do not be misled by these small complaints, the movie is brilliant. The most positive aspect of the movie are emotions! The death of Snape and the talk Harry has with his deceased friends and family is just heart-breaking and made the whole theater cry (myself included). Death is the main theme of this film from the very beginning, and the dark tone in the music and environment fits perfectly with it (sometimes I wondered if this is a film for children). Harry Potter gave us quite a ride through the years, and it ended just as it had started: magically! 8/10"

","This is the last film of the worldwide franchise. If they had to make the film in a way like this, then one film was better than making two films. David Heyman is an amazing producer but David Yates a completely fowl director. He ruined the fifth sixth and seventh film and so he did with the eight film. He cut of everything. The beginning was very good, but the battle was quiet miserable. Most of the things was shown in the trailer , what happened in the battle and there was too much Harry in the film. Ron and Hermione even didn't appear much and the stupid David Yates deleted many things from the memory of Snape. The dead scene of Fred was also omitted. Ariana's story gone!!! Duel of Hermione, Ginny and Luna with Bellatrix gone. And the battle of Harry & Voldemort though they made it a bit longer it was still disappointing. There was no one to see and and thus what is the proof that Voldy is dead???? The film was good and enjoyable but I think a lot more could be expected from this film."
"sniffle_wiffle","8","0","0","13 August 2011"," A satisfying end to a mixed series.
","At long last the end is here. After 10 years and billions at the box office, the final Harry Potter film arrives with a big bang and wallop, followed by sighs of relief from the filmmakers, and big groans from Warner Bros (will they ever find another franchise that makes this much money?). I personally have never truly loved the Harry Potter films. I mean I like them, they are entertaining flicks no doubt about that, but they haven't held the special place in my heart that the sublime ""The Lord of the Rings"" and the original ""Star Wars"" trilogy have done. However upon seeing this film, I have to say I was genuinely impressed. ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" raises the quality level of the Harry Potter films to an all new high, and truly finishes off the series in a very good way. Maybe not perfect but certainly good.<br/><br/>Splitting the book into two films, disservices part 1 which was a muddled and directionless fare, but benefits part 2 hugely, which has all the boring stuff out the way and is just a gripping and exciting film all the way through. They couldn't have picked a better place to split, just after Voldemort claims the Elder Wand and right before the Gringott's bank raid. The Gringott's sequence gives the film an exciting opening, which involves a room that contains items that multiply endlessly, and a hair-raising escape on a dragon. About 80% of the film takes place at the battle of Hogwarts, and this is certainly not a bad thing. The sense of doom before the battle, where the soldiers (who are mostly kids!) get ready to fight is unnerving. One of the films highlights is the teachers creating a defensive force field around the school, which is somehow both serene and beautiful. However unlike Peter Jackson's LOTR, which focused greatly on the epic battle scenes, the focus on this film is very much on Harry and not the battles, which is slightly disappointing for those who want to see some serious on screen carnage. When the two armies charge at each other going, ""ahhhhh!!"", I braced myself for some epic fighting, but then it cuts to Harry in a quiet room looking for the next Horcrux, which I found to be disconnecting from what's going on. When Harry finally does join the battle, it is mostly from his perspective, and we don't really get the sense of scale for the whole thing.<br/><br/>Does it improve on the book? I think mostly yes. To be honest I found Rowling's last 3 books disappointing, with 5 being depressing, 6 being boring, and 7 being a bit anti-climatic. However the film does correct a lot of what I didn't like in the book, which mostly concerns the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. In the book all they did was point wands at each other and talk for ages, whereas in the film it has been transformed into a grueling slug match that rages throughout the castle, exactly how I wanted it in the book. It is a credit to screenwriter Steve Kloves who has the balls to create these changes and make them work. Also I felt improved was Snape's memories, which reveals many of the story's secrets, and delivered it on such an emotional high, I don't think there was a dry eye in the cinema, including me. However the film does some things the same as the book, such as killing off side characters with no proper send off, Lupin and Tonks's death immediately springs to mind.<br/><br/>As the two leads Daniel Radcliffe (Harry) and Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) are both exceptional. Being the series' two main characters can't be easy, but both carry the weight of the whole saga well, and we truly get the scale of the epic struggle between them. Radcliffe has been very iffy on the acting front, but here he really comes into his own. He crafts a brave and iron willed young hero, who no longer shies from his immense task but now takes it head on. I wasn't overly impressed with Fiennes' performance as Voldemort in the previous films, I thought he over-acted it and didn't really come across as intimidating. However in this film both Fiennes and director David Yates have created something truly dark and terrible. One scene which is guaranteed to stay with you long after the film, is in Voldemort's first appearance where he casually walks barefooted over a room filled with dead bodies he has just murdered. The floor is soaked in blood and he speaks in a creepy language to his pet snake. It is a very short scene but is highly disturbing (especially for a fantasy family film), and you truly feel that this is one guy you don't want to mess with. Voldemort is also portrayed in a surprisingly tragic light, as each Horcrux is destroyed it cuts back to Voldemort who looks heartbroken and nearly in tears. It is Ralph Fiennes incredible talent that makes us feel sympathy for such a horrific monster. I will also give a special mention to Alan Rickman as Snape, whose story arc is the most interesting in the whole series, and his performance in Snape's flashback is Oscar worthy alone.<br/><br/>""Deathly Hallows part 2"" is my personal favorite of the HP films, and delivers a satisfying if flawed end. While faltering slightly in the battle scenes, the movie does deliver on the emotional front, with Snape's memories and Harry's walk to his doom being guaranteed tear jerkers. Another 20 minutes could have possibly made this a masterpiece, but I'm sure everyone on board the production just wanted the marathon over with, and my god what a marathon it has been. You have to be brainless to not be in awe that everyone stuck with it to the end. It will surely go down as one of the greatest movie feats of all time."

In fact, I can sum up Pts 1 and 2 in about three words: dull, lifeless and flat! The movie was too slow, and it needed speed or something because for most of it, it felt like you were slogging through muddied molasses. I'll admit that it was interesting to see the trio as adults, but could the finale get any more awkward? And Voldemort's death? Oh please, about as anti-climatic as you can get. He just seemed to turn into ashes and float away! I'm sorry to say this but the last two movies were as Razzie as you can get. Overall, the two parts may have grossed over several billion, but in my book, it wasn't worth the twelve bucks to go see them; viewers should have paid less than half that. At least I - and many others - won't be tortured anymore by any more chopped up crap. If like me, you love the Potter series, for God's sake, stick to the books, they last longer!"
"terrellrobinson71","10","0","0","12 August 2011"," The Perfect Finale to a Remarkable Series
","I have been a Harry Potter fan for a long time, so I really surprised to find out that the final Harry Potter film ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is the best of the eight films since the first four films. In ""Order of the Phoenix"", I thought that David Yates was making the story a bit dull, but it was still a good adaptation. In ""Half-Blood Prince"", Yates made the story better and leaner and funnier than ever and he became a rather ordinary to an extraordinary filmmaker. In the first half of the ""Deathly Hallows"", he succeeded again only to bring in a lot of the rising danger that our three heroes had to face and he did that with the help of composer Alexandre Desplat. Now in ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Yates has become a full-fledged director who knows how to pull all the right stops and he, like screenplay writer Steve Kloves (who didn't adapt the 5th book in J.K. Rowling's series), manages to stay true to Rowling's books by bringing us to the edges of darkness. In the end of ""Deathly Hallows Part 1"" Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) possessed the Elder Wand from the dead Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and in the beginning of ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"", Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) has finally reached the breaking points in their friendship. They are still in search of the Horcruxes (fragments of Voldemort's soul) and it is bringing them back to the place when they were taught how to do magic: Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. It's now owned by the Death Eaters and Professor Snape (Alan Rickman), the magic has crumbled and the dementors are keeping a lookout for the trio. A lot of our favorite characters are back and some get some huge screen time including Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis, even stronger than ""Order of the Phoenix"") and Professor McGonagall (the ferocious Maggie Smith). The Battle of Hogwarts itself is very shocking and very scary. Lives are lost, one has to make a sacrifice and there are a few people who are willing to survive and to live another day. I am seriously not spoiling anything here. But we do get to know the back story of Snape and the long-awaited battle of Voldemort and Harry. Yes, there are also a few fan moments that we have expecting to see, especially a battle between Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters) and Bellatrix (Helena Bonham Carter) and the incredibly emotional finale set 19 years later. (I won't explain the rest). At 2 hours and 10 minutes, ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" is the shortest of the series and it manages to still stay true to the second half of the book. It is devastating, funny, sharply written and brilliant at its very best. I'll give you a warning though for those entering in: It's extremely violent for a PG-13 and then again, it's perfectly safe. I loved the books and I've admired the films for over 10 years now and it's great to see how Radcliffe, Grint and Watson grown from young up-and-coming actors to real grown-up actors now. It's very remarkable. P.S: I went to go see it in 2D instead of 3D, but then again, it's your choice. This is, not only the best of the series or the best summer film of the year, but it is the best film I've seen in 2011. Period. It's the best finale yet and, yes, I am comparing them to the finales of ""The Lord of the Rings"" and ""Star Wars"". They were epic in every way and now this one is an epic that stays on its own. I advise you see it, for Harry Potter fans only."

","Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell & David Yates, what do you know about these individuals or names? These ladies and gentleman are the directors involved in the greatest & the most successful movie franchise of our times and I am guessing for a long time Harry Potter will remain undefeated and on top.<br/><br/>10 years, 8 movies and $6,369,345,142 at the worldwide box office and Harry Potters journey comes to an end. I need not emphasize any more the box office records set by the last installation in the franchise is off the record books and there is no better way for a curtain call. Falling just short of AVATAR and TITANIC, HP DEATHLY HALLOWS P2 is firm at 3rd place at the highest ever grossing films of all time. 10 years and I feel a very strong connection with the franchise and I am proud to say that I have been and that I will always be one of those die-hard HP fans. THIS IS IT! (Sniff, Sniff )<br/><br/>Leavesden studios 2001; this was the year that the set (studio stage) for Hogwarts (The school for witchcraft and wizardry) was done. It has been standing there for a decade and finally she is being destroyed and it's hard to watch the great hall of Hogwarts in ruins and once bright and exuberant school now all dark and gloomy. Since Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) got his hand on the Elder Wand (The most powerful Wand in the world) which belonged to the great Professor Albus Dumbledore (Micheal Gambon) the dark lord has been growing in his powers and has an army of his own now and is spreading the dark over Hogwarts. Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermoine (Emma Watson) needs to find a way to defeat and destroy the dark lord. The answer lies in destroying the remaining of LVs' horcruxes. This is where HP DEATHLY HALLOWS P2 takes off. The search begins and you will be shocked at how it all ends! Without the risk of spoilers I think it would be safe for me to say that the movie does not pick up for about 20 minutes up until Harry, Ron and Hermoine are saved by Aberforth Dumbledore (Ciaran Hinds) and then reunited with Neville (Matthew Lewis) who leads them into Hogwarts through a secret passage way that was nonexistent until that instant. Harry confronts Professor Snape (Alan Rickman) who is now the headmaster of Hogwarts. Harry and his friends stand up to him. It's at this point Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) steps in duels the headmaster and drives him away and reclaims control of Hogwarts. From this point on its war! HARRY POTTER is all that stands between Hogwarts and his non-nose nemesis Lord Voldermort.<br/><br/>This by far has the highest body count in the franchise and from the word go it's all about death, and its mind blowing. (Harry Potter haters will thoroughly disagree!) Seems like Director David Yates who is in his 4th addition to the franchise takes it up a notch, the whole movie is darker, and gloomier and also surprisingly it's focused on a mature audience as well I would say. With this I need to agree, despite how Rowling intended the books to turn out, commercial interest has for sure played its part. The movie that was once for purely a younger audience has evolved from a children's start to X-MEN Last Stand/ Lord of the Rings wrap up. Consider the posters of the 8 movies and you agree. They get more mature and darker through franchise; this being said it justifies HP is for all ages. Does this give you goose bumps and does it make feel sad despite all the war? Yes there is intense emotion that Harry and his friends go through and those of you who have grown to love them will have a share of your tears, that being said ( yet again) it justifies that it not just war there is emotion and it's well balanced in that aspect too. Pretty good huh?<br/><br/>At the risk of the cliché, Last but not least, let's talk awards! Shall we? Lord of the Rings wrapped up 11 at the academy awards a few years ago, I am having a great feeling that HP would be getting quite a few nods at the 2012 awards. Will it top Lord of the Rings; I have no idea, let's wait and see.<br/><br/>I am sensing that this whole finale must be much harder on the cast that grew up with the movie and who practically grew up on the studios of HP. Not forgetting the crew who put countless number of hours into the making of it. Imagine this, 250 days of shooting it took to put all of Deathly Hallows together! That's 250 days of hard work for them and 5 hours of entertainment for us.<br/><br/>Cast and Crew and writer of Harry Potter ""Stand Up .

"Meven_Stoffat","10","0","0","10 August 2011"," I needed time to digest this movie's awesomeness before I could write a review... and now that I have...
","...I can safely say this is the movie of the year.<br/><br/>As a die-hard Potter fan, the midnight screening of this film will forever go down as the greatest experience I've had at the cinema. Just being in the cinema with people just like me, who lived through their childhoods with these amazing characters, who became our friends we wish existed... A truly phenomenal experience. I had never felt such a sense of togetherness in my life. So to join these diehards in staying up till the very beginning of Friday, July 16th to witness this finale... I must say that experience changed my life.<br/><br/>And I do not exaggerate when I call this film the best movie of 2011. Believe me, this film has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, drama, emotional connectivity, amazing performances. <br/><br/>Understandably this is the shortest of all the Potter flicks- the previous movie covered 75% of the book, and so this film covers 25%... Which is a good thing because it shows Yates put effort into making this movie a big, grand finale. The movie moves at a fast pace, and boy, is that a good thing. One would worry that it would come off as rushed, but believe me, Yates did a hell of a job here. Sure some things were left out and/or changed, but obviously for pacing purposes. I am aware of the changes, but honestly, as a fan of the book, I'm glad they were made.<br/><br/>The acting is what helps make this movie amazing. You could tell the actors were in a ""alright, it's the last movie, let's live it up more than we can"" mood. Everyone hams it up beautifully. The full power of the actors' performances is used. In my opinion, Matthew Lewis was the highlight of the movie! He always was the highlight of the other films, and this movie is no exception. He manages to ham it up as Neville Longbottom, and here he is in full badass mode. <br/><br/>Really, I am still speechless as to how awesome this movie was. I mean, I knew it was going to be one emotional experience, and thank god it turned out to be that. As the movie's ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional. I did not want to say goodbye to the phenomenon that helped shape my childhood. And you could feel that emotion running through the cinema, when John Williams' score rang through the speakers.<br/><br/>In short, Deathly Hallows 2 is phenomenal, the best of the series, and the best film of 2011. Rarely have I connected with a movie as emotionally as I did with DH2, and that said, this was the right way for me to say goodbye to my childhood properly.<br/><br/>OVERALL: 10/10<br/><br/>Pros: DH2 is the perfect balance of crowd pleasing and fan service, allowing everyone to have a blast. It is a stellar finale that demands to be watched, you have no choice!<br/><br/>Cons: ........uuuuuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh....."

","It seems these days, that we have come to we live in a world of cynicism and low expectations, punctuated by mediocrity and ignorance, a world whose only highlights are a mindless pursuit of fame and notoriety. In this seemingly bottomless void, stepped JK Rowling and Harry Potter, with and old-fashioned tale of loyalty, friendship, courage, self-sacrifice, love, care and the understanding that sometimes there are undertakings and noble pursuits greater than ourselves, actions worthy of a common goal, whose end result will benefit a cause worthier than our immediate selfish wants, namely the greater good (which is a recurring theme in the books and the movies). No matter what one might think about the whole Harry Potter phenomenon, one cannot deny the impressive and positive impact upon the world.<br/><br/>I did not start out as a Harry Potter fan, my own life being too busy and hectic to allow me paying attention to what I saw as a fanciful children's tale. For the turnaround I credit, as strange as it might seem, Alfonso Cuaron. I was a fan of his previous movies, and I was drawn and curious by the fact that he should choose to work on the Harry Potter franchise. After I saw ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" everything changed. I was lucky enough to discover the world of Harry Potter through this master movie-maker's lens, and what a wonderful introduction it was! Subsequently I watched all the movies and became more and more impressed.<br/><br/>You have to understand that I saw the movies first long before reading any of the novels. In time however, after all the books had been published I went back and saw each movie and read the corresponding novel. In hindsight I think, I was lucky to do it that way, since I had no pre-conceived notions or expectations.<br/><br/>Now that I have seen the last movie and read the last novel, I can see it all stretch before my mind's eye, the wonderful complexity, the imagination, originality and great sense of wonder these works, both books and movies, contain and impart on all its fans, both readers and viewers.<br/><br/>No, the movies are not perfect, far from it, they are at times quite uneven in vision, style, understanding of the material, but overall I think that they retained the essence and spirit of the books, and gave a wonderful visual rendition of Rowling's work. My favourites remain to this day ""The Prisoner of Azkaban"" and ""The Goblet Of Fire"".<br/><br/>Alas, my thanks and appreciation go to JK Rowling whose brilliant mind gave us this gift, and to Chris Columbus, Alfonso Cuaron, Mike Newell, David Yates, as well as Steven Klovis and David Heyman, the group of people who worked tirelessly in bringing to life, on the big screen, the universe of Harry Potter and his friends. I would be remiss not to also say a big thank you to Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint as well as the rest of the cast and crew of these movies who literally inhabited these characters and their world, and created such a believable and authentic version of them before our very eyes. Whatever they may choose to do with their lives, and whatever their lives might become, I wish all these people nothing but the best and good luck always. A nod also to Warner Bros. for their support and commitment to this whole project.<br/><br/>It was a wonderful adventure and I'm privileged to have been part of it in my small way! <br/><br/>""Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows Part 1+2"" 8 out 10 / ""Harry Potter""-the entire movie franchise 10 out of 10"
"pravinconcerns","Null","0","0","10 August 2011"," Excellent movie
","I am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, they're all so great and magical. But I didn't think the film series were perfect at all, but they were still great movies. With that, I was extremely excited to see the end of the film franchise, and impressed with the trailers. So I had high expectations. And thankfully it did not disappoint, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II, blew past my already high expectations and I was enthralled! The whole movie looked spectacular! The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy! The set designers, cinematographers really need to be awarded for their work, because it looks like they spend of time and money on the look of the film.<br/><br/>The cast of the film was pretty much perfect, they should all be applauded too. Emma Watson, as usual is and great and she'll have a bright career ahead of her. Rupert Grint is pretty much great also, he is a fine actor indeed. Daniel Radcliffe did an amazing job and was very memorable as Harry Potter. Although I think Ralph Fiennes was the star of the film, he did unbelievable job as the evil, crazy Lord Voldemort, I think he deserves an Oscar Nomination for his role. The rest of the cast were also great too.<br/><br/>We all grew up overtime with the series, we followed the adventures of Harry Potter for around 10 years, I think. It seems very weird that there will be no more Harry Potter films to look forward too. I will miss the franchise very much! However I am happy the series got an amazing ending. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is not only the best film in the series, but it will probably be one of the best films of 2011. Everyone should see this film, even if they don't like past Harry Potter films."
"LazySod","7","0","0","8 August 2011"," And so the circle closes
","As an eight part in the series there's not a single reason to explain the story or its characters, they've been defined. And so this film starts running, and doesn't really pause until the very end of it. As a book translation I guess it doesn't do too bad of a job - most events of importance get a glimmer of screen time. I have no idea how it works on people that haven't read the books though.<br/><br/>As a film it's dark, literally. Too dark to my liking, it's a good thing to express the dark and grim feeling of the book, it's overkill to make the film look like everything was shot between dusk and dawn. This effect was even worse in 3D - which again turned out to be a dud.<br/><br/>Overall the film felt rushed - as if the maker was done with it, glad to have the series end. As part of the audience I now feel the same - it was a good series to watch through the years but I am happy it is done now.<br/><br/>Adding that all together makes it the worst part in the series to me, fitting but not fitting, pleasing and not pleasing.<br/><br/>6 out of 10 last rites"
"Rajesh-Narayanan01","7","0","0","8 August 2011"," Movie should have been longer and in 2D
","Plot: The film hinges on the final battle between death eaters and other wizards. Hogwarts is the center of all action. Death and destruction is no longer discussed in background. You literally see the beautiful castle, Hogsmeade and Gringotts being ripped apart and people die. Let me stop with that.<br/><br/>Special Effects: The film has been shot in 3D and, as with its prequels, the final episode boots really good CGI. Apparations, flying broomsticks, dragons, giants, slithering snakes, magic - everything is thrown at the audience in the two hour running time of the movie. And its all so beautifully interwoven that you end up applauding their physics rather than cringe thinking about their improbability.<br/><br/>Cast: The main stars need no introduction. I guess this series was blessed, for they managed to complete production of eight movies with almost the same cast as they began. So in order to review the casting I need to go back in time - I guess it is unnecessary. I do not think we are going to get a more fitting description of Harry or Ron or Hermione. The only gripe is that we get to see less of some favorite characters (like Hagrid for example).<br/><br/>Performance: The lead characters have done good. Not just in this movie but the entire series. Kudos to the kids who dared to spend the most crucial years of their lives to entertain us (yeah they definitely got a handsome pay in return) and have been keen to learn from day one to get their acting skills honed. Of the others I would always rate Alan Rickman's portrayal of the complex character of Snape as a cut above the rest - it was like a character written in the book come alive. Evanna Lynch also cast her character (of Luna Lovegood) with charm. Helena Bonham Carter will forever be remembered as the sneering Bellatrix Lestrange.<br/><br/>Read the full review at http://blog.nrajesh.com/review-deathly-hallows-2"
"System72","10","0","0","7 August 2011"," A Brilliant End to a Magical Saga
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is an action-packed, fast paced piece of cinema that wraps up the 10 year film series. It has already shown itself to be hugely successful in terms of profit at the box office and no doubt fans of the series (myself being one of the millions) will find it a great companion to the novel.<br/><br/>The quest to find Lord Voldemort's horcruxes comes to a thrilling conclusion as the Battle of Hogwarts becomes the dominant aspect of the film, a nice and welcome change from the hour and a half long camping trip of Part 1. Part 1 managed to get all the backstory and build up mostly out of the way so we can focus on the explosions and epic wand fights. The visuals are definitely one of the selling points for the movie - Hogwarts castle continuously falling apart throughout the movie, the force field to defend the castle and the countless fight scenes being some of the few highlights. It's quite a CGI heavy piece and I can say I'm thankful for that, because it looks beautiful. The cinematography was incredible - some of the castle shots were great, not to mention the entire Prince's Tale sequence.<br/><br/>There were some great touches that I thought would be left out, such as the onrush of the giant spiders (although I would have liked to see them swarm Hagrid like in the book). I think the thing that bugged me the most was the fate of the Elder Wand and Harry's wand. In the book it was a great sense of closure - the last plot twist before the ending. I can't help but think that the addition of the scene wouldn't have required too much, but what's done is done and we can't do anything about it. Another thing I thought I'd bring up is the final battle between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort. I loved that scene in the novel in the Great Hall with everybody watching and Harry explaining everything to Tom Riddle. I was pretty disappointed that this sections as cut out, but I can see the reasoning behind it. Personally, I think it would have been a little cliché and a tad cheesy. But at the same time, we've had this huge dramatic build up to the ending and it comes off as a bit of an anti-climax. Voldemort is defeated and then next scene is Harry among his friends. We didn't see the reaction of anybody else of the news of Voldemort's defeat. Also, Fred's death - did it even happen? I saw a Weasley twin huddled on the ground being disarmed by a Death Eater during a montage. When I saw that, I thought to myself ""Wait, was that it?"" So that was the gripes paragraph.<br/><br/>Over the last ten years we've seen Dan, Rupert and Emma grow before our eyes and their acting ability has improved tremendously over that time. The acting of the supporting cast is phenomenal, Harry's 'death' particularly comes to mind, although I would have liked to see Hagrid get a bit more screen time. But, it's fair to say that Alan Rickman stole the show during 'The Price's Tale' sequence, bringing out that emotional depth to Severus Snape that the novel portrayed so well. I can't put into words how fantastic that sequence was, when it could have been rushed over like 'Snape's Worst Memory' in Order of the Phoenix, which happened in about 30 seconds with really no idea of what was going on. The cold, hateful character of Snape portrayed brilliantly in the last 7 films really gets the closure his character deserves, and Yates should be congratulated for the sequence.<br/><br/>There's not much to say on the soundtrack other than it's hauntingly beautiful. The 'Leaving Hogwarts' track during the epilogue was a great bit of fan-service, the one scene fans have been fantasizing about since the book was released. Hedwig's Theme playing when Harry reappears at Hogwarts was so cheesy, but I found myself grinning all the same and I'm glad that it was included.<br/><br/>A lot of people have a problem with the epilogue in both the film and the novel, I being indifferent about it. It's a nice way to end the franchise, but I would have liked to see some negative effect on Harry from the events of his teenage years like waking up in a cold sweat like a Vietnam Veteran. But after this ordeal Harry has been through, it's great that he can finally have the life he deserved - the chance to be normal.<br/><br/>I've grown up with this series and I'm sad to see it finally end, but what a way to end it! The ticket from the midnight screening is now stuck on my bedroom wall. Harry Potter was a magical experience that I'm so glad I was a part of. I definitely recommend Deathly Hallows Part 2 to those yet to see it, and I recommend the series to anybody who is yet to discover it.<br/><br/>10/10"
"todd_4560","9","0","0","7 August 2011"," It was the end of the world and we were there to see how it went down....
","It is strangely fulfilling and so deeply disturbing how this is the last Harry Potter movie. It is a movie franchise that started off when I was a kid - as so many of its fans were - and it ends with me and the characters growing up. The troublesome trio of Harry, Ron and Hermione are back for one final act of their epic fight over the greatest evil the magic world has ever seen and he is stronger than ever as well. The twists, the turns, the magic, the spells, the bright flashes from wands, the suicidal spells, the walking stone warrior guys, the heart in the movie, the kids standing up for what is right all o this and so much more make this movie so believable and multiple-watch worthy.<br/><br/>The performances by Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are as good, if not better, than ever. They have indeed pumped in all their best chunks of acting they have learnt through out these years on the sets of their historical rise to super-stardom. Matthew Lewis (Neville)finally gets some bid screen time and does brilliantly well as the leader of the Hogwarts student camp at Hogwarts when Harry is not around and he knows how to look good and stupid with a sword. Alan Rickman (Snape) churns out another perfect performance as he has been doing for so long. That man deserves a hell of a lot of praise for the aura in which he portrays his character. He is actually one of the major cast members and equal to the prime trio in y honest opinion. Ralph Fiennes is back as Voldemort and as McGonagall says it ""Its time to call him by his name and not you know who"". We finally get to see a real dark side from The Dark Lord which we have only seen glimpses of in so many previous films. A hero is worthy only when he has a worthy adversary and it doesn't get worthier than him. Last but not least the final cast member who has been missing for so long, Hogwarts Castle, how we missed you. The castle in all its glorious grandeur and appetite for destruction comes back with a bang and after all the battling is done the castle never looked more grand than it did at that moment. <br/><br/>I personally hope that Steve Kloves gets an Oscar nod for his spectacular script work. He puts in every bit of imagination in his head and all that the fans think is possible to see in the world of magic. There is not a boring moment throughout the entire movie and most of it can be credited to his air-tight writing. David Yates finally brings out the flashes from wands and spells and magic that all of us might have missed for sometime now. His well directed stories finally have a lot of action infused in the final one of them and the results are there for everyone to see.<br/><br/>For a few corny dialogues, the cast, the brilliant characters, the writing, the direction and almost any other positive you can think of when you see a great movie and also the stubble on Harry's face which does reflect a true warrior who is facing the greatest test of this time I give it a 9/10."

","So I watched the mega blockbuster finale to the Harry ""the nerd sorcerer"" Potter saga ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" from 2011. So was this movie good, I say abracadabra bitch, or yes in muggle speak. I have seen every Harry Potter movie and enjoyed them all. I especially like how the movies (and I guess the books to) have matured with each passing film. They also went from somewhat structured like in the sorcerers stone to less predictable and original as time has passed. I saw this last one in IMAX 3D, I personally found the 3D to not be mind blowing, which I think is common among films not shot in 3D. So if I was you I would save the cash and see this in regular boring ole' 2D. So this movie just like the others is a little dark, has fascinating characters, a mystery to be solved and mysteries to be revealed. This movie delivers these Harry standards in spades. This movie was enjoyable except for the final scene for me. I won't spoil it but it is taken from the final books epilogue. It seemed tacked on and kind of pointless. I personally think much like star wars we have not seen the last Harry Potter film. I see the next one coming in about 10 years after the next Harry book by Rowling comes out called ""Harry Potter and the quest to find something else to write that failed and the search for more money."" I think the next one should be R with a little graphic interracial (muggle on wizard) hardcore action. So this movie is a worthy ending to the series, it answers all the questions, has a wide demographic base from young to old from magic nerd to jock. So go enjoy and be nerdy for a couple of hours, but just don't start here these movies for the most part should be watched in order. if you like concise reviews of interesting films please read my other reviews at http://raouldukeatthemovies.blogspot.com/"

","It all ended today, normally I am not a nostalgic type, but Harry Potter series have accompanying me through my entire 20s, which I am not certain whether is my brightest decade or not, nevertheless it represents the end of an era!<br/><br/>Compared with Part One, apart from a couple of minutes in the beginning, Part Two is sheer an awe-inspiring expedition, 120 minutes without any chance to slow down the pace until the final one-to-one duel between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The Potter-trio dominates the whole film throughout, which inevitably leaves no enough room for other wizards showcasing their heroic stunts (for example, Remus Lupin even died without any segmental flashback of what actually happened, merely serves as an augment to the number of the casualty), Neville Longbottom is the only exception (due to my ignorance of the original books, it came across as quite a surprise), all other students and professors are sympathetic cameos, all of which symbols a way of contrived reunion and also a farewell to the aficionados for their years-long faithfulness. <br/><br/>The interconnection inside the trio is dealt with less dexterity in order to accomplish the apocalyptic denouement, nevertheless when Ron and Hermione pair finally come out of their puppy love closet, it feel so overdue and gratified, and the gallantry of the entire Hogworts is foreseeable but encouraging!<br/><br/>The 3D effect is much better this time (maybe I was sitting in a smaller screening room, the vividness is more tangible and the screen is brighter). Anyway, as the series finale, I can express my satisfaction to the film, what's more shall we expect from a children-book sensation? <br/><br/>Finally, I must give Alan Rickman some accolade and suggest a potential Oscar nomination might not be a pipe dream (maybe not for this film only, if the Academy intends to honor the whole series, it will has the best shot), Severus Snape is without any doubt the most charismatic character and Alan himself is the most underrated British actor since his debut in DIE HARD (1988). <br/><br/>ps. The 19 years later make-up is a sort of ridicule, how can we forget their youth just in a fleet of seconds after the long trek we have been through?"

","Throughout the series every movie had something missing. Of course every movie had parts that were cut because they simple didn't have time to show everything. All of that has always bugged me until this. This movie was everything the book couldn't be. While it did have to cut out parts that really were important, it said everything it had to say. It finished everything that had to be finished. This movie tied up all the loose ends and it did this with a flourish. The action was at the amazing pace that only that 8th instalment of a long series could provide (without disregarding the story). Still a two hour movie of just thrills would have been a bit too much and it certainly provided some breaks. Emotional scenes, like Neville coming full circle, showed that as much as the series was about magic none of us could wield, it was also about character that the best of us could aspire to. It was breathtaking. It was triumphant. It was to the fans, to the books, to Harry Potter and all the faithful at Hogwarts: Justice."

","The final entry into cinema's hugest phenomenon, HPATDH:P2 is also the best in the franchise. The action is unlike anything you've seen in the Potter universe before; the showdown at Hogwarts is worth the price of admission all on its own. The characters are all given suitably memorable moments in their last outing – Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall and Julie Walter's Molly Weasley are allowed to get their badass on, which is, quite simply, awesome – and there's a nice little epilogue that provides a fitting finale for the main trio at the centre of it all.

This last episode is a grand reunion of everybody who has appeared before, alive or now dead (in the story, I mean), from heavy-weights (both meanings) like Gary Oldman (Sirus Black from way back), John Hurt (recent addition Ollivander), Robbie Coltrane (always-there Hagrid) to a cameo, no-dialogue appearance of Harry's one-time love interest Cho Chang portrayed by Katie Leung. It is also with poignant pleasure to witness the last scene (not counting the prologue ""19 years later"") where the trio Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson stand hand-in-hand in front of the ruins that were Hogwarts.

What emotion turmoil must have been going through their mind in shooting this last scene together! Having gone through everything with them in a last decade, one really does not expect to have any earth-shattering experience in this last episode. It's rather sitting back to savour the last 2 hours with all these people we have come to know so well (too many to mention) in a somewhat mellowed frame of mind. The movie does deliver, and deserves a verdict of absolutely nothing less than ""completely satisfying"". There are some new things, such as more frequent use of complete silence, or subtle strings hovering at the edge of audio awareness, to create appropriate moods. On the other hand Snipe's real character should be predictable. After all the double-double-double crosses, what final stunning twist revelation can be made other than the one adopted? Also, this has been done before, over 3 decades ago, in the most classic of all classics in Sci-fi fantasy epics. You surely know which one I mean – to name it would constitute a spoiler.<br/><br/>Nothing more can be added to what has been said everywhere about Maggie Smith, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, and so many others that deserve to be mentioned. The summer of 2011 will always be remembered in the satisfying conclusion of an epic cinematic journey started a decade ago, growing up, regardless of your age, with the three little kids who seem to have become part of our lives."

","Firstly, do not go and watch this film expecting to see the pages of the book replicated word for word and scene by scene- if you do this you will inevitably be disappointed and therefore I am not going to compare the film to the book. I should also point out that I am a huge fan of the series and have grown up watching these films, and expected great things from the grand finale. Did it live up to these expectations? Are you sitting comfortably? Good, then I shall begin.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. There are so many throwbacks to earlier films that bring back a hint of the magic that brought the series to life all those years ago, and as a fan it is great to see many of those characters that disappeared into the shadows return for the final curtain, despite a handful of these being killed off. Speaking of the cast, they are (excuse the pun) spellbinding- especially Ralph Fiennes who keeps the malice and evil of Voldemort whilst letting some of that vulnerability play through as Harry and co hunt down the elusive horcruxes. I relished every scene Fiennes appeared in because you literally cannot help but be captivated by his performance. Daniel, Emma and Rupert have also come so far with their acting career and these last couple of films have let that talent shine through. A particular scene near the end comes to mind when the looks between the three of them say so much through so little. I give credit to all three of them. <br/><br/>The film is relentlessly packed with action, after the first 15-20mins (where the story is set-up for the following raid of Gringotts) it is pretty much non-stop and each moment was very enjoyable and exhilarating. The Battle of Hogwarts takes up a large percentage of the film, during which a particular character's secret back story is revealed (which was done very well I might add, but I won't give anything away for the sake of those that haven't read the book). <br/><br/>The climax does not disappoint and, going back on my word at the beginning, for those who do fall into that category of people who want an exact replication of the book- of course it leaves things out and the way things unfold changes slightly so it works for cinema and so the filmmakers could achieve that elusive 12A rating. <br/><br/>Moving onto the nitty gritty details of the film- visual effects are great but if, like me, you know what you're looking for the CGI stuff does stick out like a sore thumb, but for those who remain oblivious (sorry I had to get that pun in there!) it is seamlessly integrated with the live action.<br/><br/>The cinematography is amazing, showing Hogwarts in a much more dynamic manner than before- because in this film, the gloves are well and truly off for everyone. Alexandre Desplat's scores are just so good that words cannot describe them, I loved the whole feel he brought to the Harry Potter world with the music in Part 1, and he steps up to the mark again with Part 2. The direction from David Yates was again brilliant, getting those emotional moments just right and the action scenes adrenaline-pumping and awe-inspiring. Steve Kloves also deserves a mention for managing to squeeze all the important parts of the book into two films, whilst sacrificing that which was not necessary or practical for cinema.<br/><br/>I should probably stop talking about it now before I give anything away, but first we have the small matter of the negatives. To be quite honest, they aren't really very many; they could've given Julie Walters a few more lines just because she's so entertaining, but come on- this is the dramatic climax, we aren't here to have a laugh. But there are a few fantastic lines and funny moments from the likes of Maggie Smith, David Bradley, Rupert Grint and Matthew Lewis. Ralph Fiennes also discovers a sense of humour! The biggest negative however is that they bothered to convert the film into 3D. I watched it in 2D after reading a few reviews and opinions of some friends, and I can honestly say there are only a few shots that 3D would have been a benefit to- so save the extra money and stick to 2D. Who needs an extra dimension when 2 was perfectly fine for watching the rest of the series in? <br/><br/>The reason I gave it a 9/10 is because of that 3D issue, but in 2D it's a 10/10 from me. On that note, I'll end this review before I write another 3000 words and give away the whole plot. I hope this review has been helpful to you, enjoy the film should you decide to watch it. This film is the end of an era for British filmmaking, and the start of a new beginning for it's leading cast."
"JustLikeYouCritics","Null","0","0","3 August 2011"," The End
","This is an average film at best. A great disappointment to a Harry Potter fan who read the books and a ""take it or leave it film"" to those that didn't but watched the films. They could have done unbelievably better in time management about horocruxes and the battle scenes in general were not very intense. If this wasn't the last film, I would not go to see the next. The only good part was how the Deathly Hollows were portrayed. Radcliffe, Watson and Grint as always are perfect in their roles. It is unfortunate that the screenplay writer, Steve Kloves and director, David Yates had to adapt the books to film in such a way because the last film had great potential. Still worth watching only because it is the last film."
"Al_The_Strange","8","0","0","3 August 2011"," It (finally) ends!
","Ever since Harry Potter's introduction some ten years ago, I've always been eager to see how this finale would turn out (I am a big sucker for grand finales). After ten or so somber minutes of recapping the last film, this last hurrah starts off strong as the characters infiltrate a magical vault, before moving along to the ultimate Battle of Hogwarts. As far as finales go, I wouldn't dare rank the Hogwarts battle over my other favorite scenes. Even though it takes up over twenty minutes of screen time, something about the final battle didn't really strike me as exceptional; I suspect it's because the actual fighting is subdued to the background, with no real sense of progression, variety, or true peril. But after some sporadic bursts of fighting and mystery, the film finally gets into the final duel between Potter and Voldemort, which is pretty damn cool. There are also a number of other epic moments in the film that'll keep it lively, and will enthrall most die-hard fans. I felt there could have been a bigger punch, and there are just a few scenes that drag, but what we get is satisfying.<br/><br/>The story is ultimately tied together quite well, combing up all the elements, characters, and events of the last several films for some final revelations and a decent conclusion. Some scenes may not make sense to casual fans or those who are unfamiliar with the books. The characters are as strong as ever, and with an overt theme of duality, I have found most of it very intriguing.<br/><br/>The film shows fine photography and editing. Some scenes look made for 3D, but are never overly-gimmicky. Acting is as strong as ever, save for maybe one or two cheesy moments, but I was quite impressed with Emma Watson's mad ability to mirror Helen Bonham Carter so well! I have no complaints about the writing. Production value looks strong, with plenty of solid sets, props, costumes, and wonderful special effects. Music is pretty decent (and often echoes John Williams' original theme from the first couple of films).<br/><br/>Recommended, especially for fans of the series.<br/><br/>4/5 (entertainment: 4/5, story: 4.5/5, film: 4/5)"

","Well, actually i enjoyed every film of Harry Potter just for the reason of watching a dream come true, though i always say that it's difficult to surpass a book story. In this case, i think that to split the film into two parts was necessary because the amount of events developed. However, the first part was pretty disappointing according to the lack of dynamism. the story falls in ""stand by"" for a long time focusing on the relationship among Harry, Granger and Ron. I think that the result is a matter of get things done in the easiest way, so Yates avoid difficult scenes as well as combat situations with a high need of special effects and stunts. How come that Moody, one of the best Aurors, died without a clue of what happened? From my point of view, after Harry Potter and the Gobblet of Fire, the movie is going down in quality.<br/><br/>www.cubareviews.wordpress.com"

I don't think they could of done anything more than they did, unless they made the film longer to put in more of the book. obviously they cant put every detail from the book in the films but somethings i don't thing made sense because we didn't see them on camera like the polyjuice potion you never saw Hermione take it to turn into Belatrix. Little things like that i think would of made the audience love the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the film through out that is possible the only thing i thought was a little disappointing.

","I was never really a fan of Harry Potter and especially the movies. But I gotta admit this final installment was just awesome. It wasn't as epic as I thought it would be but it's still epic. The plot also has some very emotional twist and turns that will make some viewers cry a little while watching. The girl next to me couldn't stop weeping. The special effects are top notch and the acting is the best in this franchise. I never thought I would be sad to see this franchise finally end. But during the final scene it was sad...Well just slightly that it's the end. One big gripe I have is how some of the main characters gets killed off way too easily and some even off screen.

","This movie has literally completed my childhood. <br/><br/>Growing up reading the books and watching the movies allows me to be as critically cruel as I want when reviewing this film. And, baring in mind Deathly hallows is my favourite of the lot, I felt it met (and surpassed!) my every expectation.<br/><br/>The movie kick-starts into action and within the first 30 minutes chills were already crawling through my body. The film will have you laughing, sighing, crying and applauding from start to finish. The first thing I looked out for was how different it was going to be from the book - But there were hardly any changes! And ,to be fair, the ones that were made were actually even better than what I remember; they fitted perfectly with the fast pace of the movie. <br/><br/>David Yates creates this visually STUNNING masterpiece; the build up to the final fight (when they were casting spells to protect the castle)was phenomenal to watch and generally the cinematography was just perfect (especially in 3D).<br/><br/>The only flaw I found was that the movie was a little insensitive at certain scenes and I felt that David should have given just 5 more minutes to acknowledge some of the losses of the war. But other than that, this movie honestly will please all.

"EmmaDinkins","Null","0","0","2 August 2011"," Chix Chat on Film review: An epic end to the story of The Boy Who Lived.
","It seems hard to conceive that we have reached the end of an era, a decade long conflict of good versus evil, and during this time having witnessed the growth to adulthood of a generation of wizards. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) with his closest friends, Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and constant nemesis Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton) all met with their destiny head on, and the final battles were epic. The Harry Potter story is now completed, but there are so many other characters that could take us back to the wizarding world. I have mixed feelings about anyone attempting to recreate something as amazing as this series, since it most likely would not measure up. Even though some of the supporting characters did not have much depth as compared to the primary wizards it was still nice to see them in the final story, Neville (Matthew Lewis), Dean (Alfie Enoch), Seamus (Devon Murray), and the Weasleys, the whole red-headed lot of them. I have to mention that even though Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) is an evil b!tch, she was one of my favorite characters because of how richly animated she is portrayed. The visual effects in this film were phenomenal, I was aware that there was a dragon in the story, having seen it in the trailer, but I had never in my wildest imaginings ever considered what an emaciated dragon would or could look like. It was so life like in demeanor and mobility that it elicited sympathy from me. This film as those before it introduced some other mythical creatures, and revisited the Goblins, but I have to say this. I hate to divulge anything that may ruin a film for other viewers, but what I thought was missing were the Centaurs, they were there in the beginning, again in the middle so I thought it only fitting that they should have been there in the end. The absence of the Centaurs did not diminish the quality of this story in any way. This story as written by J.K. Rowling, the screenplay as developed by Steve Kloves, and the direction of David Yates have provided movie goers with an absolute gem. This movie is a perfect example of exceptional fantasy adventure film making. The Boy who lived has taken us on a magical journey that will never be forgotten. I would give this film a double green light if it could make it any clearer that this film is superb."

","The movie was overall: great. The direction, cinematography & the special effects were brilliantly executed. The acting was good too. Hogwarts and the way the directors and screen writers had shown it was brilliant! But there were many let downs; the style of Yate's directing is simply ""let's just get to the point."" There were a few good and bad things. I'll name just a few:<br/><br/>Good: Neville was really good. Liked him. Gringotts was well directed. The acting was at a great standard. The battles were quite good, could be a little better. Costumes were brilliant McGonnagal's fight scene against Snape<br/><br/>Bad: They should have showed a few more memories of Snape. I was looking forward to Hermione, Luna and Ginny battling Bellatrix before Molly stepping it. They should have allowed a little more dialog; Bellatrix taunting Molly about the death of George. It was too vague and too fast. You would've missed Bellatrix spell hitting Ginny if you blinked at the wrong time. I was also expecting McGonnagal's, Slughorn's and Kingsley's battle with Voldemort. Hagrid hadn't showed any real emotion when Harry ""died"". There were no real strong interactions with the characters except the trio. Bellatrix, Luna, Lucius (and many more) was left out with their brilliant acting and weren't really shown much throughout the movie. They should have added little cameos of The Divination teacher enchanting the magical balls and throwing them at the Death Eaters, a few Hogmeades villagers fighting against Death Eaters, other creatures coming to help etc. Another disappointment was the death's of main/side characters. Fred's, Tonks and Lupins death was a disappointment. They just...""died"". Nothing more, nothing less. They didn't even give us time to grieve or look back at anything. <br/><br/>Well overall, the movie was great. But, they could have added just 10 minutes to the movie to allow more emotions and depth to it."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two is soon to be one of the best films of the year. The word epic is used far too liberally nowadays to conjure up any of the grand imagery it used to describe, but the last movie in the Harry Potter octalogy deserves this description in it's purest sense.<br/><br/>As corny as it sounds, I had an experience while watching this film that I haven't had since I watched the Lord of the Rings Trilogy in the cinemas. Maybe it was the quality of the visuals/sound system of the cinema I was in or maybe it was the sheeple audience I saw it with (who, while I hate them individually, I can't say I don't appreciate when they magnify my reactions to the movie to the nth degree) but it was one of the few movies I've seen which I can wholeheartedly call a ""cinema movie"".<br/><br/>What with the recent avalanche of possible ways to view our movies and everything, the list of films we'd pay to see in a theatre has become far more selective. What do we want in a ""cinema movie""? Filler. And lots of it. Action, explosions, sex, comedy- anything that could be noticeably improved through the hyperbole of a 1.85:1 to 2.35:1 cinema screen and a pounding surround sound system. Does it matter to us if the movie with the computer generated, lens flare obscured, comic relief, shaky-cam photographed robot alien is fresh or not? Not for the average movie-goer.<br/><br/>It's ironic that the same crowd who'd contribute to the $769,304,749 earned for ""2012"" would see the last Harry Potter film for the same reasons. It has the sweeping battle sequences, the spectacular CG and everything else that Peter Travers would tell you from the DVD blurb, but they are left meaningless without the depth that allow them to exist in the first place. It does not give in to the trappings of exchanging action for character. Actions and emotions are given proper weight through the drama, allowing the action scenes to off-play them perfectly, and crescendo the film through it's final act. I was able to switch off all critical thought and allowed the film to engage me at a personal level. It's what I consider to be a proper ""cinema movie"".<br/><br/>The closure to the Harry Potter film series so tightly produced that it stands firmly above it's predecessors and elevates it's entire series far above it's ""fad"" roots. I wouldn't go so far as to call myself a fan of this franchise, but I would declare myself as a fan of this movie."

","Wishing to avoid the crowds I decided to wait a week before going to see this and, although it was showing in the smaller of my local cinema's two screening rooms, it was still quite busy. I was surprised to find a good friend of mine there with his son and so I joined them on the front row (not a spot I'd usually choose, but I was surprised by the effect). Having already read the book after seeing 'HP7: Part 1' last year I knew we were in for a bit of a treat. Here's a very brief summary before I give you my thoughts.<br/><br/>Harry, Hermione and Ron are still on the trail of Lord Voldemort's three remaining Horcruxes. To this end they convince Griphook to take them to Greengots to retrieve one from the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange. They manage to obtain it, but are discovered and have to escape by releasing the creature guarding the vaults. Voldermort knows they have the Horcrux but they press on. Harry has a feeling the next one is back at Hogwarts and so, risking everything, they return to the school. Severus Snape has been made headmaster and he rules the school with tight discipline. Neville Longbottom and many of the other pupils have started an underground resistance group and it is these who welcome the trio back to the school. Having removed Snape, they now have to find the remaining Horcruxes and the means to destroy them. It is a race against time because Voldemort's forces are gathering outside and they mean to kill Harry Potter. I think that's about all I can say without them Death Eater Spoiler Police coming after me.<br/><br/>The story follows on (not surprisingly) directly from Part 1; there is no ""the story so far"" bit at the beginning so if you haven't seen Part 1 then it may all be a bit confusing. As far as performances go, they all did a great job; Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger. Special praise goes to Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort and Alan Rickman as Professor Severus Snape, I though both were excellent in their difficult roles. Also worthy of a mention were; Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom, Tom Felton as Draco Malfoy, Michael Gambon as Professor Albus Dumbledore, Evanna Lynch as Luna Lovegood and finally, Warwick Davis as Griphook / Professor Filius Flitwick.<br/><br/>There are some significant differences from the book, most of which are there to make the story flow better on screen. The only bit I was disappointed about was towards the end where Harry has a particularly stirring speech in the book; this was sadly missing from the film. On a technical level, I cannot fault it, the CGI and effects are all excellent, although much of the time it is very dark (I wouldn't have liked to see it in 3D). Over all an excellent, and fitting, end to the franchise and one I'm happy to very highly recommend to you.<br/><br/>My score: 9.2/10 IMDb Score: 8.4/10 (68,140 votes when this review was written).

","I like many have grown up reading the Harry Potter books and fell in love with them all. The fact that the entire franchise ends with this movie is a very saddening thought, but I was still anxiously excited to see its send-off, especially after viewing Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part One, which I thought was fantastic. Perhaps I set my expectations too high, but whatever the reason, I couldn't help feeling slightly disappointed after seeing this movie. Warning: Spoilers I'll start off with the good. Visually, the movie is spectacular. I felt that seeing it in 3D wasn't even necessary to get the full effect. The battle was everything I hoped it would be and more. The entire Gringotts scene was impressive as well. I also very much enjoyed how Neville was portrayed in the movie. After reading the book, I was worried that the movie wouldn't do his character justice, but I was pleasantly surprised at how well it was done. And lastly, Alan Rickman did a great job as Snape in this movie. After seven movies, we finally get to see him show some emotion. Now the bad. I felt that there wasn't enough emotion when the deaths of important characters were shown, such as Lupin, Tonks, and especially Fred. What disappointed me the most was that Fred's death wasn't even shown. All we got was a quick view of his dead body, a few tears from his family, and then on to the next sequence. Even Harry's supposed death lacked the proper emotions it deserved. Snape's memories also felt very rushed and I thought some of the most interesting parts of it were left out. Another thing was Voldemort and Bellatrix exploding into confetti. I guess it was done for flash appeal but to me it just felt tacky and inappropriate. And lastly, I Dumbledore's back story was never explained. Many might feel that it wasn't important, but it was very interesting to find out about the regrets and demons of a seemingly perfect person. All in all, this movie was not bad and considering the record-breaking box office numbers, it's already very successful. Many people will most likely enjoy this movie, especially if they haven't read the books. Maybe I'm being too harsh, but I just thought that a spectacular series deserved an spectacular ending, instead of the just okay ending that was delivered."

","Since the age of 6 I've gone to the cinema to see every one of the Harry Potter films and I have to say they have all been entertaining. And it was this foundation of previous movies that meant I was gripped when seeing this. However, I have to say I expected a little more.<br/><br/>Everything seemed a bit predictable. I wanted more twists in the story and although there were a few I felt that the plot was not as good as in some of the previous films. Perhaps this was down to the director Yates or maybe Rowling was at fault for writing a story which although fans wanted, could have been better. Yes, revealing Snape's past was interesting and there were a few other good things about the plot but the story seemed to come second to the visual aspects of the film. I have to say some things were even stupid; for instance sending the whole of slytherin to the dungeons didn't seem a reasonable thing for professor mcgonagall to do and I thought the seem with Dumbledore could have been a lot better. <br/><br/>My main criticism though is left for the end of the film. Harry's victory over Voldermort could have been a bit more impressive. As well as this, going 19 years into the future and seeing all their children going to Hogwarts for the first time was simply not good enough to conclude this great series of films. Giving Harry and Ron a beard did not make them look 40 and Hermoine and Ginny just looked the same! <br/><br/>However, enough of the criticism now... Although my rating of 8 may seem a bit generous after what I have said, I rated it 8 because it the film was spectacular. I was enthralled throughout the by the visual effects. The battle scenes were amazing and though I have had a dig at the plot, the fact that this is a Harry Potter film made up for that. This film could not have possibly been bad being what it was and I did leave the cinema with a smile on my face.<br/><br/>Finally, the acting which I has been slightly poor in the past (mainly because the children were young) reached is peak in the this film. As always Ralph Fiennes was the perfect villain and all the other adults were very good, I particularly thought Maggie Smith(Professor McGonagall)was very moving. <br/><br/>This film is definitely a must for all Potter fans."

","This is what all had been waiting. The end is here and it comes with a big bang. This is the best installment of the series excluding Prisoner of Azkaban. Finally its Harry vs Voldemort. With the beginning only its quite understandable that all we're gonna watch is a lot of action. The direction great, the script is written pretty well and I just loved the screenplay. Its stunning visually and the effects are commendable. One more thing is that you will find your heart pacing as more and more time passes. Definitely all you think is that its gonna end now. I watched in 3d and didn't find much use of 3d except 2-3 good scenes. So its moreover kind of same if you watch in 2d. The truths when unfold delivers a shock to us.

","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>I have read all the HP books and some multiple times. The last one is my favourite, so I was really looking forward to part two of the film. I thought I would refresh my memory by reading the second half of the book exactly where the movie left off - bad idea. Why? Well, I was disappointed to see that many scenes where changed and key moments in the book were completely excluded. What happened to staying true to the book? I really enjoyed the scene where Prof. Mcgonagall said ""do your duty to your school"" and then all the armoured guards came down. But WHY did they have to make her say: ""I've always wanted to use that spell!""??? Seriously.. this scene was meant to be an emotional one where prof. is doing everything she possibly can in order to protect Hogwarts. This was not the time to make a joke. I was also very disappointed when Harry snapped the Elder Wand in half and then threw it away. WHAT THE...? There are countless more examples of unnecessary changes when there were parts in the novel that would have worked on screen.<br/><br/>Overall, I enjoyed the film. My only suggestion is that you do not read the second half of the book before you watch it. You will be disappointed that crucial moments in the book were overlooked and much was left unexplained, which leaves the ordinary HP movie-watchers (those who only watch the films and haven't read the books) utterly confused. Devoted HP fans know the back story, therefore they can fill in all the blanks. If you've seen it, you'll know what I mean.."
"iReviewFilms","Null","0","0","27 July 2011"," Fanaticalaboutfilms Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II
","12A - 130mins - Adventure/Drama/Fantasy - 15th July 2011<br/><br/>Hopefully everyone is aware of the storyline by now but for the nomads amongst us the eighth and final installment sees Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) along with his friends take on the evil wizard Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). In order to give themselves a fighting chance they have to hunt down the remaining Horcruxes before Harry can square up against him for the last time.<br/><br/>So let me dive right in. Was it a fitting ending? Yes I do believe so and it was certainly one of the best of the films released. Is it that good that it deserves all of the credit currently being flung its way? No not by a long shot. The majority of the reviews have fallen into the good old trap of media hype. Don't get me wrong, it was very enjoyable and certainly entertained me for its entire duration but that doesn't make it one of the best films of the year or worthy of any great accolades.<br/><br/>It certainly continues the trend of becoming darker than all of those before it (of which I am a fan) and with them having completely cut the massive battle scene at the end of the sixth film this more than made up for it with CGI and explosions galore. Although I knew that it would never happen, I'd always hoped for the last film to have a rating of at least 15 so they could unleash the evil and make it all just that bit more manic. Regardless, Fiennes and the rest of the crew impress with their acting abilities and even the main trio look a far cry from the original mediocrity of their first outing.<br/><br/>With a film of this stature you are going to get the people who are disappointed because if failed to stick to the book rigidly and missed out key details. Of course it did, it's an adaptation of the book not an exact replica! If they included everything it would be 14.5 hours long and people wouldn't go and watch it. The most important thing to ask was did they cover it in sufficient detail or did the variations from the book cause the film to suffer? Considering the average length of the Potter films so far has been 2h 30m I am slightly surprised that this comes in at only 2h 10m when 2/3 more scenes would have been all that was needed to keep the avid fans happy.<br/><br/>Although it was necessary for it to be put in for some sort of closure, the epilogue felt out of place with the rest of the film and the attempts to age the cast was something short of farcical. Considering the budget available you would have felt they could do more than just add some hair gel, a cushion around the waist and making all the actresses look extra frumpy. But what do I know?<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this both as a individual film and as I closure to the series. Despite it having several flaws and at times feeling like they were trying to see how many cameo appearances they could fit into the 130 minutes rather than telling the story, I would recommend this to most. Just be warned, it's not quite the flawless and perfect film that most would have you believe.<br/><br/>For further reviews feel free to check out: http://www.fanaticalaboutfilms.com"
"pruttisman","Null","0","0","27 July 2011"," A great ending to the series, better than I expected.
","I was really worried about this last movie. Part 1 was good, but I knew that wouldn't mean this one was gonna be. Luckily, they pulled it of. In the beginning I was worried. It seemed as if things were happening to fast and that they didn't really make the Gringotts scene as big and meaningful as I felt it was in the book. Of course, if this was happening in the middle of a movie, which it would if the two parts were put together, it wouldn't be very strange. Still, even for that it was too fast, in my opinion. However, the movie picked up very well after that. Things slowed down, and you started to feel everything that was happening. Now I'm not an enormous Harry Potter fan, though I've read the books and seen the movies, so I might not even remember all the details that they might have missed. Still, to say that it was bad of them not to include more stuff, is unfair. Most Harry Potter books are fatter than holy hell, and even though the last one wasn't as big as for example the fifth, it still contained lots of information and details in the storyline, and trying to squeeze that in to two movies would be impossible. They managed to put a lot of the story into part 2, and I think they did it well. Even though for example Snapes memory scene was shorter than I had hoped, it still gave you the right feel. And of course the big battle could have been shown a little more, you know just a few minutes of footage of people killin' each other and stuff blowing up. That would have been nice. Fred's death was also a little to ""small"" They should have made a bigger deal out of it. But considering all the good qualities of the film (especially CGI and the way they played out a lot of key moments, like the thing where Harry almost dies and goes to the train station thing, I loved that) it hardly even matters to me that they did some stuff differently. And yeah, the final fight scene between Harry and Voldemort, so what if they weren't in the middle of a crowd, seriously, who gives a crap? Loved that they included the ""19 years later scene"". Too bad that they didn't make more out of it, but once again: Who gives a crap? Overall, Great movie, a totally fine ending to the Harry Potter series."

In my eyes maybe the best of the lot. We see more emotion from characters in this film than any other, particularly from Severus Snape, Alan Rickman does an excellent job. The action scenes are also spectacular and all the money spent on this was definitely worth it. I also watched this film in 3D which was another joy as the effects were fantastic. Also credit has to be given to the writers of the film who tweak some of the plot that was originally in the book but readers should not worry as the scenes that have been changed are still fantastic.

And while the film differs in various ways from the book, it still captures the emotion and heart of what the Harry Potter series is about.<br/><br/>The last forty minutes or so of the film are breathtaking and play on your emotions in such a convincing manner that you forget that you're sitting in the theater, especially viewing Snape's story in the Pensieve and the moment when it dawns upon all three young wizards that Harry must die to defeat Voldemort.

Harry Potter is on a mission to kill Voldemort and those who obey him. Ralph Fiennes' character Voldemort lies about Harry Potter being dead, which shows his excellence in acting, then harry potter comes back to life and defeats voldemort.

","I knew that when they decided to make this a two part film two things would happen, one, it would make a TON of money, (it sure as hell did) and two, there would still be things missing even though the point of two films is to get everything in (wtf). I thought that almost all of the important content and even the not so important content that the fans love would be thrown in. I can't say they got that completely right. But nonetheless...<br/><br/>Positive: Part one and two do a great job of giving you the feeling that harry really is screwed over, many of his idols and role models that have carried him through his life are gone now, and the dangers that threatened him are even stronger.<br/><br/>Negative: The ""role models"" that got him through his life that still remain get the crummiest respect in this movies, Fred Lupin and Tonks don't get nothing for death scenes, all the teachers and friends barely get any scenes during the fight which is about half the movie, its like they don't matter anymore because it's ""harry's show"" <br/><br/>Positive: Snapes death scene was the best scene in all of the harry potter films,emotionally it really affected me, and that's a really good accomplishment. Dumbledore's death scene did the same exact thing.<br/><br/>Negative: I wont complain about the stupid jokes, there are always stupid jokes in movies, some of them were even pretty funny in this movie, but a problem is the timing of some of these jokes and how they create a completely unserious atmosphere sometimes.<br/><br/>Positive and negative: The film looked and sounded AMAZING. I can safely say all the effects in this film were perfect except for one damn thing; the thing that happens when bellatrix, nagini, and voldemort die...what the hell they turn into like dust! (what is Jean Grey attcking them) It would have been much more affective if we saw a nice Voldemort dead body<br/><br/>Many things were missing from this movie as well, but I won't judge it in that way even though they did have like 5 hours of film to do stuff with. Overall though, this movie delivers very well, and I'm sure you will love it, but with just a little more effort this film could have been a 10."

","Alas, we find ourselves at the conclusion of 10 years of wand-waving adventures. Was it a success or was it less than what fans expected. Here is a detailed analysis of the last Harry Potter movie.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert!!! :<br/><br/>We were left hanging as Dobby, a great friend of Harry dies and Voldemort gains a newfound power. Harry continues his quest to find the horcruxes. One of the first things I notice is that the entire movie was just a couple of events stretched out. I'm not saying that is a bad things, but a lot of things were left out. <br/><br/>One of those events was when Harry snaps the Elder Wand. What about fixing his broken wand!!! Now he has no wand. In the books, he was able to fix his wand with the powerful Elder Wand.<br/><br/>Also, there should have been a more emphasis on Fred's death. The movie focused on just Harry and his 2 friends. Showing the students battling would have really put a more emotional twist by seeing all the deaths. <br/><br/>Another thing I noticed was that Goyle was gone. I mean, Zabini was never really appeared much, yet Malfoy had replaced him as a best friend.<br/><br/>However, the movie had a lot of good things about it. The plot was strong and the scene with Snape dying and Harry learning he must die was very appealing to the emotional sense. The action was great and there was humor, (some a little dark) throughout the movie.<br/><br/>By the way, I was really looking forward to the main battle. I wanted to see a crowd of people watching two battles of Bellatrix and Voldemort. Seeing each of them battle the 3 people would have been great. <br/><br/>But, when Molly Weasley curses Bellatrix, she does it with almost no emotion. And Voldemort only battled Harry and there was no one watching. There was no speech with Harry coolly calling Voldemort Tom and explaining the power of love. There was instead Voldemort beating Harry and Harry running and hiding.<br/><br/>End Spoiler!!!!<br/><br/>Even with two parts for the same book, there just was not enough time to fit in all these events. Still, the movie definitely did a good job of portraying the few events that actually transpired. I think the movie really deserve the 8.7 out of ten rating. I might have even given it a 9. But, as much of a fan I may be, I must taken into account any flaws for this to be a good review."

Many are complaining that they left out a lot but in an interview with the writers they made sure to mainly focus on Harry Potter since he is the main character. they would have included more details on other characters but the main story is about Harry and adding other stuff would have made part 2 a 4 hours movie. The movie had amazing graphics and all the acting was believable. Allan Rickman had an amazing performance and changed the whole perspective of the character Snape. His work was just touching and heartbreaking. Daniel, Rupert, and Emma as always gave a thrilling performance. Maggie Smith added a lot of humor to the movie even in the dark times. Ralph as Voldemort was brilliant and portrayed him excellently. If you haven't seen the movie yet i HIGHLY recommend it. Another thing about Harry Potter which is so great is that although there is love it is not the main highlight liked Twilight. These movies are great for an audience of 7-100 year olds. There are no swears or sex. It is purely about friendship, bravery, and fighting for what is right and good. BEST SERIES IN THE WORLD. It will live on forever"

"alinewazshah","8","0","0","24 July 2011"," Harry Potter's Last Act finally unveiled
","Before I start this review, lets make some things clear: 1. I love the books more than the movies but I do realize that not every word of the book can be reproduced in the film due to many budgetary and technical reasons, so my focus will remain to the film only. 2. I watched the film in 2D screening, my rating may have been different considering the experience, but I am sure it won't play much part in this movie.<br/><br/>Well, the final chapter of this awesome saga begins where the previous ended. The movie opens with a mild but haunting vocal soundtrack, which sets the mood of the dark and dramatic tensity that was to be expected. This is where I felt the first flaw in the movie. All of the trailers of this movie had epic orchestras used in trailer musics, but here to express the dark tone, the whole movie did not push it self to the epic level in terms of music. I really wanted the music to be uplifting enough, but even in the last half of the movie, the soundtrack was same as if the movie was just beginning. I missed the edginess of soundtracks of Lord of the Rings Trilogy and Transformers Trilogy, they are still simply awesome.<br/><br/>If you have read the books, you already know the prime role of three leads of the movie in more than half of the movie. All in all, the end objective was to defeat he-who-must-not-be-named. As the movie grows darker, so does the lighting of the movie. Trust me, although it was a 2D screening, some scenes were so dark that I had to really look carefully to trace out Demontors in the sky. Considering more than 40 minutes of this movie uses those dark scenes, it was disappointing to see that cinematographer could not capture proper lights in certain scenes, perhaps to express darker tones by the end of the movie, but it nearly made the process rather painful. I hope BluRay fixes it.<br/><br/>As expected, movie was not focused on anyone else, this was Harry's return to his spot and his ""relation"" (I hope that's the right word) with the awesome dark lord. But it was not him or the Dark Lord who stole the show in terms of acting and expression; it was Severus Snape (The Great Alan Rickman). This guy actually got the chance by the last of the movie, but he did his role justice too well. Although everyone did their part well, but Snape was almost as believable as any of the fellow persons that I interact with on daily basis.<br/><br/>Lastly, it was a mixed feeling to see an epic saga coming to an epic finality. But I am also glad that it ended well. I hope when WB reboots this franchise (they are doing these kind of reboots a lot so I am assuming this as well), they make 3-4 parts out of each book, so that we get to know and see everything that was left out for the sake of time and money. Enjoy the movie!"

","I am an extremely devoted fan of Harry Potter and Harry Potter and ""the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" was a superb film. From what I gather, many reviewers are letting their love for Jo Rowling's series misguide their notion of what constitutes a good film. I myself, am a huge fan of the Harry Potter books, but I learnt to accept that the books and films are separate things, as noted by Jo and the films executives.<br/><br/>Not only has the films managed to stay on track (in terms of acting, cinematography, screen-writing etc.), they have been the benchmark for British acting and have given British cinema a new name.<br/><br/>David Yates has, yet again, managed do capture the pure emotion and sentimental value of the books. Yes, readers will notice voids in the plot, but none that would tarnish the book's integrity, and neither were there foolish liberties taken. Necessary changes were made and points were omitted because, as people must understand, some things that work brilliantly in the books might not work so well on screen. Jo Rowling served as producer for the last two films, and oversaw the series, consulting the producers and the directors of the series to lead them in the right direction. <br/><br/>The acting was truly compelling from every character. The trio, Dan, Rupert and Em were fantastic and seemed to nail their characters. But I have to mention the superb Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, who gave an amazing performance, showcasing his wonderful talents. Maggie Smith as Professor McGonnagall, Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, Michael Gambon as Albus Dumbledore and a host of others were also brilliant. <br/><br/>The film captures the true essence of the book; the anguish, heartbreak, joy and euphemism. It was spectacular in every sense, and the cast were outstanding and truly brought their A-game. The events and threads that were created in the earlier films unravel themselves and deliver in spectacular fashion. A truly memorable and epic closing to what has been a treasured series by many around the world, including me. Non readers and fans of the book alike will not be disappointed. <br/><br/>A stirring and magnificent film."

","Finally, Part 2 of the final Harry Potter chapter has been released, and now I realized that the movie is now my all-time favorite Harry Potter movie of all time. It was a perfect way to end the series that we all know and love so much. The drama, the romance, the suspense, the thrills, the action, and everything that makes the last Harry Potter film, the best of the best. The film is also excellent for its secrets finally revealed, and all the surprises that are spilled out. The movie was brilliantly directed by the wonderful David Yates, and it was expertly written by the unique Steve Kloves. Both Yates and Kloves bring back the dark adventures of Harrry, Ron, & Hermione for the very last time. And similar to Part 1, it also takes us back to the many wonderful and charming icons from the previous films, and has all returned for a more dark and epic version of the story. It made us all look back at the whimsical magic since ""The Sorcerer's Stone"" at the very beginning. And let's not forget the awesome cinematography, and spectacular visual effects, and all the amazing well-written scenes that bring the legacy of Harry Potter back to life. And also, it's our last chance to join the adventures of Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they set on their final chapter of their lives at Hogwarts. You have seen them grow throughout the years, and now they are facing serious sacrifices. Now, the movie was the best Harry Potter flick I've seen in years, and it will always bring back a precious childhood memory of the previous movies that we have all grown up with. So, this epic tale of courage, fear, faith, and power is all wrapped up into this wonderful package that we call ""The Harry Potter Finale"". ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"", in my review, ""a spectacular conclusion to one of the greatest franchises in movie history""."
"Red_Identity","Null","0","0","23 July 2011"," A great conclusion to an amazing franchise!
","When it comes to Harry Potter it's pretty hard to be unbiased at times. This is a series that means a lot to me. I first saw Sorcerer's Stone at age 8 in the cinema, and since then have seen every single HP flick at the cinema. It has been 10 years, and the conclusion of this series couldn't have come at a better time. I just graduated High School and am ready to go to a University in a month, so these characters that I have come to care about saying goodbye is a bidding farewell that resonates with me as well.<br/><br/>First off, this is a great finale. It's the action-packed conclusion that ends with a bang. It's fast-paced and very entertaining. Of course, there are many characters to keep track of, so only those people that have stuck with the series all these years will be able to point them out. I do wish the film had shown more of some characters, and this is where I come away with some problems I had with the film. I feel that a lot of characters come away in the film heavily-edited. As in I feel there was a lot that we weren't able to see. Since this is Part 2, it's definitely different in both tone and pace to Part 1, which was a slower-paced more moody film, where people nervously awaited the end. Here it is, and certainly action-packed, but I cannot help but feel as if it was anti-climactic at moments. This goes back to the problems with the book as well. Also, many unexplained things I felt were not given enough backstory. I feel that it would be certainly hard to follow certain story lines. For example, Draco Malfoy's resolution wasn't really seen. We see him go away with his parents then in the epilogue he is seen smiling. I felt this character in particular could have fared with a better farewell. I feel a little bit like that with a lot of characters, for example McGonogall, The Weasleys, Hagrid etc. <br/><br/>These problems I had I cannot really determine as real flaws. For starters, I feel that a conclusion this big needs to be rewatched to be able to seriously analyze it further. But don't get me wrong. It's Harry Potter, so that in itself makes me love it. Yes, it's sort of biased, but it's the truth. Not to say this wasn't a well-made film, because it was. The cinematography is soaring and lets you dwelve into the various things happening (although nothing will beat the cinematography of Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince). The music score was well adjusted and edited, although I can't really recall any really special themes. The visual and sound effects definitely masterful, as is the art direction (who this time around should FINALLY win at the Academy Awards!).<br/><br/>People who have been waiting eagerly to see how the reveal with Snape was ('The Prince's Tale') won't be disappointed. Yes, the montage is heavily edited, but really, what other way could audiences finally understand the grasp of Snape's character. This goes back to the performances. Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes are the stand-outs here. None have been better (although certainly don't see either getting any type of awards recognition sadly). Daniel radcliffe is decent as always, although to a higher extent this time. I do think that both Grint and especially Watson have turned out better performances in this, and have proved to be the better actors.<br/><br/>Let's talk about the epilogue... hated it in the book. Maybe it was the way J.K. Rowling wrote it, in such a cheesy and overly-sugary tone. Yeah, that complaint has been heard millions of times before, but it's the truth. But, to my surprise, it came alive much better on screen. What I especially loved about it was the way not much words have to be said between the original trio for them to know how much they mean to each other. The final shot of them smiling at their kids attending what might be the biggest part of their lives is a great ending. <br/><br/>Ultimately, yes, I might have had problems with it, but at the same time I cannot feel that there might have not been a better way to end the series. David Yates has proved he was the best Harry Potter director, and the last three films of the series are near-masterpieces. I don't really want to over-analyze this reality that Harry Potter has come to an end, because I HATE getting emotional, but really, we have a classic franchise that will be remembered for decades to come."

"sanddragon939","Null","0","0","23 July 2011"," The End of an Era
","I was all of nine years old when I first saw Harry Potter and the Sorceror's Stone...a movie that literally propelled me into another world, as it had propelled countless spellbound viewers before me and countless after me...a fantasy world intricately woven by the literary genius of JK Rowling. I, like billions of others, followed the legendary magical adventures of Harry, Ron, Hermione, Dumbledore, Neville, Snape, Malfoy and innumerable other memorable characters through seven books and seven movies (and even the odd video game or two, to say nothing of the T-shirts and action figures!)...in many ways (most ways, actually), this magical journey came to an end on the midnight of June 21st 2007...but insofar as it was the movies that introduced me to the world of Harry Potter, I only truly considered the journey complete when I saw the epic cinematic spectacle that is 'Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2'.<br/><br/>It is difficult to be objective about this movie and analyse it as just another movie, even just another Harry Potter movie, for it is anything but that. It is the end of an era, in cinematic history, in literary history, in creative history...in the history of pop culture itself.<br/><br/>And ultimately, the minor mundane details, the perceived 'innacuracies' and omissions, don't really matter much this time round...it matters very little that we don't learn ALL about the Deathly Hallows, or Dumbledore's somewhat dubious past...it matters even less that we don't see Wormtail die and that Neville Longbottom ends up with Luna Lovegood rather than with Hannah Abbott...it doesn't seem, strangely enough...to even matter at all that we don't get even a halfway convincing explanation for how Harry survived his second near-death experience at Lord Voldemort's hands...story has always been important to the Harry Potter franchise, but this time its not about story...its about images and icons...be it that of Harry, Ron and Hermione flying into the London sky on the back of a dragon, or that of Harry confronting Snape in the Great Hall of Hogwarts...Hagrid carrying Harry's seemingly lifeless body back into the castle or the climactic showdown between Harry and Voldemort...these are iconic moments brought to life from the pages of Rowling's magnum opus, which will remain entrapped in our imaginations forever!<br/><br/>I will not commend the cast and crew of this movie, and all the others before it, for I expected nothing less from them anyway. I will instead urge everyone who reads this to take a moment to acknowledge the end of an era...to perhaps even bask in the euphoria of Voldemort's defeat and Harry's victory, which epitomizes the perpetual tale of good's conquest of evil with a radiant brilliance which perhaps few other works of literature have ever been able to muster...JK Rowling may not have been William Shakespeare, but the great bard's writings never brought millions of fans out onto the streets at midnight waiting for the release of his latest book...THAT is the true inimitable magic of Harry Potter!!!"

","I watched the movie on the first day itself and was blown apart by its brilliance. It's a truly EPIC movie, although there are several scenes that could have been better. I seriously don't think they could have ended the series in a better way. Though the movie is only 2 hours long, it moves with such high energy that your heart keeps racing from start to finish. The background score by Alexandre Desplat is the most haunting Harry Potter music I've ever heard. Also, I'm very pleased to know that the film is breaking all-time box office records one by one. The film may not look good in 3D, but it's great in normal 2D & IMAX. The director has succeeded in tying the loose ends in a satisfying manner. I would also like to add that some scenes have outdone those portions in the book. It's so sad that we won't get to see these lovely characters and places ever again. Miss it at your own risk!!!"

","So after ten years the Harry Potter film series is brought to a climax with this eighth film.<br/><br/>All the tension builds to a close in this film with the fate of the wizarding world being solved in a bum-numbing two and a half hours. <br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint give their beloved characters one final run out and as ever play them to perfection. Radcliffe in particular does very well and holds the film together at times. Credit should also be given to Alan Rickman who gives a fantastic performance as Snape whose true colours finally get revealed in this film.<br/><br/>Yes there are parts of the original book that were missed out and yes nothing can replicate the imagery that fans have in their heads when reading the book but by and large the director David Yates has constructed a fitting end to the saga and there can be no doubt that these films will long live on in the memory."
"FanPerspective","Null","0","0","20 July 2011"," It is an action-packed and bittersweet goodbye.
","This film hasn't even been out an entire week yet and I've already seen it three times, if that gives you any idea of how amazing it is! Truthfully, I still haven't fully come to terms with the fact that it is actually over. These films have been apart of our lives for ten years, now, and it is bittersweet to say goodbye. But, there is no doubt, it could not have ended in any better way.<br/><br/>It starts exactly where Part 1 left off with Voldemort breaking into Dumbledore's tomb and stealing the Elder Wand. From there, the darkness only spreads as Harry, Ron and Hermione continue on their journey to destroy the last of the Horcruxes. Things get a bit more complicated this go round, though, as Voldemort has realized what they are up to and begins to unleash his wrath of destruction on his mission to kill Harry, which all comes down to an epic and destructive battle at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>As a fan of both the books and films, I went into this finale with the highest of expectations and it still managed to far exceed them. They really just hit the ground running with this one and did not let up.. not for a second. And not only was it an action-packed epic, it was also very emotional.. both in the way certain character's stories unfold and come to an end and that it is, in fact, the very end. Each time I've seen the film I've laughed, I've stayed on the edge of my seat and I've cried.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe's acting abilities were greatly showcased in this film and in certain scenes his performance will give you goosebumps it is so good. At times, yes, they did stray from the books as all the films have, but in the heart of it all it stayed very faithful to J.K. Rowling's magnificent vision, while also enhancing it to a flawless film, adapted wonderfully by Steve Kloves, that has not one dull moment.<br/><br/>David Yates also directed the last three Potter films, but I think this one is his shining moment. The camera work he does is just beautiful and the pacing of the film keeps you immersed in the magic from start to finish; not to mention how he thrust you into the action during the larger than life battle sequences. You couldn't ask for a better film; a better finale; a better experience at the theater."

"fawkes29","Null","0","0","19 July 2011"," The very definition of ""epic""
","Up until now there's been no denying that the Harry Potter movies have been a pale imitation of the books. Finally, in its last installment, after 10 long years of trying, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't perfect: the first twenty minutes dragged slightly, hampered by a less-than-stellar performance by Daniel Radcliffe when he questions Griphook and Ollivander in Shell Cottage. Here, the acting is mediocre and the pacing seems off.<br/><br/>Skip forward to the scenes at Hogwarts and the movie really gets going. While the final battle comprised maybe 15% of the book, in the movie it takes up almost 70%. Certain subplots and nuisances are therefore lost, but the payoff is great.<br/><br/>The final battle is as epic as they come in all the best ways possible. Maggie Smith is marvelous as a not-strictly-book-canon McGonagall, the special effects are terrific, and the pacing is spot on. Just as the books led up to this moment, so too did the movies – and it works. More so than in any of the other movies, everything really comes together. It's quite true to the books here, too, particularly in reference to Neville; and for once, artistic license serves to actually improve the story rather than detract from it.<br/><br/>It still wasn't perfect: for me, too many of the subplots were lost in the movies as a whole (I'd have loved to see more of Kreacher in particular). But Deathly Hallows Part 2 did something I'd long since lost hope for in a Harry Potter film: it exceeded my wildest expectations and had me on the edge of my seat.<br/><br/>9/10. The franchise ended on a high."

","Harry Potter is kind of a special series in the sense that as me and many others have grown up watching this series, this series has also grown up, like Andy in Toy Story. The movies have progressively got more mature and darker, showing the complications of life as we get older. So this was pretty big.<br/><br/>Well, it did not disappoint. This is definitely my favourite HP film. The entire tone just shifted YET AGAIN to a darker one, with many, many characters which we have grown up with dying. There is one especially grim scene where we see an entire courtyard of dead corpses. So I would say that although it originally set out as kids movies, this is no longer the case. In the UK this is a hard 12 rated film, and should be considered. However, brave ten year olds HAVE to see it!<br/><br/>The acting has improved with the series, and watching them back, the acting was already very impressive. There's no question that the actors and actresses have become there characters.<br/><br/>With a twist and many touching goodbye to the series scenes, this was indeed a moving movie that shall be no doubt, in time, be regarded as a classic of our age of cinema.<br/><br/>Have to say though, the very last scene made me laugh for all the wrong reasons.

I knew this day would come for many years now but I am still in a very melancholy mood while writing this. The Harry Potter series was my childhood. I was 10 years old when the first movie came out, and I am now 20. I feel like I have grown up right alongside these actors and to finally be saying goodbye to them, is like saying goodbye to a friend, and also saying goodbye to my childhood.<br/><br/>One thing I have to point out before anything else is the acting, it was just Oscar worthy. Dan, Emma and Rupert have grown into wonderful young actors and they all have very bright futures ahead. Alan Rickman, as stated by Daniel Radcliffe, does in fact give the performance of his career, he was incredible. The real star of this movie though, was Ralph Fiennes, that man is one of the best actors I have ever had the pleasure of watching. He brings Lord Voldemort to life in an impressive way and every time he was on screen I was completely mesmerized.<br/><br/>The Film itself, was truly epic. From the beginning of Snape peering out over the Hogwarts students(a very intense shot, great work on that camera angle), to the very touching epilogue, this film gets it right. Out of all the Potter movies, this one seems perfect and relates to the book extremely well. The effects are visually stunning, and the music is perfect.<br/><br/>I don't want to give too many plot details away, so I'll end my review here. This film is brilliant, not only the best Potter movie, but possibly the best film of the year. I'm not ashamed to admit that I cried during the end, during the epilogue scene, with that wonderful score playing. It truly is amazing, I can't say enough about it.

","Part II picks up right where the previous film left off- the dark Lord Voldemort smiles in evil triumph as he steals the most powerful wand in the world, i.e. the Elder Wand, from the tomb of beloved Hogwarts headmaster Professor Dumbledore (Michael Gambon). The next shot is equally ominous- students are marched rank-and-file through a Hogwarts courtyard, watched closely by cloaked Dementors hovering over the school grounds. If there was any need of a reminder of the danger facing our three protagonists, these opening sequences should just about refresh one's memory of what is at stake.<br/><br/>There is precious little time to waste, and the first we get to see Harry, Ron and Hermione, they are already hatching a plan to break into Gringotts to retrieve a Horcrux. Their break-in settles upon a plan of deception that allows for some rare moments of levity in the film, as Helena Bonham Carter gets to ham it up as a polyjuice-disguised Hermoine impersonating Bellatrix Lestrange. This being the first 'Harry Potter' movie in 3D, Yates caters for some distinctive thrills in the additional dimension with a roller-coaster ride through the vault, culminating in a daring escape on the back of a dragon.<br/><br/>But as readers of the book will tell you, the last stand happens back at Hogwarts, and true enough, after this thrilling early set-piece at Gringotts, the trio head back to the School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to confront their foes. It is also where the last Horcruxes are supposed to be, and Harry's return to the once sunny and cheery grounds now besieged by darkness and doom becomes a true test of allegiance. <br/><br/>Fans will be glad that Kloves gives room for otherwise supporting characters to step into the limelight- in particular, Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) emerges as one of the unlikeliest but also truest heroes on the side of good. The Hogwarts stalwarts also get a chance to show off their magic, and Yates gives each largely enough screen time for the heroic send-off they deserve.<br/><br/>Yet he reserves the most emotional moment in the film for Severus Snape's (Alan Rickman) vindication, long thought to be the Judas Iscariot-equivalent in the Order and the one who pushed Dumbledore to his death. Yates delivers a truly poignant and deeply heartfelt revelation of Snape's true colours, and it is a farewell that even those who have read the book and can expect what is to come will be overwhelmed by its sheer emotional muscle. While Part II was always meant to be an action-packed spectacle, it is to Yates' credit that there is still as much heart as before in the storytelling."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is the grandest of finales. It works in hope, love, loss, death, destruction, thrills, and triumph, and does so more efficiently and powerfully than any other film in the series to date. I'm not sure if Deathly Hallows will work as one giant, almost five-hour movie, but I expect that it will. The individual pieces are so strong—the direction, the performances, and all the technical aspects—that only the pacing would be a question. But I'm not reviewing that eventual epic. This review is for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2, a movie that is exhilarating, emotionally powerful, uplifting, magical, and a beautiful conclusion to a wonderful series. Splitting J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was a risky proposition from a narrative standpoint. Financially, it was an unsurprising move, but if you have one movie that's all slow, methodical character development and the second movie that's all fast-paced action, then each movie could be monotonous because they've lost the other half of their story. Both parts of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows managed to avoid that problem. The first part, while mostly centered on wandering and quiet moments, still managed to work in humor and thrilling set pieces. By contrast, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is an almost non-stop epic battle that still finds time for the character development and deeply moving moments the series became known for. It is the grandest of all of the Harry Potter films in scope, in action, and in heartbreak."
"colinrgeorge","Null","0","0","18 July 2011"," Deathly Hollow: Part 2
","""It all ends."" So reads the succinct tagline for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Capping a decade and eight blockbuster adaptations, Warner Bros. and director David Yates have finally put the franchise to bed. This is Potter's final hour, but is it also his finest?<br/><br/>Depends on who you ask. It's a criticism J.K. Rowling superfans may never understand since the Potter films are tailored to them, but the franchise is neigh impenetrable to the layman. Creative sovereignty is secondary to providing a faithful if mechanical visual companion to the source. Consequently, Deathly Hallows: Part 2 isn't even half a story. There's no beginning or middle — the entirety of the two plus hour runtime is one drawn-out ending.<br/><br/>Often that's an exciting feeling. Deathly Hallows' upbeat action sequences outpace many of its predecessors' — a magical bank heist and a Peter-Jackson-sized skirmish at Hogwarts Castle broaden the scope of the series. Others disappoint. What should be the climactic culmination of a 20-hour epic arrives without the exhilarating catharsis its audience deserves. Standing at 10 paces, Harry and his nemesis cross wands, sans emotional stakes. The archrivals spar simply because they're destined to, and the outcome will surprise no one.<br/><br/>Sandwiched between action and more action are dense expository scenes. When we last left Harry, he was hunting horcruxes (""Pieces of Voldemort's soul,"" he helpfully reminds us). With three of the elusive artifacts still left to unearth, he, Ron, and Hermione have plenty of scrounging to do before their much-advertised and inevitably underwhelming confrontation with the dark lord. The way that series screenwriter Steve Kloves artlessly espouses these crucial bits of info is telling — he could care less whether we follow him because he's following a blueprint.<br/><br/>Still, Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is superior to its predecessor if only because it contains the bulk of the book's action and the characters' overdue closure. There is likewise little fluff, especially compared to the middling middle Potter flicks — but at least Prisoner of Azkaban and Goblet of Fire didn't ask anyone to cough up extra to see the ending.<br/><br/>Dividing Deathly Hallows into two films was a brilliant marketing strategy, but one bereft of creative merit. All of the Potter films suffer to an extent from their unwillingness to embrace a fundamentally different storytelling medium, hoping instead to appease fans by cramming in as much exacting detail as will fit. And that's fine if you view the two billion dollar movie franchise as a visual supplement to the novels, but their standalone worth is negligible.<br/><br/>Hollywood's Potters do a good job of making flesh Rowling's beloved characters and their ever-evolving universe. Removed from the cultural phenomenon of her writing however, they are shallow, mediocre fantasy films cluttered with unnecessary detail. Some would utter an unforgivable curse at this suggestion, but Harry Potter would have made a better trilogy — there, I said it. I just hope you witches and wizards appreciate the irony of burning a Muggle like me at the stake.<br/><br/>Much of the positivity toward Harry Potter can be traced directly back to J.K. Rowling's writing from the generation that grew up reading it. None of the adaptations are bad enough to undo the goodwill she accumulated, but none of them stands independently either. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 stumbles with the right idea — to send the franchise out with a bang — and it does rank among the more enjoyable installments for sheer leanness. Whether or not it's Potter's finest hour is irrelevant; when it all ends, the films are only secondary."

","Okay, so first of all people who have written reviews saying they left out and should have extended it. Guess what J.K. Rowling had creative control and helped write screenplay and lines. If she was happy enough with it with her being the author then you definitely should so don't go give this movie a 1 star and say it was completely awful just because there could've been another 20 minutes that would've greatly contributed. But still this was a great movie. A friend of mine who is not a big fan of the series really enjoyed it when I basically forced him to go. I think there should've been more background information on Dumbldore/Grindelwald like there is in the book at the end. More dialog between Harry and Voldemort at the very end like in the book. Though I say there's a lot of stuff missing that was in this book this is probably the best if not the 2nd best move that has followed the book very greatly. And people dissing David Yates I agree he's not my favorite Harry Potter director Chris Columbus should've done them all. And for those people saying there wasn't enough emotion or time for emotion to spread during the sad parts and such, well guess what there was tears in my eyes and A lot of people in my theater were crying. (Spoiler) the professor snape death scene is probably my favorite through the whole series. I think it was great. I read an absurd review on here saying that Alan Rickman's acting was poor in it..I mean really? People if your that upset with it do it yourself, oh thats right you can't. I've read and re-read the series since the 5th grade (I'm in high school now) I'm sad that it can't continue anymore but the last movie is probably one of the best."

","Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows:Part 2 is the final installment of the Harry Potter Series. I was so excited to see it and had high expectations, as usual these expectations were met. The movie kicks off right where Part 1 ended and there is an intense atmosphere from the very beginning as Harry and his friends know what must happen. There are lots of emotions running throughout this movie as an avid fan would feel for each character as the story unfolds. The effects are great! The 3D didn't really add much however it didn't take anything away either. The music and sound is superb as usual. The script was well written and the acting was great. When you grow up loving Harry Potter, this is the kind of ending you expect to see and I must say David Yates did a phenomenal job! Its intense, it emotional and it sure is thrilling which makes this movie the Perfect Ending.<br/><br/>10/10"

","For the biggest movie franchise in the world, director David Yates had a numerous amount of pressure to bring the decade-long phenomena of Harry Potter, to a close. One might predict that the fear of failure may show itself should the 4 time HP director face a boggart, but of course to say this film was a failure would be ""Ridikulous."" Yates does it again with the final installment to the wizarding world of Harry Potter, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- Part 2. <br/><br/>In the epic conclusion to the series, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ronald Weasley (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) must race to find the remaining horcruxes in order to rid the world of Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) once and for all. <br/><br/>The screen fades from black to the familiar scene of Voldemort raiding the former headmaster's tomb, he sends a bolt of light to the sky, and the WB logo fades from white. A soft and haunting score plays, a masterpiece at the hands of Alexandre Desplat (composer of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows- part 1 and The King's Speech) welcoming the darkened and ominous Hogwarts castle, made all the more beautiful by Eduardo Serra's vision. Strings and a magnificent choir fuse together and create a sound more enchanting than a mermaid's song. <br/><br/>As the second half of a whole, this film moves fast to a hard-hitting and epic battle at the school where we all fell in love with magic, Hogwarts. Stuart Craig's Production design and Serra's point-of-view bring the audience to a significantly changed and matured school to match the wonderful storytelling by Steve Kloves and J. K. Rowling. Reminiscent to the past films, we hear the scores from Harry's first escapades from Sorcerer's Stone, to the melancholy music from Half-Blood Prince. Both enough to bring tears to the eyes. Also gracing the screen is the cast from the entire series, including Maggie Smith as the darling Professor McGonagall, David Thewlis as the howling Remus Lupin, and John Hurt as the mysterious Ollivander. If you want Fantastic Beasts, here's the place to find them. Rowling's world is as magnificent as ever, strewn with Goblins, Animated statues, Acromantulas, and yes, a Dragon!<br/><br/>The magic is bigger and bolder as the main actors give the performances of their careers. Rupert and Emma share a long anticipated moment and some powerful screen time. Of the actors in this film, although each one gave it their all, three were most notable. Alan Rickman, returning as the sniveling Prof. Snape gives the most heart wrenching and beautiful performance of his career, leading to a mind-blowing realization. As the villain who is slowly losing his mind, Ralph Fiennes terrifies and entrances. Lastly, Daniel Radcliffe, the young hero audiences have adored for a decade, awes. Daniel's maturity and absolute dedication to this role has left me breathless, there is no doubt in my mind, if ever there was a Harry Potter alive? -- it is this 21 year old actor. <br/><br/>Words cannot express the perfection of this bold exit for the Harry Potter franchise. Yates, with his talented cast and crew standing beside him, has released the single-most enchanting conclusion in film history. Action, Adventure, Mystery, and Emotion, this film has it all. (Oh, and don't be fooled, albeit the serious nature of this film, there are laughs hidden in there too.) The film left the audience roaring with applause as they sniffled and wiped away their tears. Yates must be a wizard, because I can not imagine any other director taking Rowling's beautiful books, and making them into this immaculate reality without a little magic to help out. For those who have grown up with this series and who have fallen in love with each adventure the troublesome trio have taken us on, this conclusion is everything Harry Potter ought to be: Pure Magic. <br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film!<br/><br/>""It's one thing to be called ""the chosen one,"" but another thing entirely to stand up and be that hero."" --Brandy Jensen"

","OK I really liked the movie but I wasn't a big fan of the ending. Up to the last 30 minutes, I really enjoyed the movie. However, once the movie was about to end I really didn't enjoy it after that. I don't want to spoil the movie for anyone, but I made a video about it: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TE_vVT9uL44 That talks about the last few minutes of the movie, and how it differs from the book. I really wanted the movie to end the same way as the books did, which would have been awesome. However, the director decided to make the ending a little more climactic which really took away from the overall story in my opinion. Other than that though, the movie itself was very well made, and it was a good sending off for Harry and company."

","I consider myself a 'die-hard' Harry Potter fan but don't let that make you think that by saying this film was absolutely fantastic, make me biased.<br/><br/>I went into Deathly Hallows Part 1 with very high expectations but was slightly disappointed with the turnout. Going into Part 2 I had the same expectations however, wasn't disappointed one bit. <br/><br/>Everything went together perfectly; the amount of magic and action fitted in perfectly with dazzling camera work and just the right amount of humour. <br/><br/>Full credit goes to all the actors and actresses for putting on brilliant performances. I was slightly worried that Daniel Radcliffe wouldn't live up to the huge role he had to play but once again I was shown otherwise with a fantastic performance on his behalf. Performances from Rupert Grint and Emma Watson added to the overall brilliance of the film. <br/><br/>Though, particular attention must go out to Alan Rickman (who plays Professor Snape). Until now I've seen his role as entertaining and slightly humerus but in this film we see a deeper and much more emotional side the character. <br/><br/>David Yates has done an incredible job of capturing the raw emotion that shapes our beloved characters and at the same time maintain a high level of heart- stopping magical action. The one slight disappointment was the fact that the film went too fast and a few details were left out.<br/><br/>The film was a fantastic closure of the epic saga and will be long remembered."

","I absolutely loved this movie! It was very emotional and heartfelt which is the ending the saga deserved. The only major problems were, of course, Fred's death, a scene with Fred and George fighting together and showing his death would have made it as emotional as it was in the book. Also, at the end, if you hadn't read the book, why Harry came back to life might have seemed a bit of a mystery. It doesn't really describe the whole 'harry owned all three deathly hallows thing' and it doesn't even mention that Harry's cloak was the original Invisibilty Cloak. If it had explained it a bit better people wouldn't have been left wondering why he survived the kill curse. Also it should have included Harry fixing his old wand. That was pretty important and it just skipped it right out. Other than that though it was a wonderful movie and did the saga justice.

It wasn't as epic as the book was but it did what it was suppose to do and that was conclude the series of Harry Potter. The best acting performance came from the character Voldemort. He deserves a plethora of awards for his performance. Also, Hermoine is going to have a bright career ahead of her. <br/><br/>I was not pleased at all the missing back stories that were in the book. David Yates is a jerk for leaving some of those important facts and scenes out. It seemed like he just said, here's the ending, the journey on how we got thee doesn't matter. A lot of the action scenes were quite short, especially the fight between Mrs. Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange.

","Tears came to my eyes from the first scene. I loved seeing the end play out and the series come to the close. But there is no doubt in my mind that the drive to make it 3-D drove the filmmakers to put too much emphasis on action and took away from character interactions. Sadly, I fear this is the future of films. I was very sad that they chose to pump up the fighting at the end but took out the wonderful scene of Percy Weasley's return to the fold. Also, Alberforth's story is reduced to a line or 2 and we learn nothing of Albus' abuse of power. Even the central revelation of Snape's back-story is reduced. This again, is triumph of special effects over character... and it was the characters that made these books great. It's worth seeing and fans will love it...but it could have been so much better."

","I had read many reviews about this movie warning the book worms who were grabbed by the novel night after night (ME) that they would be disappointing at the end. I entered the theater with low expectations and left with an afterthought. Sure, the writers couldn't have fit the whole book into the movie! No matter what anyone says, it, under most circumstances, can not be done. For example, (For anyone who read the book) when the house elves in the kitchen at Hogwarts are in danger and Ron informs Hermione about this, she gives him a passionate kiss for remembering (not in the movie). However, it is not stated in the movies about Hermione's cause for House-elves (S.P.E.W.) or any of them even knowing that House-elves worked at Hogwarts period.<br/><br/>Another example is the Percy/Fred scene. SPOILER: When Fred dies and Percy sees,(not in the movie) he is overcome with great strife and sadness, more so (I feel) then any of the other Weaslys. It was a very moving scene. Beforehand, he is fighting the Minister of Magic. However, although he makes a cameo in the Fifth movie, it is never clearly stated that he ""betrayed his family"" and sided with the ministry. END OF SPOILER.<br/><br/>This film is however filled with everything that makes a movie shine. Terrific character emotions (Snapes reaction at Lily's death was brilliant) realistic CGI special effects, a hole less plot, and of course, we witness the end to a winding story that captivated it's viewers for more than a decade. All in all, to those of you who wanted it to be ""just like the book"", get over yourselves. It was never going to happen in the first place. Just be glad it wasn't another Percy Jackson (which I still saw and liked). I say enjoy the movie for what it's worth. Some scenes are better off left between the pages of our imaginations."

","The final piece of a decade of Harry Potter movies is in many ways a worthy conclusion, but just as much a mere shadow of the novels' superb storyline. It was most impressive to see the darkness and despair that had build up over the -let's say ""prequels"" to HP&TDH2- come to a climax here, which in my opinion is the key to the final book. The long shadow of catastrophic events to come was still echoing in my mind from Part 1 and I was very excited when I went to see HP&TDH2. One one hand I was amazed how much thrill this production was able to generate, as I had read the book and knew what was going to happen. On the other hand I must say that not only the tension that should / could have been arching over Part 1 & 2 was missing somehow. But also -over the attempt to create a movie that was able to live up to the huge expectations of the audience, HP&TDH2 had become trivial and hollow in many scenes. Why not take a little more time to make ALL the important scenes count? What with the hasty kiss between Hermione & Ron, Dumbledore's brother or Harry having to cope with the facts that the price of victory will be the most terrifying for him? Action-wise it was fun to watch, -not superb as an action movie, but great as a final Harry Potter film. What disappointed me most was the weak ending. The production team could have done a better job, as the final battle between harry and Voldemort just couldn't create that feeling of a cinematographic climax; there was no thrill of this special moment just before a catastrophe is about to happen. As a Harry Potter fan I must say to the production team: OK, a movie simply can't reproduce all the charm and depth of the books. But in the end you just missed the important parts. The final book is NOT about action or an epic showdown. <br/><br/>7/10"

While they are doing this they are also trying to avoid said Dark Lord and his followers who, if they find them, will make short shrift of them. <br/><br/>So here it is, the final chapter of Harry Potter is upon is.

Well, yes it is. Is it the best Potter film so far? I'd still have to put Azkaban above it, not necessarily because it is a better film, but because it's when the films started to grow with us, like remembering a first kiss or a first crush, others may come, but memory tends to play around with us like that.<br/><br/>David Yates' again shows us why he for the last for films he has been ""The man who would"" tie everything together. The performances are excellent from all the cast, particularly from Rickman who has portrayed Snape so well for the last ten years with this film being his big pay-off.<br/><br/>The script, which in a way just features two big scenes from deathly hallows, allows us to really feel the adventure for each character and one of the big problems with the final book, the final finale, is, in the film, handled with much more excitement and power which is really missing in the books, so hats off to Cloves and Yates there.<br/><br/>Of course with anything like this there are going to be bits that we wish there'd been more of and bits that we wish they'd kept in (Like who the headmaster of Hogwarts is at the end) but after spending a few days getting to know our friends from Hogwarts again myself, I feel that this is a very satisfying ending to a saga middle-earthian in scope and yet like those self- same loved books, whose main strength comes from the very human condition that they represent on the smallest scale.<br/><br/>As a film on it's own, very entertaining.<br/><br/>As a film set ...a Triumph for all involved (apart from Mike Newell ...sorry!)"

","Some things seem beyond criticism. Flaws can be pointed out, but these are not welcomed by many.<br/><br/>As a fan of sci-fi and fantasy, I'm often chastised or quizzed heavily about my dislike and disinterest in the 'Harry Potter' books and films. My answer is that the books are obese, verbose tomes lacking in any turn of phrase or wonder. The film adaptations are empty confections, old rope dressed in great actors and special effects that stifle the wonder and the oxygen of true humour and peril.<br/><br/>Rowling is no plagiarist, but her books were always imaginative responses to the canon of British children's literature from Blyton and Tolkein through to Pratchett and LeGuin - not to mention Lucas. <br/><br/>In this last film, Rowling and the movie makers' huge snowball of influences has gathered so much weight that it pulls itself off course and rushing down a ravine taking all loose plot ends with it.<br/><br/>The film delivers what the book was - no accident that the final tome's drafting came at the time the Lord of the Rings movies were popular as wholesale set pieces are nigh on recreated here. The assault on Hogwarts could be that upon Minas Tirith. The final scene could be the parting of the ways. Dumbledore in a dream is Gandalf the White for Puddle Lane readers.<br/><br/>The way mythic and fantastic elements are glossed over, showcased as living, breathing monsters or magic, but with no life in them past being wall candy for the video-game- simple plot, is frustrating. Tolkein or Douglas Adams had the ability to pull out from their story as their characters drove events, explaining weird and exotic creatures as they went. Rowling drapes stock figures of trolls and dragons around her groaning wedding cake of stacked ideas and ultimately gives in to the American audiences who helped make her famous - her hero just shoots his problem. ""Bang"", Voldemort's dead. ""Slice"" a snake's dead... World of Warcraft is like Pinter in comparison.<br/><br/>No moral victory for Potter, certainly no satisfying victory when the defeated characters in Rowling's world are the most interesting while the victors are the blandest. <br/><br/>David Yates does an admirable job and some of the set pieces are phenomenal, but how can he ultimately create anything of interest in a world where Deus Ex Machina was used in ways that would lose a ten year old marks on a story grade?"

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was overall a good film. It contained the hype that the advertisements said it would have with the effects and acting, but the storyline was quite off. I felt at the beginning it started off great, continuing at Shell Cottage and working from there to Gringotts. However, the battle for Hogwarts in my opinion could've been better. The sequence wasn't all correct, and some things were randomly added in (Potter confronting Snape in the great hall) or completely left out (Potter and Luna not going to Ravenclaw tower and encountering the Carrows). Also the battle with Voldemort was not how it was supposed to happen, and thats something I wish the screenwriters would have given more consideration. Voldemort's death wasn't as epic as I had pictured, with everyone in the entrance hall watching as Harry took down the dark lord, and having him explode into confetti was more comedic then an epic death. But what I don't understand was Harry snapping the Elder Wand. He was supposed to mend his own, then dispose of it (but of course not by snapping it but by returning it to Dumbledore's grave). I know my review is harsh, but thats because I follow the book more than the film and, as we all know, the book is always right. Overall the film did follow the general order of the book despite the loopholes, the acting was excellent, and the effects were epic.

","Who would have thought in 2001 that in 2011 we would be expecting HP 8 to be the biggest film of the year, smashing all box office records before it? And yet, here we are, with the same characters and almost exactly the same cast, consistent across the whole franchise. Dumbledore being effectively replaced by Michael Gambon, due to the death of Richard Harris After abruptly leaving audiences in mid story in Part 1, have the loose ends been tied and a resounding and satisfying finale been served? The short answer is yes with some relatively minor caveats.<br/><br/>All of the exposition was completed in part 1 thus allowing the filmmakers free reign to make the last film, one long running battle. The opening scenes with Griphook (Warwick Davis) are noteworthy for the stillness that he brings to the role, an element that is lacking in the frenetic set pieces that follow. Swathed in make up and razor sharp teeth, he highlights the issue that has beset the films from the start, the young protagonists acting ability has always paled against the wealth of mainly English acting talent on offer.<br/><br/>These early scenes set up an adventure to recover another Horcrux within Gringotts bank, beautifully and expensively recreated and then promptly destroyed. The effects throughout the film are outstanding, the studio obviously pushing out every boat they could find, to make this an ending worthy of the name. Tie in's to new roller coaster rides are obvious but in 3D this is great fun, and everything is created believably within the fantasy world.<br/><br/>There a few flashbacks which indicate just how far the cast and crew have come from early beginnings but all of this is just delaying the inevitable final battle and showdown that everyone has paid to see. The final siege of Hogwarts, draped in protective spells, stone guards brought to life and a last stand defense by all those who remain in the Order for good.<br/><br/>Like a fireworks display where the biggest rockets are saved for last, everything is thrown at the screen, mostly very effectively. Characters from the past all get some screen time, albeit brief in some cases. Julie Walters (Molly Weasley) and Maggie Smith (Professor McGonagall) get the best lines of the film, Walters ""Not my daughter, you bitch"" receiving a round of applause from the audience, as Bellatrix is brought to account.<br/><br/>Hogwarts far from the sunny refuge it offered in early films, becomes a battlefield liberally strewn with dead bodies, the Quidditch pitch is the first to be set alight. Large scale battles with colossal Trolls are reminiscent of Lord of The Rings in scale and presentation and are equally impressive.<br/><br/>The remainder of the books plot is explained and final motivations revealed, although the film does come to a grinding halt at one point to deal with an out of body experience. Similar to later episodes of the Matrix and Pirates of the Caribbean, this is achieved with an all white set. Whilst necessary, is does dispel the considerable momentum built up, before the final showdown. Harry against Voldemort, Fiennes yet again achieving acting marvels below levels of constricting make up.<br/><br/>Few actors get a chance to shine as the last film is all about tying up loose ends and spectacle. We will miss Snape (Rickman) with his billowing cape and drawn out delivery of lines, however there are unintentional poignant scenes, more so because the young threesome clearly realise this is the end of a journey that none of them could have predicted would last so long. The kiss when it comes is awkward, the actors clearly considering themselves brothers and sisters due to their shared experiences at this point.<br/><br/>Despite the rather questionable ending of the books, in the film all the actors are aged effectively to portray the final epilogue scenes, which if anything, play better on the screen than on the page.<br/><br/>Certainly Warner Brothers must be credited with providing solid, creative and expensive entertainment, they could not be accused of just relying on the built in audience that comes with the Franchise. Whilst every commercial avenue has been exploited, as any good business would, at least everything is built around a solid worthwhile piece of popular entertainment.<br/><br/>Is this really the end, well everyone tells us that it is. Rowling has written no more books although fan fiction continues apace, whether Warner Brothers will be able to walk away from such a lucrative Franchise remains to be see.<br/><br/>But for now, this is it, the end, Harry Potter has left the building.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>For those even casually acquainted with the books or films, this will be a must see. For fans it goes without saying, this is compulsory viewing.<br/><br/>We have grown up with Harry Potter, some might argue it has accurately reflected the gradual shift from innocence to the current woes of the world post 9/11.<br/><br/>We will be sad in many ways to see it go but this is the send off the series deserves and comes highly recommended.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.com/"

","Part of the problem this movie faced was sustaining tension. It didn't. Nor did it attempt to rebuild tension drained by each scene. Splitting a single book in two was a bad idea to begin with, but this movie not only failed to stand alone, it also failed to live up to the promise of Part I. There should have been a single final movie that matched the book. Part I built tension, and left us all on the edge of our seats, but that tension dissipated, never to be rebuilt.<br/><br/>Part II wasted time on dull one-liners to provide comic relief for tension that wasn't there. Also missing were a sense of doom, fear, a burdensome awareness of menace, fatigue, and the need to fight all-out for an uncertain outcome. As there was no sense of fear or doubt or determination, there was nothing to inspire our encouragement or protectiveness -- and certainly no need for relief from tension, since there is none. There is more groundwork laid for the lame one-liners than there is for the story. Since Part I wasted time on similarly extraneous scenes, why not just combine the two and make one long, excellent movie? <br/><br/>Other problems: rearranging sequences so results are known ahead of time, which deprives us of surprises; abbreviating scenes to minimize tension, which deprives us of payoff; overstating certain emotional phrases, weakening their impact; writing out-of-character lines for players who don't have enough dialogue to restore their integrity; omitting scenes that add gravity; adding lighthearted mugging at bad times, which is confusing. Is this a do-or-die moment? If so, why are you tittering and shrugging? If not, why is there blood everywhere? <br/><br/>There were technical problems (some bad green screen moments, especially) and some weak framing and editing; all this speaks of a rush job. But the weak storytelling and dialogue were what killed this movie."

","Like many of the hardcore fans I believe the books in the Harry Potter series are better then the movies! Does that mean I haven't enjoyed watching the films these past 10 years? HECK NO!!!! They have been so much fun to watch and I have loved every single one, though I was disappointed a little with Half Blood Price because they left out the battle, keeping it for the final movie! The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is not only the best movie in the series it is probably also one of the best movies I have ever seen! I'm not quite sure if it was because I went on opening night at 12:15am and was engrossed with all the fans energy, but I have never had so much fun at the theatre! The movie is filled with emotion, great acting, a wonderful score (music), and it kept all the best parts from the book!!! The Deathly Hallows part 2 has found a place in my heart and it ranks in my top 10 favorite movies of all time! DON'T MISS IT!"

","David Yates delivered a fine ending to one of the most anticipated climaxes in cinema history. Though obviously the book has far more depth and detail, this treatment was really well done with just the right amount of deviation from the book to create some intriguing visuals (and in one case, a much more dramatically effective scene).<br/><br/>The trio of Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint have grown enormously as actors and are a joy to watch. I especially am impressed with Radcliffe's measured and thoughtful performance. But the minor characters hold their own as well, including Maggie Smith, Matthew Lewis and David Bradley.<br/><br/>The real power in the film comes from Alan Rickman, who's layered and complex portrayal of Snape has been one of the anchors of the entire series. Though I've been critical of Michael Gambon's past performances as Dumbledore, his brief scenes in DH2 are well acted, showing both the desperation and mischievousness of the character.<br/><br/>One delightful surprise for me was in the final scene and credits where the great music of John Williams was brought back for a final farewell, linking the final film to the first. It's hard to believe it's been an 11 year journey -- longer than the 7 year span of the books. But I'm glad the conclusion was done so well. It was worth the wait."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 marks the end of the reign of Lord Voldemort, and the end of the most successful movie franchise ever. I have to say that it was a fitting end to what has been an extremely exciting 10-year-long adventure. Although this was inevitable, and the ending was fairly predictable, even for those who had not read the book, this film was absolutely gripping, powerful and suspenseful, and characteristic of a classic ""cloak-and-dagger"" tale.<br/><br/>You want to talk about ending with a bang, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 did that in tremendous form. I have been told that in business you cannot be everything to everyone, and while this holds true in many scenarios, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows refuses to be bound by this rule. This is one of the few films that I have seen where every possible emotion one can experience is provoked at one point or another. Throughout the film, you will be happy, sad, angry, upset, confused, sad again, distraught (I heard the sobs) depressed, perplexed, and then absolutely euphoric. Daniel Radcliffe described this film in an interview as being an ""intense emotional drama"" and the story to be ""quite a roller-coaster ride"", and after having seen the film, I can vouch that it truly is one heck of an emotional roller-coaster.<br/><br/>Although this last film continued on with the story from the one before it, it was not absolutely necessary to have seen part 1 to understand part 2. Part 1 was all dialogue in order to set the plot for what was to come, and considering only one Horcrux was found and destroyed over the duration of the entire film, the remaining Horcruxes along with every conclusive detail were left for part 2.<br/><br/>The opening scenes of the final film were strictly dialogue and the story moved very slowly, taking on from the film that preceded it, but once it got back into the thick of things, it suddenly seemed to breeze by. Before long, two Horcruxes were destroyed, Voldemort had become significantly weaker, and an epic battle of good versus evil ensues at Hogwarts School. A familiar place that had at one time been considered a place of refuge, comfort and safety, I thought that it was the perfect setting for one final mystical adventure with Harry, Ron and Hermione. It's where it all began for the boy wizard and his trusted sidekicks, so it seems only fitting to have it all end there as well, and have the story come full circle.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows provided the perfect place for the proper good-bye, and I thought every aspect of this film was very well thought-out. Every scene, every character, and every event that took place had significance to how the whole story played out, so you have to really be paying attention as you watch. Everything was done appropriately and surely to every fan's complete satisfaction. As part 1 dealt mainly with Harry, Ron and Hermione's quest to uncover the story behind the deathly hallows, many of the other characters that had become staples in the franchise had been left out. But from the opening scenes of part 2 onwards, we are rightfully reacquainted with all the bright, familiar faces that we have come to love and cherish, including Ollivander.<br/><br/>All the characters were utilized, some more than others, and some with even bigger parts with more screen-time than they had in the past 7 films put together. Those select few characters I have alluded to become the unlikely heroes of the movie.<br/><br/>Just like the Sword of Gryffindor presents itself to the witch or wizard most deserving of it, the sword, along with the role of hero, went to a character very deserving of it.<br/><br/>This film drew applause from the audience even before the story picked up. There are many occasions when you'll be compelled to clap, not just at the end; and that's the kind of reception this film has gained. It was the perfect ending to a phenomenal story."

","Throughout the series fans of the books have experienced highs and lows. This last film of the book attempts to be an epic, and in doing so, misses the charisma of the book. One expects a movie to be shortened and reduced to encompass the essential facets of a novel. Apparently the directors and writers did not feel the need to adhere even remotely to the book. An essential hallow, the invisible cloak, almost plays an insignificant role. You, expect changes to suit the film, but you do not expect changes that will detract from the original plot. I'm sure it was a difficult task to encompass the entire 7th book into a single movie, therefore they attempted to film into two parts. However, they seem to have missed the thematic development of the book, and the entire series, for that matter. It is not a complete disappointment, the acting is not fantastic, but not lackluster. Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes portray their characters with ease, and deliver an expected performance. However, their dynamism seems rushed, as does the entire film. Radcliffe, Watson, and Grint have shown improvement but I feel they have been limited by the director. The biggest disappointment of the film is the directors abysmal vision. Nevertheless, fans of the movies will enjoy it, leaving fans of novel feeling utterly disappointed. Its interesting how the director expects the audience to have read the books in order to understand the general flow of the film, but decides to deviate on crucial factors of the book."
"Alexdamien89","Null","0","0","16 July 2011"," Great ending to a franchise
","And so we have come to the final installment of the Harry Potter film series, and this one is a blast. All I gotta say is ""WOW"". Harry Potter literally ended the series right.<br/><br/>To begin with, I wasn't too satisfied with the first part of the film, I thought it just dragged on and on and got boring, all Harry and his friends did was just go hiking, that's it, nothing happened. Well, stuff did happen here and there, but most of the movie involves Harry, Ron and Hermione just camping. But it was still a descent installment in the franchise and it got us hyped up and ready for the final curtain, being Part 2 of the Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>The thing that bothered me was this film may have gotten a little too hyped up and I always thought that was not a good thing, because then people would be expecting a lot from this film, and once they see it, they'd walk out of the theater all confused and disappointed-like. Before I saw this film, I have had countless, and countless Harry Potter dreams and the wait was killing me. I almost couldn't sleep because we were just minutes away until it's release. I've also been going through countless conflicts thinking the movie was not going to be as hoped. Well I wasn't going to let those feelings get the best of me, because I have wait a long time for this. I got myself prepared for this film by watching all seven Potter films throughout the whole week and without knowing how fast the days went by. I seems like only yesterday when we were only 80 days away. Then When I saw the film, all those feelings, all those conflicts I had for this film were thrown off of the face of the earth.<br/><br/>Director David Yates wanted to stay true to the book, but at the same time wanted to show a lot more emotions and a lot more character developments along the way, with some humor mixed in as well. Of course there are some changes, but that was nothing to nitpick And it works, this movie took everything that made Harry Potter legendary and turned it into something greater than any viewer could ever imagine. And As always, Daniel, Rupert and Emma all give it their best out there. Seems like yesterday when they were starting out as child actors. And now they've all grown up into find actors, for Emma of course, she's grown up very beautifully too.<br/><br/>The one thing I and everyone else has notice was how much these films have changed. 10 years ago, the first film was like a family-fantasy film that was mostly made for kids, but as it goes on, It started to get a little more darker and it seem to target more on the adults. The characters were growing up, the viewers were growing up, and so were the films. Not to mention the last few films were rated PG-13. But again, the way these films gradually make that transition is exquisite. But back to this film. This is, without a doubt, probably one of the best Potter films ever made, with an epic battles, emotional Revelations and a satisfying ending. The film was so good in fact, that it took a lot out of me. Everything that made me who I am, every one of my interests, my favorite activities, were all replaced by this one friggin film. It's not often a movie is able to accomplish something like this, let alone the whole film series.<br/><br/>So if you are looking for a good summer flick, this film is beyond good, it's genius, pure genius. And to be honest, this film is so great, my words are not enough to express how spectacular it is, this is one of those films that you just have to see to believe. It's a phenomenal roller coaster ride that will leave your heart beating and beating and throughout the whole film, you will be clenching your stomach. My rating......I give it 5 wands out of 5, check it out"

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part II is a great conclusion to the enormous success of the Harry Potter film series that has great visual effects and powerful acting. It's a satisfying conclusion to the biggest movie franchise to come out over the past 10 years. The acting is very good particularly from actors like Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter and Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom who has the best speech since Aragorn's speech in the Lord of the Rings The Return of the King. My main complaints with the movie was that some characters like Helena Bonham Carter's Bellatrix and Julie Walter's Mrs Weasley are very underused and the 3D makes the movie a whole lot darker and by the end of the movie I had a head ache. So in my opinion stick to the 2D version as when I took my glasses off the movie looked a lot brighter. So overall this movie is a good conclusion to a fantastic film series but stick to the 2D version if you can find it."

","It is very entrataining, at least it is the best by far of the four movies directed by David Yates. But.... what I truly truly hated is that Ron and Hermione are absent almost all the time. Since David Yates started to direct the movies I think he stopped paying attention to that part, to the friendship part. the book is full of funny incredible dialogues and in the movies they don't appear anywhere. I think Neville Longbottom talked more in this movie than Ron and Hermione put together in both parts. Ron is funny yes, but not as funny as in the books, Hermione is so... not- Hermione like, Emma lost all her sassiness and high airs she used to have in the first movies. It is the only thing I hated of this movie the almost absence of this amazing important characters. An I have to say I hated the three previous David Yated movies this is the first one of him I sort of like."

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","0","0","16 July 2011"," Harry Potter and the Satisfying Send-off
","There is a moment deep into ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" that passes quickly but stands for a lot. Harry Potter is visited by the ghostly apparition of his avuncular mentor Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) who addresses him: ""Harry, you wonderful boy . . . you brave, brave man."" Man is the key word. In ten years, since we first met ""Harry in Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone:, we saw a wonderful, fresh-faced kid become a man of wisdom, strength, caution, maturity and leadership.<br/><br/>What is refreshing about this closing chapter is that, after seven previous adventures, it is refreshing to have a hero whose mind, heart and soul are conditioned by the lessons he's learned, and not by the body count at this feet. Death is a major factor in this concluding episode, there are many deaths, but the question looming over this chapter is whether Harry will become one of them. There isn't a conclusive answer to that question because the ending that Rowling came up with is both baffling and fascinating at the same time. That, in essence, has been the continuing factor of this series all along and part of the reason that we have kept coming back. Rowling's gift is that she has such a surprising sense of imagination that we don't know what she will come up with next.<br/><br/>""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2"" picks up where its predecessor left off, with Harry (Daniel Radcliff) and pals Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) seeking objects known as Horcruxes, that contains torn off pieces of the soul of the evil Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). By this point there are four that remain and Harry discovers that one of them is locked away somewhere at Hogwarts. As Harry returns, students and teachers at Hogwarts batten down the hatches for a massive battle with Voldemort and his minions.<br/><br/>What is special about ""Part 2"" is that it is more than just a door-closer. There is a lot at stake here, not the least of which is the fact that Harry must take the final steps of his journey alone. What is interesting here is that, whereas the previous installment pushed aside most of the supporting cast, this one brings them all on-stage for the final showdown - everyone gets their little moment. Yet, the story still remains focused squarely on Harry. This is his big moment and we see that that overly protected little tyke of 10 years ago is now a man battling the most evil being in the land single-handedly. That battle would be nothing without a performance we can believe in and Daniel Radcliff, who has seemed distant from the material in some of the previous movies (at his worst he seemed to simply be going through the motions), finds an intense foothold on the character that lends it gravity and weight.<br/><br/>The movie doesn't have the overriding sense of dread that ""Part 1"" did, it replaces quiet atmosphere with breathless action scenes. In fact, the movie is one action scene after another. That's both a blessing and a curse. There are action scenes here are hit home with striking originality, such as an early scene in which Harry and friends must break into the goblin-run Gringott's Bank to steal an object from the vault of witchy-woman Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham-Carter). I like the action scenes in these movies because they always have a spark of originality, but if there is a weakness in this last chapter, it is the feeling that the movie is rushing things. We get to the final moments with Voldemort rather quickly. This is the shortest film in the series and there is a lot of information to be imparted to the audience including the legacy of Harry's parents, the truth about Professor Snape, the mysterious machinations behind the death of Dumbledore and the steps that Harry must take to fulfill his destiny. It is a lot to take in and I think the pacing of the previous installment was better at allowing us to get involved rather then join the film on visceral level.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a series that was never content to remain as it was in the beginning. Like Harry, this is a series that has grown and matured. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is violent but not bloody and scary but not traumatizing. It is a polar contrast to the innocence of Sorcerer's Stone with its talking portraits and Quidditch matches (just to hammer that point home, the Quidditch field itself meets a fiery end).<br/><br/>It was a wise decision to split this concluding chapter into two parts. The first part made good use of ominous silences and the spaces between the action where we could get inside Harry's feelings of dread. This second part is just the opposite, there are few moments of quiet introspection (save for that moment with Dumbledore) and, in fact, this is one long action scene. Is it the perfect send-off? It isn't as spectacular as it could have been, but I must say that I was surprised at how much this movie was able to cover in two hours and ten minutes. When we get to the concluding scenes, it feels like a fitting farewell. The door closes on one of the most original and creative enterprises that any author has ever put to paper. There's a feeling of saying goodbye but an even greater feeling of what is to come."

","Let me start off by saying that I grew up with Harry Potter, just like most people posting on here. I read the first book before it was even popular, and have seen every movie the first day it was released. <br/><br/>I feel like the movies went downhill from the 3rd to the 6th, then picked back up on 7 part 1. I loved part 1, and was so stoked to see part 2 at midnight! I definitely was not let down.<br/><br/>If you are a person who reads the books then sees the movies, as I am, you need to realize that not everything is going to be like the book. They need to make the movies entertaining for not only loyal fans and readers, but also non-readers. If you get caught up on details that were in the book but not in the movie, you will be disappointed in every single movie made from a book, and I'm not just talking Harry Potter here. <br/><br/>Now that I have that off of my chest, I must say, I liked the adaptations made in the movie. The only part I really didn't understand was Harry and Voldemort's adaptation of a ""fight""... no wands. This was the only part that really bothered me because in the wizarding world, if a wizard has a wand, they will use it. Not their fists. Honestly. When Harry grabs Voldemort and they free fall off of one of the towers in Hogwarts, it was totally unrealistic. Voldemort would never let Harry get that close to him and not kill him. Just an observation as a die-hard fan. <br/><br/>Overall, I thought all of the characters got their share. Of course a lot of focus was on Harry, but that's because it's called ""Harry Potter"", not ""Adventures at Hogwarts"". <br/><br/>I felt like it was a great send-off for the series, it summed everything up, and the included the very last chapter in the book where Harry and Ginny are married with kids, as well as Ron and Hermione. Though the make-up was mediocre, actors in their 20's are tough to make look like they are in their late 30's. <br/><br/>I would recommend seeing the movie in 3D... I am going later to see it in 3D, but I just saw it 2D last night. You can tell it was made as a 3D movie by the special effects."

Unforgettable experience!<br/><br/>First impressions of the film? Brilliant.<br/><br/>Director David Yates, who also directed the 5th, 6th and 7th films is back to direct the final. The film (in case you're wondering) picks up straight after where Part 1 ended, Voldemort has the most powerful wand in his possession and he's finally ready to succeed in what he tried to do over 15 years ago. He finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. I won't go into much more detail in what happens as most people will have read the book and I don't want to drop spoilers! Harry, Ron and Hermione need to seek out and destroy Voldemort's remaining Horcruxes. This is the only way that will give them a chance of stopping He Who Must Not Be Named.<br/><br/>It Was The best harry potter movie EVER!!

","I salute you, Potter fans. This moment has taken 10 years to find you, and now the wait is finally over. I can tell you the wait was worth it. Maybe you want to know exactly what happens to Voldemort in the movie or exactly how a battle specifically goes down, but spoilers for this movie (good or bad) are simply not worth knowing. Get in line and don't ruin the experience for yourself.<br/><br/>I know what your big (generic) questions are... Is Part 2 fantastically more epic than the previous films? Does it loyally mirror the book to the very last page? Has Daniel Radcliffe's acting improved? I know you definitely don't want to hear it, and I definitely don't want to say it, but the answer is No. If you have come this far after watching seven Harry Potter movies and still have no clue what to expect, then I don't know what to tell you. In whatever regard you held Part 1, you will probably think similarly of Part 2. They are made of the same quality,,, Unfortunately, that means I can guarantee there will be moments that cause you to shift uncomfortably in your seat and think to yourself, ""That's not how it happened in the book""; you'll see chunks of the story removed for the sake of runtime; some parts, namely the romances, will feel rushed and awkward; what consisted of pages of dialogue in the book are awarded a single line in the movie; the smothering relationship with Hollywood style leads to silly fist fights and corny one-liners. Even the epilogue is quite laughable because someone in the costume department thought ""19 years later"" only meant ""19 pies and a Big Mac later"". Again, these are all defects you should have come to expect in the series... <br/><br/>But do not despair! I can also guarantee that after these fleeting mistakes pass, you will shrug your shoulders and realize that these are Harry's last days. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is perhaps the only possible movie that, despite however unsatisfying some scenes might be, the film as a whole will leave you with a grand sense of fulfillment in your mind and with a feeling of nostalgic happiness tugging at your heartstrings. You will STILL be rooting for your favorite heroes, be wow-ed by excellent special effects, and squirm with delight at the sight of the long-awaited kiss. It is ultimately a bombastic conclusion befitting of one of the greatest literary and film series in history - No one can argue with that. Harry Potter's life on the screen may be over, but the boy who lived will continue to live in our hearts forever."

2) Potter has to die to kill Voldemort but survive. Forced happy end;
3) Neville survives all attacks because of fortune so to kill the nasty monster: ridiculous;
5) the movie has too much negative aspects.<br/><br/>The story should have been good if Severus had faced Voldemort to defeat him so to avoid Harry Potter's death.

","to be fare this movie deserves more like a 7.6, meaning its still good, but never as good as an 8.7, that's pretty much an insult to real good movies. as i said is good definitely better than the first part and maybe best of all if u like, but come om 8.7? even 8.4 still very high how can this be better than gladiator? or inglorious bastards?, or even freaking avatar? (which i also believe is a little bit overrated with 8.1) its true, I'm not a fan, but i don't hate harry potter either I've watched all movies because i want to, but because I'm not a fan like most people i believe i can have a better judgment of the real meaning of the movie and not favor it out of fanaticism"
"ypjoshi","8","2","5","16 July 2011"," Very good.a Must watch..epic! but, could have been better,,,
","This was my first preview experience of a movie.My first reaction? Very Good.best among David Yates'. SPOILER ALERT !!!. Well, its fast paced, unlike previous one.The movie starts on a high.(SPOILER)The Gringotts Bank scene,excellently coordinated,pulls you in the movie instantly.All the scenes are absolute visual treat. Few scenes are worth 3D viewing, but most are not.The movie has many scenes already in dark and the 3D glasses make them look even less bright. Watch it in 3D only if you have to,but I would recommend to watch in 2D. Harry, voldemort and severus are deservedly given ample screenspace,but other characters(even important ones)are felt to have only a cameo.Even Nagini has longer role.(SPOILER)The ron-hermione kiss is aptly placed.Severus Snape's character has finally been done justice with!The wand-fight scenes are not as abysmal as in 6th movie but also not the best in the franchise, They craved for some background score! Silence works Yates,but too much use of it takes out its intensity.(SPOILER) It was great to see Molly and McGonagall in action.It intensifies the importance of the whole fight.Couldn't even spot Kingsley,Lupin,Fred-George,Arthur,Tonks . Neville is perfect! Excellent performances by Ralph Fiennes,Dan, Watson and Alan Rickman.<br/><br/>(SPOILER)The movie has excellent flow until harry's death scene.It rises expectations very high,feels epic till then .But the later part does not live upto expectations. I don't fathom what was the hurry to start wrapping it up so quickly.Bad Editing! (SPOILER)The only admirable part in the last half hour is the king's cross station scene .That will help up the rating for sure.(SPOILER)The deserved ado about Elder wand snaps as Harry is shown to break it like a twig.Hurtful for the book fans! The much fussed epilogue scene is good,but again felt wapped up.Ron really looks like a 36 yr old.The goodbye didn't go into the heart. The Cinematography is good.Few innovative camera angles. Art direction also deserves praise.The backdrop keeps you always in a HarryPotter mood,nicely achieved. All in all a very good movie,action packed,emotional roller-coaster,musst watch for Potter fans,and others too. A movie to clap for sure, not to stand though.A little more background score, little less meddling with story and 1/2 hour more would have given the movie one more star."
"mad_mandonna","9","2","5","14 July 2011"," Harry Potter concludes. It will take your breath away...
","The final instalment is epic, beautiful, heart wrenching, funny, jaw dropping and enthralling. Part 1 sets the scene perfectly for the final instalment and the action comes in thick and fast. The final hour is an adrenaline rush of another kind, similar to that of Lord Of the Rings or even Return Of The Jedi every heart pounding second is deliciously played out to optimum effect and the special effects are (to put it lightly) incredible.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter films in general are always a joy to watch, and this one is no different. Its soul purpose is to entertain its audience and boy does it work. Scenes featuring Britains finest actors are among the most enjoyable, Helena Bonham Carter is scrumptiously evil as Bellatrix Lestrange, and another side of her is shown to fantastic comedy value. Maggie Smith was always able to steal the show even when only in the film for mere seconds, here she demonstrates just how good she really is and her scenes are some of the most enjoyable in the entire film. And Ralph Fiennes' Lord Voldermort is a joy to watch, and gives the character an almost down-to-earth characteristic that makes him all the more threatening and to a lesser extent even sympathetic.<br/><br/>The core core three Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are no longer playing around in this one. Radcliffe's progression as an actor has been slow, but ultimately very good. I was worried in the fourth film when I truly believed Radcliffe could ruin the rest of the series, but by film five he got back on track and managed to hold his own against Watson and Grint who certainly have a more natural knack for acting. His Harry Potter really is fantastic by this last instalment, he gives the character a warmth and humanity that he missed at times in previous films.<br/><br/>All the characters in the film cement there lasting relationships in this last film, and though some rather beneficial and important moments are only scanned over, this is minor grievance as virtually nothing of significant importance is left out of the film from the book.<br/><br/>Harry Potter has been with me since child hood all the way to adulthood and the films have continued the magic that JK Rowling first bought to my imagination with the Philosophers (Sorcerers) Stone. Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows part 2 is a fitting ending and the best in the series. And though I was never a fan of the epilogue from the book, even I struggled to hold back the tears as I bid goodbye to my childhood and my favourite fantasy saga."
"erichey23","1","4","15","12 July 2012"," Rowling is a death eater, supporter of Lord Voldemort by allowing Slytherin to remain active at Hogwarts.
","Rowling ends both the book and the movie in an appalling manner! By allowing the vanquished Slytherin house with it's evil Snake crest to remain active at Hogwarts at tne end of the second Wizarding World War. Moreover, she didn't close down the death-eater's portraits which she breathed immortal life into. In the books Rowling created, the portraits themselves are sentient; able to speak as if still alive. They are also portals to other portraits and have every means available to them to re-group, re-organize and start another literary world war. Beatrix Lestrange for instance, would surely enjoy training a pack of new slytherins with her dark magic and cruel intent, with only one aim. To destroy the world of good magic, and to take over the human world by force. <br/><br/>In symmetry to enhance my point: I have an example from Lord of the Rings I cite King Elrond of the Elves, in LOR trilogy, whom allowed the ring to go free at the end of the first war in Middle Earth. Because of this, the ring grew power again. Sauron regrouped with more force than before, and started the second world war. Elrond made a terrible, horrible blunder. He admitted it, worked to fix it, and author Tolkein ended the ultimate literary war of good and evil with the ring being thrown into the fire. It resulted in a victory for the peaceful citizens.<br/><br/>Collectively the group of Death-eaters were a bunch of mass murderers who tortured their victims before killing them. The Death-eaters world domination attempts resembles another vicious group of war mongers, infamous for hurting victims and then executing them. I'm talking about the Nazi's and I'm equating the Nazi's to the death-eaters, and Hitler to Lord Voldemort. Both wanted pure-blood races to dominate, and neither cared about the cost to cultural diversity or considered the value of human life. <br/><br/>However, the Nazi's at the end of WW2 were vanquished of their power symbols. The swastikas were removed and destroyed. They went bankrupt . To associate with this group is to integrate into a hatred that is repugnant to everyone. <br/><br/>SO why did ROwling leave the Swastika (the snake of Satan) on the house crest, leave the Death Eater portraits at the school,and why did she kill Dumbledore who was a GOd FIgure of reason whom would have likely removed Slytherin house as vanquished and replaced with a new house that is more progressive. He also would have ended the war with no trace of a chance that a new world order of Slytherins could prevail. Ever again. A good author does this for the readers. Closes shop on the evil.<br/><br/>Instead, by allowing the Slytherins to remain powerful--she invites another mass scale War, and on loopback. With the portrait system of the Dark Lord's most loyal supporters, helping now-- the next Hitler to destroy more children like the Creevy's or Hero's like Cedric Diggory and Professor Snape."
"N_A_Meless","9","2","6","14 July 2011"," Good ending, Fantastic Franchise
","I was looking forward to see this movie (like many people) so i watched it at the first day. Deathly Hallows part 2 is one of my favorite Harry Potter films. I was blown away by the effect and of course the atmosphere of the movie. Part 1 had me feeling like it was building a momentum for a great ending, however i still had the feeling while watching part 2. It was as if something great was yet to come, but sadly it didn't really come. Example: There weren't any great big fights (like the showdown between Voldemort and Dumbledore in Order Of The Phoenix) and the usage of spells was pretty much the same as in all the hp movies (with some exceptions). But the thing that bothers me the most was the ending, it felt as if the last couple of minutes were just something that had to be done, after the moment we all have bee waiting for(between Harry and Voldemort)it felt as if the rest was just a necessity of a couple of minutes. for example: there wasn't much talking between the characters/ no praising harry or anything. and there was hardly any respect for the fallen ""soldiers"". Generally speaking this doesn't mean that it lets u down, however one can not help but feel a little bit of disappointment after reading the book. But I have to say that the reason for this is most likely the duration of the film, the book is just far the detailed to show everything in the movie.<br/><br/>But there were also a lot of great things about the movie. Like early mentioned the special effects, The acting, and i think Rickman (Severus Snape) did perhaps the best job. Having seen the true colors of Snape, with pretty much confidence i can say that he is one of the true heroes of the series, and grew out to be one of the peoples favorites as well. Pretty much all the questions are answered (no plot holes) , and of course the Harry Potter feeling.<br/><br/>Despite my stern review I have to say that this is a MUST watch movie that cannot be missed."
"khadia-11951","9","1","2","10 February 2020"," How to this inspired me...
","When trying on the Sorting hat in The Philosopher's Stone, the Sorting hat suggests that it thinks Harry could do well in Slytherin. But he asks to be not sorted into Slytherin. In the end, the Sorting hat heeds his choice and places him in Gryffindor. Later on, in The Chamber of Secrets, when everyone thinks that Harry is the heir of Slytherin, he recounts the Sorting hat story to Dumbledore. And Dumbledore tells him, ""It is not our abilities that make us who we are, it is our choices.""
We often let our abilities and our position in society dictate who we are rather than make those choices ourselves. Becoming a billionaire is not about having a billion dollars, but about becoming the kind of person to make a billion dollars.
We need to make the right choices, and we will make the right choices when the choices are aligned with our values.
We can either let the world sort us and mould us based on the abilities and attitudes that we have, or we can make our choices and turn into the kind of people that need to make those choices come true."

"zkonedog","9","1","2","6 March 2017"," A Spectacular Rendering Of The Source Material
","The ending of J.K. Rowling's ""Deathly Hallows"" novel is a wonderful way to bring to close such an epic series of this order. In this film, director David Yates manages to translate all of those same emotions to the big screen to really re-create the magic of Rowling's pen into visual form.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Deathly Hallows 2"" produces the endgame of Voldemort's (Ralph Fiennes) plan to rule the wizarding world. While Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermoine (Emma Watson) close in on the last Horcruxes, the students and teachers of Hogwarts must defend their territory in the face of constant Death Eater assault. As the final battle for the school rages, Harry (as is his destiny, made even clearer by a pensieve trip into the memories of Severus Snape (Alan Rickman)), must face Voldemort alone to decide their fate.<br/><br/>Like ""Deathly Hallows 1"", this movie is allowed enough time to focus on the details of the story without it feeling rushed or excising parts altogether. In Rowling's ""Potter Endgame"", pretty much every page has some sort of meaning, and this film is able to explore those events/emotions with the care they deserve.<br/><br/>It also helps that ""DH 2"" showcases some of the best acting of the entire series. The lead trio have perfected their roles by this point, and the auxiliary cast is now so large and deep that every interaction seems like a true happening.<br/><br/>Overall, this big-screen finale to the Harry Potter franchise is exactly what you would want in a based-on-the-novel scenario: it stays true to the source material while at the same time translating it into visual drama instead of imagined or ""thought"" drama."
"ThomasDrufke","10","1","2","19 November 2016"," The Ultimate Sacrifice
","To me, the perfect conclusion to a franchise ties up everything that was promised while leaving the audience with an emotionally satisfying ending that leaves the door open for something later. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 checked off just about everything I could have asked for.<br/><br/>We begin part 2 still in search of the Horcruxes as well as finding Voldemort's army at its strongest. I think what's most impressive about this particular installment is that it manages to pull off the ""all pay-off"" type of story that most part 2's have struggled with. Both, The Hunger Games and Hobbit series' have had a rough time closing out their series' with a film that feels whole in itself. Sure, you can't really have the full experience without at least watching Part 1, but there's no part of me that thinks this story could have been pulled off in one film.<br/><br/>Even with all of the cameos and reappearances of beloved characters, there's plenty of new ones as well. Ciaran Hinds' Abeforth Dumbledore for one, Helena Ravenclaw, a nearly-blind Dragon from Gringott's, and oh yeah those kids at the end. J.K. Rowling has a knack for giving everyone a chance to shine, and there's no difference in Part 2. Seriously, I never would have thought Neville would be the one to kill Voldemort's snake, Nagini, but that's why it was so brilliant.<br/><br/>This is also the film in which all was revealed about Snape and his allegiance to Harry after all. The first time I watched this entire sequence, it absolutely broke me. To watch a guy so hopelessly in love with someone he can never have, and then look after her son even though he despises the very presence of him, is so beautiful and tragic at the same time. It's something only the likes of J.K. Rowling could handle with such grace.<br/><br/>Harry himself goes through perhaps his biggest character arc since the middle of the franchise as he's forced to come to grips with the fact that he is the 7th horcrux after all. Even though we ultimately knew he was going to have that showdown with Voldemort at Hogwarts, but his goodbyes to Ron and Hermione, and ultimately his discussion with The Order in the Forest, were some of the most touching scenes the franchise has given us. This also gave us one final scene with Michael Gambon as Dumbledore's spirit, so to speak. Of course, I'm a bigger fan of Richard Harris' work as the great wizard, but Gambon's spin on the character definitely grew on me. Especially when watching them all back to back.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is epic in scale and emotion. Even if you know when certain things are going to happen, they are written and presented in a way that's undeniably satisfying. I know some think the ""19 years later"" scene is hokey, but for me it's the perfect culmination of everything that the series has brought thus far. Harry finally got to experience King's Cross Station with his family, and he honored Snape and Dumbledore with his son's name. It's just perfect. After re-watching the 8 films within days of each other, I can say that this without a doubt in the top 5 of my favorite film franchises of all time. And The Deathly Hallows ended it with a bang.<br/><br/>+Everyone gets a chance to shine<br/><br/>+Battle for Hogwarts<br/><br/>+Snape reveals<br/><br/>+The ultimate sacrifice<br/><br/>+19 Years Later<br/><br/>10/10"
"mistoppi","2","1","2","4 November 2016"," This is so bad
","This movie is bulls**t! <br/><br/>There is so many useless scenes and they make me angry! They decided to make two movies out of one book, they cut many scenes out and then come up with scenes that don't exist and make no sense. I'd ask, but I know why: money. Two movies make more money than one. The people behind these films don't care about story telling they do this thinking about dollar signs - or pound signs, since it's a British film.<br/><br/>The original novel is so sad. There are so many significant deaths of characters you never feared would die. And in the movie those scenes are butchered. You briefly see someone dying - or you don't even see them dying, they just are dead all of a sudden. It's a lousy way to do this, because the emotional response from the audience isn't as great as when reading the novel. <br/><br/>First part had the tale of three brothers that was so beautiful and amazing. The second part has nothing beautiful. Everything is million times faster and all the important pieces of information are lost. It's annoying!<br/><br/>I don't know if I can express my anger and frustration towards the series any better. Everything is wrong, and there are so many weird and awkward scenes that just don't go with the original story. The only thing that brings life to this movie is the cast, but many actors and actresses are now seen for maybe five minutes and that's it. They should've given more thought to how this movie is going to go down. Agh!"

"muvi-fan-73","9","1","2","1 April 2016"," Final installment: dark and extremely successful in catching nerves.
","There are so many movies we like, but time is always the main constraint. It matters when we have seen the movie. Harry Potter is a series that we have grown with. I remember, I never read those books. I remember how I have waited about an entire year till summer, when the movies were to be first premiered on TV channels in India. Sometimes 2 sometimes 3 and finally 4 were amongst the movies that I got to watch at the weekends.<br/><br/>A great salute to J.K Rowling to have come with such a series. She is the most deserving candidate for all the praise associated with Harry Potter. The elements that have been included in the movies are simply unparallel. She thought of everything and put all of them in line with tremendous creativity. To pick any one of them as your best one is very much difficult.<br/><br/>When the cast of the movies were selected, it was not known how they would grow up in. It might be so that some of them grow up different than writer's imagination. Also not everybody including me is fan of reading books. It was good to see the movies. However not everything was included. An extremely graphical and animated version of TV series which includes everything would be a dream coming true.<br/><br/>The final 3 movies were something where adult world comes into existence. To be frank they were different and again I would praise the writer that handles it so well. I remember my youngest sister saying she doesn't get those movies. However I like the act of Heroism. The character in which Snape's true nature is known and the wand logic via which Voldemort is defeated are tremendous. Just a wish, I wanted last two parts to be single movie, its one of the main reasons why none of them score a ten."
"cowmanviolin","8","1","2","29 January 2016"," Captured the surface, but not the depth.
","I don't want this to be a giant review and I'll try and keep it as short as possible.<br/><br/>I consider the books as perfection. They are beautiful on so many levels and there are NO plot holes whatsoever. Everything is wrapped up perfectly and satisfyingly.<br/><br/>I loved most of this movie for its ability to capture the stakes of what everybody was fighting for, the human qualities of most of the characters, and the epic grandeur of this finale. The battle was magnificent and I sat in awe as the set you got to know and love got blown to bits before your eyes. My personal favorite part is when Harry goes to face Voldemort and he sees the visions of his family before he has to die. It was sweet and brought the significance of his sacrifice full circle.<br/><br/>Not to mention the visual effects and soundtrack were brilliant.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that's the only piece of genius the story the books have that's translated to the screen. There are a bunch of small things that are left out that didn't bug me that much but the big things were really upsetting. The Deathly Hallows being totally forgotten, the rushed reveal of Snape's amazing character, Teddy Lupin/Percy, and questioning Dumbledore's ""moral"" memory.<br/><br/>The significance of the invisibility cloak is left out and the whole idea of being the ""master of death"" is forgotten. This is so egregious because it's the name of the damn movie!!! Check out the theory of Dumbledore being Death from the tale of the three brothers and you'll understand why this plot point is just so beautiful (Connecting the story being told to a mystical and legendary back story).<br/><br/>""The Prince's Tale"" is a perfect chapter and it's done well, but you don't really get to see Young Snape develop his connection with Lily and though it's conveyed well towards the end of the scene, it misses the tragedy and real believability of the books.<br/><br/>Teddy Lupin isn't huge but it expands Harry's importance and the bond between him and Lupin, making the loss of Lupin and Tonks so much more significant. Then Percy coming back at the last moment and rejoining his family right before Fred is killed makes Fred's death that much more necessary. Fred died because the fact that the second the Weasley's are whole again they are ripped apart is just too heartbreaking to leave out (which they did). It adds so much to the Weasley's characters and I remember it as one of the most important parts of the book.<br/><br/>Lastly, Dumbledore is always regarded as a saint and undeniably ""good"". The last book makes us question that and we realize that even the most resolute characters can have some darkness, but more importantly that that's okay. You can still be as amazing and beautiful as Dumbledore was even with that history.<br/><br/>Of course, there are tons of things that were left out, such as the use of the cruciatus curse on the Carrows, the absence of the Centaurs or Grawp, the LUDICROUS explosions of Voldemort and Bellatrix into dust, and the unnecessary dragging out of ""The Flaw in the Plan"" chapter in order to squeeze in extra action.<br/><br/>All in all, the finale of this series in the books includes tons of satisfying action and conflict, but it focuses more on explaining why Harry is going to come out on top and showing how darkness cannot possibly defeat all the goodness in the world. The movies are breathtaking to watch but sort of cop out with making it as suspenseful and drawn out as possible which is the main reason why I didn't love the ending.<br/><br/>Sorry this was so long. I tried.<br/><br/>P.S. What freaking wand does Harry have now? Not Draco's, not his own Phoenix feather, and certainly not the Elder Wand."
"emonaghan-64172","10","1","2","31 October 2015"," Excellent movie, excellent book, but still two separate things
","The problem with film adaptations of books is that most of the time, they are not judged as movies but instead as how closely they relate to the original story. When I first saw this movie, I will say that I was dismayed with the portrayal of some of the deaths in the movie, along with the entire Albus/Aberforth story line. I have since accepted, however, that those were not critical to the main messages of the book, and SOMETHING had to be cut out if they wanted a coherent movie that wasn't 10 hours long. <br/><br/>So, instead of spending my time saying that the directors should've included this and that from the book, I will instead look at it as its own separate entity.<br/><br/>This movie is truly a masterpiece - the tone of the movie is excellent, the acting is phenomenal (especially if you compare it to the first Harry Potter movie), and the visuals are stunning. This movie will forever be one of my favorites because it can make you laugh, and cry, and feel the full weight of the era of Harry Potter ending. I truly believe these movies will live on forever, and I will certainly show my kids and their kids the wonderful world of Harry Potter."

The film does feel very light-hearted, even though it is dark in a few areas throughout.<br/><br/>The plot follows the last half of the book and the book was translated well for this film and credit is given to Steve Kloves. The direction is amazing and David Yates also gets a lot of credit and I thought this film should have won an Academy Award for Best Picture, but did not.<br/><br/>The music by Alexandre Desplat is really amazing and it does have themes from the other films, composed by John Williams and Nicholas Hooper and it is a spectacular musical score. The special effects are incredible and amazing this time around and the production design is really cool.<br/><br/>The special effects and battle sequences are just a joy to watch and no wonder that this film was released in IMAX 3D and I thought it was enjoyable to see the final fight between Voldemort and Harry. I think the main thing that was in the trailer that should have been kept in is when Voldemort chokes Harry and asks him, ""Why do you live?"" and Harry responds, ""Because I have something worth living for?"".<br/><br/>The ending is set 19 years later and it is just sad as the ending to THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING, which was also good to. It is just fantastic and I hope the new Harry Potter films are better and amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a great conclusion to the eight film franchise. 10/10."
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","2","5 September 2015"," The expected end.
","This film is the adaptation of the second half of the seventh and final book in the Harry Potter's saga, written by J.K. Rowling and directed by David Yates. This film is the end of a franchise that lasted more than seven years and earned billions. Yates excellently fulfilled its role but seems to have been a bit dazzled by the special effects. Certainly they have done a great service to the film, but it seems that, in the midst of so many effects and phenomenal camera angles, the script was a bit put away, eventually detaches from reporting the original book. One of the most surprising and unfortunate facts of this film is the radical change in the appearance of some parts of the castle, as its main entrance (which originally wasn't near the Great Hall) and the appearance of the stairs. Throughout the saga and all the books, the castle stairs had the same appearance and the ability to change position, which sometimes took the students to places where they wouldn't (or couldn't) go but, in this film, those so-known stairs gave way to some others, completely different, wider and imposing but that have nothing to do with descriptions of the castle in the books.<br/><br/>Despite these negative details, the film is excellent. It's a real thriller in certain passages and has the gift of having the entire cast to give their maximum and achieving levels of interpretative excellence, giving to their characters an enormous depth, a human size, often fallible and imperfect. The final, moreover, it's surprising and absolutely breathtaking, as were also the last chapters of the book."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 (2011): Dir: David Yates / Cast: Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman: The final film in this wonderfully enchanting series of films and this time the youth wizard Harry Potter must face and vanquish the evil Lord Voldemort for good. All three principal actors have grown much in the ten years of films. Daniel Radcliffe as Potter faces severe facts that could be fatal. In fact, a major plus here is how Potter is placed in a battle situation where he appears to have lost. Emma Watson as Hermione and Rupert Grint as Ron have been Potter's friends and companions through every film and thankfully the film ties off their romantic feelings without stooping to Twilight level. Then we have Ralph Finnes as Voldemort, one of the most evil presence in films. There is no remorse. He will destroy even his own in order to conquer. The secret involve the wand he possesses is another highlight revelation. Voldemort is historically the murderer of Harry's parents. Now they clash wands in what will appear as if Voldemort will dominate. When he utters a victorious laugh, he doesn't realize that he hasn't thought of everything. Alan Rickman has played Professor Snape in all of the films but here he is at his best, particularly when certain facts surface. David Yates returns as director after having made The Deathly Hallows, Part 1, as well as entries The Order of the Phoenix and The Half-Blood Prince. These films were always pointless entertainment but with such enchanting visuals, it concludes with as much magic as it begun. Score: 7 / 10"
"joshuadrake-39480","10","1","2","18 May 2015"," Brilliant conclusion to the series!
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is the final and eighth chapter of the worldwide phenomenon of the HARRY POTTER film series.<br/><br/>With a lot of big special effects, acting, story, direction, an impressive musical score, battles and an emotional ending, this film does not disappoint at all. The film does feel very light-hearted, even though it is dark in a few areas throughout.<br/><br/>The plot follows the last half of the book and the book was translated well for this film and credit is given to Steve Kloves. The direction is amazing and David Yates also gets a lot of credit and I thought this film should have won an Academy Award for Best Picture, but did not.<br/><br/>The music by Alexandre Desplat is really amazing and it does have themes from the other films, composed by John Williams and Nicholas Hooper and it is a spectacular musical score. The special effects are incredible and amazing this time around and the production design is really cool.<br/><br/>The special effects and battle sequences are just a joy to watch and no wonder that this film was released in IMAX 3D and I thought it was enjoyable to see the final fight between Voldemort and Harry. I think the main thing that was in the trailer that should have been kept in is when Voldemort chokes Harry and asks him, ""Why do you live?"" and Harry responds, ""Because I have something worth living for?"".<br/><br/>The ending is set 19 years later and it is just sad as the ending to THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING, which was also good to. It is just fantastic and I hope the new Harry Potter films are better and amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, this film is a great conclusion to the eight film franchise. 10/10."
"msloane1","10","1","2","25 April 2015"," Harry Potter's Emotional Finale.
","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the best movie in the Harry Potter series. More than anything, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 packs an intense emotional punch. The scenes involving Snape's memories, Harry's experience with the Resserctuction Stone in the forest, and Harry ultimately going to face his ""death"" are all very poignant and moving. Deathly Hallows part 2 is mostly faithful to the book with one major exception and it's a good exception. The biggest difference is that in the book Harry returns the Elder Wand to Dumbledore's grave. In the movie Harry's snaps the Elder Wand in half and throws the pieces into the lake. I like the movie's way of handling the Elder Wand's fate much better than the book's because it makes it absolute 100% sure it really is the end of the line. Not much to talk about casting wise as we've seen them all before expect the children of the epilogue. Daniel and Emma remain fantastic in the lead roles as do Allan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes in key roles of Voldemort and Snape. And of course both the character of Luna Lovegood and her actress Evanna Lynch remain huge personal favorites of mine. The pacing is excellent. It's about a 2 hour movie and never has a slow moment. The music is different to match the emotional nature of the story and it fits well. And definitely loved hearing Leaving Hogwarts return at the end of the epilogue. That was awesome. The story is well presented. Great emotional finale. Faithfulness to the book: 8 out of 10. Pacing: 10 out of 10. Music: 10 out of 10. Casting/acting: 10 out of 10. Special effects/visuals: 10 out of 10."

","Harry Potter was amazing history in our lives and with this chapter it is ending.I'm so glad that they split that last book into two movies. There's no way they could have told this story effectively in one film. This final Potter movie was both awe inspiring and emotionally draining. It really affected me in a way I've never been affected like in a movie before. I might as well admit it hear and now, this movie hammered on my emotional cords and I got chocked up and on the verge of tears, I was barely able to hold them back, but it didn't sound like the audience was able to, the person next to me was bawling her eyes out. The reason this movie affected me differently was because not only did a just get chocked up, but I was on the verge of breaking down through about 85% of the freaking' movie, which is ridiculous! I've never experienced that before. I wanted to cry through the whole movie!As a lifelong fan of the series, watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is what I imagine it would be like watching your kids graduate from high school: your heart swells, your eyes get a little misty, but more than anything else, you're left feeling satisfied in the presence of a huge milestone."

","Well wasn't really shocked, I expected it to be bad even though it was worse than I could possibly guess. It's a beautiful book that we all loved, it's hard to watch an adaptation that almost literally ***** on it. The most enjoyable part of the movie is probably the CGI, that's how bad it was. So here is a list of the worst things that can be found in this movie (in all honesty I'm only speaking of the very worst):<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT<br/><br/>Protego suddenly can stop the Avada Kedavra. Fred scene where he dies isn't shown, name wasn't even specified. Percy pops out of nowhere. Voldemort and Harry's idea of a battle is hugging and kicking each other because you know they are wizards. Voldemort personally cuts Severus's throat because he likes cutting throats. Severus's throat is cut but he takes his time to say more than in the book, I must insist the beauty in the book was the ""look.. at.. me.."" PERIOD Hermione had a flask in her bag, that she carries even in war, just in case Severus' memories were mere tears. Harry's eyes aren't even green (or slightly). Lily and Severus are best friends and suddenly she is married to James. Albus Dumbledore absolutely no back story. Aberforth seems to be as good of a wizard as Albus was even though he quit school and is supposedly not even able to read (he had one of the strongest Patronus charms in the series..) Hermione and Ron try kill Nagini by throwing stones at it Everyone can fly even though Voldemort was suppose to be the only character to be able to Harry tells Ron and Hermione what he saw in the Pensieve The Ravenclaw common room wasn't shown, Harry doesn't defend Minerva, suddenly the whole order is in the castle and Severus and Minerva fight.. Minerva jokingly says that she always wanted to use that spell (was suppose to be an epic scene) The diadem is broken with the basilisk fang not Fiendfyre not even mentioned A bridge scene with explosives, Hagrid wasn't shown when he was taken and suddenly he is at Voldemort's side The Elder Wand splits (Why? Please, why?) Hagrid stops screaming because he was asked to. Harry suddenly understands that he isn't dead even though he didn't even ask the question Reference to the fourth book where Dumbledore had a gleam of triumph in his eyes, one of the most interesting twisted plots in the whole book,the fact that Voldemort had some of Harry's blood in him, not mentioned. Harry was suppose to be angry at Dumbledore, because he didn't trust him, because he made it so hard for him, not mentioned. Since it isn't specified we can think that a disarming spell killed Voldemort The elder wand is broken and thrown, Harry's wand isn't repaired Harry doesn't speak to Dumbledore's portrait. The ending, is so bad, it's just as bad as it gets."

","When I watched this film for the first time, my expectations were actually very low, since I knew what they've done to the books in film six and seven. You have to know that I'm always quite finicky about the correct transcription of literary material into films. But compared to the former Harry-Potter-Films, this one is quite close to the book on which the film was based (comparatively).<br/><br/>All in all this last film is fairly good. It is thrilling, the effects are great, the book was not completely shredded. So even if you don't like adaptations, this one is quite viewable.<br/><br/>I hope there are not too many mistakes in my text. If there are, I'm sorry, but I'm no native speaker."

","I enjoyed it because I enjoy Harry Potter, but overall the last book was lame and the movie was even lamer. When I re-watch the series I usually skip Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>I may be alone in this, but it would have been awesome if J.K. Rowling had the guts to kill off a main character. I was kind of hoping Ron would die. Not that I have anything against Ron, I just thought he'd be an excellent choice. And the epilogue is so unnecessary. I hoped the film wouldn't include it. They lived happily ever after. We get it. I think if we can imagine magical creatures and a school in the sky that teaches witchcraft, we certainly can imagine how their happy ended would go."
"iseeeliteinthesky","10","1","2","1 November 2013"," This movie had the chance to become an epic 10 movie.
","I first gave this movie a 8 or so, but i have revised it to a 10. Most likely because almost all other movies i have watched recent years are crap.<br/><br/>Not many movies get even the slightest chance go get epic. But this movie had the chance, however this chance got spoiled it and it didn't get epic, rather just very good/great.<br/><br/>Nevertheless some scenes are very good, but the movie seems wrongly compiled.<br/><br/>The absolutely best part of this move is played by Servus Snape / Alan Rickman. He is outstanding in the whole saga but in this he is truly masterful. His role-play is totally and utterly brilliant when Potter finds out the memories.<br/><br/>How could the movie be redone so it would be utterly epic? Well not follow the book would unfortunately be required. It actually just comes down to some cutting and replacing scenes. Not many changes to the actual move except some last dramatic scene when Harry truly dies.<br/><br/>Remake to make last harry potter truly epic: First = The hunt for the horrocrux, thats fine as it is.<br/><br/>Second = Invasion of Hogwarts, also fine as it is.<br/><br/>Third = Vast action scenes where Voldemort and Potter battle, but it ends in a tie. Voldemort realizes its a tie and that he has to kill Snipe to to get the wand. Snipe dies.<br/><br/>Fourth = Potter extracts and reviews Snipes memories, where Dumbledore explains that Harry Potter is destined to die. Servus Snipe is Harry Potters real father but rejects a relation to Harry on the basis of the knowledge of the future, and not to compromise his status as double agent, which pains him utterly.<br/><br/>Fifth = Harrys suffering takes him into the forest and is killed by Voldemort, where Voldemort dies and Harry as well(!)<br/><br/>Sixth = Future scenes, about the same as present, without Harry Potter, where all remember Harry Potter for his great deeds."
"Horst_In_Translation","6","1","2","26 October 2013"," A great end to the franchise, a good film on its own
","When I watched all Harry Potter films for the first time earlier this year within a short period of time, I really loved the very last entry to the series. Most recently, I rewatched just the last film and the experience was not as great, but still made an entertaining two hours. So let me recommend you to always watch at least ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" before going for the final installment. But whatever you do, you're still in for an exciting conclusion to the biggest film franchise of the 2000s and that comes from somebody who isn't even that big of a Potter fan. While the three young actors are okay as always, although I still struggle to see Radcliffe's Potter as the force he is supposed to be and Watson had more material and a better performance in previous work, it's nice to see some of the supporting players have great spectacular scenes as well before it all closes: Julie Walters on Helena Bonham Carter, Maggie Smith on Alan Rickman and Rickman himself in his final scene, who was probably my favorite performance here and I really loved how it all unfolded for Severus. The way we find out more about his background was done impressively, especially the flashbacks to his childhood and they really hit me on an emotional level. That certainly made up for the first half hour, where the film admittedly needs a while to really get going. The final scene 19 years later was really beautiful too, particularly the name reference (which made me ignore the fact that the trio doesn't really look 20 years older), and even if it probably guarantees there will be no more Potter films in the future, it was such a nice inclusion and there was something beautifully final about it.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is as impressive as the previous one. Great costumes, art direction and special effects, especially the massive statues coming to live and I only watched it on the big screen in my living room. In the theater, it will certainly be even more breathtaking. Recommended."

","Knowing in advance both how the story goes (and with J K Rowling on board as a co- producer, that it wasn't going to be changed much) and naturally how it ends, it was incumbent on Peter Yates to nonetheless deliver the big finish to Harry's adventures and in particular his final showdown with Voldemort. I wasn't disappointed and in the end had only minor quibbles about the resolution.<br/><br/>The dark atmosphere from Part 1 is continued with the action mostly played out in scenes of brooding darkness and to the background of weighty soundtrack music. There is noticeably less of Hermione and Ron, which is only right given the necessary one-on-one fight with Voldemort at the conclusion. While that duel, with shades of Holmes and Moriarty, was always going to be the climax here, I enjoyed the build-up to it, with the escape from Gringotts, Snape's revelatory Pensieve memories, Harry's supernatural interviews with Rowena Ravenclaw (and Dumbledore), plus of course the blowing-up of Hogwarts all contributing to the excitement and anticipation.<br/><br/>Rowling herself has stated that from the first, she had a clear vision of Harry and Voldemort's final reckoning with both of them circling each other in a blasted landscape and this was exactly what was delivered. I did however feel confused if not cheated as to how the Elder wand reverted to Harry, when all along Voldemort had made such a strong claim for it, but still the Evil Lord's demise was spectacularly satisfying when it came.<br/><br/>My only other carps were the pointless inclusion of the 19-years-on epilogue, which added nothing and detracted from the high point achieved with the death of Voldemort (I know it's in the book, but it told us nothing important - as if we didn't know they were all going to live happily ever), the abbreviated round-up afforded different characters from previous episodes, especially Hagrid, the Weasley parents and Jim Broadbent's character, plus it can't be denied that the three main characters by now seem too a little old for their parts (although it's not their fault that the time needed to create such large-scale movies by- passed their characters' natural time-lines) and my old caveat that too many of the supporting parts were played by too-familiar faces from British acting royalty (it's a wonder Judi Dench didn't get a look in).<br/><br/>But in the whole this was fantastic entertainment and a worthy finish to the saga, which I hope they don't spoil by rebooting sometime in the future."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a fantasy film directed by David Yates and the second of two cinematic parts that form the screen adaptation of the novel by J. K. Rowling. It is the eighth and final installment in the Harry Potter film series, written by Steve Kloves and produced by David Heyman, David Barron, and Rowling. The story continues to follow Harry Potter's quest to find and destroy Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes. The film features Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, alongside Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Harry's best friends, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.<br/><br/>In the epic finale, the battle between the good and evil forces of the wizard world escalates into an all-out war. The stakes have never been higher and no one is safe. But it is Harry Potter who may be called upon to make the ultimate sacrifice as he draws closer to the climactic showdown with Lord Voldemort. It all ends here.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the film all Harry Potter fans have waited 10 years to see, and the good news is that it's worth the hype that is visually stunning, action packed, faithful to the book, and mature not just in its themes and emotion but in the acting by its cast, some of whom had spent half their lives making Harry Potter movies.Also,it is a wonderfully rich adaptation of the final book's last act, but the central focus on the three leads might leave some fans disappointed, especially those seeking a more thorough adaptation.But nevertheless,it was thrilling, powerfully acted, and visually dazzling, Deathly Hallows Part II brings the Harry Potter franchise to a satisfying conclusion."
"bethany-lewis","10","1","2","31 August 2012"," Full of excitement, wonderful movie!
","A must-see end to the series of the magical Harry Potter world. I recommend it to all ages, all genders and all expectations. This grand finale starts off where part 1 of Deathly Hallows finished, with Harry crouching besides Dobby's grave. It is showing how the good is weak and evil are getting stronger, but Harry, Ron and Hermione are determined to hunt down the remaining horcruxes. After a heart-stopping trip to the bank, the threesome go to Hogwarts for the final battle. Many innocent lives are taken, with some main characters getting killed. Daniel Radcliffe and Rupert Grint make an excellent job portraying their life-long characters, and though it's Emma's best film, she still lacks the chirisma from my point of view. The movie ends really well, but I'd have liked more of a bang at the end so the viewer could have been left wondering what was going to happen next."
"parallel_projection","9","1","2","26 August 2012"," Spectacular end to the franchise!
","So, yes, this movie does waver from the book, and yes, they did get a bunch of things wrong, and yes, many parts of it could've been better, however, everything else was so incredible all this mistakes are soon overlooked. This movie is simply epic, and while the spaces for the most part are confined, it is on a grand scale. Unlike the last movie, by like all the others previous, most of the action takes place at Hogwarts, which for some reason they changed the architecture to. I don't get why they did that, but the sets are still amazing, especially Gringotts, which was much darker this time, the sequence on the bridge, which I thought was a good addition, and all of the destroyed courtyards. <br/><br/>David Yates does a good job at capturing all the emotion that goes into a battle like this. Most people just relate war with action and violence, but it's also extremely emotional, something that J. K. Rowling did a great job at portraying, and something that Yates carried through with the movie. However (only a spoiler if for some reason your haven't read the book or seen the movie yet), with the exception of Snape's, he sweeps through all the death scene rather quickly, sometimes giving character only mere seconds of screen time. The hardship and loss still definitely gets across, but it could've made more of an impact if more time was spent on it.<br/><br/>Speaking about Snape, I think Snape's memories is one of the greatest sequences ever filmed in cinematic history. I'm not joking--they couldn't fit all of it in there, and they added some stuff for the movie's purposes, but it is just so powerful, it's impossible not to feel affected by it. It is a spectacularly and masterfully done montage with many different layers and footage from almost all the film, which really brings back some great memories. It was definitely the closest I've ever come to shedding a tear in a movie theater, and trust me, that doesn't happen. Alan Rickman also does in absolutely breathtaking final portrayal of Severus Snape-- if the Academy wasn't so afraid of Harry Potter movies, and fantasy in general, he would've gotten an Oscar nomination, which definitely would've been deserved.<br/><br/>In fact, all the acting is top-notch, especially Ralph Fiennes, Maggie Smith, Jason Isaacs, Michael Gambon, Warwick Davis, and Julie Walters, as well as Helena Bonham Carter, John Hurt, Jim Broadbent, and Gary Oldman. The kids, too, although they're not really kids anymore, were all very good, namely Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint, who have really grown and turned into some fine young actors throughout the course of this series. Evanna Lynch, Matthew Lewis, Devon Murray, Tom Felton, Bonnie Wright, and Alfred Enoch also did great jobs.<br/><br/>Not everything was perfect, though. (Mild spoilers again, if somehow you don't know the plot.) The sequence with the Grey Lady was not at all like in the book--it didn't have the same feel to it, and she seemed angry instead of upset. They also changed how the ghosts look for the last movie, which I didn't like and thought was a little pointless. Also, towards the end, Voldemort sort of beats up Harry while Harry is taunting him, and Voldemort does some weird thing with his cloak and picks Harry up with it, and then they both jump off the bridge and fly around to their final battle. This whole sequence doesn't really fit in, and Harry never Voldemort the whole story behind the Elder Wand, but instead tells it to Hermione and Ron afterward, which I also didn't like. He then proceeds to dispose of it without fixing his own wand, which was broken in the previous movie, which was a terrible thing to leave out. <br/><br/>Looking past all the small errors, though, this movie is absolutely spectacular in every sense of the word, and it is accompanied by and equally-as-impressive score by Alexandre Despalt. Everything comes together in an incredible way, and, if you look past some of the minor deviations from the book and embrace some of the larger ones, you won't be disappointed."

I also liked how we got a sense of power voldemort has , as we see bellatrix who is a feared character so nervous around voldemort especially when she trys to help him up after he falls.<br/><br/>Overall I thought it was a very good film with plenty of action , although some parts could of been explained a little better , but still a really good movie!

Of the scenes that i loved the most included; 1. The Gringotts scene which I thought was very well shot and was built and directed in a very good format. 2. Mostly all the scenes at Hogwarts and the murder of Voldermart were very well written and directed. To be more specific the scenes in that which included a lot of thought and also included a lot of stlye which i enjoyed. <br/><br/>To give it a more overview i REALLY enjoyed this part of the the 8 part movie seiries and proves to be the the best on e out of all of them. The acting by Daniel Radcliff, Rupert Grint, Emma Waston, Ralph Finnes, and the entire cast was truly amazing. This shows how mature and experienced the actors are.

","An amazing and epic cinematic conclusion to the Harry Potter series. Of course, the books were far superior in every way but these last couple of movies really did do an amazing job capturing the meaning behind every scene which the earlier films couldn't quite do. The acting continued to improve in every film as did the development of the overall story arc and characters. I also felt like this was the best movie in terms of not needing to have read the books in order to fully engage in the story. Overall, I am very glad that I was able to complete the book series and films. This entire process has been an enjoyable one and that is the ultimate point of all mediums of entertainment, isn't it? To enjoy it? That's always been my belief and this story was absolutely captivating. I can't wait until the next time I can make it to Universal Studios to check out what I've heard is an amazing job at recreating the environment. Thank you J.K. Rowling for providing premium entertainment for my mind!"

"Smells_Like_Cheese","10","1","2","10 January 2012"," The Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","So this is it, one of the most beloved series of all time has come to a close. You know I was starting to wonder if summer blockbusters were just tired of having some kind of story, great acting and substance. Harry Potter changed all that, not to mention it was a breath of fresh air that kids wanted to read again. I did not read the books as Harry Potter wasn't the type of genre I would ever read but I did watch the movies to see what all the hype was about. I've always been very pleased with watching these movies, they're very satisfying, between the effects and the story and growing up with these actors, everything has just been great. The Deathly Hallows was split into two parts as it's a very long book and I'm sure they wanted to get in every detail for the fans. The last Harry Potter, while it was a good movie, it felt like it was a little boring at certain times for me. I haven't seen these films so close together and haven't read the books to know everything they are talking about so it was hard to keep up on certain parts. But this conclusion blew every one of the Harry Potter movies out of the water and had a great conclusion with a tear jerker ending.<br/><br/>As Lord Voldemort retrieves the Elder Wand from Albus Dumbledore's grave, Severus Snape has become Hogwarts headmaster. After burying Dobby, Harry Potter speaks with the goblin Griphook about breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting that a Horcrux may be hidden there. Griphook agrees to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to the vault in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Harry asks Ollivander, a wandmaker, to identify two wands they took from Malfoy Manor. Ollivander says they belonged to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry.In Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers that the Horcrux is Helga Hufflepuff's Cup. He retrieves the Cup, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by the alerted security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort killing goblins, including Griphook, and learns that the Dark Lord is aware of the theft. Harry also realizes there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts, in some way connected to Rowena Ravenclaw.<br/><br/>My best friend and her boyfriend saw this opening night and I had asked her were there a bunch of fans crying and she said there were and I just laughed thinking how silly it was. However I ate my own words when I got a little teared up at the ending. I could only imagine for the fans who really grew up with this series. The special effects are out of this world and the show down between Voldemort and Harry was great. My only small complaint being is that Voldemort didn't seem as much of a presence in the film or as much a threat, only being argued by that maybe he's feeling that Harry is getting stronger so maybe he's not as cocky as he used to be. Alan Rickman, Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe did the outstanding performances. It's not even a question of wither I recommend this movie or not, of course if you're fan you've seen this movie already. If you're the average viewer, I think this series is worth getting into. But it's a strange thing to say there will never be another Harry Potter sequel againbut who knows with Hollywood? I'm sure they're having fun in the bank right now wondering how they could bring back the movies.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Doylenf","8","1","2","6 December 2011"," A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series...
","HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS Part 2 moves forward where it left off with Dobby's death toward a stunning conclusion with the final violent confrontation between Harry and Lord Voldemort. The richly crafted characters bring a lot of warmth and humor between all of the tense situations, which makes the whole project such a delight to watch.<br/><br/>However satisfying the conclusion is, winding up the tale nineteen years later with a grown-up Potter and friends seeing their children off to Hogwart, I found some discomfort in the decision to play many key scenes in almost complete darkness. I repeat here what I said in my review of Part 1: ""Many of the 'dark' scenes are too dark for eye comfort, but then the whole story has a dark atmosphere of brooding and impending evil about to erupt."" Still, I think the contrast between light and dark was ""off"" once again in the DVD transfer and too many scenes are underlit and obscured by bad lighting techniques.<br/><br/>Having said that, the performances are all first-rate, with all of the British thespians doing fantastic jobs in both leading and pivotal roles. But the standout among all the players is Alan Rickman as ""Snape."" His character is revealed to be much more than the one-dimensional man he seemed to be in earlier chapters. He speaks every word with great authority. And, of course, the other standout is Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldemort, hissing his lines in a threatening manner accompanied everywhere by a slithering snake. Seeing him get his comeuppance is one of the major satisfactions in the whole story.<br/><br/>An almost unrecognizable Ciaran Hinds turns up as Aberforth Dumbledore, one of the many ""surprises"" among the supporting players. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint do their usual ensemble playing with finesse, embodying their characters more completely than ever.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat's background score is stirring whether it's being forceful or gentle and is a pleasure to listen to under the closing credits.<br/><br/>Summing up: A very satisfying conclusion to an epic series."

","''Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2'' is certainly a nice movie. The Harry Potter film series ended with this movie. This movie has been made wonderfully. Though some may say that there are many dissimilarities in the film from the book, I think that the Battle of Hogwarts scenes were made wonderfully.<br/><br/>I really loved the memories of Snape. Throughout the series, Severus Snape is shown as an emotionless person, but in the memories, his real identity is introduced. The scenes of Snape's memories very touching, and its the best thing I liked about this movie.<br/><br/>The fight between Severus Snape and Minerva McGonagoll was amazing.<br/><br/>The scene where Molly kills Bellatrix is quite exciting.<br/><br/>The epilogue was also nice.<br/><br/>Some bad sides: Ron and Hermione were chased by Nagini in the film. But in the book, they are fighting against the Death Eaters. The background story of Dumbledore is completely missing in the film.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was very nice, except having a few dissimilarities to the book."

It's almost a niche genre. You know what to expect at this point. The movie doesn't stray away from the others, and it doesn't try anything knew.

"varun_120","9","1","2","21 October 2011"," Emotional adieu to a great series
","I am writing this review not to recommend anyone to watch this flick. Because, I know all those who have been fans of Harry Potter will see the Grand farewell to this epic series, irrespective of the reviews. As my story with this Series goes, I remember I was 14 when I watched first Harry Potter film. I watched the first Harry Potter film after the second installment had been released 4- 5 months back.<br/><br/>I watched first H.P film by accident. I was watching cable with something good to be viewed. I happened to bump into a flick with a small boy. Later on it is turned out in the movie that, this boy was special and gifted. Then I realized, that movie was Harry Potter's first installment. Soon after watching the first installment, I liked it so much that the very next day as I remember I rented the Harry Potter and the Chamber of secrets and seen it.<br/><br/>Since then my fascination for H.P films has been immense. I was waiting for this flick for a long time. This is my personal opinion that Harry potter films from 5th installment seemed, kind of stagnant( except for the Half blood prince)From the 5th part a new director had come with a new style. I think the first four flicks were better than the latter ones.<br/><br/>I had great anticipation from the last 2 parts. But, I don't know why it fails to create that emotions as it should have generated. There are some very emotional scenes, but they are too hasty as though left incomplete. I didn't read the books as I thought it would kill interest in watching movies. I relied entirely on movies. But, as the first four films don't seem incomplete, the latter ones do seem( again half blood prince is exception.)I am not complaining about the movie. It has been directed greatly, but a lot of things are not explained even after making 2 parts of the last book, can cause confusions in minds of those who haven't read the book.<br/><br/>A lot of things unravel in this films. Some misconceptions also are done away, with the main one with contempt turns into reverence. I don't want to drop any spoiler. This is kind of silly of me to say, but I always felt sad after watching new installment of H.P, as I knew we are one step closer to the end of Harry Potter. That's why this film becomes very emotional that we are not going to be able to see Harry, Ron, Hermione or any other H.P characters again.<br/><br/>As Harry Potter franchise ended, there is a feeling of happiness with ambivalence of melancholy alongside. Surely, this film is a deluge of emotions throughout. There are instances of it throughout the movie. A lot of characters who died in this movie deserved more scenes, but only their dead bodies are shown. Here, I'd say at least their fights could have been shown. It becomes injustice to these characters, whom we saw in seven H.P films.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is a great end to a mesmerizing tale of a boy who lived. I grew up watching this film and will never forget Harry Potter. The series might have been ended, but Harry will live in our hearts throughout our lives. And, we will never forget Harry Potter. I want to say 'Thank you' to J. K Rowling for giving us Harry Potter. <br/><br/>I give 10/10 to Harry Potter and 9/10 to this flick and hope if Lord Voldemort could come back once again so that we could see Harry once again."

","I have nothing to say but astounding.Ultimately the best Harry Potter film of all time.I must say that it truly was an excellent performance by Danielle Radcliffe,Matthew Lewis,Ralph Fiennes,Maggie Smith,and of course the whole movie has to go to Alan Rickman.The movie was very intense and was a good ending for the Harry Potter Franchise,and i hope that if J.K. Rowling ever writes another book (will probably be about Harry,Ron,and Hermione's kids going to Hogwarts)then Chris Columbus(director of the first two Potter movies)should step up again to direct.Then will the franchise be finally finished.But I cannot stop thinking about ""Harry Potter and the Philosophers Stone"" compared to ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2"".Because everyone in the film has grown so much and,to cut a long storie short I would like to say a thanks to J.K.

"jcillini88","6","1","2","28 July 2011"," Let down!
","Let me start off by saying I am a fan of both the books and movies, so I am not a troll.<br/><br/>I went into this movie with high expectations. I was expecting this movie to be great and considering this was the end I expected the filmmakers to go all out. This was, after all, what the trailers promised. They promised an action packed finally. Unfortunately the movie failed to deliver in almost every way.<br/><br/>Leading up to the release of the film all anyone could talk about was the action and battle scenes in the movie. Supposedly the battle took up over 45 minutes of the movie?! This was not the case. The battle scenes we see are brief. In fact they make up maybe 5 minutes of the movie. The entire first 45 minutes is a big build up to the battle and we do not see any of it pretty much. Instead the movie decides to focus almost entirely on Harry, Ron and Hermione's quest to destroy the remaining horcruxes. This takes up the majority of the movie. It's like DH:P1 only they changed locations to Hogwarts and there is an epic battle happening around them.<br/><br/>Had the hype surrounding the battle not been so great the fact that the movie is not an action movie would not have bothered me. Instead that was all anyone could talk about and I naturally was expecting and looking forward to it. I wanted to see more fights like the one between Voldemort and Dumbledore at the end of OOTP. We do not see anything like that. There are three cool scenes, when Kingsley Shacklebolt stop time and kills a death eater, when Aberforth Dumbledore protects students from dementors by casting a huge patronus spell and when Molly Weasley kills Bellatrix. Other than that most of the fighting consists primarily of flashes and loud noises, nothing else.<br/><br/>The battle between Harry and Voldemort also made up a good chunk of time, but nothing really cool is done. If you have seen GOF then you have pretty much seen the extent of the fight between Harry and Voldemort. They do the same light connection thing they did in that movie and then they show Voldemort beating Harry up and Harry apparrating with Voldemort. The fight was a major let down. When Voldemort dies it is not epic. You won't clap, you won't do anything because he just kind of dies and that's it.<br/><br/>This movie also was not as emotional as I thought it would be. Considering the deaths in this movie and considering that it's the end I felt it should be the most emotional of them all. Instead we only see the dead bodies of some of our most beloved characters, we don't see them die and there is no build up to it. Any emotional response was muted by doing it this way.<br/><br/>There are a handful of things they got right in this movie. First and foremost was Snape's memory. I felt they did that part justice. <br/><br/>I also liked during the Harry-Voldemort fight how they cut back and forth between the fight and Ron and Hermione trying to destroy Nagini. That was more intense and suspenseful than the fight between Harry and Voldemort.<br/><br/>The acting was great in the movie. All the actors did a great job, specifically Alan Rickman, who went all out as Snape.<br/><br/>The effects, for the most part, were great. <br/><br/>Overall this movie was a massive let down. For whatever reason the filmmakers felt they didn't have enough time to do more with this movie. Despite the fact this movie is the shortest of them all, clocking in at 2 hours. They easily could have added an extra 20-30 minutes to include more action, to make the deaths more emotional and to make the fight between Harry and Voldemort better."

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011) was directed by David Yates. This film is wildly popular and is now ranked with the IMDb top 100 movies of all time. I can see why it's a box office hit. If you've read all the books, and seen the first seven movies, it's unthinkable not to see number eight. However, it's not clear to me why so many thousands of IMDb viewers rated the film as high as they did.<br/><br/>The three main characters are there and--gasp--they've grown up. Emma Watson looks great in jeans, and Daniel Radcliffe needs to shave. Many of the ""dead"" characters get to come back in dream sequences, so the excellent cast is complete. <br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes is one of the world's great villains. Any movie that includes Helena Bonham Carter and Maggie Smith as supporting actors has to have something good going for it.<br/><br/>Director Yates has faithfully followed J.K. Rowling's plot--no one really wants a different story or a different ending. In fact, Yates has improved upon the book by paring down Rowling's ill-conceived epilogue.<br/><br/>If you want excitement, the movie is full of it. However, as a local Rochester reviewer pointed out, most of the action consists of people pointing wands at each other and firing away.<br/><br/>If, unlikely as that may be, you haven't seen all the other films, I wouldn't bother with this one. If you're someone who has, indeed, seen all of the other films, then you must see this one. You won't be disappointed, but you won't be enlightened or surprised either.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter series was successful, it was fun, and now it's over. It was a great ride while it lasted, and I enjoyed almost every minute of it. I'm just not sure that Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is one of the best 100 movies ever made."
"Bale-Pearce-Oldman","Null","1","2","27 July 2011"," It was good, visually and technically... but something lacked.
","Deathly Hallows – Part 2 in itself tugged to the heartstrings. Harry, with his friends Ron and Hermione, came back to Hogwarts to look for the remaining Horcruxes they have to destroy in order to weaken Voldemort. Some epic battle ensues.<br/><br/>In the technical level of how the film was shot and produced was skillfully well done. The score, by Alexandre Desplat, is excellent as always. It added to the dynamic of the film that is hard to ignore. The humor is not lost even if we're dealing with some serious business here. The actors all did their part justice. Seeing how the three leads all grew and mature and came to this point is a delight to watch. The support cast is also noteworthy, but that is expected since they are all masters of the craft. Special mentions to Ralph Fiennes for giving a riveting portrayal of Lord Voldemort and Tom Felton for making me sympathize with Draco Malfoy.<br/><br/>A particularly great sequence in the film is Harry looking through Snape's memory (called The Prince's Tale in the book) where he found out about what really happened about his past. The montage was great. In fact, I think it will be a great idea to have a spin off during Snape's time studying at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Now where did it go wrong for me? Lighting. Sorry guys, but the lighting and photography in the battle sequences are too dark. I know the battle took place at night but can't they make the color scheme a little bit lighter? If we're talking Adobe Photoshop just put it in ""Screen"" mode at 100%? I know this is a stupid nitpick but sometimes it ruins it for me. I don't understand since in Prisoner of Azkaban, even at night setting, the cinematography is still clear and lively. Also the cinematography in Deathly Hallows – Part 1 is beautiful (and one of the better aspects of the film) in which I find it very contrasting with DH- Part 2. Anyway, if this movie will be out in Blu-Ray I bet it will be of better quality.<br/><br/>I find it hard to care for some of the characters. Maybe fleshing it out on the screen with minimum amount of screen time gives out a different result. The only characters I care about are the trio and Draco Malfoy. A little bit of Bellatrix Lestrange but that is a personal bias since I love Helena Bonham Carter. Even Snape didn't do much of an impact for me.<br/><br/>My major fault is that I expected too much out of this. Can you blame me though when almost all critics are in love with it?<br/><br/>It was a great family event, don't get me wrong. But the best Harry Potter film for me is still Prisoner of Azkaban."
"mdenvee","Null","1","2","23 July 2011"," A snore fest... ZZzzzz
","The movie deserves a 1 but out of my compassion to the die-hard HP fans, I'm giving it a 2. I'm not a huge fan of the series, but I love the genre. This last movie is like the last movie in LOTR- the first was infinitely better and had some depth and proper pacing. But like Pt2 and 3 of LOTR, this last Harry Potter was replete with slow sequences, and unconvincing acting by almost all the characters. There were so many scenes with Harry just staring into space (seemingly in deep thought). The whole film seemed to lack the quality.. seemed a bit hastily put together. Reminds me of Return of the Jedi versus Star Wars... the acting by Solo and Leia and even Luke was horrible and seemed disinterested in the 3rd movie. And the movie's battles in many ways reminded me 2nd and 3rd LOTR, and very much like X-men 3. One of my biggest problems was with Ralph Fiennes as Lord Voldermort- sorry but I kept seeing a guy with a stupid mask on and he just didn't look authentic- it reminded me of the Darth Maul in Star Wars Ep 1. Like Darth Maul, he just looks like the writer was trying to create a character who looks as grotesque as possible, but neither scary or persuasive- just ugly and painful to look at- like a burn victim or someone who had a facial deformity. Actually he was the least scary and least interesting evil character- just like Darth Maul was. But the main problem I had with the movie was the tempo- so slow sometimes and too fast other times. I guarantee that unless you are a die hard Harry Potter fan (and I know this will be sacrilege to you) you will feel squirmy in your seat and want the movie to just hurry up and end in the 2nd half. A few more spells cast would have been great, instead of the usual fire shooting from the magic wand routine- snore."

","'HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HOLLOWS: PART 2: Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The eighth and final chapter of the immensely popular 'HARRY POTTER' film series.  This one is based on the second half of the seventh (and final) book of writer J.K. Rowling's classic series.  The script was once again written by Steve Kloves who has written every film in the series except for 'HARRY POTTER AND THE ORDER OF THE PHOENIX' (which is arguably the worst one, possibly as a result).  David Yates returned to direct the film (he also directed the last three installments) and of course Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson all reprise their beloved roles.  The film is sure to please die-hard fanatics of the series but will definitely not win over any new fans as well.<br/><br/>The film begins exactly where the last chapter left off with Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Watson) and Ron (Grint) burying their fallen friend Dobby.  They then set out to find the next of the three remaining Horcruxes (the items of magic which give Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) his immortality).  At the same time Voldermort finds the 'Elder Wand' and learns of their plans.  The entire magical kingdom is soon set for the biggest war their world has ever seen and Harry, Hermoine and Ron are once again caught up right in the middle of it.<br/><br/>I've never been a big fan of the 'HARRY POTTER' series, I've never found it incredibly interesting or involving, but I have always admired the craftsmanship of most of the films. The film producers have always been able to find high quality directors and crew for most of the installments (minus maybe the first couple). The acting has always been rather decent and for the most part (except for maybe really early on) the movies have seemed to live up to fans of the book's high expectations. You definitely have to give the films credit for that. What they have failed to do is involve or interest most other movie goers who are not familiar with the source material (like myself). The greatest book to film adaptations should be able to do that as well. With that said I have found most of the movies at least slightly entertaining and again being a fan of film I can definitely admire the skill that went into making them. I did find this last chapter the least interesting or involving of the series though (that's not to say it's the worst film of the bunch). Despite all the action I had no real emotional involvement with any of the characters or what was going on with them. I think this is due to the fact that, not being a fanatic of the series, I haven't seen each film more than once and have not kept up with the mythology for the most part. So not knowing what was really going on a lot of the time did make it hard to follow and keep interest in. All of the other chapters have been able to pull off a certain amount of stand alone storytelling as well as keep up the continuing saga whereas this one spent most of it's time tying all the other films together and wrapping things up. So for that reason I found it the least involving of the series. Still there are a lot of spectacular visuals going on and big fans of the series will eat it up. Everyone else might be a little bored.<br/><br/>Watch our review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CN5KZOE7p28"

","I saw the first and second Harry Potter movies but then I gave them up as they were all alike with poor acting by the three kids. The trained actors were, as always superb. So, after 10 years I thought I'd give them another chance and went to see the latest release which is currently showing in Bangkok on an enormous IMAX/3D screen. I'm sorry, it did not help, still no acting from the three main characters, most of the time they were standing in a group of three looking at something in the distance.

"mattjones1990","Null","1","2","21 July 2011"," A Very Disappointing Finale
","I think the one saving grace for this film is that it is part of the Harry Potter series, thus it gets a certain degree of protection from the critics. For me personally though I felt rather let down.<br/><br/>Some parts of the film are fantastic don't get me wrong, but I felt it was spoilt by certain scenes. For example the 'dramatic' scenes involving Neville made me cringe, whilst other scenes left me laughing when I should have been frightened or on edge.<br/><br/>The icing on the cake was the end scene. How a few bad shirts and a change in hairstyles/facial hair can constitute nearly two decades of ageing is beyond me, to the point where I left the cinema literally laughing. If it was meant to be a comedy then I apologise.<br/><br/>Id recommend it for the youngsters, but as an adult I simply could not take it seriously. Personally a disappointing end to a franchise that dominated my childhood years."

","We all know that films are never as good as the books they are based on, it can be difficult to squeeze a book into a film. The Deathly Hallows if I remember correctly was over 1000 pages so breaking the final film into two parts seemed logical. 500 pages for part 1, 500 pages for part 2, makes sense right ? Well no, whilst the first film covers about 70% of the first half of the book, the second film covers about 20% - if that !!!<br/><br/>The major issue here is that each book becomes progressively darker, death, relationships, emotion etc and to reflect the horrors that the characters were going through meant that the films should of been given a 15 certificate not 12. A good example of this is that you really don't see any of the characters suffering, we didn't see Voldemort set Neville on fire before he was able to pull the sword from the hat. We didn't see how Fred died nor Tonks or Lupin, these are surely hugely emotional parts to the storyline.<br/><br/>Where the hell is the backstory? Ariana/Dumbledore, Harry falling out with Lupin, Snapes past was merely brushed over and yet I remember reading the book and sympathising with Snapes infatuation with Lily (we've all loved someone who didn't reciprocate) Voldemorts death was laughable, this was supposed to be the climax to the film, you wanted him to suffer, to scream and curse, you wanted to witness the spectacle and you wanted all the world to see his demise but he sort of...well....pixilated, where were the crowd of onlookers to watch the final duel, to cheer Harry at finally defeating his nemesis? It was a drab, dull affair. Scripwriters, may you never again be allowed near such a film for what you put is through was pure tedium.<br/><br/>What made Peter Jacksons LOTR trilogy such an epic is that in the most part he kept faithfully to the original books, he understood that he had the material in front of him...all he had to do was point a camera and shoot, now I am not going to say the JK's work is in the same league as Tolkien but she had laid down the script..SO WHY CHANGE IT? All in all I gave this a 3....sure special effects are good, the actors did their best, Rickman and Maggie Smith have such screen presence that more should of been made of it but as Yates only told part of the story I am still waiting for the rest.<br/><br/>DON'T BOTHER WATCHING IN 3D, there are only two moments where the visuals come into action and they are hardly worth it anyhow.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the remake in 10 years or so...."
"LloydBayer","Null","1","2","20 July 2011"," Saving the best for the last...
","In all honesty, I have never been a fan of J. K. Rowling or her screen adaptation through Warner Bros. However, I have to admit that the last 10 years have been phenomenal for Rowling in not just establishing a fan base, or a cult following, or even a massive bank account, but in creating a whole new world; The world of Harry Potter and his adventures. What started as a lighthearted venture into the world of myth and magic ten years ago, culminates into a dark and powerful showdown between the forces of good and evil. Both parts are well interlinked, but the plot seems stretched at times. This is obviously due to the cinematic rendition of Rowling's books. The highlights are easily notable from both parts:<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 1<br/><br/> Minister Rufus predicts that the Ministry of Magic strengthens with Lord Volemort's rise in power.  Along with Severus Snape, Voldemort plans Harry Potter's assassination.  Harry, Hermione and Ron discover an evil locket with powerful negative energy.  They also discover the origins of the Sword of Gryffindor, which can destroy such lockets.  They then discover the origins of the Deathly Hallows, comprising of the legendary and omnipotent Elder Wand, the Resurrection Stone and the Cloak of Invisibility.  Harry, with the help of his friends, recovers the Sword of Gryffindor and with its power, destroys the locket.  The ending scene has Voldemort breaking into Dumbledore's tomb to steal the Elder Wand.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2<br/><br/> Griphook the goblin helps Harry, Hermione and Ron break into Bellatrix's vault in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor.  The trio return to Hogwarts where Severus Snape, now the Headmaster, threatens anyone who helps Harry and his friends.  Ron and Hermione declare their love for each other after destroying a Horcrux cup they stole from Bellatrix's vault.  Hogwarts is under attack by all Voldemort's all powerful forces.  Voldemort kills a key character and invokes the full potential of the Elder Wand.  Harry learns that Snape and his mother were good friends before she was killed, and that part of Voldemort's dark soul grows in his.  Harry prepares to die at the hands of Voldmort, resulting in a catastrophic battle between the two archenemies. <br/><br/>Prior to the 5th installment, ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"", David Yates was virtually an unknown in cinema. With a history in TV productions, David Yates has etched his name in history for not just directing the last four installments, but for epically ending a multi-billion Dollar franchise with such magnitude, that only any idiot would think of re-booting the phenomenon known as ""Harry Potter"". Besides, he has severely raised the bar in any and all competing movies in this genre, giving ""The Lord of the Rings"" Trilogy and its makers a run for their money. One week after this release and international critics are echoing words like, ""spectacular"" and ""spell-binding"". As a movie buff, I can say this is cinema in its best form ever. Having not read any of Rowling's books, I have no idea about the book to cinema adaptation factor. However, the movie experience is too good to be true. There are a lot of things happening at any given time. Sometimes, keeping track of what's happening can be an engaging task, but in a good way. Although acting is flawless from the three protagonists (why shouldn't it, given they have been preparing for this for the last 10 years), it is Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman who stands out as the antagonists. Simply brilliant! Then there is a tidal wave of A-list talent from the crème de la crème of British cinema. Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson and it goes on and on, like the final quatrain in an epic opera. Although the longest running cinema franchise will be tied between Star Wars and the James Bond movies, the problem here is every now and again, we are introduced to different producers, directors and of course, protagonists. For that matter, over 6 actors have taken on the 007 call sign. For the Harry Potter saga, the entire Potter universe, if I may say so, is built round the lives of Harry Potter, Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Earmarking these roles in cinematic history, Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, will always be remembered for their roles in the Harry Potter franchise, no matter who or what they maybe 20 years from now. Where Yates succeeds is in giving this franchise a well deserved send-off by saving the best for the last. In doing so, he has vindicated the use of some eye-popping visual effects, renders the plot with the darkest atmosphere in the series, throws in a plethora of top actors and propels the pacing at a breathless rate. What he could have done without is the post-conversion to 3D. I really don't think 3D adds to this film's already immense scope. To me, this is taking advantage of crazed fans by squeezing the last penny out of pockets. And why not, being the last episode, the intention appears to stem from the greed of milking the cash cow dry. <br/><br/>Put 2011's two summer heavyweights in a ring and there won't be a question about going the distance. ""Deathly Hallows Part 2"" has ""Transformers: Dark of the Moon"" up against the ropes even before the first round begins!"

","The best of the saga. How can I say as a Harry Potter freak? Well, not a freak for real, but more or less this. The final is epic, and the characters are developed right to them top... maybe I still can say Harry is not well enough played by Dan Radcliffe but it still good and he improved a lot. Great scenes from Alan Rickman (one of the best in my opinion). Deep and tender, even sad story from him, of course it comes from Rowling. But still good. Also the battles, every each and single little one is epic, and shows what each wizard is capable to do for real. You have not to think anymore, now you have the proves. Maggie Smith, epic too.

"sandainet","Null","1","2","19 July 2011"," the worst of the harry potter franchise
","from the very beginning of the movie, harry potter loses its iconic sense of magic to be replaced by a feeling of utter content. although it is good to feel content i was strongly expecting a movie with significantly more bang to it. the whole movie consists of one continuous fast moving story line that is overly obsessed with stuffing as much content as possible instead of showing the more emotional side of the story. <br/><br/>The film also contains an unimaginable amount of stereotypes and clichés that render an otherwise moving story into a dull collage of (attempts at) epic scenes. the major issue with these ""epic scenes"" is that they seem to all be made in order to impress the audience as opposed to fit in with the story which is what they ultimately should be. on top of this, there is a profuse amount of silly ""heroic"" moments that just end up being dumb. for example in the end when they try to make 20 year old kids look 40 and act all parent like it simply comes out like a joke. or when Neville limps up towards Voldemort and gives a cheesy speech about how meaningful harry was.<br/><br/>Overall, the whole film comes across as dull, clichéd, cheesy, rough to follow and over dramatic which renders it utterly hopeless along side its many great predecessors."
"super_dude_95","9","1","2","19 July 2011"," Best Of The Series, If Not Best Of The Year (So Far)
","Well... where do i start? This Movie is flippin' awesome! If you've grown to love the series in full (Speaking film, not books) then you will love it with a dire passion, and praise it until the next big thing sweeps you up. If you recently liked the newer (And admittedly Darker) films, like 5 and on, then you'll appreciate this as a true nod to a series that has well earned its place in film history, and will be remembered. And If are just getting on board with all this and were taken up to see it strictly on its hype, then you'll be incredibly surprised at how well put together this movie is, especially since it's a freakin Harry Potter film.<br/><br/>Acting: To be honest, was there ever any bad acting in any of them? Seriously they were all good enough to keep fans completely engulfed in the series for 10 straight years. It has gotten better since they were younger obviously, but they really put their acting chops on the line for this one. Bravo.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Beautifully shot, it helped to capture the world J.K. Rowling meant for us to see. With all of it's landscapes, creatures, Magic, Fighting, Killing, Loving, More Killing, More Fighting, and over all an entire world... full of people getting killed (Seriously, for Harry Potter there was a hell of a lot of people dying).<br/><br/>Music: For the first time since maybe the first one, the music truly struck me. It played perfect to the film, more so than it did in the previous films in my opinion. It seems that that iconic theme that we've all been hearing for 10 years now, has gone unappreciated in a way. I know that leaving this film, i will miss that little theme. <br/><br/>Overall: Seriously if you can't tell, I loved this movie deeply. I see the Oscars in this films future, and one of them better be a nod for Best Film. It deserves it without question. I highly recommend it, it's not just a summer blockbuster, it's a true film that should be enjoyed, respected, and admired by everyone. 10/10 no doubt in my mind.<br/><br/>-By the way; enjoy the good movies while you can, THE HIPSTER WAVE IS COMING, trust me, it'll be worse than the 80's..."

Bellatrix even more so! they died way two easily! 6 two many off screen deaths. 7 Harry not dieing after being shot with the death curse was completely ridiculous! it completely ruined the tension i was feeling after i thought he was no more. 8 if harry had to come back it should have at least appeared he was dead until the very last second before he fought you know who. in stead the audience already new he was alive almost right after he had been shot. 9 harry has kids with jenny. corny ending! again still a enjoyable film. but i expected something better for a finale!"

","This film is recommended. <br/><br/>Good versus evil! You'll hear no spoiler from me in this review, although it doesn't take a rocket scientist or any wizard to guess the outcome in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. The gang's all back and more in the final thrilling installment of the HP series.<br/><br/>In the incomplete HP7: Part One, we left off with Harry, Ron, and Hermione still trying to gather the Horcruxes ( pieces of Lord Voldemort's soul ) to finally rid the world of this villainous predator and his black magic crew of crazies and Death Eaters. Sacrifices were made and lives taken in the ongoing struggle against evil domination. And HP7: Part Two wastes no time with any informational flashbacks or needed exposition to aid its audience to recall any history or plot. It's up to each and every moviegoer to do their homework and bring their own prior knowledge to the proceedings. Every Muggle for himself! ( It is here that I must confess that I had some difficulty with my lack of knowledge about some minor characters from other installments who now have major roles in this segment of J. K. Rowling's massive saga. Their importance and interrelationship with others seemed incongruous to the action on the screen before me, while other more interesting characters from earlier versions never materialized in this last chapter. I was in desperate need of a program, map, or CliffsNotes to guide me through the film's cast of thousands. )<br/><br/>This final film emphasizes action and special effects with very little narrative and character driven dialog. It's all about tying up loose ends and providing a jolly good conclusion for its loyal fan base. That the film was somewhat anti-climatic and a bit unsatisfying to me came as a surprise. Yes, all the beloved characters are there, even if it is only a cameo bit for some. All are armed with magical wands and potent potions, ready for battle, but the film's pace felt a bit rushed and on overdrive to me, with this part relying too much on special effects to counteract any real emotional connection for me. Still it's a minor quibble with all the lush production values, lavish sets, sound effects, marvelous CGI and make-up, and valuable assists from the cast members of this monumental series.<br/><br/>For the last ten years, the moviegoer could sit back and partake of an illustrious collection of talented British actors that have lived and prospered with enough serious British coinage and global fame from this film series. We watched these actors breathing new life into Rowling's multi-dimensional supporting characters and journeyed with them, caught in the complex genealogies of Harry and family and participating in their physical and emotional growth. Special praise must be given to the perfectly inspired casting of Daniel Radcliffe as our hero who has grown more as an actor than one would have expected. Radcliffe's likability and poise given to his role, along with the fine chemistry with his cohorts, Rupert Glint and Emma Watson, brought an added intensity to the films. The film's strong supporting cast, which includes Maggie Smith, Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Helena Bonham Carter, and the reliable Ralph Fiennes as the Dark Lord, are just some of the thespians who provided their own unique form of magic with their endearing eccentricities and subtle quirks that helped to make this series so successful. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 may satisfy many moviegoers and devotees of the books. However, for this ordinary Muggle, it was more of a technical triumph than a purely fulfilling movie-going experience. HP7: Part 2 is a fitting ending for a mammoth undertaking that has become an impressive part of cinematic history and epic filmmaking. One could easily admire the craftsmanship and dedication of all those involved with this worthwhile project rather than truly love the finished result. I, for one, was more bewildered than bothered and certainly not bewitched this time around. GRADE: B<br/><br/>NOTE: Visit my movie blog for more reviews: www.dearmoviegoer.com"

","It was the movie that had created all the hype this summer. Belonging to a series which redefined a decade, Harry Potter had changed the lives of millions and I feel proud to be one of them. Having read each book multiple times, I had considered the movies a disgrace to the series, but recently, my opinion has been changing. After watching the premiere of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 at Trafalgar Square, I had more than high expectations from this last movie, the movie which would ultimately draw the curtains to the most beautiful world that had ever been created. So, did it live up to the expectations? Lets find out.<br/><br/>The movie kicks off very quickly from where HP 7 part 1 had left off so it gives a nice feeling of continuation. However, even from the beginning, you can feel the tension of the situation. Snape is shown as the headmaster of Hogwarts and things have gone from bad to worse. The effects are stunning throughout the movie and you find yourself biting your nails and clenching the arms of those around you when Harry, Ron and Hermione break into Gringotts and make their get-away on a dragon. The whole movie is pure action and the Battle of Hogwarts has been shown as intensely as it has been portrayed in the Book. Every character has their moment and anyone can connect with them. Even Radcliffe, who I always thought gave a mediocre performance, did superb! Snape had his moment, although very briefly(and that is the only thing I complain about) but it is enough to make its point. The end of Voldemort, happened too slowly and they removed the parts when Voldemort is actually intimidated by harry(but oh well, you cant get all that you wish for, right?). The 19 years later part was emotional, and very saddening as it brought back the harsh reality that there would be no more Harry Potter after this.<br/><br/>I would never complain about how the movie did not have enough 'details' because that it just something impossible to do without exceeding the runtime and also losing many audience who haven't read the book. By far, this is the greatest movie based on the Harry Potter series and after seeing this, one feels proud to have stuck with Harry Potter till the end. It is strongly recommended that you watch this movie in 3D. Watch it over and over again. It deserves nothing less."
"hmdabir","10","1","2","17 July 2011"," Great Movie! A++ movie. Must watch for all Harry fans, like me.
","I am not going to give any details here. Just in short, the movie is simply great! Just understand that it is practically impossible to show everything from the book in just 2 to 2.5 hours. Whatever is shown in the movie is just great, simply great, amazing and fully enjoyable. Obviously, if you have many expectations about each and every thing and you have already the book, then you might be disappointed about a few points. All the remaining horcruxes have been destroyed in the movie (obviously all of us know this;harry potter series cannot end without that). So some of the adventures have got very less time to emphasize their significance. But that does not really matter. Just go with zero expectations and you will come to know it is the best movie, Movie of the Decade. Just great! (watch in 3D)"
"skeletonman13","10","1","2","17 July 2011"," Best Film of the Series and Best Film of 2011 thus far.
","I've been an avid fan of the Harry Potter series since I started reading the books on my own in 3rd grade. I've followed the books and movies for a good part of my childhood. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was and everything and more I hoped it would be. I cried when I read the final book, but I wept when I saw this film. If I could go back and count it'd have to be at least seven times I felt my heart break, and then I realized that my childhood was coming to a close during the epilogue. It's been awhile since a movie has emotionally effected me that much. The performances in this film are so powerful and thrilling (namely Daniel Radcliffe and Alan Rickman), the detail of the film's location, costumes, art direction, music, and mostly cinematography blow all of other films out of the water. The most visually beautiful film of the series. I may sound biased because I'm such a huge fan of the series from such a young age, but even if I hadn't read any of the books I'd still think it's a piece of monumental cinema.<br/><br/>There's so much about this film that amazed me, but mostly it was the translation from text to screen. Gringotts, The Battle of Hogwarts, Snape's back story, and the final battle between Harry and Voldemort. I had my own little picture of how that played out, but it's so grand to see on film and ever so gripping.<br/><br/>I honestly think that this final chapter in the Harry Potter series is worthy of some Oscar nods. I'm really hoping it'll at least get some nods for Best Supporting Actor (Alan Rickman), Best Art Directon, Best Score, Best Adapted Screenplay, Best Visual Effects, Best Cinematography, maybe even Best Picture... who knows! With the Academy nominating 10 films a year for Best Picture it's highly possible! But, overall this is definitely the best film of the series, emotionally wrenching and heartbreaking but an absolute spectacle of a film."

","Since 2001, I've watched every Harry Potter film ever made. Now here's something that can be difficult to put in proper words. I'm just... in complete shock and have to say that it's an astounding and compelling end to a famous franchise! <br/><br/>The top film critics were absolutely right about it all. The series started off as a lighthearted piece where we got to know the young cast, but as the movies progressed further into a darker tone (with ""Prisoner of Azkaban"" director Alfonso Cuaron starting it there), we see this cast growing up before our eyes, delivering such wonderful performances. It was certainly not overacting, director David Yates turned it all around with such finesse ever since he took control of 2007's ""Order of the Phoenix."" <br/><br/>The final duel of Harry Potter vs. Lord Voldemort has finally arrived and I was at the edge of my seat anxiously waiting to see the end result (I could literally hear some people gasping, slowly cheering, and even a small handful of them tearing up).<br/><br/>I've read the original book of ""Deathly Hallows"" and there were quite a few changes that occurred in the movie (though I won't say what those are). Point here is, it's very intricate to interpret this particular book into film, but at least this adaptation kept as closely as it can to the original. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson have permanently solidified their careers, thanks to the franchise that has shaped them as we see today!<br/><br/>With great robustness in the story both in triumph and tragedy, author JK Rowling certainly brought us to our knees begging to see more."

Perhaps the most engaging chapter was ""The Flaw in the Plan."" If the filmmakers had simply used J.K. Rowling's dialogue, the movie would have been a ""10""; as it is, most fans will probably be doing as I did - rereading to see if they'd missed something.<br/><br/>Bottom line: if it ain't broke, don't fix it."

Also I can understand that the movie is more geared towards a younger target audience, so I can overlook some of the flaws that come with that.<br/><br/>But I still think the movie has some other major disappointments. To me the movie does not feel like it is telling a story but rather shows a series of loosely connected scenes.<br/><br/>For the immense budget and popularity this movie has I am also disappointed in the acting (Of course most actors are very young, but that doesn't stop one from noticing some missing depths in the characters) and the special effects are OK but not impressive.<br/><br/>Overall I thought the movie was quite good but not nearly as good as many make it to be.

"ih2010","Null","1","2","17 July 2011"," Good, But Very Anti-climatic
","Let me start out by saying that I am an absolute avid Harry Potter fan. I became addicted to the books when The Goblet of Fire was released when I was around 10 years old. Since then, I have probably read all of the books but the last two a good 20+ times. I love Harry Potter.<br/><br/>When I heard about Harry Potter movies being released and not being split into 2 parts, I was very down in the dumps because I knew a lot of important information regarding the story line was going to be overlooked due to it not fitting into the ~ 2 hours allotted to the movie. Needless to say, the first 6 movies came out, and while I enjoyed them for what they were, I was very disappointed in some of the information that was cut out.<br/><br/>When I heard about the Deathly Hallows being a 2 part release, I jumped and screamed for joy because I told myself ""Surely they can't cut anything out in nearly 5 hours worth of movietime!""<br/><br/>Unfortunately, I was wrong.<br/><br/>While reading the books I was very in tune with all the characters; I (nearly) cried when Sirius died, then Hedwig, I was sad when George lost his ear, I cried my heart out when I flew through the 6th book and read about Dumbledore dying.<br/><br/>Now onto this movie, I thought it was very in detail, yet the connection to the characters that you get when you read the book just wasn't there in this movie. I felt no remorse when Lupin or Fred died because I've barely seen them all movie. Also, if you did not avidly read the books, you will not understand why Harry came back to life after being killed with the 'killing curse'.<br/><br/>While a lot of the scenes in this movie are very pretty and well done, I think the action could have used quite a bit of work. When Mrs. Weasley killed Bellatrix, you had no idea that Bellatrix was dueling 3 people before that, one of them being Ginny, and that was why that happened.<br/><br/>I guess this is a bit long drawn out and I just like to nit pick at a lot of the smaller details, but for 4-5 hours worth of movie, I feel like the last 30 minutes or so lacked a LOT of content. Voldemort should have died in the Great Hall with a ring of people watching after Harry give a speech to Tom Riddle, not this silliness of falling off a building and flying around.<br/><br/>I am more disappointed in the lack of following the book to the exact letter than anything else; for while since content was left out, the story was much shallower than it deserved.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling deserves better than this, I sincerely hope that they filmed an extended version with a lot of the missing scenes and with better action scenes.<br/><br/>And that concludes my long drawn out ramble of a review. I give it a 6/10 with a few stars taken off for important content being forgotten, lack of connectedness with the characters, and weak action scenes."

As many would say, it's the end of a Legendary Era , but hardly do you feel it come true.. I admit that the previous parts had been losing that charisma and intensity set by the initial parts, but it's the time to revive, Cuz the universal hero Harry Potter gets a grand finale with Deathly Hallows Part 2. There's drama, action, terror, danger, death, special effects and loads of magic as the world's three most loved fictional characters meet their final destiny. But what makes the film really special is the high emotional quotient as heroes emerge from nowhere, lovers exchange love and longing neath the shadow of death and friends give a whole new meaning to friendship. Many a times, the film touches your heart and fills your eyes with a strange mistiness... something that rarely happened in the last few encounters.<br/><br/>Such is the pace of movie that you find it hard even to recollect your memories about the novel, and gives you an edge of a thriller.. The high point of the finale is the all-pervasive presence of Lord Voldemort and the high voltage encounters between the evil wizard and Harry Potter. If Daniel Radcliffe creates one of the most credible young heroes of cinema -- both poignant and brave -- then Fiennes lends a dignity and a terror to his unbridled portrayal of evil. Equally enticing are Potter's faithful lieutenants: geeky Ron Weasly and super-smart Hermione Granger.. And also are we forgetting the perfect timed entry of Neville Longbottom, and his funny old antics.. <br/><br/>It may be hard to argue that this final installation will go down as the greatest sequel of the whole Potter Saga..It is essentially a delicious blend of exquisite action set pieces where the Trio try to accomplish their tasks, leading up to the final tryst at Hogwarts. The notable ones are the heist at Gringott's Bank when the trio try to steal the sword of Gryffindor, the attempts of Voldemort's army to break through the defense at Hogwart's,demise of Snape and indeed the whole duel encounters!"
"optionsf","Null","1","2","16 July 2011"," Unsatisfying
","Taken alone, this is a good, fun, action movie...the action rarely stops (as opposed to Part 1 where it never started).<br/><br/>I gave up on the Harry Potter book series after the second book, but saw all the movies. I read Lord of the Rings 4 times as a child, and watched the films, and felt they did a very faithful job adapting them, despite the need to leave out huge pieces of the story. As such, at the end, I felt a great deal of satisfaction when Gollum finally steals the ring and jumps into the fire at the end.<br/><br/>No such deal here. Haven't we been waiting for six films for Harry to destroy Voldemort? Unless I missed something, after Voldemort is destroyed, there's not so much as a ""Ding Dong the Witch is Dead"" or ""Hooray for Harry"" moment. It's like it never happened. Harry goes back and walks through the school, and while there's lot of destruction and obviously important characters have been lost, after all that wouldn't they have given Harry a round of applause for killing Voldemort? Shouldn't someone be happy? There is no moment for the audience to cheer - I clapped when he killed Voldemort but the audience in my theater was silent. They did not program in a moment to rejoice. Is rejoicing a bad thing these days? It was underwhelming. <br/><br/>There was at least some cheering when Bellatrix died, but again, she is so powerful and then Mrs. Weasly just got mad and called her a bitch then it was so easy to kill her? <br/><br/>Also unsatisfying was when Harry casually snaps the Elder Wand, the most powerful one in half (if it's so powerful, how do you just snap it in half even if you are it's owner?) and toss it aside? Couldn't Harry have used the power of the Elder Wand to rebuild Hogwarts or do something good? Wouldn't he have been tempted for a minute to keep it and been conflicted - it was Dumbledore's after all! Having read some of the reviews here from those better informed, I learned that Harry reflected back the death spell on Voldemort since he realized he actually controlled the wand. Big point, totally lost in the special effects.<br/><br/>Also can someone explain Draco Malfoy to me? Why does Harry save him at the end? He chose his side, and in the end leaves with his parents (not clear why) from everything.<br/><br/>I felt like some of these issues could have been addressed at the expense of cutting some time off the roller coaster ride at the beginning at Gringotts. 20% less action and 20% more emotionally satisfying time spent explaining the motives behind what happened, would have made the film not only visually interesting, but also emotionally involving."

Words aren't enough to describe this movie to the majority of teens around the world who grew up watching HP movies (like me). This is the first time I've literally burst out crying like mad in the cinemas. The Prince's Tale absolutely brought me to great big tears and My Previous fave HP movie (azkabhan) was overly topped by this one. In fact, I think this is my ALL TIME FAVE MOVIE. In my opinion, the Oscars have been ignoring the HP franchise way too much. This movie DESERVES TO WIN BEST PICTURE AT THE Oscars. Most 90s kids internationally admit that this franchise has kept them laughing and entertained throughout their teenage years and a franchise other than HP has never been beloved and gave so much happiness to a generation globally. I not only cried at the absolute tear breaking moving emotions displayed through mind blowing acting my Dan Radcliffe (His acting has improved enormously through out the movies, but his acting in this one was Oscar WORTHY for BEST ACTOR full stop), but the terrible fact that with HP over, I feel that my childhood is over (it really is)and since I am so emotionally attached to HP characters, I couldn't easily let them go. With HP ended, I feel my youth is ending and it is. HP kept my teenage years with something to look forward to in the cinemas through 10 years, and no other franchise in the world has achieved that. HP is the BEST and most beloved franchise in the world to the 90s kids and it won't change because HP not only represents the height of entertainment in our era, but it represents our youth and joyful memories of our school days. I am still very sad that HP is over, more than anyone. I've read all the books, watched all the movies, but I have to say, this movie is the best of all, the perfect finish to a perfect franchise. And whatever other overrated franchises like twilight may be a better representation of their youth to the minority, the majority of 90s kids around the world will always pick HP as their all time favorite franchise ever. It will go down in history not only with success in numbers but in the hearts of 90s kids and other youth of this era. I would be very disappointed if Daniel Radcliffe who is obviously a very talented and hard working professional actor does not win Best actor at the Oscars, because I've never seen an actor at his age display a character with such ground breaking emotion and reality. I would be more disappointed if this movie does not win Best Picture at the Oscars, because this movie is not just a movie, but a form of happiness that have kept the youth of our era entertained for a decade and that is something that is not likely to be achieved even in the future."
"keriannharper","Null","1","2","15 July 2011"," Great movie - ""cliff notes"" of the books
","As a huge fan of the books, yes I loved this movie. I am giving it 10 stars as it was definitely full-filling as the end of the series - however I am looking at the last few movies as more of a ""cliff-notes"" version of the books.<br/><br/>As another review noted, there were many details left out of the movie. One thing I was extremely disappointed in was the ""death scene"" of Fred Weasley. For those who may not have ever read the books, they would not have realized who it was for the scene was cut so short and there was no dialogue to it at all.<br/><br/>The backstory of Dumbledore. I understand that to bring in the backstory and details that the books require, would make these movies 4 hours long each (and a lot of us, I'm sure would be happy with that!) - but the fact that the audience has no idea WHY Dumbledore was the owner of the elder wand or WHY his sister was killed and his brother hated him...it left so many un-answered questions for those who have not read the books.<br/><br/>Snape's scene. I love Severus Snape, and think Alan Rickman did a BRILLIANT job portraying the character. I am actually very happy with how Snape's death scene and his ""memories scene"" went down. For the memories scene, they do leave out a few details, however the emotion you get from Snape and how much he truly loved Lilly Potter is so raw it's beautiful. We all know he loved Lilly Potter with every last breath (literally) and in turn loved/hated Harry. He hated Harry for being James' son but loved that he was a part of Lilly.<br/><br/>All in all, as a potter-head, I am happy with this film. Definitely parts that were left out that should have been kept in the movie - but, again, I look at this more like a ""cliff-notes"" version of the books."
"robert-710-767167","Null","1","2","15 July 2011"," An okay ending
","I have the disadvantage of not reading the books or seeing the movies from age 12 to 18 or anything like that. I saw all the movies in a week and then waited two more to see this in theaters. I was invited to see it at the midnight release with some friends who were all die hard fans of the series.<br/><br/>I'll be honest and say that my predictions for the ending were very off to what actually happened. I was hoping Harry would not only get into a relationship with Hermione but would kiss sometime near the end. And that Ron would just sort of either find someone else or just be happy 'single'. I also excepted to see a lot of epic battles and a final epic battle that would sum up these many years of hard work and danger in the guy's life.<br/><br/>Instead, Ron kisses Hermione and they don't even do a close up. Then the epic battle at the end didn't seem to reach full potential. As I read on the message board on here, the ending wasn't that great. There was almost no dialogue between Harry and he-who-must-not-be-named. And in the end, it seemed that the snake being killed was what got him.<br/><br/>Then after this epic battle, it doesn't show much to congratulate Harry at all. The Lord of the Rings ending is a good example. I didn't even cry. Then as someone mentioned, it shows Rom and Hermione holding hands. Oh my goodness! But despite these negative notes, I was very impressed with the special effects. I was happy to see the movie and wonder if indeed there will be future movies...<br/><br/>Rated 8/10"

","Part 2 of the final installment of the Harry Potter series begins as Harry, Ron, and Hermione continue their quest of tracking down and destroying Lord Voldemort's three remaining Horcruxes, the dark magical items posed as everyday things that are responsible for his immortality. But as the legendary Deathly Hallows are uncovered, Voldemort finds out about their mission, the fight of good against evil will come to an explosive end. Deathly Hallows: Part 2 picks up right where Part 1 left off, searching for Horcruxes. I was never really a fan of the Horcruxes plot line, but I had always tolerated it as I read the novels because even though it felt like a plot line that would be in a sub-par video game, it still felt planned, thanks to Tom Riddle's diary back in Chamber of Secrets. The Horcruxes plot line also worked well on the pages, because they were spread out in the book. However, on screen, it felt repetitive and tedious, with little to no break in between each one, especially in Part 2. Part 1 was an atmospheric and emotional movie, and even though it was basically a prelude to the conclusion of the series, it stood alone as a film rather well. Part 2 was supposed to be action-packed and also emotional, and while it was action-packed (although it felt like it took forever to get there), it wasn't as emotional as I had hoped it would be. The film felt a bit rushed and was single-noted. Part 2 is the shortest Potter installment, and it felt like it. Many scenes left me wanting more. The single-noted aspect made the film feel incomplete. It felt like it was strictly about Horcruxes and the Potter/Voldemort confrontation, with some other sub-plots barely sprinkled in. Maybe if they hadn't split the film in two, but made it one long film, it would have felt more complete. The acting was as solid as ever, with Daniel Radcliffe giving his best performance of the series. Ralph Fiennes was as evil as ever and Alan Rickman gave his best performance in the series too, as Snape. Everyone else was solid as well, but unfortunately we don't get to see them nearly as much, which was a shame. The visual effects were top-notch and can only be rivaled by Deathly Hallows: Part 1. The spell-casting, creatures, and explosions were dazzling and suitably, magical. Some of the CGI was a bit spotty, but I honestly can remember only one instance and it literally lasted two seconds. I loved that the film was all about how there is darkness in all of us, but we can learn how to overcome it. We learn quickly that no character in this series (including Dumbledore) is totally pure, and Harry must completely accept this or else he will fail. Overall, as a film, it's a good one. But when you deal with sequels and a series, as well as the most famous book series of all time, as well as expectation, Part 2 doesn't make the grade. I expected a lot more, and didn't get it. It felt rushed and wasn't at all cathartic, which is what a Potter fan who not only grew up reading the books but grew up watching the films as well was deserving of. There are a lot of variables as to why the film was not excellent, and one could argue Book 7 was one of the weaker books anyway. Still, it's a good movie and whenever you deal with an ending people are very critical if it is not exactly they way they envisioned it. Harry Potter was one of the greatest film series of all time, and even though Part 2 wasn't the best, I'm still satisfied with the series as a whole, which stuck to the books faithfully, upheld Rowling's wishes, stuck with the same actors, and above all, stayed consistently great with four different directors and the transition from kid-friendly to much, much darker themes. That is an achievement unto itself. In the 10 years since Harry's big-screen debut, the spell has never been broken."

I really do not need to tell you about his acting because its Alan Rickman and as usual he is fabulous.Thanks to David Yates for wonderful crafting it with minute details from the book ... and special not spoiling a dialogue from the original Book .like this one : ""Dumbledore: Have you grown to care for the boy, after all?....... 'for him?' shouted snape.'Expecto patronum!' from the tip of his wand burst a the silver doe:she landed on the office floor,bounded once across the office and soared out of the window.Dumbledore watched her fly away,and as her silvery glow faded he turned back to snape,and his eyes were full of tears. 'After all this time?' Always for Lily' said Snape ............. ""I literally had a tear"".you don't usually find a movie that grows along with you ,the characters ,the story ,those memories.If someone asks what is the most cherished memory that you have in your teenage i would say it's Watching Harry Potter in theaters.Don't wanna say more about just watch it in 3d magic before you miss a chance of a life time.Thank you J.K.Rowling for inspiring a Generation :) The Boy Wizard will Live in our Hearts Forever..."
"henry_yan","Null","1","2","15 July 2011"," A fitting end to a long saga
","There were a more than a few sighs in the cinema audience when the final scene ended with the fade out of the 3 protagonists (who IMO didn't age 19 years at all) as their children departed for Hogwarts. Most of these sighs came from the slightly younger people in the audience, the Gen Y and Gen Z. I know how it feels. I grew up with Star Wars and I got that same feeling when the saga concluded with ""Revenge of the Sith"". It's that feeling of emptiness that there is nothing else to look forward to now.<br/><br/>The final installment of the Harry Potter story is everything the viewer wants, and more. The performances of all actors, even those in supporting roles, were excellent. While it was natural that the younger stars got most of the attention, to me, the outstanding performances came from the older ones, like Alan Rickman, Ralph Fiennes, Michael Gambon, David Thewlis and Jason Isacs.<br/><br/>I was completely fascinated by Alan Rickman's Severus Snape. His back story, done in a flashback, was the fulcrum to which the entire series rests upon. Alan Rickman played the part of a misunderstood hero to absolute perfection. From the flashback, you can see his complete devotion to his childhood friend, Lily, and how he loved her so much that he was willing to sacrifice his good name and reputation to protect her legacy, ie, Harry Potter. Watch out for the scene when he uttered ""you have your mother's eyes"" before dying. It would make your viewing of Snape's memories that much more poignant. Unfortunately, that flashback was hastily done, and it does not give justice to Snape's dislike of James Potter. But I suppose for that to happen, the running time would have to be extended by another 30 mins. Alan Rickman owned Snape, and Snape owned Harry Potter.<br/><br/>The other standout performance was none other than Ralph Fiennes' Voldermort. He reminded me of that sadistic Nazi camp commander in ""Schinder's List"", a role which he excelled. You'll feel a chill in your spine even when all he needs to do is stare at you from the screen. A little girl about 6 who was sitting in the row in front of me grabbed her mother for dear life when he did this. Yes, he was that good.<br/><br/>Finally, you will understand the reason for the inter-twining of the destinies of Harry and Voldermort, which happened on the night James and Lily were killed.<br/><br/>All in, this is a fitting and well deserved conclusion to a saga which needed a full 10 years to unfold."
"bretboonnofan","Null","1","2","15 July 2011"," this movie is everything it should be
","I have just gotten back from the midnight screening of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two. I gave my full attention to it and was very perplexed and entertained by it. The movie was extremely well received by the hundreds I watched it with, and received high emotional reactions as well raving conversations. Big fans might want to bring a tissue box or two. This movie starts out right were it left off in part one. It go's right into things, but you aren't at any lose of memory, and if you are the film cleverly reminds you subliminally. There is not a moment that fades interest. in the begging I did find the dialogue a little bland, things were happening fast and were generally had a unattached feeling to the rest of the movie, thus the only reason I give it a nine instead of a ten. Things really get into the beauty of what makes this movie what it is, which is the characters and the story. This movie hits all the emotions with still knowing what it. you could be crying over dead friends or friends brought back, or clapping with the audience while Neville slays Negini, or Mrs.Weasly kills Belatrix, and when there is the spontaneous kiss scene between Ron and Hermoiny, all releasing 7 movies worth of tension. Concerning the fact that they split this into two parts; I think it was a good move. this movie does something its predecessors couldn't do, which is fit in loose ends. back in the third movie some would whine about things that were left out. This second half takes care of all that. i'm guessing the screen writer had a list and would have to make sure everything was included in a flowing way making sure it did not cross the thin line of forcing it to make fans happy. some might argue that some things happened that were not in the book. true, but please, its a movie, it dose some things for cinematic effect. If you wanted to see a movie exactly like the book then film yourself turning pages for three days, movies have a movie feel, get over it and enjoy it. This film dose everything its supposed to do and i would be surprised if it left a fan disappointed. its is a hell of a story and a work of cinematic art. a must see, and one of the greatest blockbusters we've had in a long time. harry potter is truly astounding"

The only thing I was disappointed with was how long it took for part 2 to came out after part 1.

"anders-rock","Null","2","8","13 July 2011"," A worthy ending
","For ten years I have been waiting for this and now it's finally here: The epic conclusion of the Harry Potter franchise and it's worth the wait. Why only 7 stars? I felt that the movie had a little too many plot threads to handle in the end. For instance when Harry goes into the hall with all those dead characters we know and might love and you sit there thinking: ""How did that happen?"" and you get no explanation. It was a while since I read the book so I didn't remember that much. It also scratched the surface of Dumbledore's past without really diving into it and if you ask me they shouldn't have included it in the movie at all because it didn't have the running time to flesh it out properly. But the positive point definitely outweighed the negatives. The acting was terrific from all parts. If Daniel Radclife starts acting in roles which do not resemble the Harry Potter character and keeps doing it he surely will be remembered as not only Harry Potter but a good actor. Emma Watson and Rupert Grint supported him perfectly. I also love Alan Rickman in anything he does and this is no exception and Ralph Fieness as Voldemort was a pleasure too. The action was really well done, the effects were splendid and you really gave a damn about what was going on even if you read the book and knew what was goiing to happen. The final confrontation between Voldemort and Harry was actually way better than in the book where I really thought Rowling copped out but this was thrilling! The ending bit was also very touching until the last ten seconds where my theater had technical difficulties and the screen went green. If you like Harry Potter you have to see this movie for obvious reasons and I tell you it's a good time some script problems aside."
"sivadparks-89786","5","1","3","13 March 2016"," As a fan of the book, I couldn't be more disappointed.
","While I can't give an F because it's still a well made movie, there is so much I hate about this. I've read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows nine times. This does the book no justice. There's a ridiculous amount of effects that don't belong in the movie, discontinuity and missed potential. They seriously traded in an epic battle in the great hall for Voldemort slapping Harry. I wrote down a list last time watching and was able to find over a hundred legitimate problems I had with the movie. Worst of all is this movie had no depth. The book has beautiful themes of love that are entirely absent from this movie. This is even more bothering when you go back to the first three movies which touch on this theme so not only is it ignoring the book, but also the precious movies. In the first, Dumbledore has a moving speech about the scar love leaves and in the book Harry sacrifices himself with this intention. The movie wastes this potential with a corny scene that has no impact on the themes and characters. The entire movie is loaded with these types of ridiculous changes. It doesn't deserve half the love it gets."

","I don't like this one, because for me something is missing.<br/><br/>I think there are 4 main characters: Harry: we know a lot about his past and we follow him during the books/movies. He's the main character but not the most exciting.<br/><br/>Voldemort: he's the opposite. In the beginning we know only a few fact about him and we discover how he became evil. There is a lot of psychology behind him.<br/><br/>Snape is like Voldemort but we didn't know about him nothing for sure until the end. Then that moment, his apotheosis... He has always been a nice person until his disappointment in Lily. Then he became introvert and met the evil. And changed. But deep inside he still remained good. And finally his goodness won.<br/><br/>Neville: yes, he. In the books, there are only a few lines about him but those are the most traumatic. The tragedy of his parents, his clumsiness... And the one who beheaded the snake... He experienced the biggest character development. He's my real MVP.<br/><br/>What is missing is the background of Snape, Neville and Voldemort. The movie is fascinating, the actors and actresses did an excellent job, but it's nothing compared to the books."
"egen38","6","1","3","12 August 2012"," What we got is great, however, there are crucial moments missed out
","First and foremost I would like to commend Dame Maggie Smith on her excellent award-worthy portrayal of Minerva McGonagal, in this film she transforms from the cruel, although sweet, teacher into a loving mother- like figure to Harry. The scene where she stands up against Snape left me with goosebumps, and in the final fight scene her face was priceless. Maggie Smith gave the best performance in this film without a doubt.<br/><br/>I really do like this film, i thought the special effects were great and realistic, especially the flight scene with Harry and Voldemort. And the acting was A*, standout performances from Maggie Smith, Matthew Lewis, Julie Walters, and as usual Daniel Radcliffe shone.<br/><br/>However, i really did expect more, since i have read the books. Vital scenes which would have increased my rating from a six to a nine were left out, such as;<br/><br/>1)The scene in the Ravenclaw common room, where Harry casts the cruciatus curse on Carrow was left out.<br/><br/>2) Snape's memories were squashed into a 1 minute scene, where loads of details were left out.<br/><br/>3) in the books the final scene took place in the great hall, as it should have in the film, the fight between Molly and Bellatrix was good, but voldemort's reaction to the death of his 'most loyal servant' wasn't shown.<br/><br/>4) there should have been more individual fight scenes, like in the books where Sybil is throwing crystal balls, or where Kreacher leads an army of house-elves to war. <br/><br/>Overall, i did like this film and the quality of the film was absolutely outstanding, however, the missing parts which i think are vital prompt me to give it a 6 out of 10. It was though, and commendable end to the franchise"
"Kubris","8","1","3","24 June 2012"," Oh, the childhood
","10 years after it began, the Harry Potter films concluded with a two- part finale. I grew up with Harry Potter: there are pictures on my wall of me as him for Halloween, I remember going to several Harry Potter- themed birthday parties, and I have specific memories of reading the first and last books. So I was prepared for an emotional conclusion. Hell, if Lord of the Rings (something I liked but was never been invested in) could move me, surely this backbone of growing up could.<br/><br/>Not quite. Part II gets a lot right, but I feel like many things didn't live up to their potential, and the film didn't take itself seriously enough.<br/><br/>The good: there is a well-done conclusion for one of the best literary series of all time. The key points are there. Visually, everything is stunning as it has always been. And the performances, something I never paid attention to, are excellent. Harry, Hermoine, Ron... all admirable, but the standouts are Ralph Fiennes, maybe the greatest villain actor of all time, as Voldemort at his strongest and most terrifying. And Alan Rickman as Snape, arguably the best character from the whole series, tragedy and true loyalty personified.<br/><br/>Major points for including a throwback scene to my favourite of the films, The Chamber of Secrets. I remember seeing that one and being scared silly.<br/><br/>But then the issues... first of all, the film is short. There was time to expand aspects of the film. Which leads to the next problem, which is that the support cast doesn't get very much screen time. Hagrid offers two lines. The aforementioned Snape, in his most important book/film, sees three scenes. But the cuts don't end there: the final battle doesn't feel as satisfying as it does. The Weasleys have two emotional scenes during it, and both are glazed over. Neville's time to shine also doesn't feel proper.<br/><br/>And then there's the ironically distracting movie magic. The hero climbing up from the destroyed bridge. How many times can Harry and Voldemorts wands' stop their beams right in the middle in an epic duel? By the end the effect is predictable. <br/><br/>Also the film adds humour where humour definentley should not be. I remember that starting with Goblet of Fire the change to tone to being much darker, and in fact I didn't quite like the change. But now I'm more mature, and feel that this one tried to lighten up the tone, but unsuccessfully. McGonnagel has some real bad lines in particular. <br/><br/>So Harry Potter is done, but I felt it went out with more of a flipendo than a rictusempra. The epilogue is nice and touching, but failed to have 'oomph' like Lord of the Rings. A legendary series with a satisfactory send-off. 7.7/10"

It's far better than part 1 and the action sequences are praisingly exciting.'Avengers Assemble' didn't need to beat it as the box office record that was the 3rd highest grossing film of all time but took this down a level lower because it shouldn't ridiculously be as successful as this. Although the 3D was an unpleasant experience David Yates(director) has the soul of an epic conclusion. An aspect of characters and relationships that return for the last time. Full of untold flashbacks and spellbinding visual effects, this film has to end with a big bang, laughter, excitement and sadness. Goodbye Harry Potter.

""Part 1"", on the other hand, did have it's fair share of fight scenes but also had a more diverse plot, a diversified setting, and more focus on the characters. <br/><br/>Of course, I know that ""Part 2"" was technically supposed to be focused on battle scenes as the second half of the novel is also focused on, well, battle scenes, I still feel that the filmmaker could done more than just fill most of the movie with large scale CGI battles, magical projectiles and explosions. <br/><br/>If you enjoy visual effects, this movie is perfect for you.

","I don't really know how to describe this movie, so I'll make use of my Spanish and say that Part II was ""asi-asi"". Yes, it is arguably the greatest saga ever told, probably the greatest I will be alive for, but as a stand-alone movie, it was mediocre. The writers/director overlooked numerous subplots from the book, and the movie felt a little impersonal. When the big battles come, and you are watching characters you fell in love with almost a decade ago meet an untimely end, you don't get very emotional like you should because it all happens so fast. Half of the heartfelt moments of the movie are basically summed up in one or two lines with melodramatic acting/writing. Not a terrible job by any of the actors, but this movie deserved a better effort all around. Not Oscar worthy in the least bit, not epic enough in the least bit, but not worth avoiding. Despite all my negative words, I do not believe this movie did harm to the Potter series, it just should have been better. I give it a 7/10 because I still enjoyed my movie going experience."

","All of the Harry Potter films have been phenomenal, but this one stands out. Part 1 has been noted to lack action, but Part 2 is a masterpiece! Everyone knows the story, Harry, Ron and Hermione are hunting for the last Horcruxes, which are Voldemort's secret to immortality, and everything ends with the final, epic battle between Harry and Voldemort. The film follows the book brilliantly, but I have to admit the beginning felt a little rushed. Many fans, including myself, expressed disappointment in the fact that many scenes are missing, such as Dumbledore's back story and Fred Weasley's death, which makes many parts of the film confusing for people who haven't read the books, but nevertheless, Harry Potter goes out with a bang. I loved the final duel between Harry and Voldemort, which doesn't happen in the book, and was completely action packed and utterly brilliant. Ron and Hermione's kiss was long awaited and doesn't disappoint, although keeping it the same as in the book would probably have been better. The scene in the Great Hall where Harry, Ron and Hermione mourn Fred, Lupin and Tonk's deaths is extremely emotional, but as I said, showing Fred's death would have been better, partcially as those who haven't read the book may be confused as to which Weasley died. His death in the book is such a powerful moment between the Weasley's, mainly Percy, who in past films abandoned his family, and the whole moment just brings them all together. The scene still brought tears to my eyes as both Fred and George are my favourite HP characters. Another of my favourite scenes is when Harry has the Resurrection Stone and is reunited with his parents, Sirius and Lupin. Although I have to say, the best moment in the entire film was Snape's memories. Alan Rickman seriously deserves an Oscar for his performance! The scene really pulls things together, revealing Snape's past and many other things. Oh, and the epilogue scene was very good. Personally, I would have liked it to be longer and feature more of the moments in the book, such as formal introductions to Harry and Ginny's and Ron and Hermione's children. I would have also have loved to see Teddy Lupin, who I was looking forward to seeing, as well as James running up to his family and shouting out that Teddy and Victoire were kissing. When Harry hugged his youngest son, Albus I cried a little inside. Arthur Bowen is the perfect choice for Albus Potter, and I adore the scene between them. That ending makes me wish that JK Rowling writes another HP book, this time about Albus's first year at Hogwarts. The epilogue is another of my favourite scenes, and I love the fact that they kept the original music from the Philosopher's Stone as well. When watching that scene I held onto my friend and we both cried. Overall, the best possible way to end the Harry Potter films. That was an incredible decade and will never be forgotten. Thank you JK for sharing this with the world! xx"

","Saving the BEST for last ... the final film of the Harry Potter saga (8 films over a ten year span!!!) is rather monumental in what it achieves.<br/><br/>By far the most grown-up and mature of the films (which, after the last couple, IS saying something), HP and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 has a high death toll (readers of the books won't be shocked by this) and the entire film is a fitting farewell to one of the world's most favorite literary and cinematic heroes of ALL time. *sniff sniff* <br/><br/>Who'd have thought the tale(s) of the bespectacled boy wizard, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), and his two best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) -- first-conceived on a pub napkin! -- would have made for such gripping celluloid? The Deathly Hallows Part 2 has EVERYTHING wanted in a good film (action, drama, romance, suspense, good dialogue, chemistry, great characters, some hearty laughs and some stifled tears). This film -- as directed by David Yates (he has directed the final 4 Potter films) -- is a tribute to such a fine character (and ALL of the supporting players LARGE and small), a tribute to Ms. Rowling, and a tribute to the millions (billions?) of loyal Harry Potter fans the world over.<br/><br/>In addition to our dependable trio, Deathly Hallows Part 2 gives ample (enough) screen time to several Potter supporting players. Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) FINALLY gets to shine/step-up like his three classmates; Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) gets a Yoda-Moment (awesome-ness!!!); Mrs. Weasley (Julie Walters) gets to deliver the book/film's BEST line of dialogue; the batty Bellatrix LeStrange (Helena Bonham Carter) vamps evil craziness as her master, Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), seethes hate. Ever-so-brief glimpses of Hogwarts classmates and professors (like Emma Thompson's Sybil Trelawney) is also pleasing to loyal fans of the previous films. The most notable new addition to the cast is Kelly MacDonald who -- as Helena Ravenclaw -- gives House Ravenclaw their most-important role in the entire film franchise (just-in-time, I'd say).<br/><br/>It may sound dumb; but this final film is EPIC on several levels ... and that ""epic-ness"" is different for every viewer -- and that is one of the reasons Potter is so special (his/the film's ""connection"" is different for every fan). This franchise is no fantasy fluff ... it has graduated (with honors!) to classic cinema that will endure for all time.<br/><br/>Seeing this cast grow-up in front of us has been both a marvel and a treat (with nary a Lohan-moment amongst them!!!); and it also makes many of the faceless deaths in the film more resounding as we realize most of them were mere children who's bravery and heroics cost them their lives as they stood-up for GOODNESS in a world wrought with evil (damn you, Voldemort!).<br/><br/>There are moments in this film that make the audience feel proud of the heroics on screen and ALL of it makes us thankful. Thank you, Harry Potter ... thank you for forever. You've made magic happen."

","I know that I am behind everyone else, but I just saw Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 tonight. It's the final film in this good but mostly great series. Its been fun growing up with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, and Emma Watson, and luckily after eight films the series still has plenty of surprises. They've saved the best for last.<br/><br/>This one continues exactly where Part 1 left off. Harry, Ron, and Hermione(Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson) are continuing their deadly journey to find the 7 hidden horcruxes of Lord Voldemort's(Ralph Feinnes). The horcruxes are the pieces of Voldemort's soul, which they need to destroy in order to defeat him.<br/><br/>After escaping from Gringott's bank, the trio ends up back at Hogwarts for their final stand against evil. And the people around Harry risk their lives for him, and he must come to terms(though he already sort of has) and prepare for battle.<br/><br/>Ever since I left the theater, I haven't been able to stop thinking about this marvelous film. The series is about magic, friendship, and love, and I was so moved by The Deathly Hallows Part 2 you wouldn't believe it.<br/><br/>I have loved many chapters in the series, and some of them have just been good, but none have ever been quite like this one. The special effects are top notch, the love stories are very endearing, the film is never boring, and the acting is excellent.<br/><br/>Aside from the three leads, who started off as nobodies and turned into fine young actors, the supporting actors are great too. Such as Ralph Feinnes, who always adds a bit of menace to his roles and is always chilling as a bad guy.<br/><br/>But the best performance is from Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, the mysterious professor. I wouldn't be surprised if Rickman got an Oscar nomination for his brilliant work here. He really is a great actor.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows part 2 is especially a masterpiece for two main reasons: One, it answers things that we've wanted to know since the very beginning, and there are even many surprises thrown in. And two, the film brings back almost every character, even the dead ones. And most of them kick ass, even Maggie Smith who's nearly 80. There hasn't been a better series conclusion since The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King.<br/><br/>The series has ended with a bang. This is the finest film of the series, and will go down in film history. I loved every second of it, even the epilogue. This series has earned its fame, and now that its over, Harry Potter and friends can live long and prosper. The film will make you laugh, and even cry, but hopefully, you'll love it as much as I did. The best film of the year so far.<br/><br/>A"
"tomhiscox3","10","1","3","19 July 2011"," Well Done.
","Let's be honest, a certain amount of 'die hard fans' of the books were always going to come on here, knocking the film and being completely ridiculous, that's predictable enough. Ignore them, they're silly. It's a bloody wonderful movie, one I would be happy to watch again and again, and I LOVE the books. It's a different medium, there are differences! And people talking about Crabbe just 'disappearing', well, the actor was arrested for drug charges? So no Harry Potter for him. But it is brilliant. Yes, some things were rushed, yes, some things didn't quite happen as expected. But it would be boring to watch a film that's exactly the same as its book. And 'die hard fans' should love it anyway, because... Well, it's Harry Potter."
"adambogoch92","9","1","3","18 July 2011"," ""Do not Pity the Dead, Harry. Pity the living, and above all, all those who live without love.""
","Love. The main theme of all the Harry Potter films, and novels. It is also why this series works. The cast and crew... and Rowling, love these characters, and this world. So we are meant to love it too. <br/><br/>I had my hopes up, growing up, expecting the catharsis of what feels like graduation from childhood, dreams, and magic. And being a fan of the adaptations of J.K.'s novels to film, I had high hopes. Were they met? Mostly, yes.<br/><br/>I do think in many ways this picture was stolen by Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman. It is so obvious how fine an actor Ralph is... he's done some pretty stellar work. Here, he is menacing and truly 'evil'. He does this well. However it is the two sides of him we had yet to see in his interpretation of Voldemort that impressed me most. His dark wit, and his utter vulnerability and fear of his own demise. This is so evident in his performance. One of the greatest antagonists of all time. Bravo Ralph!!!<br/><br/>Alan's character, Snape has obviously been a fan favourite and his big reveal has been much awaited. What a great character by Rowling, and what a great performance from Rickman, he plays him with such inner conflict. He shows that no mater what genre a film is, good acting... is good acting. <br/><br/>In this apocalyptic reunion film, we get to see the group of talent faces that have joined this series over the last 10 years. The cast is a true accomplishment. They are, without a doubt, the finest actors out there. Even in smaller roles, Maggie Smith shines with love, the down Jason Isaacs, the lovable Julie Walters, the intelligent Michael Gambon, and Robbie Coltrane who is viciously underused but still the lovable Hagrid we grew up with. But my all time favourite goes to the wickedly evil, Helena Bonham Carter as Bellatrix Lestrange. She is underused... that is a downfall of this picture. She is talked about more then she is present. Oh well, she makes the most of what she is given. Bonham Carter not only gets to play the sadistic woman madly in love with Voldemort (we get to see a little more of this), but she gets to play Emma Watson's Hermione as well. Helena you are my all time favourite actor, and you do Potter proud!<br/><br/>A big hand out to other underused, but much appreciated faces of the Potter family, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Miriam Margolyes, the remarkable Jim Broadbent, Warwick Davis (not so under used... but still), John Hurt, Mark Williams, Kelly Macdonald, George Harris, Emma Thompson, Gemma Jones, David Bradley, Ciaran Hinds, and the finally used Helen McCroy... she does a good job here.<br/><br/>The youngest cast members have not only grown up with us, but also turned into talented young actors. Harry Potter himself, Daniel Radcliffe... who I liked but often found wooden, does great work here! As an actor he deals with some of the more difficult emotions... again he does this so well here! Bravo Daniel. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson (who is so beautiful) feel like the audience's best friends as well as Harry's. I can't think of a better compliment. And their much awaited kiss... is absolute perfection. Bonnie Wright's Ginny feels present and talented. Evanna Lynch has a great career ahead of her, her Luna is eccentrically groovy. Tom Felton is typical... he's given stuff to do... I guess, and he does a good job of what he has. Matthew Lewis has screen time. Kloves wrote well for him, and his delivery is sweet and courageous. His exchange with Voldemort in the courtyard, as Bellatrix laughs in the background, is one of the best scenes in the series!<br/><br/>As for the other familiar faces of the Hogwarts students, good and bad, a shout out to you guys!<br/><br/>Technically ""Deathly Hallows part 2"" is completely Oscar worthy. I do not pass this sentiment off easily. But it is. Cinematorgraphy is stunning, striking strong imagery. The production design is absolutely flawless, with such incredible detail that not everyone sees, you my friends need an Oscar! The editing is sharp, and the sound design is terrific. But what steals it all is Alexandre Desplat's touching score. It evokes true emotion, throwing in enough of John William's score, but also adding his own mark on Harry Potter history.<br/><br/>The writing is the best it's been and never rushed. The direction by Yates is wonderful. You can tell he truly cares about the characters and what they're going through. Would I have liked him to show more of the supporting cast, especially during the battle... yes, but we all can't get what we want.<br/><br/>There are times where it feels a little rushed, the whole film could have been 10 minutes longer, and most of my issues could have been fixed by that. A couple plot holes, nothing major, but a couple. <br/><br/>A huge thank you to all the cast and crew, every single person who put their heart and soul into this film, and the series it concludes. You have brought forth J.K.'s world, creating one that was easily attainable to children, but also philosophically for all ages. We deal with some huge themes here, love and death being the biggest.<br/><br/>This is a fantastic, gripping, incredibly poignant and tender film, with all the magic and wonder of the first, and the excitement and climax of what the last film should be! <br/><br/>See this film in 2D, as it should properly be seen."

The cinematography extremely well done, the art direction was incredible. The movie was beautiful to look at, the visuals were spectacular and truly Oscar worthy!

"grandad4","7","1","3","17 July 2011"," Did I watch the same film as the majority who have reviewed this?
","OK well only a short review, but seriously this feel was good at best. It was hyped up so much that I was expecting a lot more than what I got. The most disappointing part for me was the fight between Harry and Voldemort. It just didn't connect like it did in the book. It was a good end to the series, but seriously, to end the main time line by them holding hands and having the camera fade out? Couldn't be more cringe-worthy. Sure there was a few laughs now and then, but that is expected with the type of story the book tells.<br/><br/>The thing that really gets me is the score it currently has, which is (8.7). I mean I expected it to drop in the past few days but it hasn't. How many blind potter fan boys have just been raping 10 stars? It doesn't deserve the ratings it gets. Which its current 8.7 it will be put in the top 20 on the IMDb list. Really? That would put it above classics such as Se7en which this film can't even touch.<br/><br/>Overall It was a good film, but no way near the amount of positivity it is getting from the blind Harry Potter fans that are writing these reviews."

Ron's Mom got to kick ass and the theater raised the roof on her invective to Bellatrix! Dumbledore was heavenly. And Snape, Severus Snape, undoubtedly one of cinemas all-time character roller-coaster rides. Is he? Isn't he. He did? He didn't! I really felt for this guy, and that he is Lily's soul-mate is beyond touching. It would have been nice to have had sentimental wraps for more characters like Hagrid, Buckbeak, even Draco, but HP7II is not about being sappy. I felt completely engaged, fulfilled, and even a bit exhausted after this excellent film. This experience has deep lessons to offer, and I'm on my way to check it out again now. Undoubtedly I will see this movie more in it's first-run theater showing, than any other film. Lifetime achievement Oscars for the whole lot, I say! Mischief Managed!"

But David Yates' The name speaks for itself. God bless him for bringing in such a complicated book into a great finale! This movie has every reason to win an Oscar.Its shame if Alan Rickman didn't get the Oscar this time.<br/><br/>I appreciate there work on converting a 2D movie into 3D. Did a convincing job. Not too good but acceptable. I love the way movie starts.The score ""lily's theme"" is composed very well. Halena did very good job as Hermione!the Gringot's scene was one of the highlight of the movie. As the go to Hogwarts' I was like ""WOE Hogwarts so fast"". And I see many complaining for not showing Dumbledore's past. All i can ask is why is that needed? :s From there on the goosebumps stuff's starts! When harry walks in room of requirement, It was just like our hero is back.I had that feeling.<br/><br/>And there is a scene when harry walks out of the group towards Snape and the whole order comes out of the entrance.It sure was very well directed.<br/><br/>Then harry says the best lines of the movie.<br/><br/>""HOW DARE YOU STAND WHERE HE STOOD!! HOW ABOUT YOU TELL TELL THEM HOW IT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT HOW YOU LOOKED HIM IN THE EYE THE MAN YOU TRUSTED AND KILLED HIM"" <br/><br/>And Magie smith stole the show with her performance.

The score from Alexander Desplate for this scene was mind blowing!<br/><br/>Nevill was given a great role and Showed his courage and he stole the show for sometime. And Snape dieing in Boat house rather than Shrieking shack was a great move.The way Nagini Bit him and tears in his eyes were really hard to take in.<br/><br/>I was not really impressed by the kiss between Ron and Hermione.But that really didn't bother me. The prince's tale was Best part of the movie. they used ""Dumbledore's farewell"" Done by Nicoles Hooper for Half blood prince.Which was the best move in the movie. I had tears in my eyes during the whole tale.When Snape's picks Lily in his hand and cries and baby potter had tears in his eyes.<br/><br/>hats Off David Yates and JKR!<br/><br/>The forest scene and the Meeting with Dumbledore were perfectly done. The final battle was too Good. Better than it was explained in book. Some complain saying he didn't give the speech to Voldemort which was in the book. But they already showed us that in Prince's tale,So what more you expect critic's? <br/><br/>The Epilogue scene was too cute to be left off! When harry says to his son about being in Slytherin Almost had tears in eyes. And it ended. Its Unbelievable how these movies Influenced in our lives.

"alexart-1","10","1","3","16 July 2011"," What My Childhood Died For
","I remember when I was five years old. I remember my mother reading Harry Potter to me, the way her hands turned the pages, the way she placed her bookmark in the book when she thought I had fallen asleep. I remember wanting to be Harry Potter. I was Harry Potter twice for Halloween, as a matter of fact, wandless and only armed with jack-o-lantern shaped box for keeping candy. And now, almost at age 18, I have created a new memory of my own, that of sitting next to my mother, and now my brother, in a dark theater, sobbing together at the thought that it really is the end of my favorite series, Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the near-perfect finale to one of the most beloved series ever written. David Yates has created the first, and unfortunately only, classic of the Harry Potter film series in a spectacular and emotional thrill ride. Dark, brooding, and downright suspenseful, Harry Potter ends with an enormous bang, one whose reverberations will be felt for years to come.<br/><br/>The bang that this movie creates only begins with its fine actors. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, and Rupert Grint have matured into real adult actors now. Once cute and dopey, the trio has now become truly magical at their profession. Though it's a spectacle to watch the chemistry between our three leads, they're overshadowed by an impossibly large supporting cast. Maggie Smith returns to give a sweet performance. Ralph Fiennes reprises his role as Voldemort and totally creeps us out. The real star of the show is, however, Alan Rickman. Finally, Rickman emerges from the depths of the great sets and shows his true acting chops as Snape. He's just fantastic to watch.<br/><br/>And the film is technically brilliant as well. The visual effects go heavy on the pyrotechnics, so why not throw in a little slow-motion while we're at it? And so David Yates does, but whereas most directors (other than Zack Snyder, that is) can't handle slow-motion, Yates does it perfectly. It's thrilling, and it's only aided by Eduardo Serra's cinematography. He's an expert at what he does: Serra loves playing with color, and it totally works in every way. Sometimes, the film is so drab looking that it almost becomes black-and-white. What Serra films is gorgeous. He's secured himself a nomination for Best Cinematography.<br/><br/>The film isn't without its flaws however. Steve Kloves' script is lacking as usual, placing far too much emphasis on action and not enough on the characters themselves. Humor is used improperly to lighten the otherwise moody atmosphere. That said, the way Kloves writes action, and the way Yates directs it, is marvelous.<br/><br/>While it can't help but feel as though there's a full half hour missing from the final cut, Yates and his team have made a brilliant film. I almost feel weird saying that a Harry Potter film is great. Mainstream films just shouldn't be this good, but thankfully, they still can be. Movie magic still does exist after all.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, no matter how many times we see these characters when we watch the movies or read the books again, they'll never be fully resurrected. It's the first time that matters the most. After that, it's never the same. Everything ends, unfortunately, and so does the Harry Potter series. I have grown so much with Harry Potter, but it's finally time to lay it to rest. Goodbye, Harry and crew. You'll be sorely missed."

","I was excited to go see this, and went to the midnight premiere. I knew I wouldn't be disappointed judging by the last 3 movies. It ended great, with most of the movie being a battle and destroying horcruxes. All the actors gave the last installment their best, especially Alan Rickman: During the penseive memory sequence toward the end, we actually see the truth behind Snape and Dumbledore, and ironically Snape was Harry's true guardian at Hogwarts. But we learn more about his past and why he resented but also cared so much about Harry. We actually see Rickman get out of his drone and interact with Gambon in these scenes. We get to see his vulnerability.<br/><br/>The biggest issue I have does not lie with this movie: It lies with the whole series. All 8 movies are great, but not very consistent with each other, the reason being the constant change of directors. It makes you wonder how the end would have been if Chris Columbus stayed for all of them, or if David Yates came in early and directed all of them. Fortunately none of the actors were replaced, even the small characters, (with the obvious exception of Dumbledore, which was unavoidable.) although many actors considered leaving which I'm personally grateful that they stayed. It was the only thing really keeping consistency. Of course the major complaint by everyone is all the things cut from the movies, which I'm not a fan of either, but at least it all worked.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows Was by far the best of all the movies, because it stayed true to sources while keeping the dark edge that was needed. The first two movies (Sorcerers stone and Chamber of Secrets) stayed true to source but were very childish. It makes sense, since as the characters mature, the movies mature with them, but going from bright and happy straight to dark and ominous in Prisoner of Azkaban...maybe they could have made the transition a little better. Regardless, these last two were fantastic, and the best ending I've seen to any franchise, especially since we get to see more of the characters get involved in the fight.<br/><br/>So definitely worth going to the theater, and definitely worth buying. So as a conclusion-Deathly Hallows 1&2 (since they are basically one long movie) 10/10. The Harry Potter series as a whole-7/10."

","This movie was definitely one of the best out of the eight. It included most major events and had effects that will blow your mind. As a true fan of the books I was a little angry at how they played out some of the battle. Here is my list 1) I wish they would have started the battle as they did in the book. It was similar but Snape never addresses the school and Harry, they only briefly meet in the hallway. 2) Some of the old characters that I was sooo excited to see return (Harry's old quidditch team, buckbeak) did not return as they did in the book. 3) There was a bit to much humor in certain moments that were supposed to be dark and intense. 4) They showed Fred dead but not his death, which was described in the book. They also left out the Weasleys' reunion with Percy, but it was expected as this conflict went back to the fifth book. Harry Going down to the Forbidden Forest, Harry never confronts anyone after he realizes what he has to do, as mentioned in the book Hermoine and Ron would have never let him go 5) The way Harry presented himself alive was different. In the book, Voldemort brings him up and gives his speech of liberation, and then and there Neville kills the snake, in which another fight breaks out. Harry slips on his cloak and watches as Hermoine, Ginny, and Luna battle Bellatrix and McGonnagal, Slughorn, and Kingsley battle Voldemort. The crowd gathers around these two fights until Molly Weasley steps in and kills Bellatrix. Voldemort then aims at her, until Harry protects her, revealing himself. Then they go on the circle each other and Harry explains why Voldemort cannot win. It was very intense in the book and it would to be in the movie. There was no chase scene around Hogwarts or diving off the tower, as there was in the movie Harry kills him and the Death Eaters run and the good storm Harry. In the movie no one sees him kill Voldemort and there really isn't a celebration. 6) Barely no Hagrid! I was beginning to think they left him out until they showed him tied up. I wish they showed him fighting. Also no Gwarp. (Hagrid's giant half-brother) 7) In the book Voldemort cannot feel when they destroy a Horcrux. 8) Voldemort kills Snape in the Shrieking Shack in the book but for some reason in the movie it was at the boathouse. That kinda bothered me. 9) If I had not read the books I would have been confused on the Tonks and Lupin relationship. They never actually say they got married or had a kid. Tonks mentions her husband and Harry later asks the ghost of Lupin about his son Teddy, who was never mentioned until that point. 10) They stayed away from the whole Dumbledore conflict, which i understand because it would have been hard to explain on top of everything else 11) Harry never breaks the Elder Wand, but uses it to repair his own, which was broken. He returns it to Dumbledore's grave and hopes that it will die with Harry, passing on to no one.<br/><br/>Things i did like 1) Shell Cottage was beautiful and just as imagined 2) Gringotts break-in was perfect 3) Aberforth 4) How secondary characters such as Luna, Neville, and Mcgonnagal shined and kicked ass 5) The protective enchantments and the death eaters trying to break through them and Voldemort just destroying them (not in the book but was a great addition) 6) The humor, I mentioned before there was too much, but they were very funny 7) Ron and Hermoines kiss...really captured it the way it was described in the book 8) Bellatrix, my favorite character is perfectly portrayed. They truly showed her wicked obsession with Voldemort 9) The Malfoys, they correctly showed there cowardliness as described in the book 10) The battle, although it was not spot on, it was very epic and included most major events, just in different orders. It was a great battle and confrontation between good and evil. 11) Snape's memory!! one of my favorite parts. Alan Rickman was FANTASTIC and they did a really good job of making him look younger. It was so depressing to see cruel, gloomy Snape break down in tears 12) The score, as usual, was perfect and emotional 13) The epilogue, it was basically spot on. I like how they included Malfoy too. <br/><br/>Though it may seem that I had many problems I thought their substitutes and changes were exceptional. They really did a fantastic job and they portrayed the story well. Readers will be very pleased with it. The actors in it are spot on and are beyond marvelous. One of my favorite movies ever! I will miss it soo much. Going to midnight premieres and what not. It is very bittersweet! GO See it!!!!!!!!!!!"
"ero-senin","10","1","3","15 July 2011"," A fitting farewell
","The movie was made in two parts with the objective of staying true to the book but while the first part of the Deathly Hallows seems to be extended, slow paced while the second part seems to have left some details & altered the others.These changes however make the movie more cinematic, easy to understand which would please most of the people.The people who were fans of the book however would be disappointed by certain lack of detail which was evident when the person sitting next to me at the theater was missing the ""Expelliarmus""(Harry's favorite/TM spell) & jumping at how harry finds the fifth horcrux was different. Though i agree on the part that the book had some rich detail which would have made some great scenes but despite of all this the main plot is still there & makes for an enjoyable movie with action paced scenes, great soundtrack & some moments of laughter. Yates delivers by focusing on visual details which results in mesmerizing & encapsulating battles & emotional scenes(like the one in the end) which would stay in the heart of people for many years. Movie is close to perfect & a fitting end to the story."

","Harry potter and the deathly hallows part 2 is definitely the best movie in the series. It starts from where it left off. The baddie Lord Voldemort has stolen the most powerful wand from Dumbledore's grave.<br/><br/>The trio is at Shell's cottage and strike a deal with the shrewd goblin for a Gringotts heist. Like the lead says, they plan, they go and all hell breaks loose and the same happens at Gringotts. The amazing roller coaster ride and the larger than life sets and scenes were so amazing that i was stunned without someone casting stupefy at me!!! The CGI dragon spitting fire and breaking out is one of the highlights.<br/><br/>Harry realizes that one of the horcruxes is at hogwarts, they enter hogsmeade and with Aberforth's aid they enter Hogwarts and try to find the horcrux but the sword of gryffindor is no longer with them. Mc Gonagall shows off her skills in a rather amusing way and so do the other teachers by casting a magical shield to protect Hogwarts. The war between good vs evil is as epic as it can get.<br/><br/>Amidst all the chaos, the trio destroy two of the horcruxes in another scene with incredible visual effects. Later Harry discovers the reason behind his connection with Voldemort with a last trip to the pensieve. The complete sequence is so very moving, my eyes welled up with tears even though I knew what was coming.<br/><br/>The final duel between Harry and Voldemort is, I must say, better than the book. So are a few other scenes, with only 130 minutes of screen time the movie is truly magical!!! The end was bittersweet and I was already roaring and cheering throughout the movie and the whole crowd stood and clapped at the end. The movie scenes are still on my mind and it will take sometime to sink in that there wont be another potter movie which will hit the theaters.<br/><br/>Neville and Molly get their scenes too and you would be cheering away madly at them. Daniel Radcliffe has definitely improved a great deal and gave an astounding performance while Emma Watson and Rupert Grint are great too. Alan Rickman, Micheal Gambon give honest performances and so does the rest of the cast. <br/><br/>What a way to end the series!! High on effects and high on emotions, the movie was incredible, amazing, stupendous, fantastic, mind-blowing, awesome and everything fans expect it to be....Do not miss it in IMAX 3D!!!!!! What an experience...!!! <br/><br/>Thanks J.K Rowling and thanks Warner Brothers for this wonderful wonderful series :)"
"BovieMuff-91","7","1","3","15 July 2011"," Its the little things that count
","To be very honest, I have never liked the movies but read the books dozens of times. From the point of view of a hardcore fan of the books, this was a disappointment. But, I looked at the movie in perspective once I got home from the theater, and realized it wasn't so bad after all.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie was exciting and fast-paced. Loved every minute of it. Snape's death especially was very touching, and what I would say was one of the high points of the movie.<br/><br/>Then I watched The Prince's Tale (for people who haven't read the books, that's Snape's memory segment). It was so short that a chapter that many would agree was the best in the entire series deserved a LOT more than just 5 minutes on the screen. So much so, that by the time it ended, some of my fellow viewers hadn't even taken their seats after the interval.<br/><br/>It's the little things in the movie I was disappointed with. Over the last 4 movies we have seen a trend wherein the jokes are the main focus. So when a movie of the importance of HP&DH2 came along, a serious affair such as a war against Voldemort ended up having moments of humor at the end of every scene, which I felt was quite inappropriate.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the movie would have to be, hands down, King's Cross. It did complete justice to the book, when you consider that they decided to leave out Dumbledore's past completely out of the movie.<br/><br/>My rating: 6/10 (hardcore fan of the books). Otherwise I'd have given it a 7."

","One word: WOW!!!<br/><br/>I saw the midnight screening (July 14) with my sister and we were quite thrilled with the movie. <br/><br/>SPOILER: This movie was about a famous wizard named Harry Potter. He survived when Voldemort killed him. According to someone, he was known to Voldemort ""The Horcrux that Voldemort Never Meant to Create"". Harry and his friends, Ron and Hermione, finished looking for the Horcrux in this movie. There was only one in the Hogwarts castle. <br/><br/>What was the most heartfelt moment of this movie was when Harry looked into the Pensieve. He took a tear from Snape and put it in the Pensieve. He learned the truth about Snape. He saw everything that happened that night when his parents were killed.<br/><br/>Finally, Harry learned what the final Horcrux was. It was...

","So well made,dark, totally exceeded expectations , tight screenplay and the splendid on-screen adaptation of The Prince's Tale, HP7.2 has finished a saga which kept us cheering and clapping in many of the jaw-dropping sequences...it was a first-day-first-show, and a house-full at IMAX 3D screen, and I was moved by the spirit of the people...the depressing Voldemort declaring Potter dead, brought a silence in the theater, but the next scene which followed, was so superbly shown that we were rooting: Go Harry! Daniel Radcliffe turned out to be a fine boy-wizard , his expressions were up-to-the-mark totally! Alan Rickman scored and Ralph Fiennes will forever be remembered as the darkest villain of all time! Not much to act by Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, but Matthew Lewis surprises( hit like striking a sixer by Sachin!)<br/><br/>A bit of imperfection was seen in the form of abruptness which Yates maintained...some scenes(mainly the important characters dying) needed some extra minutes, but I guess overall its passable as you cannot show each and every minute detail in a Finale...now those are complaining about such things, and hence calling the movie a disappointment, must know that, in this finale, each Potter-maniac is expectant of the action and if in view to achieve the book-readers' respect , the makers added every single details as given in the book, then the movie would have turned to be a disappointment(trust me, this review is being written by a person who grew up reading those novels) for sure. The winner in the movie are The Prince's Tale and the climax...the climax is the best one i have seen in any fantasy-movie so far, because it made us shudder even though we knew how it would end! Not only this would be a record-breaking commercial success, but I bet some Oscar nominations await too...respect for David Yates and Steve Kloves to keep this one the closest to the book!<br/><br/>Watch out for the pleasantly surprising epilogue and who knows? you might actually stand up and clap(like we did, yeah really), as you see the temporary blacked-out screen moments before end-credits roll... splendid end of an era... REPEAT-VIEWS, DEFINITELY!!! <br/><br/>And finally, a word of advise, people , don't be skeptical while watching this movie...just celebrate the ending and the aura of Harry Potter as it should be done for a franchise which lasted a decade and with which, most of us grew up...reading and watching alike!"
"timijan-tuparov","10","1","3","14 July 2011"," The Most Epic Conclusion Ever
","I must admit, I didn't like David Yates when he first entered the Harry Potter franchise, but this was phenomenal. I watched it and I loved it so much! It wasn't like the book, but it was better on screen that way. Very exciting, very touching (especially if you're a hardcore fan, like me) and very vivid vision of the last chapters of ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows"". I cried several times, I admit it, and I would never be ashamed to say I did, because ""Harry Potter"" is with me more than 10 years and I couldn't have imagine that it will end so perfectly on the big screen. I loved the Tale of the Prince, the scene where Snape was hugging Lily. I loved the kiss between Ron and Hermione in the Chamber of Secrets after they've destroyed the Horcrux. I loved the final battle between Harry and Voldemort, with all the extra, exciting scenes that weren't in the book. I loved the ending scene, with the old Harry, Ron, Hermione, Ginny and Draco. Basically, I loved the whole thing so much, that this is probably my favorite Harry Potter film - EVER. I cried at the ending seeing the old faces of my favorite heroes and I cried because there's no more Harry Potter. Thank you J. K. Rowling for creating this wonderful and magical world, that will always be my second home no matter what I do, wherever I go or which other book or world I discover. Thank you David Yates for finishing my favorite film series the way they deserve it. And thank you Daniel, Emma and Rupert for being the perfect Harry, Hermione and Ron. I will love you forever. Always."

"Buddy-51","8","1","4","19 February 2012"," Satisfying conclusion
","Thus endeth one of the most popular - and profitable - series in movie history. And the good news is that it ends more with a bang than with a whimper. For once we push through the clutter of wand-waving, spell-casting and jaw-dropping CGI effects that have been the hallmark of the works, we're left with a moving, deeply human tale of an honorable man (Daniel Radcliffe) putting his life on the line for those he loves.<br/><br/>The movie finally reaches the climax that the series has been leading to all along: the fight-to-the-death battle between Harry and his arch nemesis, Voldemort, the man who killed his parents. The one criticism one might have with this scenario is that it essentially reduces most of the other characters - including the lovable Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emily Watson) - to mere onlookers of the action.<br/><br/>As directed by David Yates, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Harrows - Part 2"" has drama and action to spare, but it's the human element - along with an epilogue that hits all the right notes - that brings the beloved series to such a satisfying conclusion."

When I saw part one I couldn't make sense of anything and just felt like it was a waste of time. I would have to say I'm glad I won't have to waste my time standing in line to see another lame Harry Potter movie. Good bye to them and I hope to never see anything along the lines of Harry Potter come out anymore. There was only one good few minutes of the movie and that was when the previews and credits were rolling."
"jacobi86","8","1","4","16 July 2011"," Review from a Non-Reader
","As a non-reader, I enjoyed the film. I have never read the books but have watched the other movies in the series. Compared to all of the previous, I believe that this was the best one out of all. It doesn't mean that it was fantastic but was a good solid movie.<br/><br/>What I most enjoyed from the movie was the sense of dread, action, and depth of emotion exhibited by the characters; plus, it was believable. In my opinion, the other movies failed to reach this endeavor by instead focusing on pretty CG effects.<br/><br/>The things that I didn't enjoy about it is first the virtual lack of musical score in the movie. I remember a few scenes but it was completely noticeable that you are left with ""dead air"" for most of the movie. I understand using this device to cause introspection and greater attention to what is happening; however, the whole movie attempted to utilize this, and by doing so, I believe it failed to achieve the aim. Secondly, the failure on explanation and exposition. It wasn't entirely clear what the characters were aiming to accomplish. The scenes appeared to be disjointed and didn't explain their motivations.<br/><br/>Yet, It was an overall solid movie and I recommend it for others to see."

","My husband and I saw the movie last night. It was good but a little disappointed, given all the hype. A couple of things<br/><br/>1) My husband found the loose ends were all too conveniently wrapped up. I think this may be how the movie skipped (rightfully) over the numerous backplots. <br/><br/>2) I don't normally compare the movies with the books because I usually have read them way in advance. However, the scene where Harry is looking over all those who died in the Hogwarts battle was much more emotional. I think their deaths were a little rushed. <br/><br/>3) The movie flowed very nicely tempo wise, but I found it lacked a bit of the atmosphere of fear and urgency that the other movies (esp 7.1) portrayed so well.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, we were (and the entire cinema) were captivated for the entire 2 hours. However, they could have taken an extra 20 mins to add in some emotion and elaborate some scenes or have found a way to make just one movie."

And, you know, I was about to cry when Snape was crying. I was like, BOO HOO D-; I will say it again, IT WAS AWESOME. Oh and crap when it was nineteen years later it was like aaaww its really over. Here is the beginning synopsis: After giving Dobby a proper burial at Shell Cottage, Harry speaks with Griphook the Goblin about breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts, as he believes that a Horcrux is hidden there. Griphook agrees to take Harry, Ron, and Hermione to Bellatrix's vault if they give him the Sword of Gryffindor in return. Harry then asks Ollivander, the wandmaker, to identify the wands they took from Malfoy Manor. Ollivander says they belong to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's wand has changed its allegiance to Harry. Harry then reveals that he knows Lord Voldemort has stolen the Elder Wand, the most powerful wand to ever exist, from Albus Dumbledore's tomb."

","I'm going to make this review as brief as possible. Deathly Hallows Part 2 was great. I went to see it last night at midnight, and i must say, i was blown away. I love music, especially musical scores in films; this movie had a GREAT musical score. The special effects were like nothing I've seen before in any of the Harry Potter films. The action sequences were fun and not too worn out,combined with the truly epic music, it made for some truly epic moments in the film. I have read every book and seen every film, so there were many moments where i found myself crying, and those tear-jerking moments nearly stole the film away, and might even have for other people. The final battle between Harry and Voldemort is insane, I found myself and many other on the edge of their seat as the showdown ensued, which only added another layer of epicness to the movie. There was stuff added and removed from the book version, but thats okay, to the common movie-goer who wants to see a Grade A summer film, they wont know the difference. David Yates did a great job directing and I wouldn't be surprised if this movie was Oscar nominated! <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 gets a 10/10 for its excellent action, epic music, mind blowing special effects, and some wonderful, tear jerking moments. I would highly suggest multiple viewings, because I sure will."

Even in hindsight, you couldn't pick anyone to do a better job with these characters.

While it does not follow the book like one would have liked, that is understandable as different things work for different mediums. The best by far was the WONDERFUL WONDERFUL acting of Alan Rickman as Snape, he is such an underrated actor. I hope that the academy will acknowledge his amazing attribution to this work of art, there is no question that an Oscar nomination is worthy.<br/><br/>The disappointment of the movie in my opinion was the lack of the final confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. Why change a good thing? the gorgeous prose that Rowling wrote would have played beautifully on screen, the beauty of the battle of words instead of the battle of weapons was a key point in the epitome of the whole series. But than again, you can never have everything you ask for ;) all in all, a major success!"

"patrick_ok","Null","1","4","14 July 2011"," Quite a good movie with a bit too much melodrama
","I've watched Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 2 free of any expectations - since I only read the first four books of the novels anyway -, which turned this experience into something quite enjoyable.<br/><br/>While it failed to keep me in suspense and had an ending I found to be somewhat disappointing with regard to showing the aftermath (considering it being kinda short while it is indeed the last part out of 8 movies), the feeling the movie left in me was warm. I regard the sum of several single sequences and scenes as the reason for this. Regarding present movies there is some rare kind of content here, especially within the aesthetic and atmospheric slow-pacing moments (which were emptier and thus much worse in the Deathly Hollows part 1). This time these moments seemed to be a perfect counterbalance to the action, with dialogues and statements that hint at you to think and reflect about them, e.g. the comments on the circumstances by various characters, for example the scene in the woods at the end. I love this!<br/><br/>Nonetheless there were other aspects that almost destroyed the whole experience because in some parts the movie tried too much to be emotional in a technical way by means of too many methods of dramatizing. I don't know if this is also a problem of the books, but at least the movie could have made it different. Anyway, this doesn't work:<br/><br/>I mean, excuse me, at least one scene thoroughly outclassed the often adapted cult-scene of someone kneeling on the ground in the rain with a dying love-interest in his/her arms and crying ""NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!"" up to the sky. Well, this time it's the same scene but with a crying baby watching behind a playpen's bars... I almost laughed at this point. The quintessence of such scenes being over-stimulation or the unintended destruction of any other feelings, which wasn't necessary. Especially with regard to such good and wealthy scenes as mentioned, which achieved to deliver their messages quite clear in spite of being subtle, which shows the common producers' illness of underestimating its audience just once again. But well, these aspects didn't win. All in all: Recommended!"
"jdesando","Null","1","4","13 July 2011"," Goodbye, Harry, Prince of Summer
","""I never wanted any of you to die for me."" Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) <br/><br/>There goes a decade of Potter watching, a 20 hour marathon of magic wands and ripening kids. Not a bad run (billions of dollars later) with characters likely to stay in our popular culture imagination indefinitely.<br/><br/>In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, we see what happens when Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) gets the Elder Wand, one of the three components of the Deathly Hallows that will give him omnipotence. My consistent criticism of the series has been its reliance on pyrotechnics when the intellectual combat is more rewarding. But then J. K. Rowling's series is about and for adolescents who live through the magic of being young and the youthful adults who people the theaters and read the books with them.<br/><br/>In this final chapter Harry (Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson), and Ron (Rupert Grint) are locked in the final battle with the Dark Lord, Voldemort, specifically trying to destroy his three Horcruxes and therefore his hold on immortality. Through all the fireballs and flame throwing, the most important element for me is the presence of death, even alluded to in the last part of the Dark Lord's name. The film carefully and maturely considers what James Joyce called the ""melancholy unity between the living and the dead."" Not only must Harry face his imminent death, he must also learn about the great circle of human sympathy that extends to the dead, with hands held out, so to speak, in brotherhood. Yes, we do see Dumbledore (Michael Gambon) and Harry's parents again, shades that they are, but substantial ones who stay with Harry in his final moments, as all our departed loved ones do in our minds.<br/><br/>The film is ultimately about growing up to meet the challenges of adulthood and death. It all ends with just the right emphasis on the circle of life and the reality of death.<br/><br/>Hats off to an enduring series that has asked kids to face maturely the biggest issues of life and have magical fun at the same time."
"markwoo","4","1","5","15 July 2011"," Good, but not good enough
","It is a truly sad reflection on the film industry that, with the commercial success of this film practically guaranteed, HP8 was not far better; especially with amount of CGI thrown at it. If you have read the book, then, most likely, you will find HP8 a rather pedestrian stroll through the main scenes, nothing more. Where there are changes, these detract from the book and some are positively dreadful! Potter fans beware. As for the final scenes with HP versus Voldemort, what an awful distortion of the book. I am astonished that JKR allowed such a travesty. The exploding bodies and snake were laughable. A scene that more closely followed the book would have really lifted the film but I guess the people behind the camera realised (if they had not had this horrible realisation ages ago) that Radcliffe simply could not have pulled it off. It is such a pity he was chosen the role he is far too wooden. That said, Radcliffe does perform slightly better in this one though, sadly that is saying very little. The final scene – 19 years later – should be cut, it was pathetic. I watched the 3D version and it added nothing so save your money and go and see the 2D one. The stand out performer of the series is Alan Rickman. It is a pity that Richard Harris died he was a far superior Dumbledore. I have given the film a very kind rating of 5."

It was more like ""oh i cant be bothered to be voldermort anymore and i'll just do a crappy job.""<br/><br/>The destroying of the cup hocrux was the worst. It was just a splash of water and nothing else. If it took them 1hr plus to find one hocrux and about another 30minutes to destroy it in the first movie. Why does it take like 15minutes to find one and 15minute to destroy one in the 2nd movie? That's just retarded.<br/><br/>And then there's the plot holes.

","Every now and then there comes a great movie that can't be explained without spoiling the events. This is one of them. Especially since this movie is the last one, closing the story of our four-eyed magician once and for all (maybe). How can I describe this movie without actually spoiling the content? (!!!) Well, I can't. I mean of course I can, but that would ruin the whole movie for you, and even though my heart is begging me to spoil everything, I want you to experience it for yourselves. I want you to feel the same way I did when I walked out of that cinema. And if you haven't read the book, do not worry since this is actually a great interpretation of the book unlike most of the previous movies (even though some minor things were off). I will give Harry Potter and the deathly hallows a perfect ten, and this based mainly on the flow of the movie. I loved the action, I loved the drama and I LOVED it all put together. But I will also give it perfect ten because of the way it made me feel. It made me feel sad on the sad moments, it made me feel happy on the happy parts, and it made my day at the end of the movie. Right now I only feel saddened because it is all over. But talk about going out with a bang!!!"

","The task of concluding a series like Harry Potter is immense and scary at that, but without doubt it has succeeded in concluding it with utter satisfaction. A great finale wrapping up many loose ends and completing characters.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie a lot more than Part 1, which at times dragged on and in general was paced extremely slowly, with some choices here and there.<br/><br/>But in general I loved part 2, faithful and with much better pacing. Sure, at some times predictable like Neville chopping off the snakes head which made the scenes with Hermione and Ron a lot less suspenseful, but I was alright with that for the character.<br/><br/>My last point would be that I would've liked some more focus and time on the actual death of Voldemort, the build up is excellent and extremely exciting but his death was quick and fleeting. I guess I wanted a little more focus on the actual death of the antagonist we've been fighting since day one.<br/><br/>The 19 years later scene was nice, even if it was a bit cheesy, but it was needed to really close off the storyline and show that the characters now life peacefully, and *can* life peacefully.<br/><br/>Definlity did not let down even though part 1 gave me doubts.

There is a huge info dump between the two acts of the Battle of Hogwarts which was a bit annoying.<br/><br/>2. I think the book could have been more evenly cut. Personally, I think that the Gringots sequence should have been put in Part One so that everything outside of Hogwarts happened there, and everything in the Hogwarts happened here. That would mean more focus could be put on the Battle of Hogwarts and make it that bit more epic.<br/><br/>3. The second half of the battle was a bit underwhelming.<br/><br/>9/10"

","I remember watching the first movie of this series in the theaters when I was a child. Now that the series has completed, what am I to do? Harry Potter has changed so many lives of all ages who were hooked. It made us to believe in magic and wizards. The way they ended the movie was nothing short of the book. It definitely did it honor. From paying tribute to the famous Hogwarts, to revealing Snapes true nature, the movie pulled on our heartstrings. When they announced they were splitting the last book into 2 movies, it made sense. Ending the movie series this way kept the audience at the edge of our feet. We wanted more. Yearned more. Curious to see how the second movie would play out. Although it took 7 movies to finally complete Hermoine and Ron's relationship, at least we got to see that envelop! However, I'm not much of a fan of Harry's love interest. The movie didn't really developed their relationship. It just all seemed to rushed. As a believer of dreams, I felt like the good guys deserve more when it comes to their love story, but then again, he was the ""chosen one"" to be last puzzle piece to Voldermort's fate. When the movie revealed that Harry was indeed a horcrux, that was a hair-rising scene. In fact, the entire movie was a hair-riser. Part 2 gave the fans a chance to have closure with the conclusion of this series. Always Remember."

","I have now finished the harry potter films in preparation for fantastic beasts and where to find them. So I have watched the deathly hallows part two and after a bit of a disappointing part one this film really had to deliver and yes this film is fantastic. The premise of the film sees harry, Ron and Hermione on the search for the remaining horcruxes and getting ready to take on voldermort's forces. Daniel Radcliffe really delivers a fantastic performance in this film as harry as you see him finally stepping up to the plate and becoming a true leader of the wizards against voldermort's. Emma Watson and Rupert grint really encapsulate the characters of Hermione and Ron, there chemistry together really works and there development feels very personal along with Harry's. Ralph fienes finally gets the time to shine as lord voldermort an he is a great villain that truly works perfectly for this film. I just wish maybe we could have seen more of him over the franchise. Alan rickman gets time to really shine as snape in this film and his character probably has the best development over this film and maybe even the whole franchise. All the other supporting characters especially Neville get time to shine and they give great finality to the characters. The story has some great moments in it, you feel the epicness of the final confrontation and the character development throughout this film. My only negative in this film is that the film towards the end possibly rushes some of the important story arcs but overall I did like the story. The script has some great drama in it and as I mentioned before it really helped make the finality feel more strong in this film. There is a slight lack of humour but in this film I actually think it made this film more serious and epic. The style of this film is probably the best of the franchise with excellent action scenes and overall better pacing then previous films. So that is it a fantastic finish to a great franchise that you should experience yourself."

","Before all this, I was a great Star Wars fan, but there is so much more ""depth"" to this entire series of books and movies. There are many great plot synopsis reviews here and on the web, so I will stick to just a few highlights and comments. Vodemort, having desecrated Dumbledore's tomb, steals the most powerful ""Elder"" wand, but it later turns out that he is not it's true owner, as Draco killed Dumbledore and Harry defeated him. Dumbledore was stricken with a fatal spell anyway, so it is more of a mercy-killing than a murder, but that's yet another story. There is a touching scene where Harry gets to meet both of his dead parents through a Resurrection Stone hidden inside of the ""Snitch"". Voldemort eventually discovers that the Elder Wand does not cooperate and won't obey all his commands. He kills Harry Potter, as Harry is the unwilling recipient of a part of Voldemorts' soul. He dies, but meets Dumbledore at a ""half-way-station"" on the way to Heaven. He is given the choice to return to the living or move on to the next level of existence. He chooses life. There is a huge battle scene. Both Hogsmeade and Hogwarts are destroyed and many Death Eaters and good Wizards are killed in this battle. As Hagrid carries Harry (who appears dead) he springs back to life and has a ""Wizards' Battle to the Death"" with Voldemort, as the last Parsal-Snake is killed with the Magic Sword of Griffindore. Harry wisely destroys the Elder Wand by breaking it in half, and throws it into the water, as not even a Wizard should have that much power or live forever. In the epilogue, Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermione send their children to Hogwarts 19 years later. A most satisfying ending and Draco sends his white-haired son to Hogwarts as well! A long but very fast-moving action film that is totally spell-binding!"

","Wow. Just wow. I am a Harry Potter super fan and so when I watched the movies before this I loved them. Going into this I thought that they could never finish it in a satisfying way. Boy was I wrong. This may be my favourite movie of all time. I said it. Characters The characters are all amazing. They are played by some of the best actors ever: Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman and Alan Rickman (RIP). With a cast like that playing at their best you can't get much wrong. And Emma Watson as Hermione is amazing as well. Hero Harry Potter is a great hero. He is just a great character who isn't always amazing at everything. And Dan Radcliffe holding his own in a cast like this is absolutely amazing for someone that young. Villain Ralph Feinnes is amazing as Voldemort. He is creepy, calm, scary and you also realise that he is crazy. He is one of the best villains ever and is the Ying to Harry Potters Yang. It's like Batman and Joker, Luke and Vader they are one of the best hero and villain relationships. Action The action is absolutely amazing from the Gringotts robbery to the Room of requirement fight to the Hogwarts battle to Harry vs Voldemort. It is all great and I'm not a giant fan of tonnes of CGI but many of the explosions are real and the CGI is amazing. Plot The plot is great. It wraps up all of the Horcrux stories really well and I love the Snape subplot. It is such an emotional movie. From the character deaths to the ending but the most tearful moment is Snapes memories which is so beautifully done and emotional. The ending is very bittersweet as you say goodbye to all these amazing characters.

","The first movie had an amazing expansive world to set its story in. The problem was, it focused more on the building OF the world than the story IN the world. <br/><br/>The second movie also had this problem, although to a significantly lesser degree. Here, the story is minimally interrupted by building up the world its set in and, although the world is interesting and expansive, it served more as a distraction from the story. <br/><br/>The third movie mastered this. The amazing and expansive world is there to help the story, rather than the story being there to help it. The fourth movie also understood this. <br/><br/>But each movie introduced some subtle concept into the mythos. Each concept from each movie is present as a brilliantly used device to tell the story of this film, part of why it is the best one. The first two films had this, but instead of being there to tell the story, it was just there. Here, it actually is there in a way that helps the narrative of the story along, like the books. The amazing mythos isn't distracting, like in the first two films, but isn't ignored almost completely for the sake of the story like in the middle films. <br/><br/>If Harry Potter is the master of death, this film is truly, the master of storytelling."

It's clear that the previous seven films contained a lot of plot that would eventually lead up to this film, which is pretty much two hours worth of non-stop battles and chaos. As much as I enjoyed most of the series, there's no question that this film here took the action to a whole new level and it really delivered the goods and closes out the series in a grand way.<br/><br/>The greatest thing about this film are the terrific special effects, which have certainly came a long way since the first movie. I'm really not a strong fan of CGI but this series certainly shows the greatness that can be done with it because the effects here perfectly build up this fantasy world and some of the battles here are just beautiful to watch. Obviously I'm not going to spoil anything major but the closing thirty minutes contain some of the greatest battles that you're ever going to witness. The visuals and colors in the battle between Potter and Voldemort are wonderful to say the least.<br/><br/>Once again we're given some terrific performances from the entire cast, which was obviously to be expected by this point.

","** may contain spoilers(limited), if you read the book you are safe to proceed** Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 picks up after the death of Professor Dumbledore and Lord Voldemort's rise to power once again. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the final film in the franchise and covers the second half of the final book by J.K. Rowling. The film is an epic finial that ties together the majority of the loose ends and gives the views an epilogue with a happy ending. The film is a continuation of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliff) and his two best friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) as they search for horcruxes that Lord Voldemort created by dividing his soul into objects. His plan in doing so was so he could not be defeated and live forever. If the trio of friends is able to destroy the horcruxes it will weaken Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) and he will be able to be destroyed once and for all. The main themes throughout the film is good versus evil and personal triumphs. The conflict between good and evil has been a constant theme throughout all of the other Harry Potter films (Sorcerer's Stone, The Chamber of Secrets, The Prisoner of Azkaban, The Goblet of Fire, The Order of the Phoenix, The Half Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows Part 1). Many wizards join Lord Voldemort and his quest to conquer the wizarding world. They join out of fear, greed or power but what they don't count on is a battle of epic portions. Hogwarts becomes a battleground in the final battle of the war between good and evil and the future of the wizarding world. During this film, viewers learn of Professor's Snape's (Alan Rickman) true motives and the shocking secret that he must reveal to Harry Potter when the time is right. The revelation causes Harry to look within himself for the courage to do what must be done to defeat ""he who must not be named"". Lucius Malfoy (Jason Isaacs) throughout the other Harry Potter films has always been put together and exudes power and an ego of a ""pure blood"" but in this film the viewers see him as frazzled and unkempt. The power he once sought comes at a price and in order to save his son, Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the Malfoy family must make choice. The goblins at Gringotts Wizarding Bank are greedy and not to be trusted but Harry, Hermione and Ron have no choice but to trust Griphook to get them into the vaults in order to retrieve a horcrux they believe to be hidden in Bellatrix Lestrange's vault. His deceit and treatment of the Gringotts dragon becomes his undoing and while good does triumph in an escape, evil in the form of Lord Voldemort's revenge takes place. Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Ron's mom, Molly Weasley (Julie Walters) show off their wizarding powers and take out their fair share of death eaters. Neville Longbottom (Mathew Lewis) overcomes his fears in more ways than one. He omits his romantic feelings towards a certain witch, stands up to Lord Voldemort, and is the one to ultimately weaken ""he who shall not be named"" and save two of his friends from certain death. Genealogy is a motif in the Harry Potter franchise. Half-Blood, Pure-Blood and Mud-Blood (muggle born) all determine how a witch or wizard is viewed in the wizarding world. Hermione overcomes strong oppositions and personal struggles to show that she is a smart and powerful witch regardless of her ""muggle status"" Witches and wizards that are muggle born are persecuted and singled out. The Malfoys are a pure-blood family and have a sense of entitlement. Everyone, regardless of their linage must fight and take a stand, thus with conviction and courage will overcomes their obstacles. The film was often gray and dark, it lacked color but that created the ambiance of the somber setting that ties into the theme of fighting between good and evil. Once the shining light of Professor Dumbledore was extinguished and Professor Snape took over at Hogwarts, the school became dark, structured (marching students) and the forbidden cruses became standard fare. Overall the film was great and good the book justice (of course there was missing pieces and differences). From the musical score to the cinematography and the costuming this film was a hit."
"musapuff","Null","0","1","8 June 2016"," End of a magical era
","This movie already has a 90% guaranteed chance of success just with its title as the last Harry Potter film. As the last movie of the franchise, I was disappointed. I thought the beginning pace was slow and full of awkward cinematography (there's an air of awkward silence). Despite picking up pace nearing the end, it lacked any form of epicness (just think of LOTR series).<br/><br/>Since this is the final battle between Harry Potter and Volemort, the movie is all about Harry. Harry talking, talking, doing something, and talking. All our other beloved supporting characters, even Ron and Hermione, have very little screen time. It just bothered me especially in the beginning, that Harry Potter did all the talking while Hermione and Ron just stood there like static characters.<br/><br/>Also, Daniel Radcliffe's acting as Harry Potter doesn't look as natural as before. There's a sense of stiffness to him. But I have to applaud the belated Alan Rickman for his role as Snape. Snape's final scene is the most impressive and emotional part of the entire film for me.<br/><br/>Perhaps after a decade of waiting for this final installment, my expectation was too high. The film still delivered a satisfying closure to a magic era of our time."
"chanson-90775","10","0","1","7 May 2016"," An Amazing End to My Favorite Series of All Time
","I love Harry Potter. I read all the books, multiple times, and I have loved every single movie. Even if they were different from the books at times. My favorite movie is Part 1, followed closely by Goblet of Fire. They, I feel like, have been closest to the books and that's why I love them so much.<br/><br/>This movie was so amazing. I didn't want it to end. Every scene (except for one, which I'll talk about later) was perfectly directed and followed so close to the book. The escape from Gringotts, the Battle of Hogwarts, and especially Snape's memory showing what side he was really on were exactly how I pictured them and I couldn't have been more pleased with them. I love all of the actors, and I feel like they all did exceptionally well with this movie (especially Rickman and Fiennes). <br/><br/>I would give this movie a perfect 10/10 in a heartbeat, if it weren't for the ending. They completely changed what happened, which is why I took off one star from my rating. It all starts after Hagrid carries Harry back to Hogwarts with the Death Eaters and Voldemort. First off, Bellatrix does not explode like that, and her death was so much more epic in the book. When Harry and Voldemort fight in the book, they are surrounded by everyone there and Voldemort is instantly killed when he shoots his curse at Harry. It is not carried on forever and they explain a lot of things that have happened throughout the series. This does not happen at all in the movie. I felt like this entire scene could have been executed better. <br/><br/>Another thing, Harry does not break the most powerful wand ever created in half and throw it off the bridge. He leaves it with Dumbledore in his tomb so its power would stay there. <br/><br/>All in all though, the movie was great. Just a few minor things at the end that could have been done better (just do it like it was in the book!). I'm extremely pleased with this series and how great all of the movies were. I will miss this series and I hope that Fantastic Beasts will live up to the expectations. 9/10."
"Dr_Sagan","Null","0","2","29 December 2015"," Excellent rhythm...
","Not a fan of the series.<br/><br/>I have seen Columbus's 2 movies which felt somehow like ...Christmas fairy-tales. The 3rd which I found good, the darker 4th which till now I consider the best and the ridiculous 5th with the prominent figure of Dolores Umbridge (played Imelda Staunton) which make me stop following the series.<br/><br/>Yesterday I saw bits and pieces of the 2nd movie and so I decided to skip 6 and 7 and go straight to the 8th to see the obvious conclusion.<br/><br/>Well, I must say it was far better than expected. What amazed me the most was the solid rhythm of the movie. In its 2 hours the director and the editor managed to achieve a pace that fits the mood of the plot and balances between action and sentiment. This film is not forcefully complicated and that's a good thing.<br/><br/>I wont bother you with comments about the visual fx etc. which obviously were great with such a budget.<br/><br/>The problem of ""Part 2"" is that you probably have to see the previous movies especially the 7th to understand the mechanics of what is happening. The film is generous about sharing information but although a very good movie you simply can't see it independently from the others.<br/><br/>Overall: Excellent proper rhythm and atmoshere but you must have seen the previous movies and know well Harry Pooter's Universe to truly enjoy it."

","I have to say, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows Part II was my favorite movie because over the years, I watched Voldemort grow strong and powerful. As he grew stronger, he murdered tons of people. Sadly, Harry's parents happened to be one of the many. When Harry defeated Voldemort, I found it satisfying to see someone who murdered tons of innocence people finally meet the same fate of those he murdered.<br/><br/>I grew up watching the Harry Potter movies. Literally could watch them for the rest of my life and never get tired of them. I personally do not think that the Harry Potter series will ever get old. It's a great movie to watch with the family I would give them a 10 out of 10. It breaks my heart the the series is over."
"willcundallreview","9","0","1","19 July 2015"," A beautiful end to this magical journey
","Rating-9/10<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the final part of the massively popular and wildly huge franchise that is Harry Potter. This is the most emotional but also most gripping of all the films and really gets to the point and just gets on with what has to be done. Not only is this a step up in terms of plot, but in acting too and the technical plus the score side get even better too to create a just brilliant film.<br/><br/>We see our young characters continuing their quest for Lord Voldemort's Horcruxes and the attempts to destroy them and henceforth also trying, to destroy him. The plot is just great, it is paced well and the film really gets into what it is doing straight away, it literally contains no boring part, or part left untouched or too hashed out, this is class all the way through. Daniel Radcliffe has emerged a fine young actor through this, and maybe even just through the two Deathly Hallow movies, you can see he is perfecting his style and with a cast like this franchise has behind him, it isn't so easy.<br/><br/>David Yates returns as the director and he is well, what David Yates is always like in the Potter movies. All credit to him for not trying something wildly different but I still don't think his direction is spot on, he does however I feel do a well enough job. As for the writing I felt the same, not perfect but OK, of course when adapting a book it is not always so easy to find the right lines from the source material, or to make up your own, but Kloves does well in adaption. This is the most technically advanced Potter, and surely one of the biggest of 2011, the visual effects are staggering and you forget at times there being used, just beautiful work from that department.<br/><br/>Yet another fantastic thing about this is the score, now of course Harry Potter is known for it's scores and how wonderful they sound, but Alexandre Desplat goes even further. This man is a genius with movie music, he just knows exactly when to play the right tune, what the best thing to play is to not only make you feel pumped, but also tug at your heartstrings. If one thing from this movie can make you feel emotional, I will bet it is one scene with the glorious work of Alexandre Desplat.<br/><br/>I felt throughout this should please fans of the book and also the fans of the movie series, yes OK the franchise did deviate from the book at times but all in all this is too good a movie to just criticise on that point. I felt if the directing and writing would have been great, this is the kind of movie we could have seen getting awards in that department. One more thing along those lines is that this is one movie that deserved awards, sure films like this don't usually get them but this has so much emotion, so much in epic proportions that this by the end deserves recognition, and not just from Harry Potter fans.<br/><br/>I felt that overall this movie was just superb, a fitting end to a finely tuned family favourite and one that I personally hope generations to come can love and cherish. Don't judge Harry Potter as one film, judge it as the whole 8 movies in the series and when I do, all I see is how to make a franchise to perfection. This is by far the most emotional of them all as I said before and for good reason, so much happens and there is new things revealed, things from the past and of course new music from Desplat, yes take in the sights and sounds that Hogwarts have to offer, because this I say sadly, is the last time we will be going with our three friends."
"mahmoud-amin103","8","0","1","3 July 2015"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (2011)
","It's hard to express how much the last Harry Potter matters to its fans, and how important it is to finish the series on the right note. After ten years, eight films, four directors and over $6 billion at the box office, it comes down to this. The final film presented a gargantuan challenge to its makers, who were required to juggle gigantic action scenes with emotional heft and jaunts into the metaphysical to explain its labyrinthine plot. Thank Dumbledore, then, that director David Yates and screenwriter Steve Kloves managed one last herculean push to finish things in style.<br/><br/>The shortest film of the lot, this may be based on only half a book but it has a mountainous plot to climb. Scraps of bad guy Lord Voldemort's divided soul, hidden in ""Horcruxes"", have to be found and destroyed — a process that will involve a bank heist, a dragon and a large, dead snake. The mysterious ""Deathly Hallows"", three powerful artefact's allowing the user to conquer death, must be uncovered and claimed. Voldemort himself has to be killed and there must, surely, be a giant battle involving every surviving character of the franchise. Lesser villains must get their comeuppance, heroes must fall, and Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) must get a room already. <br/><br/>What's impressive is that, where earlier films revolved around solving a mystery, this one shifts to a war footing without losing its emphasis on character and emotion. The battle scenes are appropriately spectacular, with Hogwarts under attack from an army of Death Eaters, Dementors, giants and beasties and defended by a small and dwindling number of students and teachers. The effects have never been better, the sets more beautifully designed nor the explosions bigger — but it's still the human moments that grip. The truth of Alan Rickman's sneering Professor Snape is finally uncovered in perhaps the most moving scene of the entire series, while Ralph Fiennes at last shows off the full range of Voldemort's genius and madness and Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall reveals herself as the bad ass we've always suspected her to be.<br/><br/>But this is Daniel Radcliffe's hour, with Hermione and Ron very much in supporting roles as Harry steps forward to meet his destiny. His encounters with Voldemort are brutal — very much an adult targeting a child rather than a clash of equals. And while Radcliffe remains reined in as an actor, that is by this stage a feature of the character, and his performance has moments of quiet brilliance. As he steps into the Great Hall and sees the devastating human cost of his defiance of Voldemort, his eyes register one body blow, and another, and another as he sees dead and wounded friends. It's subtle, but it's the best he's ever been. <br/><br/>That said, subtlety is not the overwhelming impression. This opens with that bank raid and builds around a running battle, hexes sleeting through the air and Hogwarts reduced to so much rubble. It's here, if we were nitpicking, that we craved just a tiny bit more room to breathe. The set-up for Mrs. Weasley's (Julie Walters) big moment is fractionally but fatally rushed, and many more minor characters get only a single line or shot in which to shine. Admittedly, that's in keeping with the book's cavalier attitude to its supporting cast as the plot races to its end, slowing only for Harry's sake at key moments, but it's a shortcoming that the film could have corrected. It's one of those cases that leaves you wishing for a longer director's cut — an unusual feeling on departing a Harry Potter film."

Always I say novel. There was some mistakes in movie.Eyes was same of Harry and his mother in novel whatever Harry's eyes is blue and mother's eyes is black in movie. There was also confused events in movie. For example Neville Longbottom was very in passive position, but he is like star in last movie. Harry Potter's character is played by Daniel Radciliffe all movie series. In the same time Emma Watson has played in ""Ballet Shoes"" also Rubert Grint has played in video clip of the song.David Yates is awarded best director award after J.Cameron.

The books didn't do the movies justice, but I enjoyed watching them and watching Dan Radcliffe portraying Harry going from a once small innocent boy to a slightly grizzled man, and a wonderful one at that. I do appreciate what he did for the series, and in my opinion, he has proved that he was the right guy to play Harry Potter over the last decade.

","Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is the final film in the Harry Potter series. Part two is the conclusion of Harry Potter's (David Radcliff) journey to destroy Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). Harry is accompanied by his friends Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) in his race to destroy evil and save Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The theme of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is good versus evil. Similar to the Lord of the Rings series in which Frodo is accompanied by his friends on a mission to destroy the ring in an effort to destroy evil, Harry, along with his friends Hermione and Ron, are on a quest to locate and destroy the Horcruxes. The Horcruxes are objects in which Lord Voldemort has placed a piece of himself in to give him eternal life. The only way to destroy Lord Voldemort (the Dark Lord) is to destroy the Horcruxes. As Harry, Hermione and Ron race against time to find the Horcruxes, Lord Voldemort is preparing to battle Hogwarts. After many lives have been lost at Hogwarts, Harry discovers that he is the final Horcrux. Harry is forced to make the decision to sacrifice himself to destroy Lord Voldemort in an effort to save his friends and Hogwarts from the Dark Lord. In a surprising twist, Lord Voldemort thinks he has killed Harry, Harry begins to battle Lord Voldemort as his friends destroy the other remaining Horcrux. In the end Harry defeats Lord Voldemort and saves what is left of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Motifs were used to emphasize Lord Voldemort's power and to show how evil he truly was. Harry Potter would have visions of Lord Voldemort. These visions displayed how dark and evil Lord Voldemort truly was and enhanced the power he had over Harry. Harry battles these visions throughout the movie.<br/><br/>The initial battle scene was shot during the night, as well as the scene when Harry is sacrificing himself to Lord Voldemort. The darkness represents evil and reflects the feeling that Lord Voldemort (evil) is winning. The final battle scene was shot during the day-time and this is the scene Harry (good) defeats evil.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 was the perfect end to an epic series. The film ended with good defeating evil. There were many twists to the film which kept viewers on the edge of their seats. Even though, this was the last film in the Harry Potter series, the film ended with a possible beginning of a new series."

","The last Harry Potter movie was actually a sad event. It was extremely sad for everyone who cares so much about the books and the movies. Everybody knew it was the end of an era. And you watch that movie with that idea in mind, even after watching it 4 times in cinema. There were so many scenes in this movie who were beautifully filmed. Perfectly. and had some drama in it. This was Alan Rickman's movie. His performance was absolutely outstanding. This movie had so much in it, that it is almost impossible to don't like it. During the whole movie there is actually this long waited confrontation between Harry and Voldemort. It is excited that it is not one battle and then it is overno, there are some fights and duels during the whole movie. And between those scenes there are moments of romance and moments of sadness-extreme sadness , which breaks the hard of the fans. I can only say that I am proud on the way they end this amazing film series. <br/><br/>We , Die Hard fans couldn't wish for a better movie to end the series. The screenplay deserved an award, it was written with so much ambition and so true to the book. It makes me think that some moments even touched me more and brought me more Goosebumps than the book. But don't understand me wrong original is always the basic and the best, but somehow some moments really hit me. Still do. There of course always things wrong in a movie. I think , I still do, Harry had to die. A Horcrux must be destroyed and Harry isn't physically destroyed. It also was good for the film if we saw Remus Lupin die and Fred. It would give the story some facts. Unfortunately that didn't happen. I also think that there should have been more of a conversation between Aberforth and Harry like in the books. You didn't know what Dumbledore did, in the book you did. It was so short. <br/><br/>I was not satisfied with the music. They failed with asking a good composer. There are so many good composers in the film world and then they ask an un-experienced man, who is not a John Williams. I missed John Williams but I was happy to hear some of John Williams magnificent work in the last scene. The music deserved a better in a last film. Alan Rickman , Ralph Fiennes and Maggie Smith were so amazing in this film. This was so amazing and so outstanding it deserves 10 out of 10!"

","First things first, do the smart thing and see it in 2-D.<br/><br/>Finally, we come to the end of the critically well received ""Harry Potter"" franchise. It doesn't seem long that 10 years ago we looked upon Hogwarts for the first time, and knew we would have so many enjoyable years with 3 very talented actors. I'm sure they will have very long careers ahead.<br/><br/>Beginning with a recap of where the first part left off. Harry, Ron and Hermione continue there mission. Leading into the wizarding bank, and finally a large scale battle at Hogwarts school. The best thing about this instalment is David Yates directing. The way he managed to pull off the slow-motion in wide angles and uncomfortable close ups shots, made for a ""Harry Potter"" movie that just felt beyond what it was visually capable of. Making every big moment all the more bigger. Seeing Harry (Daniel Radcliffe) and Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) interact and fight it out with each other is without doubt, one of the series highlights for the past couple instalments.<br/><br/>Aside from that, when they arrive back in Hogwarts everything kicks off. Old friends are reacquainted, special effect laden spells fill the skies and hallways, all towards the final revelations discovered at the end of the movie (Without doubt a stunning performance from Alan Rickman). All building up to the final minutes where Harry's wizarding life all began is just extremely satisfying. I just wished that makeup was a little better.<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Without doubt a satisfying, stunning conclusion to one of cinema's most highest grossing franchises of all time. A very big thank you to the talented people, who have worked on these movies and have entertained me for the past 10 years. 8/10."

","Regardless of your views on Harry Potter as a whole or whether this film really does this literary phenomenon justice (on balance it does), there can be no doubt that this is a great climax to one of the great cinematic challenges. There will always be a debate about the place of J.K. Rowling's novels and their film adaptations in the wider pantheon of literary and film history. But if one wants a true measure of how good this series has been, they should simply ask: what would the world be like if Harry hadn't been helped out of his cupboard?<br/><br/>I know that the answer is: poorer! The first novels that I read were the first two Harry Potter books. And to a child at the age of 6, as I was then, what wasn't there to like about a downtrodden young boy who discovers that he is a wizard and is whisked away to a magic school by a giant man? That is the magic of this series. Long after the special effects have been superseded and there has been a disastrous (American) attempt at remaking the films, it will be the stories that remain with us. We all want to be Harry, Ron or Hermione because we can relate to them. We believe that we can have Harry's courage, Ron's heart or Hermione's fierce loyalty and skill because we have experienced their emotions alongside our own. That is the reason for the success of these novels and films: We could just as easily imagine ourselves as <br/><br/>I think that the leads did well in this film; and whatever people say about their acting at various stages, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson will always be Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger. But the real star turn, as in the novel, comes from Severus Snape. Alan Rickman really steals the show, as he has done throughout the series. We have loved to hate this man for the last decade on screen, but the superb execution of ""The Prince's Tale"" leaves us feeling as devastated as Snape himself is when he learns that Lily Potter is dead. I think we all shed a tear for the incredible sacrifices that he made, as much as Rickman's superlative performance. Maggie Smith is as imperious as ever as Minerva McGonagall, whilst Helena Bonham Carter is sublime as the wildly cunning Bellatrix Lestrange. Ralph Fiennes simply exudes menace whenever he is on screen as our irredeemable villain, Lord Voldemort. He takes on a rather muted role here, strangely, although I do think that the way in which the menace of Voldemort is portrayed in the novels is almost impossible to bring to the big screen. The scene in the Forbidden Forest with the Resurrection Stone is also a brilliant emotional journey. Plus it's always nice to see Gary Oldman back in the role of Sirius for such a short amount of screen time he is wonderful and David Thewlis is great as well as lupin.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent as one might expect, especially when the magical protection is created around Hogwarts, to then be destroyed by Voldemort in fury. Alexandre Desplat's score is also superb and really reflects the subtle moods and nuances of the story. If one good thing came out of the Epilogue, it allowed Desplat to use the brilliant ""Leaving Hogwarts"" theme for the last time! As a film, I think that David Yates has done a great job. This was probably the biggest challenge in film. Almost everyone had an opinion on how it should be done, along with the added pressure from Warner Brother's to make this film palatable for all ages, in order to maximise potential income from their most lucrative franchise. Left to their own devices, this film could easily have been a 15. For those who think that a lot of the humour is missing, then they are probably right. However, it is harder to establish this in a film. The Potter series doesn't really do black humour, so many of the jokes or asides in the novel just wouldn't fit the tone. I think the result would have been worse if the producers had attempted to shoe- horn the humour in.<br/><br/>All in all, it has been a magical journey since I first picked up ""The Philosopher's Stone as a 6 year old. As the credits rolled on this film, I suddenly realised that there was no more Harry, no more vestige of my childhood, to come. But then I thought that it doesn't really matter that there will be no more ""new"" adventures. The magic of the series, its values of courage and loyalty and friendship, will live on. And naturally, we will always want to go to Hogwarts."

"OllieSuave-007","8","0","2","21 July 2014"," The fitting end to the Potter trilogy.
","Based on the book Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, this is the second film of two parts and the final film overall of the Harry Potter trilogy, where Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their mission of finding and destroying the remaining Horcruxes in order to defeat Lord Voldemort. However, after Voldemort is on to the wizards' plan, it leads to the ultimate battle between the wizards and the Deatheaters.<br/><br/>After a lackluster Part I movie, the imagination, magic, adventure and drama returned in full force in this final film. Director David Yates and the team of writers and special effects people gave an intriguing and action-packed movie with non-stop thrills and suspense; I particularly liked the tense atmosphere of Hogswart during Professor Snape's takeover, all the students being on their guard under Voldemort's dictating eye, a pursued Harry sneaking into the castle with Ron, Hermione and Neville Longbottom to infiltrate Voldemort's gang and the battle between Snape and Professor McGonagall. These scenes all remind you that the once spirited, magical and prosperous Hogswart and the surrounding wizard world have come to a dramatic halt, and only a suspenseful war between good and evil can determine the future of the city of Hogsmeade. And, the destruction of the Quidditch field during the Deatheaters' attack also symbolized an assault on the prosperity of Hogsmeade, contributing to the overall feel of a final movie. In addition, the acting was spot-on, most notably the believable and dramatic performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Ralph Fiennes and Michael Gambon.<br/><br/>In addition to the action, the scenes bridging the past and the present is a great balance of drama and spectacle that leaves unanswered questions solved and everything coming full circle in the trilogy regarding Potter's life. <br/><br/>***spoiler ahead*** While definitely one of the better Potter movies, I wished some of the final scenes weren't deleted from the initial theatrical and DVD release, like scenes showing Professor Flitwick and Professor McGonagall battling the Deatheaters, and wished the battle scene between Molly Weasley and Bellatrix Lestrange was made longer and more dramatic. I also would have liked to see more one-on-one battles between the good wizards and the Deatheaters rather than focusing mostly on the Potter vs. Voldemort and Weasley vs. Bellatrix scenes. However, it is an exciting and riveting final battle nonetheless and one of the final scenes that show a camera pan of all the surviving students and professors was a nice and conclusive touch. ***spoiler ends*** <br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the most tense and thrilling Potter movies that definitely ends the series on a high note.<br/><br/>Grade B"

","The Deadly Hallows part 2 ends the decade long legacy of Harry Potter. In this ultimate good versus evil showdown, the once ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" has now established himself as Lord Voldemort and has now seized control of every political establishment. With his support and allegiance of an army, the time has come to change the magic world from one of acceptance and tolerance to one of power and domination. The only thing standing in his way is ""The boy that lived"", Harry Potter, whose very life is the symbolic manifestation of defiance against wrong doing. <br/><br/>Whether or not you're a fan of the series, there is something mesmerizing and fascinating about each movie. Everything from the special effects, story line and even right down to the music captivates and entertains. Watching these actors grow up and mature physically as well as their talent over the years also provided a special connection for the long time fan. <br/><br/>I gave this movie 9 out of 10 stars for its imagination, entertainment value, story line and talent but this is an obvious must see to anyone that has followed the series up to this point. The most noteworthy character (other than the triumphant trio) goes to Neville Longbottom played by actor Matthew Lewis who best portrays the ""do what's right in the face of fear and danger"" mentality. For best effect, see this movie in 3D."

It was over 10 years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who unlike any other boy thought that he was a normal 11 year old kid. But he wasn't normal – he was a wizard and that's how the boy Harry Potter melted the hearts of readers and moviegoers. The creator of this great epic phenomenon, gave us what we had foresaw – Harry Potter was and is and will always be a part of our lives. For you see, it was at the hand of a young writer by the name J.K. Rowling that gave us something to live for.<br/><br/>I have been a true fan of this movement for 10 years and I can honestly say, that I am extremely proud to be a true Harry Potter fan. I could not have asked for more. I read the books and I have the movies, if anything that I have gained from both is that Harry Potter will always live within me and the fans that have graced the books and the movies. Tonight as I was watching the movie, I was thinking the entire 2 hours, how one boy at the age of 17, give so much of his life to save the world from annihilation.<br/><br/>The prophecy is true when it says ""but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not"" that power was and will always be the love of his parents and his friends. Thank you, Harry Potter for teaching us what it means to live a life of love and you have given us something to live for – a life full of hope and joy. Thank you, J.K. Rowling for allowing us to dive in your world of magic into the pages of Hogwarts and teaching us that magic lives within us. As Dumbledore says ""help will always be given to those who need it the most.""

"hippypeacegirl","10","0","2","22 June 2014"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two
","""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two"" (2011) is the final of the series, which comprised of eight movies altogether. This movie had a lot of hype to live up to with the success of the book series as a whole, and the huge fandom that follows it. Anytime a book is made into a movie, there is a risk of angering a whole readership of people, and this movie did a superb job of following the book as much as possible. In this movie, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his friends Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are on a hunt for horcrux's, which are pieces of someone's soul concealed in an object. These horcrux's belong to Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes), whom is the villain in the entire series, and has been trying to kill Harry since he was only a year old. The hunt for these has secretly been going on the whole series, but really culminates in these final two movies. The hunt leads Harry and his friends back to Hogwarts, the wizarding school, and is where most of the movie and the major battle occurs. The overall theme of the battle, and the whole series in general, is the battle between good and evil. Harry and his friends, along with the groups that are created to fight Voldemort and his Death Eaters (his followers who do his bidding, which includes murder) represent the good, and Voldermort's team represents the evil. There are many instances in the movie when it seems that the evil might beat out the good. The overall feel of the movie is dark, and the lighting, especially during the battle of Hogwarts, is dark, which allows for the explosions and spells cast from the wands to be electrified even more. Even the music throughout a lot of it is seems dark and sad, but it slowly starts picking up as the battle rages on and gets more intense, adding to the feel of excitement. The montage of memory Snape's memories is a great piece of editing. The way that each memory flow so smoothly to the next, and how spot on to the book it was, really gives viewers the feeling that they are watching it right next to Harry. The key was the transitions. They not only flowed well, they tied back in with the story line, keeping the theme going at all times. Through most of the series Harry battles with not only Voldemort, but his own personal demons as well. This makes the theme of good and evil show up on many different levels, which all leads up to when Harry essentially sacrifices himself (realizing during the battle he himself is one of Voldemort's horcrux's) to make Voldemort mortal again, and able to be killed. This is Harry officially making the ultimate sacrifice so that the good side has a chance to win, even if he is not around to see it. He was afraid he was becoming evil, becoming like Voldemort but who we really are is shown in our choices, and his choice to sacrifice himself is one that Voldemort would have never made himself. Another wildly popular story about good and evil would be The Hunger Games. Even though it isn't as obvious as it is in the Potter series, the characters in the Hunger Games are essentially starting to fight back against the group of people who are running their lives, and sending children in an arena to fight to the death. In this story, Katniss would be the Harry character- unwillingly thrown into the hero role, leading a charge against evil, which would be the Capitol, led by President Snow. Snow could be seen as the Voldemort of the plot since he is responsible for the death and suffering of many people. Most stories that deal with good and evil have the viewer's rooting for good to prevail, and hope that the hero (or heroine) makes it out alive. If there is one thing that is learned in Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Two it is that the battle between good and evil is not always easy, but backing down is not an option if you have something worth fighting for. Even when things look the darkest one must fight on until they have nothing left to give."

","This final movie in Harry Potter series is everything an average viewer expected. From the opening scene to the climax, entire movie is captivating. Background score is good and all the characters in this film performed their roles so good that you cannot imagine anyone else doing it. <br/><br/>Credit should go to Cast Director who picked a perfect cast. The fact that most of the cast were kids when this series first started and they performed with such a talent, makes one wonder how the cast director knew these kids would fit into their roles so perfectly. <br/><br/>Is this movie good? Yes. Is this movie Perfect? No <br/><br/>I am not against movie not following the book from beginning to end. If the changes entertain audience and are good for movie on the whole I am all up for it. But I am very disappointed with deathly hallows part 2 where the plot is not as in the book. <br/><br/>When I first read Harry Potter and the Deathly Hollows book, last 50 pages of the book were so good that I wanted it not to end so badly. The final fight of Harry and Voldemort gave me Goosebumps while reading. Why had the director of this movie felt that it is necessary for Harry and Voldemort to fight in an open place where there is nobody else but them? If I was in Hogwarts I would want to see the epic finale and make sure that dark lord is gone for good. <br/><br/>Harry slipping an invisibility cloak when everyone is thinking he is dead and putting up shield charms everywhere to protect his friends is much better than him jumping down from Hagrid and running for cover. <br/><br/>The very first time Harry Potter gets his scar, nobody witnesses what happened. So basically not everybody believed that Dark Lord is gone. Same thing happens in final fight of the movie. No one actually sees the fight and to top it off there is no body. So finally Voldemort is gone for good because Harry said so? I mean who wouldn't want to see the lifeless body of an evil wizard who is feared by entire wizard community? Who wouldn't want to make sure that history won't repeat itself and this time it's really ""THE END"". <br/><br/>I loved this movie but I would have loved it more if last one hour is by the book."

After burying Dobby, Harry Potter asks the goblin Griphook to help him, Ron, and Hermione to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts bank, suspecting a Horcrux may be there. Griphook agrees in exchange for the Sword of Gryffindor. Wandmaker Ollivander tells Harry that two wands taken from Malfoy Manor belonged to Bellatrix and to Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry. In Bellatrix's vault, Harry discovers that the Horcrux is Helga Hufflepuff's cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword of Godric Gryffindor and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort killing goblins, including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realizes there is a Horcrux at Hogwarts connected to Rowena Ravenclaw. The trio apparate into Hogsmeade, where Aberforth Dumbledore instructs the portrait of his deceased younger sister, Ariana, to fetch Neville Longbottom, who leads the trio through a secret passageway into Hogwarts. Snape hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after Minerva McGonagall challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle. At Luna Lovegood's insistence, Harry speaks to Helena Ravenclaw's ghost, who reveals that Voldemort performed ""dark magic"" on her mother's diadem, which is in the Room of Requirement. In the Chamber of Secrets, Ron encourages Hermione to destroy the Horcrux cup with a Basilisk fang. Afterward, the two share a passionate kiss. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, Gregory Goyle and Blaise Zabini attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse and, unable to control it, is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement, where it is destroyed. As Voldemort's forces attack, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realizes that Voldemort's snake Nagini is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the Pensieve. In the chaos at Hogwarts, Fred, Lupin, and Tonks have been killed. Harry learns from Snape's memories that Snape loved Harry's late mother, Lily, but despised his father, James, who had bullied him. Following her death, Snape worked secretly with Dumbledore to protect Harry from Voldemort because of his deep feelings for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore's death at Snape's hands was planned between them, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword had been conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him and that Harry must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry goes to die at the hands of Voldemort in the Forbidden Forest. He briefly speaks to his dead loved ones before facing Voldemort. Voldemort casts the Killing Curse upon Harry, who finds himself in limbo, where Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's own curse. Due to Voldemort killing the Horcrux inside Harry, he is able to return to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort once and for all. Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and says anyone who defies him will be killed. Neville stands up to Voldemort and makes a dramatic speech, stating that Harry will live on in their hearts. Harry reveals he is still alive and duels with Voldemort throughout the castle. A general battle begins as a defiant Neville draws the Sword of Gryffindor from the Sorting Hat and decapitates Nagini, leaving Voldemort mortal. Molly Weasley watches her daughter nearly get killed by Bellatrix during a duel and then petrifies and kills Bellatrix. The final stand of Harry and Voldemort's fight is Harry's Disarming Charm rebounding Voldemort's own Killing Curse and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognized him as its true master because he had disarmed Draco, who earlier had disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore, which then explains why the wand didn't kill Harry in his final battle with Voldemort. Harry snaps the Elder Wand, rejecting its power. Nineteen years later, Harry and Ginny Potter and Ron and Hermione Weasley, along with Draco and his wife Astoria Malfoy, proudly watch their own children leaving for Hogwarts from King's Cross station."

"axel-koch","6","0","1","18 January 2014"," A good movie, but definitely more fun for aficionados than casual audiences
","Never have I been looking forward to a movie as much as I did to Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 and never have I had a viewing experience in cinemas as great as I had when watching the film, bringing an end to the wonderful franchise I'd so exceedingly adored to read and watch over the course of my whole childhood. But despite all the wonderful moments it holds for the die-hard fans, the final instalment of Harry Potter isn't perfect, remaining as flaw-studded and clichéd as its predecessors.<br/><br/>It's impossible to specifically point out the aspects of the plot I disliked in Deathly Hallows 2 while simultaneously keeping this review devoid of spoilers, although I can say that they mostly concern the deaths of major characters and the newest dei ex machina that J.K. Rowling and Steve Kloves got up their sleeves. Not all of them were grave though and in some cases, it's merely the poor adaption of the source material that causes confusion or illogicality. Either way, it impairs what is actually an appropriate denouement to this outstanding huge story and makes the top rating the film's best moments would definitely rate a no-go.<br/><br/>Speaking of the film's best moments, Snape's memories, the scene in the Forbidden Forest and the Chamber of Secrets (watch and learn, Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, these settings can actually be used for good scenes), and, of course, the battle of Hogwarts are also some of the whole series' absolutely best moments and give me goosebumps whenever I watch the film. The intensity of everything that's happening during 130 minutes that actually feel like only half of that is perpetually palpable and stirs up one's blood even when fully aware of how the plot is about to play out. I completely adore Deathly Hallows 2 just because of how greatly it is able to convey the insanely perilous sentiment Mrs Rowling managed to put in words when writing the novel. In some ways, the cinematic adaption is even better – or did your imagination make the fighting at Hogwarts look as fantastic as David Yates and his guys responsible for the visuals did? Although that is balanced out with an epilogue scene unnecessary and poorly made in every way you could think of (how the hell did the make-up department get an Academy Award nomination for this?).<br/><br/>Being an objective film critic, I must admit that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is far from being a perfect film and that doesn't change with a handful of unforgettable scenes. Nevertheless, I reckon it to be a very worthy finale for the franchise and, as with the other seven, the flaws just can't prevent me from rewatching it over and over again."

There is a lot of action in this one, and it closes out the series satisfactory.<br/><br/>If there is any problem, it's that the ideas behind horcroxes are somewhat confusing. They never really explained it easily or clearly. It's a difficult subject that the passing movie goers would best served by reading the books. Even with the books, some aspects could still be murky. The need for explanations requires some slower sections. The pacing still goes well. It does a passable job. The most important part is the exciting battles. It's a thrilling end and a satisfying one for fans of the series."

","This was a truly brilliant way to end the series, it stuck to the last books plot quite well - due to splitting the last book into two films which was an extremely good choice. <br/><br/>The acting was flawless from everyone, even the minor roles shone which added to the brilliance of this film. <br/><br/>The plot is intriguing and well thought out and brilliant. Harry Potter is a good book and film series which I would highly recommend.<br/><br/>Also the production of Harry Potter films was absolutely superb when it came to the lighting and script, also the music within is beautifully done. <br/><br/>This film was an brilliant ending to an era and the childhood of many many people I applaud J.K Rowling for making such a brilliant novel series and allowed it to be adapted into a films series and I applaud the directors and everyone involved with the production of this, and the previous films,for such a good job of master pieces of novels."
"Editor_Mandy","10","0","1","3 December 2013"," Epilogue, so many important things you may be missing.
","I would like to make my review about the epilogue because that seems to bring about a lot of talk about looks and some are missing out on a few very big things.<br/><br/>First, I am glad they shot the epilogue. It wasn't so much the looks, I thought they all looked age appropriate, they had their children in their mid 20's and now it's time for school. It was what was said that was so important and powerful to me.<br/><br/>When Harry first went to the school he had no one. He was a lost little boy trying to find his way. During his trip through the series he kept losing family or those close enough to be family.<br/><br/>Harry standing side by side with his son and saying to him ""Together"" as they went through to the train station...it hit me the most. It hit me hard, I did not laugh, I cried. It just showed that all Harry went through he finally had what he always wanted. Not power, not understanding of why things can be so unfair but the one thing he wanted most..<br/><br/>A family.<br/><br/>He finally had stability and peace, surrounded by loved ones for the rest of his life. That truly is the biggest prize isn't it? A prize they all deserved and all received.<br/><br/>I love how he wanted to make sure that his son did not feel as he did on his first day. That his father was by his side as they took that first step. If they had filmed it with other actors, no way would it have been as powerful as it was.<br/><br/>Another important note, it made crystal clear that to Harry, Snape was finally understood and in turn cared for him so much he named his son after him and told his son all of those wonderful things about him. That hit me too! Again it made the ending that much more beautiful. I LOVED the epilogue and feel the series gained so much more ending it this way."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","0","1","23 November 2013"," This concerns the eight films
","Eight films for seven volumes. The whole saga in these films. A real treat.<br/><br/>[]<br/><br/>The films also concentrate slightly too much on the fact that Harry Potter is a young teenager and then a young man who is attached to men of all sorts. The story as it is revealed in the end clearly identifies his fate to the decisions of a few men and to the fate of these few men. The only woman that has counted in his life was his own mother who saved him from annihilation with her own love and nothing else. This vision of Harry Potter being a man of many men is very sexist in a way and this world of wizardry is very sexist in all kinds of ways and it is not the Weasley sister and Hermione who save the story from being a man's story for men and only men. Girls and women just have to look, watch, admire and applaud but they have no real role to play, or hardly some ancillary roles here and there, like cleaning the teacups. The books were slightly less sexist and we could have expected the films to change that kind of bias.<br/><br/>Harry Potter is entirely dependent on Dumbledore who never tells him the truth and that his fate has been decided by three men: Voldemort who wants to kill him to be unique and sole master in the world, Dumbledore and Snape who want to bring Harry Potter to his resurrection in order for him to destroy Voldemort, because Harry Potter can only do that if Voldemort tries to kill him and succeeds, though he will only kill in Harry Potter the part of himself, Voldemort, he had invested in the kid when he tried to kill him the first time when a baby. []<br/><br/>That makes three men, and two will have to die for Harry Potter's Voldemort part to be killed by Voldemort and for Harry Potter then to be able to kill the third man of this triad.<br/><br/>Three more men are necessary for Harry Potter to survive through it all. []<br/><br/>When you add to these two triple sets the giant Hagrid in the back of all these men you have it nearly all since you should also see the short-lived and evanescent role of Harry Potter's godfather Black who will be important all along, or nearly, since his elf will be crucial in the seventh and last episode when Harry Potters is trying to bring together the three Deadly Hallows that will bring Voldemort down.<br/><br/>Only two maybe three women are important: Mrs Weasley, Ron's mother, in her great motherly quality essentially knitting pullovers for the boys. Then Hermione who is a mixed blood and will be divided between Ron and Harry all along, though she will marry Ron in the end. And Ron's sister who will eventually marry Harry in the end. Both marriages produce children, with a third one in the back: the son of the Slitheryn opponent to Harry Potter who nearly ended up as a direct servant of Voldemort, and Harry produces a boy with a triple name, two given names and Potter, the two given names representing the main men who supported Harry in his adventures.<br/><br/>[]<br/><br/>Harry's mother is married to Harry's father but Snape is in love with Harry's mother and Harry has the same protection against Dementors as Snape, a doe. Harry is the son of his father and his mother but he carries some part of Voldemort in him and hence has three parents. Voldemort will have to kill his own contribution in Harry to become killable by Harry, provided he has some help from a triad of students behind, but Voldemort can only have the opportunity to do so if Dumbledore and Snape are killed, if possible Dumbledore by Snape and then Snape by Voldemort.<br/><br/>Finally in the end Harry Potter has – with some help from three friends – killed Voldemort and he has recuperated the famous wand that was in Dumbledore's possession and then had been stolen by Voldemort from Dumbledore's own grave. Harry Potter, as the third owner, destroys it. It will not have a fourth owner and Harry Potter has three reasons to do it: He cannot possess it (and you possess a wand only if that wand chooses to be possessed by you) because only someone who has killed the person he loves can possess this wand. Dumbledore had killed his own sister? Voldemort had killed so many people he should have loved but he never loved anyone anyway, and thus he can't possess it as he says himself to Snape who is the proper owner because he killed Dumbledore who he loved. []<br/><br/>A last remark on Daniel Radcliffe. He is a great child-actor and we can see him growing but he is developed as a very stiff character, static in expression and action. That is a handicap in this profession. He could have learned how to be active and how to build a real rich and passionate character he would impersonate in its deepest feelings and emotions since he is far from being a child in the last films and his character is old enough not to be a child any more and become a passion ate teenager. He can't satisfy himself with being that stiff and cold an actor forever. Methinks he could have been directed better in the last three or four films.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"steve-campbell-338-333870","9","0","2","14 November 2013"," The Best of the Series!
","HPDH was the best of the Harry Potter series, IMHO. Believe me, this film has it all. Action, comedy, suspense, drama, emotional connectivity, amazing performances. <br/><br/>Understandably this was the shortest of all the Potter flicks- the previous movie covered 75% of the book, and so this film covers 25%... Which is a good thing because it shows Yates put effort into making this movie a big, grand finale. The movie moves at a fast pace, and boy, is that a good thing. One would worry that it would come off as rushed, but believe me, Yates did a hell of a job here. Sure some things were left out and/or changed, but obviously for pacing purposes. I am aware of the changes, but honestly, as a fan of the book, I'm glad they were made.<br/><br/>The acting is what helps make this movie amazing. You could tell the actors were in a ""alright, it's the last movie, let's live it up more than we can"" mood. Everyone hams it up beautifully. The full power of the actors' performances is used. In my opinion, Matthew Lewis was the highlight of the movie! He always was the highlight of the other films, and this movie is no exception. He manages to ham it up as Neville Longbottom, and here he is in full bad-ass mode. <br/><br/>Really, I am still speechless as to how awesome this movie was. I mean, I knew it was going to be one emotional experience, and thank god it turned out to be that. As the movie's ending credits began rolling, I got incredibly emotional. I did not want to say goodbye to the phenomenon that helped shape my childhood. And you could feel that emotion running through the cinema, when John Williams' score rang through the speakers.<br/><br/>In short, Deathly Hallows 2 was phenomenal, the best of the series, and I plan to see it again someday soon!"
"ericwilcox27","9","0","1","11 November 2013"," Very good, for the most part
","I will start off by saying that I was very impressed with this movie and how it was chosen to end the Harry Potter series. While some will say that Deathly Hallows into to movies was simply for profit, I do agree with the decision, because I believe that the events in Part 1 allow Part 2 to move as quickly as it does. It is impressive to think that all previous Harry Potter movies take place over the course of a year, while Part 2 takes place all within a day or so. Putting Hedwig's Theme at the epilogue was a very good move that should please most fans of the series. The visual effects seemed pleasing, but at times it seemed that they may have been overdone. Once again, Priori Incantatem is not supposed to take place in this movie, yet it happens all the time, making me think that it was added just for a visual effect. The deaths of Bellatrix and Voldemort were also unnecessary and more climactic than the book described. But all of that aside, I do think this movie was made with the intention of making any Potter fan cry, because people next to me were in tears by the time the title cards came through. Snape's memories were very well done, even though there was much left out, it still got the point across in my opinion. Overall, I think this was very well done, and I am perfectly fine with this adaptation of the end of the series."

","Fans who have read the books and/or followed the films will not be disappointed! Okay, it doesn't follow the book step by step, but it captures everything important that is present in the book; this film franchise has definitely ended on a high! If you have been put off by some of the earlier films, which, although I am a Harry Potter fan even I can say weren't great films (those kids really couldn't act!) don't judge this last one on them, it is miles above any previous ones. As always the sets throughout the film create the atmosphere, and the mature cast perform, as you would expect, brilliantly. Even the younger generation of actors have improved leaps and bounds since their Potter debuts 10 years ago. Would recommend you go and see it :)"
"akik1259","9","0","1","7 September 2013"," Very pleasantly surprised
","This movie was simply wonderful. We finally see he series come to an end, and boy does it go out with a bang! We get way more action here than in the previous movie, and it moves at a much quicker pace (which is how the book goes too). <br/><br/>Harry, Ron, and Hermione finally stop camping in the woods and return to Hogwarts, and the battle ensues with Voldemort and his army almost immediately after. A few things happen in the movie before this, but the movie really starts at Hogwarts. In the book, Harry was absent from most of the battle, but here we get to see extensive footage of it and Hogwarts gets torn up! The special effects here are the best they've ever looked, and the powerful score is very effective at playing you to root for Harry and his friends. And yes, several main characters do die.<br/><br/>My only real complaints of the movie were that Voldemort is a bit over the top, and some characters don't get nearly enough screen time. Also, the epilogue feels a bit rushed in order to end the movie in a timely manner. These are mostly forgivable though.<br/><br/>This ties for the 3rd movie as my favorite in the series. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are all very well-acted, the action is great, the score is beautiful, and I was engaged the whole time. This movie is one of the best ways to kill an afternoon."

I love all the graphics in this film and really, really enjoyed watching this film over and over again. I'm glad that the Deathly Hallows was split into two films as I feel that this made the last two films a lot better and less rushed as could have been if made into one film. It was also lovely to see at the end the future for Harry, Ron and Hermione.

Poor Harry, because he lost many of his loved ones yet he managed to move on with his life. His personality has my heart sympathizing him.

At least now we know that evil has been conquered and all the students including Harry, Ron and Hermione can live happily with their own families and friends without fear of the Dark Lord ever returning again. My favorite books and movies were Harry Potter and the Prizoner of Azkaban, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire & Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows 1-2.

"RyanCShowers","Null","0","1","24 July 2013"," What We've Been Waiting For
","Warner Brothers and the Potter team underwent a lot of unfriendly publicity when they decided to split J.K. Rowling's final novel, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, into two separate films being released at different times. Outraged film journalists and bloggers claimed they were trying to gripe up as much currency this series could stretch out. However, after seeing both films, I understand and fully support the decision. This allowed the first film to slowly develop the thick novel's plot and gave everyone the room to breathe, and the viewer could following the plot without any confusion. Part II succeeds on even greater scales.<br/><br/>I saw Deathly Hallows Part 2 in theaters, the night it was released, at midnight, and after being a casual fan of the first seven films I never felt more satisfied, enthralled, or excited by a movie before. This is how an epic series should end. No matter what movie series your loyalties like with (Scream, Batman, The Godfather, Spiderman) every fan deserves a conclusion to their series like the one Harry Potter has achieved. Deathly Hallows Part 2 is what the characters and story have been geared toward for seven movies, what the filmmakers have been waiting to tell for seven movies, and what we've waited to see for seven movies. The aspect most present in Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the pathos plugged into every second of the film, making the story and the characters float on top of the emotional tone. The filmmakers treat our emotional equilibriums like horcruxes they have to break to assure the success of the picture. Trust me, every horcrux will be broken in your theater. Deathly Hallows is a wonderfully mature film, thankfully releasing itself from the family adventure it began as. The beginning films were wonderful for what they were, but Deathly Hallows Part 2 is the ripe entry where we witness the darkness we've been told about since the first days of Hogwarts. The darkness that is tapped into through the mood of the picture makes us feel like we weren't just hearing Wizard-urban legends for a decade.<br/><br/>Deathly Hallows Part 2's biting force is the direction by David Yates. Having a rough time adjusting to the series, Yates is in his element here combining his style with dramatic emotion, war action, and finality. The fight between Harry and Voldemort has been blueprinted since the day we signed on to be fans of the series, being the last film we know it's coming, we just want to get there. In J.K. Rowling's novel, there are a lot of twists that derail the plot from reaching that climax, but Yates paces them in such a way that makes them tolerable and even involving. Yates hits the hard scenes with just as much of a punch in which Rowling wrote them.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling deserves a moment of silence for crafting this series, it's all her imagination and work on the screen. The history Rowling has thought up cracks through this installment beautifully. Part 2 brings back all the memories we made those first six years at Hogwarts and incorporates them into the plot. The characters feel complete, particularly Alan Rickman's Snape. Maggie Smith proves she's still a badass in Professor McGonagall's olden age. The only flaw with Rowling's source material is the film is occasionally stuck with cliché choreography within the written story and the character's not staying true to their realistic humanity. It's not a colossal flaw, but something most adventure-fantasy epics get wrong. Thankfully Harry Potter only floats into this in short occurrences. The most respected aspect of Harry Potter's success in the film community is the advances and proficiencies in its production values and technical aspects; the final installment don't dare slack. The set design is unbelievable, all the sets, not even just the Hogwarts castle (which may be at its best with the film's in-depth showing of destruction of Hogwarts). The photography is something Potter has improved the most on, here it sweeps the audience away like dust by a broom. The special effects are also a benchmark for the series. <br/><br/>In Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2, the worst-case-scenario becomes a reality within the Wizard world. The more pain the characters are plunged into, the more the story is plunged into darkness, the more the film ties the viewer to its internal heart. The emotion it reaches for an fantasy picture is remarkable.he final entry of Harry Potter brings out the big guns and it has more gusto in its destructive action sequences than most Greek tragedies. Harry Potter was never given the same red carpet treatment Lord of the Rings was given in its shorter run, which is a shame because Deathly Hallows Part 2 is better than anything those three films dished out. <br/><br/>Rating: 9.5/10<br/><br/>Grade: A"

","The last movie in the Harry Potter series was amazing, from the beginning to the end. The entire cast put on an amazing performance.

All characters were portrayed beautifully by the actors and actresses; in particular, Maggie Smith. She was absolutely amazing! Professor Sass! <br/><br/>It might have left a lot of things out from the book, but for a movie it was a 10/10 (you can't always add in everything.)It was a wonderful movie just like the others, but this one tops them all. This movie was everything and more :) <br/><br/>I was sad that it was the final one, but I smile because it happened and I will always be a Potterhead!

She shared something that will be opened for generations to come because Hogwarts will always be there to welcome you home!"
"claudemercure","8","0","2","12 June 2013"," the series ends on a high note
","Harry and his friends make their way back to Hogwarts for a final confrontation. By this point it's clear that this is no longer a children's fantasy story. The stakes are kept high by a sizable body count and heavy themes such as self-sacrifice. The film is anchored by Harry's weighty realization that he is a horcrux and that he must die. J.K. Rowling's clever final plot turns remain intact, including a moving trip through Snape's memories. Slight changes – such as having Harry and Voldemort confront each other away from everyone else – render the climax a bit less memorable than it might've been. Also, Harry's relationship to Ginny feels rather perfunctory, having barely been established in the previous films."

"ChristianUnchained","10","0","1","23 April 2013"," An Epic and Bittersweet Farewell
","This may just be the most true review I have ever written. And the most geeky praise review I have ever written. I truly have never come out of a movie with a feeling quite like leaving Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Pt. 2. Magical some have called it. Amazing others have labeled it. Personally, It was perfect. Don't take the confusion as a bad thing. Deathly Hallows is bloody brilliant. <br/><br/>The critics are correct in every claim. <br/><br/>The acting is unlike any of the other films, in a good way. It is truly emotional and intense, and Radcliffe's performance is stellar. None of the characters ""over-do"" their acting, and each main character has key moments that really shine (especially Neville! What a BA), and all have truly learned how to perform their characters perfectly. Next to the acting comes the stellar, glorious action. Throughout the HP movies, we have gotten tastes of the magic duels and massive battles, but none have been as grand and as epic and as extended as Deathly Hallows Part 2. The action couldn't be anything without the amazing special effects. <br/><br/>From the explosive final war to the dragon to Gringott's to Hogwarts to the final duel, everything is beautiful, eye catching and wonderful. Everything looks believable, everything looks magical and everything looks perfect. <br/><br/>And who could forget that famous theme, composed by none other than the masterful John Williams? The music fits so perfectly, so flawlessly with the film from mysterious start to grandiose finish. The variations of the original theme, and the ending 19 years later segment music is so spine chillingly spell binding, I was overcome with sheer happiness and emotion. Desplat has crafted a gorgeous score, that for sure! And this being the final movie, everyone was hoping for the most intense Potter film. <br/><br/>For me, the Part One of the Deathly Hallows was lackluster. It was boring and flat, but I knew the payoff was going to be worth it. It was, in every way. Like I explained before, the action is plain huge, the acting is top-notch and the cinematography is beautiful. Every special effect is eye catching and the attention to detail is astounding. <br/><br/>This has truly been a treat, and this has been the first book movie since the epic Return of the King that earns the label of astounding. So all this boils down to the final word. This huge Potter fan was pleased by the movie, but there is something else there, and that was the feeling as the credits rolled. Throughout the 10 years that the Harry Potter movies have been in production, there has been something wonderful emanating throughout the movies. The charm of the small band of heroes has had such chemistry from the start and they've always been a likable group of friends. <br/><br/>But strangely enough, as the credits crept up, I felt like I was sending off someone close as well. Saying goodbye to Harry, Ron and Hermione was unlike anything I have felt before coming out of movie. I grew up with Harry Potter and the HP movies, and I feel like I've grown alongside the characters all these years. Seeing these characters go feels bittersweet, like bidding a good friend goodbye. I'm sure (I hope) that I'm not the only one that feels this way, a strange combination of joy and sorrow. It's just a weird feeling, bidding goodbye to such a magical series. But so good as well, because now there is more incentive to return to the earlier movies, read the books and relive ""our"" adventures all over again. And thats the exciting thing about the finale of the Harry Potter film saga. <br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows (Part 2) is no doubt the perfect send off of Harry and friends. It is emotional, intense and action packed. It is a glorious exploration of dark themes with a hopeful finale in an expertly crafted way. And as you could've guessed, it's an incredibly well crafted movie of epic proportions. It's the pitch perfect send off for a timeless series."

","I went into Deathly Hallows Part 2 excited the book (mainly the second half) was fantastic and Part 1 had been fairly loyal to the novel.<br/><br/>The film started off well with the escape from Gringotts being well shot and written. However things began to spiral from then (30 minutes). Harry's return to Hogsmeade was OK although there was no mention about the wailing being a caterwhauling charm.<br/><br/>I recognise that although the scene when Harry confronts Snape in the great hall is pretty epic I was sad that the Ravenclaw common room scene had been cut and McGonagall's duel with Snape was too quick.<br/><br/>Then came the battle, this was what disappointed me. It was all too much Harry and skipped a lot of it especially Fred's death scene, Neville with all the plants and the inclusion of Kreacher and the centaurs.<br/><br/>The scene with Dumbledore at Kings Cross was great but it was a shame Dumbeledore's back story was ignored throughout the final 2 films as in my opinion it's one of the more important parts of the story.<br/><br/>The final duel with Voldemort was exciting and epic but I was really disappointed by the lack of the final battle in the hall where all the different characters take down various death eaters. It would have also been cool to have seen Kingsley, Slughorn and McGonagall duel with Voldemort. This would have added more screen time for characters other than Harry, Ron and Hermione who dominated the film a bit too much. I don't know if the final confrontation wasn't included to stop the good characters 'killing' the Death Eaters as Bellatrix's and Voldemorts 'confetti' deaths showed that.<br/><br/>The epilogue was well shot although it's a shame Teddy Lupin was not mentioned properly. The CGI throughout the film was good especially on the Dragon and Ralph Fiennes' acting as Voldemort was great.<br/><br/>This gets a solid 7/10 due to good acting and effects but unfortunately the story lets it down."

","Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows is an outstanding way to finish the astonishingly famous and successful Harry Potter franchise! Its large amounts of edge-of-your-seat action kept me completely entertained throughout the film as shocking truths were discovered and mortifying battles were fought! The characters were the same ones I know and love, the actors were at their best performances yet, and the grand finale was truly captivating and memorable! It's a film I'll always look forward to watching every time! I would strongly recommend this movie to all Harry Potter fans, and for those who never watched any of the previous Harry Potter movies, it may be enough to persuade them to watch them!"

","It's the end for the fans of Harry Potter. After seven movies, finally it was filmed the second part of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. Directed by David Yates, the last saga's movie had more than a billion of the viewers in a few time. In 2001, the first movie Harry Potter and the Philosopher Stone was an extraordinary success, and all other 7 movies followed the same feature. In this film, Harry Potter continue his journey looking for horcruxes and now, he and his best friends Rony and Hermione discovered some things very important about how to finish this war against the darkness. However, Lord Valdemort has the most powerful wand of the world, and the Godric Griphindor's sword, the only thing powerful enough to destroy the horcruxes, disappeared again. But, it won't be problem to Harry and his friends, because all the order of the phoenix's members and the Hogwarts' students will make part of this battle. Many characters from the lasted movies come back to finish this amazing story. Hogwarts is again the scene for the magical battle, and finally Harry and Tom Riddle – Voldemort- are going to fight face to face.<br/><br/>As we know, this is the last movie, so it's necessary to be clear in this movie's part. The director could select the most appropriate parts of the book to make a film, after all some viewers don't like to read the books, so they need to comprehend as much as the reader. There are many details about the solution for some trouble that were showed during the saga, and this make the Harry Potter fans crazy, because they can see that is what they imagined – for who read the books- , or even find all the answers- for who just follow the saga with the movies. J.K. Rowling made a wonderful job, because she could make new fans with her books every day, and the movies continue their effect on the people. Because this phenomenon, Daniel Radcliff (Harry Potter)Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) and Rupert Grint (Rony Weasley) were millionaires before thirty years old, and J.K. Rowling is one of the richest woman in all the world. To the fans, to transforming the seventh book in two movie's part is amazing, after all, they may continue a little longer with their favorite world, but to the economy, it's wonderful because they could collect twice more money than in just one film. Hogwarts finished on the cinemas, but the fans will continue watching the movies at home and reading the books again, and again. Some critics will continue saying: ""Thank you God for ending this boring story"". But one day they will discovered that they lost them times being a muglle because Hogwarts always will be there to help which those resorting to it."

","It's well known in my small circle that I'm not an overall fan of the Harry Potter seriesbut damn, what a great finale.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part Deux, or HP7b, was not just fun, exciting and adventurous, but it was a wonderfully written and tight conclusion wrapping up multiples of story lines without over doing it. It's for die-hard fans to pinpoint all the singular references from the previous seven movies. (It helps me that, instead of waiting the year – or in some cases, TWO – in between, I watched them all within 9 days. Yeah, even I had a day off in between)<br/><br/>The revolutions in this, including some major character's motivations, were enjoyable and it was nice to finally get the answersespecially after having to sit through an astounding 1,178 minutes of film to get to a conclusion that was foretold from all-but minute one.<br/><br/>Basically, I've already given the synopsis, but with more clarity: it's the final (and thoroughly EXCITING) battle between No-Nose and Harry Potter, the boy that livedthrough their first meeting 16 years prior. There will be destruction. There will be deaths. There will be blood. And mercifully, no one spoiled who died, or when, but I actually expected more deaths from more significant characters.<br/><br/>In fact, as spoiler free as people were courteous to be, the way they ranted about the deaths in Deathly Hallows, I had it narrowed down to one of two (of the countless) main characters who were going to kick the wicked bucket. I was wrong.<br/><br/>At any rate, I had a ball. It certainly was one of the best (and thankfully, was the shortest) of all Harry Potter movies, although if I were to rank them, it would go something like this:<br/><br/>1. Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix <br/><br/>2. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 <br/><br/>3. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1<br/><br/>4. Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets <br/><br/>5. Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban <br/><br/>6. Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone <br/><br/>7. Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire <br/><br/>8. Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince <br/><br/>Well that concludes, and probably for good, my Harry Potter journey. As much as I complained (okay, RAGED) through some, as much as I got excited in other parts, I did have fun and will be happy I got through all 19½ hours to say, once and for all: I do have an open mind to all cinema. Even ones that aren't typically my cup of British Tea.<br/><br/>Cheers!"

","The Harry Potter saga came to a satisfying end with this film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. This is the perfect example of how to end a series of what was perhaps the best film franchise in history. This is as close as it gets when it comes to being flawless. The visuals are outstanding and gorgeous in 2D format, a story that packs an emotional punch is being told, and we see for sure that after a decade in the business, our young three main actors have grown up.<br/><br/>David Yate's film starts off right where Part 1 leaves off. We see Harry, Ron, and Hermione hunting down the final Horcruxes which eventually will lead them to Hogwarts where they have a final showdown between good and evil.<br/><br/>This film is well-acted, perhaps the best acting I have seen this series. Radcliffe, Grint, and Watson are essentially Harry, Ron, and Hermione in essence. I was very happy that Alan Rickman and Matthew Lewis got their dues in this film. Rickman had many scenes that tend to play heavy on the emotions and Lewis as Neville Longbottom really turned into the hero that made Gryffindor house proud. All-in-all, the acting was amazing.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the best Harry Potter ever made. It's fitting that it had to be the last one to be the best but this has been the best film franchise I have ever seen and I am sad to see it go. I was not disappointed by the Battle of Hogwarts. All the technical work that was put into it was top-notch. It was epic in the book, but even more epic on-screen. I was very happy to hear the iconic John Williams themes here that have been absent for quite a few movies. This movie had the perfect ending and I'm glad they did not screw that up. I admit by the time the movie ended, a tear or two came to my eyes. The Boy Who Lived will always live on! I rate this film 10/10."

So we see them going on their search through Diagon Alley for the first few minutes of the movie, and then we see them return to Hogwarts for the ultimate showdown.<br/><br/>So when they go to Hogwarts and they fight the final battle while taking out the Horcruxes, it was armed with an all-out war throughout the movie. And I realize that all the kids from the previous films are now young adults who have matured throughout the last six films and Deathly Hallows Part 1. And I watched the series and read the books because I am a huge Harry Potter fan.<br/><br/>This film had great music, an epic script, stunning special effects and terrific lighting.<br/><br/>And the final smack down at the end of the movie was the only scene that got my heart racing and thinking to myself 'Come on Harry, you can stop him. Now's your chance.' But I got a little emotional on the inside when I watched this movie for the first time in the theater.

","Some of the kiddies here were quite impressed by this film. Indeed, it is among the best of the series, but it is not a masterpiece of cinema. It is a competent adaptation of the novels into film. In fact, the last book was transformed into two films to milk the franchise as much as possible which therefore reduce the artistic accomplishments of these films.<br/><br/>However, abstracting away from such issues and watching this film as a film it is very good. It is flawed in parts but in other ways it is very good and sometimes even powerful if you are invested into the characters from watching the previous films or reading the novels.<br/><br/>However, doesn't watch this if you haven't watched the previous films or read the novels.

It has a bit for everyone. Your emotions will be worn out when you're finished. You will laugh, cry, stare in shock and bewilderment, chuckle, grin, fight back tears, pump your fist, smack yourself, frown, and clap. Clap and clap and clap. The words, ""not my daughter, you *ahem*!"" will make you clap and cheer until whoever is sitting with you will stare pointedly. The film has an emotional side, too, which will leave you thinking long after the duration of the movie. There's romance, magic, depression, humor, happiness, fantasy, and so much more. This movie is EPIC! New funny moments will come in, bits of humor or cool details you realize the second, third, or hundredth time. The music is amazing. Much if it sad, but amazing. My favorite character, Snape, shows Harry something very sad and emotional that will make you cry or stare. Some of the book's quotes remain, my favorite being this: look... at.... me... There's something added onto that sad, sad quote that won't make sense the moment you see it. Later on, in the movie, maybe after, it will make sense.

","Ten years after its debut, the Harry Potter film franchise has drawn to a close. The dedicated fan-based generated by the book series of the same name has been subject to a fairly consistent variety of offerings, but never (in my estimation, at least) has any one of the pictures ventured into the realm of being truly ""bad."" Thankfully, the same can be said for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2. Is it epic? Not at all. But it is a slam-bang finale that—for the most part— satisfies.<br/><br/>Picking up where Deathly Hallows: Part 1 concluded, the final act of the film has a much more action-oriented focus. The story, of course, continues to revolve around mystical items called ""horcruxes,"" the persistent evil of Lord Voldemort, and the whimsical stuff that otherwise defines the alternate world in which Hogwarts exists. The final ""revelations"" are not entirely predictable, but anyone moderately familiar with Potter lore should have a solid idea as to where the whole thing is going to end up. In a sense, that's one of the things that's made the Harry Potter story so successful: it's a clear-cut case of good vs. evil, and, given the ridiculously muddled narrative webs that many tales are caught up in these days, that's an extreme rarity. I mean, really: in the final moments, when Harry and Voldemort are wand-dueling and red and green sparks are flying, one can't help but think of other similar confrontations (think Luke Skywalker vs Darth Vader, Frodo vs. Gollem, ad infinitum). At its core, then, the movie is fueled by a basic—though extraordinarily powerful—mythos that's hard to ignore.<br/><br/>The movie isn't perfect by any stretch of the imagination, though.<br/><br/>In fact, it suffers from a similar syndrome that just about all stories with an abundance of fantastical elements seem to think is absolutely necessary: namely, a crazy amount of overblown battle sequences. Don't get me wrong: I enjoy this sort of thing every once in a while. I do, however, think that the story has to merit the inclusion of such a large-scale confrontation, though. Here, when goody-two-shoes- professors and minions-of-the-Dark-Lord face off amid the ruins of the once proud School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, there's a sense that things are a bit well forced. It's as if the filmmakers came to the realization that they were at the end, and that this was the appropriate time to plug-in sweeping armies, etc. It also seems as if the long- awaited showdown between Harry and Voldemort was much too tame. It's got its moments, but when the inevitable comes to pass, I found myself whispering, ""Really? That's it?""<br/><br/>I know what you're thinking: well, it was better in the book. That may be true. But this isn't the book: it's the movie. And after investing countless hours in this cosmic collision that should be the end-all, be- all of the Potter universe, the unfathomably large audience that's waited patiently for this final installment deserves something much more grandiose.<br/><br/>I say all of this with love. I really did have fun watching the movie. It's just that that special ""something"" that makes up a classic seems to be just out of arm's-reach. When taken as a whole, though, there's no denying the power of the spectacle of one of the better movie series to come along in quite some time."

","Well its official I have read all the books and seen all the movies. Yes I know I am a little late to the punch but frankly after reading the books and seeing the first three movies I kind of gave up on the movies. But Im really glad I decided to give them another chance. Yes they always skip a lot of stuff but I feel this one was done well mostly due to the fact they spilt it into two parts.<br/><br/>The Deathly Hallows is by far the best of the movies. It is the most intense with the best acting and a great ending. The only thing I would have to say is while reading these books its hard to pick out the plot holes and the points that don't make sense but in the movie its very easy to point these out and is there ever a lot of them. Granted it is a book about magic so I don't expect it to make the most of sense but a lot of things just don't add up in it.<br/><br/>This movie follows Harry Potter as he tries to destroy all the remaining horcruxes. He goes back to Hogwarts to find the last one where Voldemort and a bunch of death eaters follow. A huge battle is fought and Harry learns the truth about why he survived Voldemorts attack in the first place.<br/><br/>This movie is really enjoyable and definitely the best one out of the movie series.

"kat_777","9","0","1","11 October 2012"," Best among the series!!!!
","Don't READ IF YOU Haven't SEEN THE MOVIE <br/><br/>The one word I would use to describe Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows part 2 is ""Spectacular"". There are many reasons for it. Let me start. I was a strong fan of Harry Potter since I saw the first film. I've read all the books and the movies were also good. The series may not 100% appealing to everyone, as some may still find it difficult to swallow the idea of witches and wizards flying around on brooms etc. Some may find it stupid and childish, some may think it as rubbish when it comes to the whole concept of kids going to a school of witchcraft and wizardry. Some will find it really creative as they notice a whole new world created by J K Rowling (which is where I step in). However it goes, the biggest attraction or the plus point I find in Harry Potter series is the way they have highlighted Friendship, family, true love (and not lust unlike the twilight saga) bravery, courage,sacrifice (and not suicide) the affinity towards academic activities and education.<br/><br/>That is what the books highlight, now the movies have to rule out as well add in a lot of things. The last movie was highly anticipated because it is end of the franchise. The movies Goblet of fire, order of the phoenix and half blood prince weren't up to to the expectations because so many cool sub plots were eliminated and th movies were just action thriller.<br/><br/>Even Deathly hallows part 2 have many sub plots missing.Sub plots like, Harry and Ginny's relationship. I don't their relationship was shown well enough to convince the audience. In spite of that still this movie managed to capture our attentions and enter in my best movies list with help of direction, acting, music and visual effects.<br/><br/>This film had everything, drama, humor, action, suspense and artistic scenes. David Yats improved a lot since the Order of the phoenix. Performances was good from all the actors. This film had Daniel's best performance from all the Harry Potter movie. He managed to remain steadfast and controlled. He's improved on not having a blank face. I want to see him do more good movies and roles. Emma Watson was at her best. She is no longer the geek bushy haired girl we met in philosopher's stone. She's changed and delivered a versatile performance. Hermione is true role model for every little girl and Emaa has to be the actor with the brightest future among the entire teen cast. Because she is beautiful and has a lot of caliber.<br/><br/>Rupert was the only person i found less impressive compared to others because he had nothing much to do or deliver. Tom Felton is the handsomest guy in the series. It's a pity that the Slytherin kids had to be locked in the dungeons and not have them involved in the battle, except two of course Lord voldemort, and Severus Snape. Ralph Fiennes have more and more weird as the series progressed. Alan Rickman was totally brilliant. A lot of characters died in the series. Sirius Black was my favorite character but I didn't feel sad when he died, because I heard too many reviews on how sad his death scene was so the effect was gone. Same was in the case of dumbledore whose death is supposed to be a tear jerker. But when Snape died, I felt sad (I didn't cry though) Because the certain thought came to my mind that is they will really miss the professor who comes bursting into the class without any words and say ""Page 394"". And the whole back story of Sbnape was very touching. When he died he was no longer the person who simply terrifies Harry.<br/><br/>The one person who didn't from the beginning was Helena Bonham Carter. She was brilliant in the sense anyone will feel like putting a cruciatus curse on Bellatrix Lestrange. Julie Walters, Maggie Smith, and all were good. Bonnie Wright was the only person I found the least worthy because. She just can't do great emotions and her character also didn't look that over whelming. Her reaction when she hears that ""Harry Potter is dead"" could have presented better. Besides there should have been more depth added to the relation between Harry and Ginny. <br/><br/>The technical part was also handled well. The movie had convincing 3D effects. There many memorable scenes like<br/><br/>1. the bank vault where the vessels multiply when touched. 2. Dragon escape scene. 3. The final Battle where Voldemort is defeated.<br/><br/>Alexandre Desplat music was good. I was totally in love with the Harry Potter since I listened to them on you tube just for fun. Alexandre Desplat added more to increase the depth and creepiness at some situations.<br/><br/>The movie was wonderful and everybody did wonderful jobs and the thing is it could have been better with little more polishing. But no adaptation is perfect and all the movies managed to stand up to the best it can. <br/><br/>The epic scene that is the final one where the trio's children go away to their time in Hogwarts we then see the trio together for the last time on the final chapter and the series is concluded.<br/><br/>9/10"

","J.K. Rowling must be a woman of overriding emotions. Beginning by scribbling in those coffee shops paid off into blockbuster magic. Harry Potter's final instalment is a fitting tribute to J.K's beautiful, eccentric imagination, pursuing the world of magic in a tone that replicates every living soul's beliefs of wizardry. The tone of the magic becoming dark and disconcerting was foreseeable as legend has it that there are those who experiment beyond a devilish level. Those desirable Potter fans that have travelled throughout the world of Hogwarts, having been given an illustrated ending full of emotion and power that encourage those devotees to support Harry and his compatriots on their route towards Voldermort's destruction.<br/><br/>The characters have matured and materialised as have the actors, becoming older and more professional towards their dedication throughout their prolonged Potter endurance. One can only envisage the depth of sadness of the franchise reaching its climax. We have endured a figurative and wonderful relationship between Harry, Hermoine and Ron. They have characterised the film and developed Rowling's paperback into a picturesque reality as they visualised the potential of the series and knew cinema has never and will never experience cinema again like this. The sheer emotions of the actors during the premier exemplified the devotion and commitment to something that will live with them and characterise them for the rest of their careers. The question is whether the trio can reach the heights of the Harry Potter franchise in future projects.<br/><br/>This final adventure encapsulates the nature of the relationship and feud between both Harry and Voldermort. Giving us a deepening explanation of the events that have unfolded in the previous seven outings. Voldermort's determination to siege power and defeat the brave Harry brings the pair closer than we have ever seen, giving us a true picture of how J.K.

"dromasca","8","0","1","4 October 2012"," the magic ends
","I am no big fan of Harry Potter. J.K. Rowling's novels are a combination of two literary genres that I am not fond off – the teenager adventures which I somehow left behind after reading Jules Verne when I was a teenager myself and the magic adventures stories which never really charmed me. Blame my scientific formation.<br/><br/>Not having read any of the books I had to watch the films to get an idea what Harry Potter is about, and here again I did not fall in love. I liked the characters at many moments but I was not fascinated by them. The permanent gallery of good and bad witches with professorial robes fighting each other until and sometimes beyond death ended by confusing me and I stopped watching them carefully from a point on. If there is something that I really liked those were the computerized characters that seem to be benevolent, yet very ugly and very funny at the same time. Do not ask me their names.<br/><br/>And now the end came. In two series spread over two years. I have seen them both in one evening, five hours of magic cinema thanks to the Jewish holidays. Again I could not help but admiring the impeccable camera work, the endless imaginary of the settings with a cool look, cool as they look very good and cool as in frozen as most of the action happens in winter. I also sensed the much darker treatment of the characters, after all round-spectacled kids grow up into round-spectacled teenagers and young men with a different problems, and of course little cued girls grow up into cued young women, and the process can be painful, as we know from our own experiences, or some of us even as parents. The good performances of Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson made me by the end care about this gang.<br/><br/>I less cared about the apocalyptic battles in this last film in the series, and not even Ralph Fiennes' performance as the super bad guy could convince me that the end can be anything else but the sympathetic heroes wining the war and living happily together in one combination or another. The tendency of the big series from the TV 'Lost' to 'The Lord of the Rings' and now Harry Potter to fight the end of world again each time becomes a little obsessional. The spectacular effects may be the ones attracting the audiences in the cinema theaters, they are not what the viewers remain with a day, a month, a year or a decade after they saw the film. It's the round spectacles and the first exchange of looks between a boy and a girl (be they magician apprentices) that will survive better."

","Having read the book, I went to see DH Part 2. However, I did some research before and read this was to be the shortest HP movie made; I was very disappointed by that. Therefore prepared to watch many cut scenes, I went to see the movie. The scenes were very well choreographed, the Battle of Hogwarts was as epic as I thought it would be, the actors did their job really well. However, what decreases my rating from 10 to 7 are the scenes they cut out and could have added to the movie. (I would not have minded, as with many others, if the movie was even 30 minutes longer, however the scenes should have lasted only seconds long) 1. Only one dialogue shared between George and Fred before (SPOILERS!!!!) Fred dies. 2. No chemistry between Lupin and Tonks. 3. Teddy Lupin was neglected from the story. 4. Snape's memories, which were crucial for the story, were shortened. 5. Not enough tension built as Harry moves towards the Forbidden Forest to (SPOILERS!!!) face his death. 6. Only a few seconds are spared on the deaths of three of the most important characters in the HP universe (Fred, Remus and Nymphadora). 7. The epic final battle between Harry and Voldemort takes place where nobody can see. 8. Unsatisfactory rejoicing when Voldemort dies. 9. Voldemort and Bellatrix die in an unintended humorous way. 10. Harry snaps the Elder wand, but does not repair his own phoenix wand! 11. Harry stands at the edge of a broken bridge, almost teetering on the edge, about to fall down after he defeated the villain. 12. Lavender, Colin, etc. are not spared any seconds by the director. <br/><br/>All in all, the sense of war that Rowling creates so well in the book is not that well created in the book. However, due to the cast, dialogue, costumes, sets, choreography the movie is fitting to be the final conclusion of an 8 film series."

","We have finally come to the last page of J.K. Rowling's epic saga. Thiz is the final adventure of wonder boy wizard Harry Potter. The seventh and last book split into two separate movies. To be honest, it's very hard to criticize since the movies were shot back-to-back. In other words, these movies are actually one movie. The opening sequence has a very slow pace of storytelling which allows every detail can be described better. There is no need for further explanation. The story starts right away, showing the preparation of dark lord to hunt Harry Potter and the dark atmosphere surrounding Hogwarts which is now ruled by Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Meanwhile, Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) continue on their journey to find the last Horcruxes. The story eventually has some twists to throw at the end of the movie, but for most of the fans it will not be a twist anymore since they had already read the series books before thiz movie. The final battle between Harry Potter and the dark lord himself is one of the most highly anticipated scenes. The long awaited climax event is perfectly told, it looks like Daniel Radcliffe has done his best, but I think what makes that final scene so intense is also a splendid acting improvisation by Ralph Fiennes as You-Know-Who. Thiz movie is still directed by David Yates who has been the Director of thiz epic since ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" (2007), ""Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince"" (2009) and, of course, ""Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: Part 1"" (2010). Once again, thiz franchise has already become a part of each and every one of us. You will easily agree thiz statement (Spoiler Alert!), especially when we come to the end of the movie which tells Harry Potter, his wife Ginny (Bonnie Wright), Ron and Hermione send their children off to Hogwarts school from platform 3 ¾. In that very moment, we realize what we've just seen is not just Harry Potter, but it is all of us who have become older and mature during thiz franchise.

","After seeing the first part that I found boring I thought that Harry Potter part two was better. My rating: 6/10 (not so bad). My opinion about the movie is that it has very good special effects and that it is the only thing I liked the ""most"" in Harry Potter. The special effects are the most used details in Harry Potter movie and they are so excellent, especially the scene where we see the battle of Voldemort against Harry Potter and this is the scene I preferred the most in the film. It was so well done! But it doesn't mean that I found it super good. Not at all. I am not really a fan of Harry film. I never really understood the Harry Potter stories and it is too difficult for me to understand and to make sense with it. Probably because, I never read any of the books. Harry Potter is a very violent film with a lot of bloody scenes. It is too violent sometimes. My sister read some or every Harry books but not me. But I have to admit that some things are good in the film (like the special effects, of course). Harry Potter is a good story. I've seen the entire seven films and I preferred the second and fifth one (I think). It is very hard for me to understand Harry's stories. I saw it at the cinema in 3D and to be honest the 3D glasses didn't give anything special to the screen. It was so boring! I wonder if Harry Potter is a real success in the world. But for me it isn't. There are a lot of sad feelings in the Harry films. It is very sad sometimes. But it is scarry at the same time. I will give only 1 Oscar for Harry Potter film. Good try anyway. My name is Constantin and I am fourteen years old. Goodbye."

","This is it, the end of an era. The last Harry Potter movie, and Harry's last stand against Voldemort. So is the last film a triumphant end or disappointment for the world's most famous wizard? <br/><br/>Voldemort has the elder wand. Harry, Hermione, and Ron nearly escaped the Death Eaters with Luna, Mr. Olivander (John Hurt) and Griphook (Warwick Davis) the goblin with the help of Dobby—who sadly did not survive. After finding out information from Mr. Olivander and Griphook, Harry, Ron and Hermione go to Gringotts Bank with Hermione disguised as Bellatrix. They are convinced Bellatrix has at least one horcrux in her vault. After successfully getting the Hufflepuff cup from the vault Harry gets intense visions of Voldemort's reaction, and information that another horcrux is in Hogwarts. Despite fearing Snape in the headmaster's position, the three heroes apparate into Hogsmeade. When alarms go off from their arrival, they are sheltered by Dumbledore's disgruntled brother Aberforth (Ciaran Hinds) in his bar. While Aberforth grumpily tells them they are doomed, a very battered Neville arrives though a secret passageway to bring them to the castle. Once inside Hogwarts the war between good and evil begins. Snape and other Death Eaters are driven out, while Harry, the Order and Hogwarts' staff and students do their best to protect the school. Harry, Ron and Hermione must then fight the Death Eaters, find and destroy the remaining horcruxes, while Harry learns the truth about Snape, himself, and battles Voldemort for the last time.<br/><br/>This movie suffered a lot, I mean A LOT from the failures of the sixth film. So much information about the horcruxes and a few other subjects had been omitted that any viewer who has not read the books (or even not read them recently) will no doubt be confused. You can even tell how they cut out an enormous amount of info by the very long FAQ on this movie about ""how the book is different"". The pacing for this film was very rushed, which made some of the missing information even more confusing. This isn't the best of them all as it is hailed. I think people just call it that because they expected and wanted this to be the best. It really glosses over the deaths of all the characters, with maybe one getting more than a few seconds of ""mourning"". And it must be said that the make-up for the epilogue was so laughably pathetic that it's hard to watch. Really, the people that did the make-up for goblins, Mad-Eye and other fantastic creatures couldn't age the characters 20 years? They might as well have just gotten older actors that looked like them than give this poor excuse of make-up. Harry and Ron were somewhat passable, but they did nothing to age Ginny and Hermione except give them more ""adult"" hairstyles and dress! That being said, this is still a good movie, and a fairly good finale to Harry Potter. The fight/action scenes were very exciting. The magnitude of the Death Eater army was very well depicted. I must say that Snape's memories were fantastic, especially since I was worried about them butchering or ruining this aspect of the series. It was very meaningful to the series, and satisfying to those who read this part in the book. I'm really tearing this movie apart here, but I should add again that it IS a good movie. I wasn't disappointed in the movie as a whole, but I was disappointed in some aspects. I loved the Gringotts scenes and flashbacks. The best part was definitely from the Snape's memory until the end, as the pace also slowed down a bit for the viewers to absorb what was going on. This is a decent finale to the Harry Potter phenomena, and a difficult goodbye to the billions of fans all over the world."
"patryk-czekaj","8","0","2","26 April 2012"," Truly epic conclusion
","I have been a fan of Harry Potter's adventures since the first book came out. I was 10 at that time it happened. So, It is easy to imagine a child's enormous delight when the news of a film adaptations broke out. <br/><br/>Since that time 10 glorious years of Harry Potter's rise for the title of the biggest magic-driven phenomena in the cinema's history has passed. And my positive opinion about the books and the adaptations didn't change a bit. Even though some of the movies from the series weren't as good as others (i.e. The Order of the Phoenix), the last one didn't disappoint me at all. What is more, it was the best possible ending that I personally could have imagined. I was somehow scared that the outcome wouldn't be as astonishing as I pictured it while reading the book, but fortunately after the movie's first minutes all of my fears were gone.<br/><br/>Great acting on the part of the three main characters just makes you wish for more. The 'Potter generation' children grew with those actors, which is why it was so hard to say goodbye. We grew accustomed to their faces and their magical adventures. We started to adore Snape. At one point in time we even wanted to be as brave as Neville Longbottom. <br/><br/>The on-screen final battle for peace in the wizardly world is really enjoyable due to the outstanding special effects and the epic life-or-death struggle between Harry and Voldemort. Notice how young wizards and Hogwart's faculty members play a huge part, as always, in the defining moments of the movie.<br/><br/>Sadly, after all those years it finally happened. After walking out of the cinema I simply couldn't believe that the magic is gone and there will be no more quests of Potter and his entourage. However, I was delighted of the way it was depicted, not too long and perfectly accurate with the book. Now I can only hope that the memory of such world-changing series of movies will live on in our hearts and minds and that even kids of our kids will be aware of the grand finale of finales as depicted in the Harry Potter realm."
"Kieth11","7","0","2","25 March 2012"," Disappointing
","The first movie, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 1 was really good, although I have never read the book, I loved it, and I wanted to see this one really badly, but it, I'm afraid, let me down tremendously. The roller coaster scene is unforgettable, and very well done. It's kind of funny and unexpected when they literally drop out of the cart. Other than that, the ending like, 45 minutes was really incredibly disappointing. It was stupid, and even with all the magic happening, seeing the whole time, pretty much two beams of light coming from a stick is boring, even when, sometimes an interesting thing happens in between each light display. Part 1 was really intense, and gave me a feeling as if a spider was crawling down my back, and there were very, very few, and short scenes like that in Part 2. I expected more."

","I will start by saying that I really enjoyed the Deathly Hallows: Part 1. I thought, for me, it was the best of the Harry Potter films. Part 2 isn't a horrible movie, it actually starts out with some really well shot scenes. Nice pacing and a serious tone to what's being set up.<br/><br/>I must say though that by the end of the film I felt very unsatisfied. I was told that the film was full of action and little else, but its almost like they decided to not put any heart or emotion into the film, while at the same time not really having all that much action in it either.<br/><br/>I was very very unhappy with how they portrayed the ending. Weak. It strayed from the book a good bit......and not for the better. I also found it quite odd with what they chose to spend lots of time on and what they decided to cut very short.<br/><br/>The series is now over and it is what it is. I just wish they could have nailed the last piece."

""The End"". WTF? 7: Voldemort' death, was not neither that powerful as i was hoping, i was waiting a battle like harry and voldemort in the 4th movie, or like dumbledore vs Voldemort in ""harry potter 5"" 8:the special effects were good, and also the sound, but something with the scenario din't call my attention 9: too many deaths, and also of one of the best characters (one of the Weasly' brothers) 10:and too many comedy, no some good actions scenes. in conclusion: was one of the worst films of harry potter."

","With the evil Lord Voldemort in possession of the all-powerful Eternal Wand and his dark army in charge at Hogwarts, young wizard Harry Potter must rally his friends and find a way to defeat this monster.<br/><br/>I'm not aware of any other complete movie adaptations of a seven-book enclosed story, so author J.K. Rowling and the filmmakers must have had a pretty hard time coming up with a satisfactory conclusion to the riotously popular series of Harry Potter stories. I have to say I think they did pretty well. This movie is exciting and fun, but also does the weighty, mythical aspects of the story justice. It's a lot more enjoyable than its Part 1 predecessor, with much more action, plot twists, an epic battle sequence, a mystical hereafter scene and even an amusingly low-key epilogue. The key expository when Harry puts Snape's tears in the Pensieve is a bit inelegant - we suddenly get tons of information very quickly all at once - but this backstory is both tender and enjoyable (and I can also smugly say I suspected it, despite not having read any of the books). The general problem I have with this series is that as it's gone on it's become stodgier and more doom-laden; the first movie is the best one and the first three are all deliriously good fun, but this film redresses some of that balance. It's all good plotting from start to finish, it makes us care about all of the characters and whilst inevitably abridging the novel it ties the enormous bundle of story-threads up skilfully and enjoyably. Radcliffe has carried the pressure of the title role through eight movies, and his performance is particularly good here, full of heartfelt maturity, which makes all of the fantasy elements seem so real. Equally good is Rickman, whose supporting part has always been the lynchpin of the stories for me, and who just effortlessly is Professor Snape, in the way only truly great actors can completely inhabit a character. All of the key elements are top-notch - score, photography, editing, visual effects - and director Yates has corralled this enormous circus of a film series into a terrific entertainment extravaganza. Unlike my wife, I'm not really that much of a Harry Potter fan, but I love the way that Rowling and the filmmakers have imbued their work with that very best literary quality - good old-fashioned exciting storytelling, filled with imagination. If for no other reason than that, the Harry Potter books and movies are a great treasure to be savoured."

","Not only is this the best of the Potter films, but it made me overall appreciate the films and Rowling's novels with much more appreciation. The biggest problems with the other Potter films was over-length and ineffective juxtaposition, but this chapter suffers from neither. Yates is as fast-paced as ever and he blends multiple elements together effectively. The movie is spellbinding and grabs you from the start, not wandering like its precursor and gets us pretty much on every level. The special effects are as good as always and seeing the story go full circle is a comforting event that leaves us satisfied with the saga."

The graphics was just fantastic, camera work, beautiful places/sets, everything was almost perfect, still........ Keep your expectations in check, then the movie might seem better.<br/><br/>For a person like me who has not read any of the Potter books (though I have seen all the movies), the characters are not too intimate to me, so the story and what finally happens to them were not too important. So this was like just another movie.<br/><br/>I was left wondering what all this commotion was about Harry Potter, kids having an almost cult like following to it! I remember having read many Enid Blyton series, Hardy Boys etc., none had made me or my peers so crazy! (Or was it just the media blowing things out of proportion?) Even the high rating here, might be because of kids giving a 10 just because they are fans.<br/><br/>Also in the movie please don't expect some big twist or revelation.

Now I watched the first Harry Potter movie when I was at the age of 5 and it is so amazing that I grew up with this series. Now, Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows Part 2 was a great ending to this series. Some people say it really different from the book and I can't agree more. The thing is, this is great as an overall movie and I loved it. People were complaining about the death of Fred Weasley being such a small part of the movie but the truth is that the actor of George Weasley(Oliver Phelps) couldn't shoot the part for too long because seeing his brother dead was very emotional for him. The special effects were great! Hogwarts was looking like a real destroyed building and the explosions were great. Severus Snape's death was great and some of the actors perfected their parts. They made a great scene with James, Lily, Sirus, and Remus talking to Harry when he finds the Resurrection Stone and the death of Harry is also great when Dumbledore gets there. Neville did great too. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good movie to watch"

The special effects are up to date (something you should expect), the story concludes nicely (for someone who hasn't read the books, including myself). The acting is solid throughout.

He looks the part but the character fails to have the full impact he should.<br/><br/>It's great to see actors of Rickman and Fiennes' calibre sharing the screen but now the franchise is finished, I only hope that all this talent can be put to better use.<br/><br/>I don't wish for all the hours I spent watching these back but I do wish the money lavished on the budgets could have been spent on more interesting and better-written projects.

","Taken on its own, it might be a little too much in terms of ""epic moments"" with something seemingly momentous occurring every few minutes. But in conjunction with Part 1, which feels rather uneventful, it probably makes more sense. It seems like a lot of the fat is gone, and from what I can recall of the book, it's edited down nicely into digestible chunks without too much exposition. More importantly, the godawful epilogue is actually transformed into something decent, without that misguided compulsion to tie everything up into neat little bows. Yes, some bits throughout are going to be rather confusing to anyone not familiar with the source material, but they're not really the intended audience anyway. Production values are high, as one would one expect, with massive battles that only occasionally get too busy. I would definitely prefer to watch this back-to-back with Part 1, but that time will come when the inevitable Super Ultra Mega Edition Blu-Ray box set is released."
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","29 December 2011"," A fond farewell to a legendary Hollywood series
","Ten years ago when Harry Potter started it was simply mind blowing. Chris Columbus at the helm created a world and characters unlike anything we had ever seen on screen. I have never read the books and probably never will but I have enjoyed every single instalment of the series in different ways. However, post Goblet of Fire I personally began to see a gradual reduction in quality and story and characters. I suppose as they built up to the climatic inevitable battle against Voldemort that the sub-stories and characters would have to take a cut but its unfortunate. However, this is the perfect time for the series to bow out gracefully.<br/><br/>The main cast are still excellent in their roles. I don't think anyone was more born to play the three main kids than Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson. We have watched them grow into their characters and it is excellent. It was also great to see in this instalment the blossoming of romance between Grint's Ron and Watson's Hermione. The unfortunate part of the Deathly Hallows 1 and 2 is that the amazing supporting characters take a huge back seat role. The amazing Robbie Coltrane is barely existent as one of my favourites, Hagrid. Same with Maggie Smith and even Alan Rickman as Snape takes a bit of a backseat and that's really unfortunate because they were the heart and soul of the series. Ralph Fiennes is still excellent as Lord Voldemort though the final climatic battle actually turned out to be one of the most anti-climatic things I've ever seen in cinema.<br/><br/>What I mean is...8 films built up to this one climatic battle and its over in seconds and its not over in the way you would even expect. I don't mean to give anything away but this legendary literary and cinematic rivalry between Harry Potter and Lord Voldemort ends in the silliest way. However, it was also kind of nice to see a much understated character like Neville Longbottom played excellent by Matthew Lewis get a shining moment in the series. My final complaint was the ending in which we zoom ahead 15-20 years later to see Harry, Ron and Hermione sending their own children to Hogwarts. I suppose its a lose lose situation because I would have been annoyed if they had gotten older actors to portray them but seeing these 20 something year old kids playing 40+ year old adults was silly and they looked silly doing it. This was still the perfect ending to a great series, some truly outstanding visual effects as always and it was terrific that it all came to a head back at Hogwarts. If you watch this make sure you watch them all in order because together the series warrants at least a solid 9/10 but this instalment is a fond farewell but not the best in the series. 8/10"

","The Harry Potter film series, after a decade of production, has finally come to an end. What began as a children's fantasy with earnest innocence has culminated in a dark, depressing world for the series' protagonist to exist in. Expertly crafted and directed by David Yates, the series has reached its climactic conclusion with one of the best entries in the saga and one of this year's greatest films.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 begins where its predecessor left off, with the death of Dobby the Elf and Voldemort finally acquiring the Elder Wand. Harry, Ron, and Hermione get straight to work to find and destroy the rest of the Horcruxes that house pieces of Voldemort's soul. Seeing as how Part 1 ended on a cliffhanger, Part 2 doesn't do much to remind the audience of what happened before, relying instead on quick flashbacks and the audience's memory. This is a bold move and it unfortunately doesn't work too well as the beginning seems rushed until the trio reaches the outskirts of Hogwarts, where the wonder kicks off.<br/><br/>As teased by the trailer, we are treated to a battle of good versus evil where much is at stake if the latter triumphs. The film wades through set piece after set piece of destruction and mayhem caused by dark forces. Excellent character development is interspersed between these moments, continuing the trend started in Part 1 that the series lacked for years. David Yates has the greatest handle on the characters that the other directors could never quite grasp, exempting perhaps Alfonso Cuarón, but even he couldn't accomplish what Yates has done in his two-part finale.<br/><br/>Hallows: Part 2 is indeed dark and Yates' decision to show Voldemort at his most violent is a wise choice to exemplify the evil that needs to be decimated for the good of the wizarding world. Ralph Fiennes plays his role with utmost attention and trumps everything he's done in the series up until this point. He plays menacing convincingly and is able to show Voldemort's vulnerability with ease as he treks on to complete his mission of killing the Boy Who Lived.<br/><br/>Another key player is Severus Snape, brilliantly portrayed by Alan Rickman. Snape has a secret that only he, Voldemort, and Dumbledore are aware of and when all is revealed, Rickman's performance brings the film to an emotional climax. Rickman has been underutilized in the series as various directors over the years have had higher priorities in their visions; director David Yates has rectified that here. While the screen presence isn't impactful in terms of duration, it is with content, and that's what matters most. You will not see Rickman being used as an object of comedy as you see him in Mike Newell's Goblet of Fire and in certain instances in Order of the Phoenix (also directed by Yates). Here his sole purpose is to advance the dramatics of the story. Many have posited that he may be nominated for a Supporting Actor Oscar, and I can see why.<br/><br/>Not only is Yates' stellar direction seen through character moments in the film, it's also on display through its visuals. The man knows how to direct and he has consistently outshone his predecessors, particularly Christopher Columbus and Mike Newell. The action sequences are vivid and intriguing because of his talent, along with aid from cinematographer Eduardo Serra, whose camera-work is on par with what he achieved in Hallows: Part 1. It's interesting to compare the visual sense from the beginning of the saga and the end and note the completely different direction the series took. It began with innocent direction (fitting, but quite bland) to reflect Harry's introduction to the world, and ended with a bold and frantic nature to symbolize that everything is at stake.<br/><br/>Hallows: Part 2 is not without its faults and they mirror what was wrong with Part 1: humor. The humor is out of place in the former and it continues with the latter. It rears its ugly head in the midst of battle with a character that plays a major role that decides the fates of everyone. It just doesn't feel right when the rest of the film isn't light-hearted. Rupert Grint, as Ron Weasley, even has a bit of a comedy moment during a scene that ends up being tense; it would have worked better without it. Another fault, as I mentioned in the second paragraph, lies in the rushed nature of the beginning, where not enough is offered to remind audiences about what happened during the end of Part 1. We see snippets of Voldemort getting his hands on the wand and Dobby being dead, but we should have seen one more thing to set up an action piece that followed.<br/><br/>The Harry Potter franchise is now complete, seeing ups and downs throughout the 10 year film period. It's the most consistent movie franchises in terms of quality and may never be matched for a long while. J.K. Rowling's story has been given the motion picture treatment and there's not much else left of her vision. Now that it's over, fans will most likely revisit the films as they still do with the books they're based on, long after they ended."

","In the long-awaited series finale, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 (2011), Harry Potter, played by Daniel Radcliffe, returns for the final battle of good versus evil. Also returning from Part 1 are the director, David Yates, and the screenwriter, Steve Kloves, for the completion of the Deathly Hallows, continuing where the story left off .With Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) obtaining the Elder Wand it would seem that he is more powerful than we have yet seen him. And, the race is on as Hermoine Granger (Emma Watson) and Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint), continue to search with Harry for each horcrux to destroy; in order to weaken and hopefully defeat Voldemort. The expertise, of these experienced film developers and in the actors who have completely absorbed their characters, surely shows in the enjoyment of the viewer. I can't imagine anyone not appreciating the value, of the entertainment, offered by this film.<br/><br/>In keeping with the overall dark tone of the movie the color palette is limited. In the scenery dull days and darkness persist throughout the movie leading up to the final battle. Sepia tones exist in the telling of the age of buildings that we are to believe have stood for hundreds of years. Even in an opening scene, as the characters stand on a sunny beach, the tone is dark as the actors are shown large and in the forefront and in very dark clothing; they are overshadowing the brighter lit beach and water. The CGI graphics are blended seamlessly in the same color palette giving little away as to where they begin and end. <br/><br/>Another important aspect, of the movie, that lends itself well to the tone and theme is in the sound effects and dialogue. The original score, as always, is impressive and assists the theme in every scene. Even in the quietest moments where there is very little background sound, like where you are to hear the dark Lord, Voldemort, as he clearly enunciates commands, the impact is one in tune with the dark theme of the movie. Another clearly effective portion, of sound, is in a battle scene where the sound is dulled and not everything that is going on in the background can be heard; one can imagine this is how a person in a raging battle would hear; from deafened tones.<br/><br/>There are a lot of movie series that offer examples of good versus evil; like The Lord of the Rings Trilogy, The Star Wars Trilogy, and the Twilight series. This one, however, is made even more special by the span of time that it has impacted even younger generations and in the long run, several generations. Along with this being a well-loved series, the theme of good ""magic"" versus evil ""magic"" makes the journey more intriguing and fun. I have to say that I feel quite fortunate to have followed all of the books and the movies and the finale did not disappoint me. I believe that my viewing had an even greater impact on me for seeing this film in the IMAX 3D. I even attended it twice and have since purchases the DVD for my collection."
"bob the moo","Null","0","1","7 December 2011"," Intense sequences ensure it goes out on a high even if I ""felt"" less than in some of the other recent Potters (one very mild spoiler)
","I'm not a particularly big fan of this franchise if I'm honest, so for me when the final films came out I was more than happy to let the crowds come and go and I'd watch it at my leisure. It's not that I was apathetic but I've never bothered with the books beyond reading a few chapters of one to a child many moons ago and the film series took quite some time to really engage me. It did this as it got darker and, although the last film felt like it was stuck in a holding pattern, I did still enjoy it because it was very dark throughout. With this final film I had hoping that this brooding would continue but, being unfamiliar with the books, unlike many viewers I wasn't sure what was going to happen (despite Simon Mayo and Mark Kermode's consistent best efforts to give me spoilers).<br/><br/>Understandably the brooding aspect of the last few films doesn't really make it far into this one because, although it keeps its dark tone and scary, the film is really all about the epic confrontation that the previous film had been leading up to. And it is pretty epic – the effects are tremendous and it really did engage me. This surprised me because previously a lot of the magic-driven action hadn't really done much for me and, although all the lights and effects had been pretty, they had sort of kept what was happening in a fantasy realm in regards my feelings. Here though the action had real impact and a real sense of violence to it and as sheer spectacle, it did work.<br/><br/>In terms of the plotting and feeling, I have to say that the sheer scale of the set pieces really made me struggle to find something to feel about in the story. I was quite excited by the final battle but I didn't really feel invested it in, it was only occasionally intimate enough to make me care. As a result the ""nineteen years later"" conclusion didn't do anything for me other than make me wonder if they couldn't have at least spared some of their special effects budget to convincingly age the three stars. I'm pretty sure that fans and particularly those fans that grew up with the franchise will be much more impacted by the conclusion and this flash-forward, but for me the film almost did the epic spectacle too well, because it hadn't left me too much room for emotional focus on the three children at the heart of the tale (and, ignoring their multimillion nest-eggs, these characters are children in terms of age).<br/><br/>Their performances are not to blame because Radcliffe, Watson and Grint have all grown into fine actors and kudos to whoever manage to see that potential all those years ago. They (and their children) may never need to work again but they do good work here and it was their performances that stopped me totally losing sight of their characters in the middle of the special effects. Of course the quality of the rest of the cast (featuring every living British actor) is deep and even though none have much to work with they are good – credit to Fiennes that he manages to be a presence despite this really not being a project that ever interested him or engaged him as much as it did others involved.<br/><br/>This final film is a fine spectacle though and it brings about a suitably intense finale to this (mostly) dark series. In my opinion the characters get a little bit lost in this specific film but it is understandable and those that already have lived formative years at the same pace as Harry et al, will not need this film to do anything to keep them involved – and given this is film 8, there probably aren't too many ""casual"" viewers left."

","Holding this DVD shifted from USA after 5 months of the releasing date, there's no words that can express my feeling. There was a huge mistake that WB didn't show this last part in our country, therefore I have to wait for a very long time.<br/><br/>Harry Potter brings many of my childhood memories back. My age is nearly the same with those characters, so it's really close to me. I still remember the time when I was small, often went to the CD store nearby to ask for the latest Harry Potter series, even at that time DVD was still strange in Hanoi, and all we could find was VCD. And then dreamed, of the world that I have never known, of a place where magic would always exist, a place that you can do anything, with true friends... A place of love. Yes, it is Harry Potter, it's not only a movie, but also a part of my childhood dream, where I can't go back but will always be remember. Yes, it will follow us, till the rest of our lives."

","I didn't read the book, but according to this movie it must have been a masterpiece (like all others). The movie itself was much darker than past sequels, even much darker than Part 1 which was great also. I just can not believe that young trio from the Sorcerses Stone could grow up so effective and seamlessly, that's why J.K. Rowling is so good; she can make you nostalgic and proud of her characters and they did exactly the same thing in the movie. <br/><br/>Music was darker, more epic and adapted very well on the movie. My best scene was when Harry banish Snape from Hogwarts and prepare for attack.....such a great piece of cinematography, music, atmosphere..great job. <br/><br/>Actually the whole movie was very well directed and written, but because of gigantic book they could't put it all in the movie. At the moments it seems that the movie is a mess because of that. I gave it 8/10 because of that and the fact the movie overall wasn't a perfect. We have dub acting sometimes, plot holes to anyone without previous knowledge of the book and the script could be written much better. <br/><br/>This movie is great and I recommended it to any fans of Harry Potter, sci-fi fans, and all children in the world."
"mvedprakasha","8","0","1","30 November 2011"," The Conceptual Review
","The movie depicts the death of the ego of the person and hence I believe the name is made as deathly hallows. It answers all the questions of the author put forth in the beginning of story of HP. It describes that the ego is of 7 categories(Crux). Out of them few of the Crux is present in a student which has to be destroyed by the Teacher(Dumbledore). Few destroyed by friends(Destroyed by Ron).And the rest has to be killed by the enemies(Voldemort). The strength of the confidence has to be taken by the aid of the Knowledge of the Teacher by either conversation or the gathering of the good will to prepare ourself to destroy the evil may be either external or internal. Story also depicts that when the evil in oneself raises to such an extent that it can cause the death of him, then its always power of knowledge which embodies to survive him(HP surviving after the deathly blow). I think the direction has brought the immense truth of the feelings of the message that is needed to be conveyed by the story writer. The existence of life of ego(Voldemort) within HP, is made felt of the presence by the scar on his forehead. The scar could have been on any other part, but still its on the forehead indicating that ego raises as he develops,grows. At the point in life hp reaches a stage where he needs to tackle his enemy Voldemort(ego) where the ego itself kills its mere existence in the Harry, then the Knowledge of DumbleDore flows through him for the perish of voldemort, to attain the state of Bliss.<br/><br/>Knowledge Possesses the overwhelming victory over Ego."

","According to an objective evaluation of the film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2(2011),was a success. The director, David Yates, effectively reached the film's level of ambition by giving a sense of closure to the end of the Harry Potter series. The film embodies the theme of conclusion and growth as the director shows Harry Potter and his friend's journey as they destroy all the Horcruxes, kill Lord Voldemort, and grow up into adults. <br/><br/>The strongest contribution to the theme was the scenes with character development. When the director shows Snape's child hood memories, the audience was finally able to understand Snape's motivation. The director also shows how Harry Potter changes by his journey because at the end, he names his child after Severus Snape. Other characters also grow, Neville Longbottom takes the roll of a leader with his speech in the end when facing Voldemort. In the battle ground of Hogwarts, David Yates incorporates a long, passionate kiss between Hermione Granger and Ron Weasley. Each of these scenes marks an end to the Harry Potter story. <br/><br/>One of the weakest elements of the film was the lack of explanation of the Horcruxes. To a viewer who had not read the Harry Potter books, it would be difficult to understand the back story of Helga Hufflepuff's cup because in the film, the director just shows the Gray Lady upset, leaving the viewers to make their own interpretations. At times, for someone who is not a Harry Potter fan, it would be confusing for a viewer to understand the complex plot at the end of the story. <br/><br/>But at times, David Yates bridges this gap for by simplifying the concepts to make it clear. For instance, he makes a connection between destroying the Horcruxes and Voldemort weakening by parallel editing. In this simple way he explains an aspect of the story without causing confusion. Overall, the film was a brilliant end to the series. The actors played their roles well and the special effects strengthened the Harry Potter diegesis. The film, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2, was able to reach its level of ambition."

","In the scene, where Voldemort blasts Harry with his wand, and Malfoy's mom goes up to see if he's dead, why did she say, ""Draco, is he alive?"" I was confused by this. And why is she deciding now to help Harry Potter? Also, why did they run away from Voldemort at the end? Wouldn't they be thinking that if Voldemort did eventually kill Harry, he would just kill them and find them all? In the beginning of the Harry Potter series, Malfoy's dad was so loyal to Voldemort, then toward the end started to look scared and less sure of his loyalty toward Voldemort. I know this is not a review, but I really am wanting to know the answer to this question."

","Although many people found this movie as their favorite,I was really disappointed in it. I thought unlike the other Harry Potter movies (which were all amazing) I found this one lacking. They cut a lot from the book, and several things were mentioned that unless you read the book you wouldn't understand. Also in the death scenes you have no time to react because the movie already moved on, it felt rushed. Like when Fred, Ron's brother, died Ron cried for a couple minutes then he was fine! Ginny didn't even look like she cared! They also cut out the story of Arianna Dumbledore which was important. I also don't understand David Yates obsession with people crumbling away! Why didn't Bellatrix and Voldemort fall over dead like normal people? Instead they crumbled away or blew up into bits. In my opinion it is the 6th best of 8 the films."

I had to beg my parents to watch Part 2 as the release date was near my examinations. The money was well-spent. I loved the music, scenes and emotions displayed by the characters.

","Even if you never cared much about the ""Harry Potter"" movies this one is worth seeing/buying. A+ hit...out of the park! I was skeptical of these so-called children's books being produced for the big screen, at first. But after my nieces & nephews talked me into making the 90min. round trip to our local theater a few times, all of the sudden I was hooked. Nothing like LOTR's, but never was intended to be. This last chapter in the ""HP"" series has got to be the biggest surprise to me of all. I expected a freeze dried ending with a little icing on top (after DH1). Could not have been further from the truth. Great ending & some nice twists and turns between. A movie in my opinion well worth owning on it's own merits.If you watch ""DH1&2"" back to back...this gives the viewer a better idea of what I think the screen writers are trying to convey and absolutely gives the movie more of an even flow from beginning to end. Sounds excellent... I have a Bose 5:1 surround system and for visuals a Samsung LN46A650 and the visual are also A+ for this very well done blu-ray. It really is a keeper. Oh almost forgot the extras...you will need plenty of time examine them all. The DVD is also a nice touch.

","Before I begin this review, I'd like to state that I am a big fan of the Harry Potter books and movies. I feel that the books are interesting and can be just as much for adults as they can be for kids. The movies do a good job capturing the essence of the book and are all very strong adaptations, yet still remain fresh and new.<br/><br/>With that said, let's get this review going. By the time the movie starts and I see the Warner Bros. sign coming towards me, with excellent musical accompaniment by Alexander Dumas, I am already invested. And, as the movie continues, it gets better and better.<br/><br/>The story, for those who read the book, was already revealed in 2007, but I must admit that it is cool to see it fully realized on the big screen. The filmmakers do an excellent job of capturing Rowling's riveting storytelling. Are events and details left out? Of course. But, for the most part, this movie does a good job at being faithful to its source material.<br/><br/>The cast is at their best here. The three main child actors do exceptional jobs, and admittedly, this is the first time I actually feel for them. They've come a long way from being the sweet children from the first movie and have now evolved into well-developed characters that we love. The supporting cast, however, does a great job, as well. Each and every actor/actress gives so much weight to his/her character that it's absolute perfection. Particular acclaim goes to Alan Rickman as Severus Snape. The character has evolved extraordinarily from the cold, calculating potions teacher to the sympathetic, three dimensional character that we bother to concern ourselves with. Rickman should definitely win something for his performance...maybe even an Oscar?<br/><br/>The visuals are splendid and heart wrenching. I kept seeing the destruction of Hogwarts on commercials but when I finally saw it on film, I couldn't hold back the tears. Seeing some of these beloved characters go through so much destruction and pain is almost too much, and yet, at the same time, pretty entertaining. The cinematography is beautiful, with much care and detail put into it, much like the previous Potter movies.<br/><br/>Final verdict: this is hands down the best film in the Harry Potter saga. It proves that wanna- be sagas like Twilight don't win the audience over through rushed romances and undeveloped characters, but with a compelling story and care put into every single detail. I will miss these movies and, if you're a fan of the franchise or not, go check it out. There's something for everyone."

The Battle of Hogwarts is the most exciting thing in the movie. The special effects are amazing and was directed very well. David Yates was the perfect director for the last films.

","Finally, a long-anticipated final chapter of the Harry Porter series and yes, it's good. An epic ending.<br/><br/>Harry Porter 7, Part 2 is kind of an adventurous ride, started with daring venture, then came the series of startling discoveries, and end with an epic fight. It's intriguing, tense, full of emotions, and it's fun. Unlike other blockbuster, high budget movies where a large sum of money is spent on stunning visuals but not on the character development or storyline, Harry Porter 7 excels in both – spectacular views with outstanding plot. It's an understatement if one says the movie's success is all due to the fame of J. K. Rowlings' novel. No it's not. In fact, they did a bit of modification to the original story, and it turns out even better than the original story, in my opinion. And don't forget to mention the pacing, the music, the settings, everything in the movie is brilliant. It really gives you the feelings of a dark, frightful atmosphere<br/><br/>The whole casts are good, and Alan Rickman's performance of Snape is excellent. Besides acting, voice of characters are superb, from the mumbling of Snape to the shady intimidating sound of You-Know-Who. And my quirky lovely Helena Bonham Carter, i adores her in her role of Bellatrix. Personal favor, though.<br/><br/>The only setback is you need to go back either Part 1 or to the book, to fully appreciate Part 2. Personally, this Part 2 makes me want to go watch the whole series from the beginnings. It's well worth it.<br/><br/>For more reviews, please visit: http://voicemotion.wordpress.com/"

Rather than being honoured for these so called 'books', J.K Rowling should be sent to the tower of London and forced to think about what she has done. Dumbledore is lucky enough to have died and not suffered the rest of the films. I feel sympathy for him to have lived through the first few film/books.

","It's not possible to review Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 (to be known going forward as Part 2) without touching on the movies that came before it in the series. It's been 10 years since Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, the first movie in the epic, was released. In those 10 years, we've watched Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson, Rupert Grint, Matthew Lewis and Tom Felton, grow from children into young adults. After his unfortunate passing the late Richard Harris, who played Professor Dumbledore in the first two films, was replaced by Michael Gambon, who stepped in and built upon the wonderful work done by his predecessor. Alan Rickman, previously most notable for portraying Hans Gruber in Die Hard, gives his most endearing performance as Professor Severus Snape; and Matthew Lewis' does a fantastic job of giving a top-notch portrayal of a mature and no longer reserved Neville Longbottom. Over the years we were amazed while watching characters we'd read about be brought to life on the big screen; we allowed ourselves to develop relationships with the characters as they themselves developed relationships; we cried, as character we grew to care about sacrificed themselves to help protect our young hero to be; we laughed as the Dursleys got their comeuppance for their terrible mistreating of Harry; and we watched anxiously, awaiting the inevitable showdown with Voldemort. Very much in the same way that thanks to Star Wars, Mark Hamil will always be known as Luke Skywalker, Carrie Fisher will always be known as Princess Leia, and Harrison Ford will always be known as Hans Solo; Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint will always be known as Harry, Hermione and Ron.<br/><br/>Part 2 picks up immediately where the previous movie ended; bringing with it the darkness and desolation that was pertinent throughout. However, it doesn't take long for the things to pick up and once it does, it never looks back. The action is intense and relentless, bringing forth a mass of devastation and destruction. As we build towards the end, the explanations provided for prior events are understandable and acceptable. There are some fateful characters loss, and unfortunately most are done off-screen. Of course, when you're dealing with a book that is close to 800 pages some sacrifices need to be made in order to keep the length of the movie under control. Unlike the first 7 movies in the series, this one was all about Harry; as it should have been. Having spent years preparing physically and mentally for his eventual battle with Voldemort, Harry appears ready to deal with the task at hand; and willingly accepts and meets his fate head on in a fitting final encounter.<br/><br/>Part 2 brings to a close the most successful franchise in film history. David Yates, director of the final four movies in the series, does a fine job of including as much detail from the book as possible and ensuring a majority of its readers a necessary happiness. Part 2 takes its viewers on an emotional roller coaster, but that's all part of the journey we signed up for. Writer J.K. Rowling could have continued the adventures of Harry and his friends as young adults, and even into their later years. Having said that, I can't complain about the whirlwind ride I was lucky enough to have experienced. I wasn't a Potter fan when the books first came out. I didn't give the first book a try until a few months before Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire came out, thanks to a suggestion made by a very good friend of mine. After reading the first book, I was hooked. The appreciation I have after reading the books and watching the movies was one I never expected to have. Something that started out as a fun little adventure ended up being so very much more than that for me and millions of others around the world. I look forward to the day when my children will want to read the books, and watch the movies for more than just entertainment allowing them to grow an appreciation on their own.<br/><br/>Grade: A+<br/><br/>visit our site at www.twodudereview.com"

When I did see the finale (The Matrix Revolutions), I was really let down by it...all the sequels seemed unwarranted in retrospect. Happy to say the final Harry Potter movie delivers a great story.<br/><br/>Another analogy is also brought to mind...""Quantum of solace"" (the direct sequel to ""Casino Royale""). In the case of the rebooted Bond franchise, the sequel (QoS) was asking too much of viewers if they had not seen the first movie in a timeframe where they wouldn't have forgotten half of the story. At the time QoS looked a badly edited and incoherent mess. It is a much better picture though when the first movie is fresh in your mind.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's what's so great about this Harry Potter final instalment...even though I had not reacquainted myself with the Potter movies before seeing it, the movie was there to remind me of the story or provide strong hints at worst. It didn't feel like I was disorientated with the story...the movie was there to help me. It should be noted too that I have never read any of the books the movies are based on, and with the finale, it just nicely wraps up the movie version of the story, without making you feel like you need to be a complete Harry Potter geek to enjoy (a ""geek"" as in having read all the books numerous times and having seen all the preceding movies...numerous times).<br/><br/>Like I said, the first instalment of the finale felt like it was treading water. With final instalment, it is all action and forward momentum. It even strikes me as being the kind of movie that has repeat viewing value on its own (as in not requiring seeing the earlier films at all to enjoy...or perhaps just in case you are already familiar with the movies).<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 has made watching the series from the beginning ""worth it"". I can't remember what the other Potter movie I particularly enjoyed was called (the one with an element of time travel to it), but as much as I liked that (quite a bit), I'd say that the finale is in a league of its own, as far candidates for the best entry in the series goes (like the first Narnia movie). It's a great movie, full stop.<br/><br/>Hmm...I wonder how far the Potter/Narnia/religious parallels go..."

","Well, I never anticipated I would see the light of day when I would walk into the theater going to view the last and FINAL Harry Potter flick, and wouldn't you know it, I was stunned! This movie is not just the best HP film of them all, but is breathtaking, jaw-dropping, dazzling, shocking, and amazing movie-making at it's FINEST! Right from the very beginning, you are sucked into the end of it all, where the Wizarding World has now been corrupted by the evil and insanely dark Lord Voldemort and his posy of Death Eaters, and Harry, Hermione, and Ron must search for the remaining Horcruxes in order to once and for all defeat him for GOOD!!! It's prolonged action sequences, with spectacular special effects are the brim-hold of this film, and the emotional scenes are enough to make anyone cry their eyes out for a decade long for seeing these wonderful characters grow into fine actors. Daniel Radcliffe really gives it his all in the last moments of the film, and Alan Rickman's performance will show his sensitive side that WILL make people loose it. It is a Definitely well-crafted film monumental masterpiece, with Oscarworthy performances from the whole cast, Deep and Tragic scores from Alexandre Desplat that sound unlike any movie score I ever heard of, and matching that of John Williams(which his music ""Hedwig's theme"" makes an appearance in this one), and an Epic battle sequence that COMPLETELY butchers the last battle scene in ReturnOfTheKing into dust, there is nothing to stop this PERFECTLY SPECTACULAR MASTERPIECE from receiving ""the"" Oscar WIN for BEST PICTURE!!! I was in complete tears by the time it wrapped up, that I didn't know how to control myself. I was speechless! I will Definitely miss this series way too much :( :( :( Fans AND Movie-goers alike will absolutely LOVE this Epically Masterful conclusion to the BEST SERIES IN THE WORLD!!! 1,000,000,000/10 stars!!! GO WATCH IT NOW!!! YOU WONT REGRET IT =)"
"jboothmillard","8","0","2","1 August 2011"," Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","This was the finale in the highly popular film series, based on the equally popular series of books by J.K. Rowling, and when I saw that it was rated the full five out of five stars, and available in 3D, there was no way I would miss it. Basically the story continues from where Part 1 left off, after Dobby the house elf was killed, and Lord Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) found the powerful Elder Wand in the grave of Professor Albus Dumbledore (Sir Michael Gambon). Friends Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are still searching for the hidden Horcruxes, the secret to Voldermort's immortality, and with the help of goblin Griphook (Warwick Davis) they break into the vault of Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter) to find one. After escaping the goblin bank with the help of a white dragon, we see the Dark Lord and the other villains have taken over Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, and Professor Severus Snape (Alan Rickman) has become the new headmaster. After meeting Dumbledore's brother Aberforth (Ciarán Hinds) the friends are taken by Neville Longbottom (Matthew Lewis) through a secret passageway to Hogwarts, and they are reunited with old friends in hiding. Snape is informed of Harry's return, but he is confronted, leaving way for Professor Minerva McGonagall (Dame Maggie Smith) to start the revolution with many of the remaining teachers against the dark forces. Harry meanwhile is told by Luna Lovegood (Evanna Lynch) to go and see the ghost for Helena Ravenclaw (Kelly Macdonald) to find one of the last Horcruxes, and finds out it is hidden in the Room of Requirement. Ron and Hermoine meanwhile destroy the Horcrux from Lestrange's vault with the fang of the Basilisk skeleton in the Chamber of Secrets, and they also share their first kiss. While the teachers and some students fight against the dark forces, Harry goes to the Room of Requirement and finds the hidden Horcrux, and although confronted and nearly killed by old enemy Draco Malfoy (Tom Felton), the three friends save his life. After destroying this Horcrux and weakening Voldermort more, Harry looks into the Dark Lord's mind and sees that the final Horcrux is the snake Nagini, and they witness him kill Snape with the Elder Wand. Before dying however Snape gave Harry some tears, and in the Pensieve these are used to look into the past, where he sees Snape was not only in love with his mother Lily Potter (Geraldine Somerville), but that he was also there on the night when she and James Potter (Adrian Rawlins). But the bigger twist than that is that the reason Voldermort did not kill him on that night was because he is the final Horcrux he unintentionally created, so according to Dumbledore he is destined to die. Harry decides to follow this path by going into the Forbidden Forest and confronting the Dark Lord himself, allowing him to cast the Killing Curse, therefore sending him to a white limbo, where he is given wise words by Dumbledore that Voldermort has in fact killed the dark part within him. After Harry returns to his body we see Voldermort overjoyed that he has ""killed"" him, and asking all to obey him now, however Harry springs to life and runs away, while everyone else fights. While the duelling between the hero and villain goes on, Neville decapitates the snake Nagini with the Sword of Godric Gryffindor, therefore all the Horcruxes are destroyed, leaving Voldermort mortal, and he combusts into ash and is blown away. The final scenes see Harry reject the powers of the Elder Wand despite being the rightful owner, and sixteen years later we see older Ron and Hermoine, and Harry and Ginny Weasley (Bonnie Wright) on Platform 9 3/4 saying goodbye to their own children as they head for Hogwarts for their first term. Also starring John Hurt as Ollivander, Domhnall Gleeson as Bill Weasley, Robbie Coltrane as Rubeus Hagrid, Jason Isaacs as Lucius Malfoy, Warwick Davis as Professor Filius Flitwick, Helen McCrory as Narcissa Malfoy, Julie Walters as Molly Weasley, Katie Leung as Cho Chang, Jim Broadbent as Professor Horace Slughorn, Miriam Margolyes as Professor Pomona Sprout, Gemma Jones as Madam Pomfrey, David Thewlis as Remus Lupin, Mark Williams as Arthur Weasley, David Bradley as Argus Filch, Nick Moran as Scabior, Emma Thompson as Professor Sybil Trelawney, Devon Murray as Seamus Finnigan, James Phelps as Fred Weasley, Oliver Phelps as George Weasley, Chris Rankin as Percy Weasley, Leslie Phillips as The Sorting Hat and Gary Oldman as Sirius Black. It is going to feel odd for a year or two not to expect another Harry Potter film, all the actors are of course fantastic in their roles, many parts of the story, especially the one or two big twists work really well, and the amazing special effects serve the final film fantastically, a highly watchable fantasy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Art Direction, Best Makeup and Best Visual Effects, and it won the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects, and it was nominated for Best Make Up & Hair, Best Production Design and Best Sound, and it won the BAFTA Children's Award for Best Feature Film. Harry Potter was number 45 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, but he was also number 35 on The 100 Worst Britons (the only fictional person, why?). Very good!"
"nukfan","Null","0","1","27 July 2011"," The best of all the films
","Right off the bat, I'll tell you that if you haven't at least seen Half-Blood Prince, and Deathly Hallows Part 1, you will be lost without all hope for the whole film AND this review. Don't kid yourself.<br/><br/>The movie starts exactly where Part 1 left off. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have buried the late Dobby, and Voldemort has obtained the Elder Wand from the cold, dead hands of Dumbledore. The three heroes then devise a plan with the aid of Griphook the goblin to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault in Gringotts to find one of Voldemort's horcruxes. They get in quite easily, but have a bit of a problem with leaving.<br/><br/>I won't reveal anything else. If you could only call one of the 8 Potter films an ""action"" film, this would be the one. After the first third of the movie or so, it's essentially hell at Hogwarts. The place is torn apart by spells, important characters are killed off, and the pace rarely lets up. This is what everyone (including me) should have expected of the final entry. It ties together all loose ends, everyone's true character is revealed, and the climax is spectacular.<br/><br/>Any acting problems that there may have been at any point in the film series are extinguished. Everyone that has a part is perfect. Daniel Radcliffe shows more emotion than before while playing the series' hero. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson as Ron and Hermione show the characters' affection for each other seamlessly, as their characters have gone from a bickering duo, to a convincing couple. Ralph Fiennes again proves that he was the perfect choice for Voldemort, a purely evil character with absolutely no redeeming qualities... then polar opposite to Harry Potter. But, in my opinion, Matthew Lewis' portrayal of Neville Longbottom might just stand out above all others. His character finally gets his true moment in the sun, becoming a great hero, and it is clear that Lewis has matured with the character.<br/><br/>The plot, while as a movie standing on it's own is perhaps unspectacular, answers all questions that any non-readers may have been asking, and, like I said earlier, it's what was expected. And the epilogue is very satisfying, don't you worry.<br/><br/>Combine this film with Part 1, and you may have a film that is the most loyal to the book of all the films, so die-hard fans shouldn't have any serious complaints. I know I didn't.<br/><br/>So, does the movie deserve Oscar recognition? In the case of acting, I think that Daniel Radcliffe has earned at least a nomination. He makes you truly feel for the character, especially near the end. Unfortunately, nominating anyone else would shadow someone else's performance, and that wouldn't be fair. Radcliffe stands out. And I haven't seen Captain America yet, but I think that this film should definitely win Best Special Effects; everything is blended together so well. The spells, the castle, the dragon from Gringotts, Voldemorts face (it is not makeup, as many people know)... you don't even notice that it's all computer generated. And should it win Best Picture...? If it's even nominated, I doubt that it will win, but I suppose that stranger things have happened... just be sure to keep your eye on the Oscars next year...<br/><br/>My one complaint? The 3-D. Totally unnecessary, and actually a bit distracting at times. And I usually like 3-D...<br/><br/>Still, 10/10"

","I saw all Harry Potter movies and read also all books. I totally and completely understand that it is not possible to put a 800+ pages book to 240 minutes movie. I know that this is Deathly Hallows Part 2 but it is one story. I'm 26 and when I read book (3 years ago) I was almost crying at the end. I saw a movie and I felt nothing...<br/><br/>--- SPOILER WARNING --- <br/><br/>Really don't understand why they put away the most of dramatic scenes from the book. It took away all the emotions and it was common action movie but there were no guns but magic. Why there wasn't scene when the Rons brother died? Why there was so little of DA fighting and showing how they are dying one by one? Why next scene when Harry died was how he is on a train station and how he is alive again? First I was thinking it was for the children so they will be not so scary and sad. But there was so much blood... it was not for children and was not for adults eater... Compare to the books endings... this one is the worst. Hope they will be a director's cut version with all missing scenes.<br/><br/>9 starts for 1st half of this part. The rest of the movie is big disappointment."

I have read all the books and the only as well. But a lot of the people complaining on this site is about because of the enormous expectations because of the book. I loved the bit with Molly Weasly and Bellatrix! they kept that well which I was so glad to see because that was one of the reasons I watched it. The ending I was glad they didn't put out to much because I didn't really like the whole corny e ding bit but the only thing I was disappointed with in this entire movie was that you weren't told about Lupins son. but besides that it is a defiantly see as possible movie."
"Afflock","Null","0","1","24 July 2011"," Good Film. Not true to the source material
","There are a lot of comments describing how the film deviated from the book.<br/><br/>As a movie it was good in its own right. Solid special affects, very good acting, and it did tie up some sub-plot lines, though not in the order they were revealed in the book or with enough back story to give the sense of grandeur.<br/><br/>Fans of the books may be disappointed by the last movie in the franchise. After reading many comments then seeing the movie, those critical of the movie vs the book have a valid argument of important details being skipped or casually mentioned. <br/><br/>It has potential to be a truly epic film. It fell short by limiting some key plot mechanics, such as the Deathly Hollows, and how Harry and Dumbledore were connected beyond just being at Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Certainly a movie worth seeing on the big screen. It is more for those who followed the movies and not the books. This condition is not unique to Harry Potter, but to any movie adaptation of a good book.<br/><br/>If you liked the movies and not read the books, it is worth the time to get the books. The movie franchise was successful for a reason."

Emotions were at their highest rate, tears rolled down my face. I was happy and sad at the same time.<br/><br/>But ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" is the best movie out of this series to have ever been made.

","As a huge fan of the books, I was sad and excited to see the final movie in the series. Throughout most of the film I was quite pleased that the story was either well-represented or deviated in ways that helped to move the film along. The final scene with Snape in particular was extremely well-done. <br/><br/>But I left with a bad taste in my mouth because two of the best scenes (the last two) were cut short in disappointing ways. The growth of Harry from the beginning to the end of the series is one of the great themes, and the book brilliantly displays that in the final two scenes. In the movie though, the dialogue that best captures his growth is almost entirely eliminated, leaving holes that to me were unacceptable."
"adnanaltaf","9","0","1","23 July 2011"," A mesmerizing and spell binding conclusion to the greatest phenomenon of this decade.
","A phenomenon which started 14 years ago ends with the last chapter in the Harry Potter Saga. The movie series, unlike the books, had its share of ups and downs. As a die hard Potterhead, I've always preferred the first two movies which remain the most faithful to the books. I really hated how this series had to face a change of directors in the middle, disrupting a continuous flow from the first two, but even though the third and the fourth ones had their differences from the book, yet they remained entertaining and magical.<br/><br/>It wasn't until David Yates came that in my opinion that the series went downhill. With Yates helming the fifth and the sixth one, the Harry Potter movie saga was at its worst. Not only were those two dull and bland, Yates completely missed the essence of the books which the other directors were able to hold on to.<br/><br/>When I came to know that David Yates was chosen for the finale, my worst fear had come true. I dreaded how Yates was going to butcher the finale of a great series which deserved a perfect send off. With the release of Deathly Hallows - Part 1, I was both concerned and relieved. Part 1 had its share of great moments but just like the previous two installments, something was missing, something magical which the first four in the series had. So from then onwards it was time to await for the finale and wonder if Part 2 would be what us fans expected it to be.<br/><br/>Today, after watching Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 for the second time I can only say this, Harry Potter fans could not have asked for a better end to the series that has shaped their childhood for more than a decade.<br/><br/>Everything about the movie was perfect. From the acting, which was the greatest amongst all the eight movies, especially from Daniel Radcliffe who had the whole movie on his shoulder to carry on and carries it off, he does brilliantly, from Ralph Fiennes who portrays a great villain with perfect menace and from Alan Rickman as Snape who gives us the highlight sequence of the series with such sincerity and grace that would make even a casual fan feel for him. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson though this time had to be sidelined a bit but still play their part beautifully with Emma showing why she's one of the brilliant actresses out there and Rupert who this time around brings out a more truer Ron than he had in the previous few installments. Not to mention the other actors like Maggie Smith who this time was given a deserving screen time and a role to play, Matthew Lewis who gives a terrific performance as the unsung Hero of Hogwarts and all the rest. If there was one thing Harry Potter got absolutely correct then that was the casting. Kudos to the filmmakers to achieve such a success with this! The direction this time around was outstanding. Always considered David Yates to be the worst thing that happened to Hogwarts but he has proved me wrong with a finale that puts him up there with the elite ones. Even though he butchered two installments but he created an outstanding finale which is his redemption.<br/><br/>The music is one of the reasons why the movie works so well. Alexandre Desplat may have given a better than average music for Part 1 but with Part 2 he shows why he is an Oscar nominated composer. His battle tracks especially the Statues and Courtyard Apocalypse were brilliant and his Lilly and Severus along with the Resurrection Stone track hits all the right notes. Though his biggest contribution is the use of John William's Leaving Hogwarts for the epilogue which is the greatest service he could have given to the fans and works as a powerful tool to bring out a decade long emotion in the end.<br/><br/>The visual effects as usual with the HP series were brilliant. The Battle of Hogwarts was breath taking, with beautiful cinematography. This movie had the right amount of violence and action keeping the battle intriguing and intense.<br/><br/>A mesmerizing and spell binding conclusion to the greatest phenomenon of this decade. David Yates, by crafting a magical finale, you have truly demonstrated why Harry Potter is and will always be.... The Boy Who Lived...!!!"

","Loved the start of HP7II, but should have paid closer attention (or read the books) to truly appreciate the middle bit. Loved Maggie Smith stepping through the crowd to battle evil. Flanked by an all-star team of UK performers, most all of whom have at least one moment in a sea of appearances. The finale doesn't disappoint either. Didn't much care for the obligatory epilogue, but as it is from the book, Potterfiles would decry its exclusion. Shame that greed and length had to portion this film out in parts, as taken together they are remarkable; broken in two, slightly diminished in impact. Rather like taking a year long intermission at a wonderful play."
"Ryan_MYeah","9","0","2","22 July 2011"," As an overall product, it's glorious. As a finale to a great series, what more can be asked for?
","After months of waiting patiently, I have finally seen the second half of the final installment of the Harry Potter film franchise, The Deathly Hallows.<br/><br/>In the film, Harry, Ron, and Hermionie are still on their search and destroy mission for the final four horcruxes, items in which the deadly Lord Voldemort has laced with fragments of his soul. Only problem is, Voldemort is now fully aware of their mission, and intends to stop them at any cost. Soon, the three are back at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, but the overwhelming influence of the Death Eaters has now left it totally bleak. As the dark armies prepare to strike Hogwarts down, Harry comes closer to his final showdown with Voldemort, a battle that will determine the fate of the wizarding world.<br/><br/>Splitting the last book of the series by J.K Rowling in half was found to be a divisive decision. Most thought that it was a wise choice, so that it would give the characters more development, while others saw it as a greedy chance to milk the cash cow. After seeing Part 2, my verdict is this: Totally. Justified. Decision.<br/><br/>This is easily one of the best entries in the Harry Potter film series. It establishes a very grim tone, but finds an even blend of action sequences, and the occasional humorous sprinkles. The movie takes a little time to get into, but as a result, the final hour of the movie had me tuning everything else out. The climax of the film is a huge rush of adrenaline, and the film's ending is a delightful return to the light spirit of the first film that has me itching to watch the series all over again, even as I speak.<br/><br/>Also, the film's cast and characters must not have been easy to keep properly developed. Not much of the adult cast are over utilized, but they serve the purpose that they're given. Daniel Radcliffe is at his best, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson perform admirably, Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman stand out amongst the cast (And one scene involving Rickman is a serious tearjerker), while new entries to the cast, Kelly MacDonald and Ciaran Hinds, make effective use of their small roles.<br/><br/>And to the many technical crew involved with the film, I tip my hat to you. The visual effects, cinematography, and makeup are most impressive. The sound design is exceptional. The excitement of watching the movie in IMAX 3D is gripping. Alexandre Desplat writes the only score of the series that is successfully able to duplicate the same thrilling, and whimsical sound John Williams brought to the earlier films. But most to thank is Stuart Craig, whose years of service as production designer, coupled with the fact that this feature might very well be his crowning achievement of the series, leads to me to say that the man, plain and simple, deserves this year's Oscar for Best Art-Direction. Case Closed.<br/><br/>But like many Harry Potter fans, I stand thinking, ""Now what?"" I'm very sad to see the series end, but happy that the filmmakers have given it a worthy finale. The Deathly Hallows Part 2 must not be missed on the big screen. If you loved the previous films, you will adore this one.<br/><br/>I give it ***1/2 out of ****"

","I am going to keep this short and sweet. Photographed beautifully and the movement of the camera done with great precision and tastefully done. The deviations from the plot line OK. Besides J. K. Rowling was executive producer through out and that means that she had the final say in everything. CGI done perfect, so much so, that the membranes of the dragon's wings fluttered in the wind, wow! Only thing that I wish is that they should have released the film as ONE complete whole (Part 1 and 2 together). I hope that they will release it in Blu-ray as one complete film. Yes, to make more money split it in two, but for the purists no parts please! The reason? The emotional arc of the movie is lost in the second part that is found in the fist. What lacked in the first the second had and what the second lacked the first had. If we can sit through over 3 hours of Lord of the Rings the Fellowship of the Rings we can sure sit through a 5 hours of Harry Potter!"

","I saw some of the first movies, then nothing until now. I thought the genre wasn't my cup of tea. I took my husband, b/c he loves Harry et al. Little did I know that I would be caught up in this adventure, even if it didn't have song or dance. With all the hoopla about the Harry series, I have learned more from news items and promos than from these movies, since as I said I have seen few.<br/><br/>I love the magical train. It is so cute. The Hogwarts Express is ingenious. Skipping to the end (spoiler), the train was as beautiful as originally, and somehow reminded me of Thomas the Tank Engine, although there was a different color scheme, of course. That the main stars' future children had boarded this train on the way to Hogwarts was, I felt, a fitting connection to things to come. There won't be any more of these movies, and more's the pity. I would liked to have seen the children going to Hogwarts, getting into all sorts of adventures, like their parents had done, and playing Quidditch (sp?). I did enjoy seeing the grown-up characters, e.g. Harry and the others with older-adult type hairstyles and clothing.<br/><br/>Also getting to the end (another spoiler), I was thrilled to see that Hogwarts had been rebuilt to its majestic self during those 19 years into the future. During this movie, Hogwarts had been blown to smithereens, over and over again, by ""the bad guys"" -- Lord Voldemort (?) and his band of dopey so-called killahs (my description, lol). As few times as I have seen the Harry movies, I always thought that Hogwarts was huge, stately and beautiful before its attempted Armageddon.<br/><br/>Baby Harry was cute. When he had tears in his eyes, it was so sad. Hagrid was excellent, as usual.<br/><br/>I have seen Jason Isaacs as Captain Hook in ""Peter Pan 2003"", and Kelly MacDonald played Peter Pan in ""Return to Neverland"". In this movie, Kelly as the feminine ghost looked so familiar, and so I did some research.<br/><br/>Well, that's about it, kiddoes. See my other reviews.<br/><br/>I predict a great future for Daniel, Emma and Rupert."
"mirabid29","10","0","2","21 July 2011"," Can hardly be better than this
","It is indeed a grand ending, an ending of a saga, an ending of the story which holds multiple generations of both young and adult. The ending of this great series can hardly be better than this. All the actors acted brilliantly at the last part of the epic and almost everybody crossed their previous performances. Especially Daniel Radcliffe wonderfully depicted the inner struggle of Harry Potter. Tears came into my eyes when Snape (Alan Rickman) was holding his beloved Lily Potter's dead body in total despair. Rupert and Emma did an excellent job too. Steve Kloves's screenplay is simply great however the final fight between Harry and Voldemort could have been more dramatic. David Yates has given his best shot although I liked the Half Blood Prince a little bit more because of its story-telling or just may be that was a better book than The Deathly Hallows. Again, the ending of this immensely popular series can hardly be better than this. Being a huge fan of Harry Potter series I must admit that the makers did a complete justice with the original story. One last thing I must say that I think both of The Deathly Hollows (Part 1 and 2) surpassed the J.K. Rowling's novel by holding viewer's interest till the end which was not possible with the last six parts as the books from Philosopher's Stone to Half Blood Prince were too damn good. Deathly Hollows (the novel) is quite good but surprisingly I found the movies of Deathly Hollows (especially part 2) more entertaining."
"lesleyharris30","9","0","1","21 July 2011"," A Stunning Finale, Does not Disappoint,
","Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is a fantastic film with a really well developed storyline and a stunning cast. Fans will not be disappointed, it closes out the franchise perfectly, all the loose ends are tied up, it is clear J.K. Rowling wrote the perfect ending in her book that had all fans very pleased, and David Yates brings it to life perfectly, making it the darkest, most intense of the series. The only issue I felt it had is that some characters are pushed to the side, ones that were significant in previous movies, whose character arch is unfulfilling, such as Minerva, Horace, Sybil and, in particular, Hagrid, one of Harry's closest friends whose screen time was very limited, I understand that they had a lot to go through, but it left me disappointed. I have said before that the cast were always maturing and growing as this series continues, and this is no exception, their performances here are very effective, the young cast members are pure professionals now, living and breathing the lives of their respective roles. Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint all shine, as does the ever terrifying Ralph Fiennes, the thrilling Alan Rickman and the charming Michael Gambon, the amount of iconic, unforgetful performances here are spectacular. An action packed, intense and well acted finale, I would recommend Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 to anyone looking for a good adventure or fantasy film. <br/><br/>Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their quest for all three of the Horcroxes, as Hogwarts is in huge danger under Voldermort's attack, it's all up to Harry to save the day, with one last battle. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Daniel Radcliffe"

"ilovesharrypotter","10","0","1","20 July 2011"," A truly brilliant and breathtaking conclusion to the magical franchise!
","*** This review may contain spoilers ***<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 left me speechless because of how amazing it was. I have been (and always will be) a huge fan of Harry Potter since the books first came out and I have grown up with Harry Potter - it was my childhood. <br/><br/>Deathly Hallows Part 2 takes off right where Part 1 finished and continues with Harry, Ron and Hermione hunting the remaining Horcruxes to destroy Voldemort. The movie is action packed, thrilling, emotional, breathtaking and very sad in parts with an ultimate showdown between good and evil. <br/><br/>If you have read the books (like me), you will be happy to know that the major key moments are in the movie, however there is a fair bit missing here and there, but you don't notice it much and it doesn't really matter because the movie is absolutely fantastic - David Yates has done another fantastic job! <br/><br/>The actors once again were outstanding. They all played their roles perfectly, and one particular actor that stood out was Alan Rickman who plays Professor Snape. He played his role brilliantly and The Prince's Tale will leave you with tears streaming down your face. For me, this is one of the best scenes in the movie even though its very sad. It is played out incredibly well. Maggie Smith who plays Professor McGonagall, was also fantastic. She really stood up a fair bit by standing up for Harry and protecting the school boundaries etc.<br/><br/>This has to be the movie of the year. The music was powerful and worked brilliantly throughout the movie, all the actors played their roles beautifully, the battle is definitely epic and words fail me to describe how great this movie is. It's really amazing. A magnificent ending to the fantastic Harry Potter series.<br/><br/>I really am struggling to come to terms that Harry Potter has ended, it hasn't fully sunk in yet, but I find happiness in knowing that I grew up with the best series ever and Harry Potter will always have a special place in my heart."
"bkoganbing","8","0","1","20 July 2011"," Hogwarts Kids Are True To Their School
","Watching Harry Potter And The Deathly Hallows, Part 2 put me in mind of the old Beach Boys song about Be True To Your School. What these kids go through for the Alma Mater is definitely above and beyond for most of us, but all in a day's work for young wizards.<br/><br/>At the end of Part 1, there's been a hostile takeover at Hogwarts Academy with perennial villain Alan Rickman the new headmaster. Michael Gambon has been killed and Daniel Radcliffe as protagonist Harry Potter along with two trusty sidekicks Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are in exile and seeking a way for an academic counterrevolution. That they succeed can be told to you by any of the millions of readers of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series, but with a lot of interesting plot twists in which young Radcliffe learns a lot about himself and the very definite purpose he's been put on earth for.<br/><br/>Though with the huge readership worldwide that the Harry Potter books enjoy, the only real criticism I can level at this or at most of the other films is that you really have to be immersed in Potter lore to know exactly what's going on. And that's bad if you missed a couple of the films when they were out as I did and still haven't made them up as yet.<br/><br/>J.K. Rowling ended her series and this should end the series with public acclaim intact and fan base satisfied. For myself even with some problems following it every now and then I enjoyed this and the other films of the series. Harry Potter is a real hero who doesn't use just magic, but uses his head to get out of troublesome situations. Poor Daniel Radcliffe though, he'll be lucky if he ever gets another role like this one."

","all right, here's my review:<br/><br/>9/10: the acting was very good. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert grunt, and Emma Watson were impressive. all the other actors played their role convincingly.<br/><br/>9/10: the script was very nice and included great lines of dialog. of course the characters are supposed to be well developed cause they were pretty well developed in the book.<br/><br/>8/10: it did have a considerable amount of emotion.<br/><br/>8/10: i'm not really great at remembering story lines, but i thought it followed the general storyline of the book nicely, although small details were left out.<br/><br/>8/10: the action scenes were good and there was some pretty good cgi, although i was expecting a little more action , which includes a little more of hog warts vs. death eaters.<br/><br/>i will also congratulate the directors on something. usually a series that is three or four movies or longer includes at least one bad or often terrible movie. what usually happens is that:<br/><br/><ul><li>the first is good or sometimes incredible, the second is a failure, and the third is good, but not as good as the first.</li></ul><br/><br/>OR <br/><br/><ul><li>the first is good, the second is amazing, and the third is terrible.</li></ul><br/><br/>or SOMETIMES: <br/><br/><ul><li>all three or all four are good.</li></ul><br/><br/>BUT, usually when there are more than three movies, at least one of them is not done well. so, i congratulate the directors on preventing one of the movies from being a big failure, especially since there are 8 films in the series and several directors.<br/><br/>the reason why i said this review contains spoilers is because i'm right now referring you to DoctorBatmanPotter's comment. if you carefully look through them, you'll notice that he makes criticisms involving unimportant things. one suggestion: don't walk into the cinema expecting the movie to include every detail of the book. look for the main storyline.<br/><br/>all in all, it was an enjoyable and relaxing-to-watch summer flick, with a few small errors. it was not exactly what i thought it would be, but i would still recommend it."
"angelwhite106","10","0","1","20 July 2011"," The Perfect Balance to End a Wonderful Series
","As a Harry Potter fan, who read all the books, and watched and own all the movies, I must say, I was upset when I knew the end was coming. I always have high expectations on movies that came from a book, but I knew it was inevitable that the movie will be different, only I didn't know if it is for the good or for the worse.<br/><br/>For those who read the book, you feel different emotions when watching this movie than what the book made you feel (that is of course if you felt anything). For those who didn't, be prepared to feel a wide range of emotions. <br/><br/>This movie is at least 10 times more emotional than any of the movies before, at times you will laugh, be scared for Harry, then you will be angry because of what Lord Voldemort subjected to Harry, next you will cry because it is so touching. <br/><br/>In this movie you can see the characters have grown. Think, has there been a time where Ron was the one that tells Hermione what's going on? and suggested a brilliant idea? The crew filmed it so well that we see that Ron has grown and he can do something other than follow orders, but not only that, they did it to the point that it makes you chuckle in a middle of the most tense scene. Now think again, when has Professor McGonagall REALLY showed favouritism? and actually defied someone with superior authority to keep Harry safe? and done it RIGHT in everyone's faces? When she did that I felt motherly love in the middle of a war zone. Oh, and when has Luna demanded Harry's attention? You know somethings up if that happens.<br/><br/>Now this scene I'm going to hint at next was done so well I was speechless, I don't think I can even convey it to you how well. Prove me wrong but when has Professor Snape even looked at Harry like he is worth something? Doesn't he always say you look and act so much like your father? While everyone goes like you have your mother's eyes? This changed so much because for ONCE, for once he tells us all that he actually care, that he is willing to express that he can to look pass Harry's appearance of James (which I would think it would symbolize as Harry's flaws from Snape's POV) to see what Lily gave Harry, by saying that Harry has Lily's eyes.<br/><br/>Snape's memories where done extremely well. When I read the book, I was like oh no, they will cut at least half of those memories, but they mean so much! Luckily they didn't cut half of the memories, merely condensed it. It was so beautiful when they overlapped pasted memories to more recent ones, when the memories changed between happiness and sorrow. It was a work of art!<br/><br/>When they were locking down Hogwarts and warding up the wards, it is the most beautiful magic I have seen on screen. For once it is not random blast of cures, but protection, a UNITED effort, yes from the beginning almost everything was a united effort, but it wasn't an object you can visibly see that it was a united effort of protection. You can feel the warmth laced with sorrow knowing the wards won't hold. <br/><br/>Since this is the last movie of a series of eight films I will assume that you all know the Harry Potter theme score. As most of you know it plays when the Warner Brother Icon pops up sometimes followed by a scene and then the Harry Potter title. Right? Well I was pretty disappointing when the first few notes told me that it was not going to be played like what I expected. However, when I started to sink into the mood of the what the music and the atmosphere around me was, it felt like my heart was going to melt and my eyes was going to water, because it felt like there was so much sorrow locked in the music and movie. Which I suppose was the point of the score; to bring it out, to emphasize it. So when the theme score was played at the climax of the movie it was so dramatic, I wanted to cry, laugh and jump up and down all at the same time.<br/><br/>Having read the books to some depth, I would say, if you strip away all the minor plots, and just left the backbone of the backbone, this series is about love, and how it will never fail, nor forgotten. The previous movies didn't really show it. But in this final one, it is stated many times over with words, action, and even magic, that the ones we love will never truly leave us even when they die, because they will always be in our heart. I think it is really powerful, because this is the last movie with a lot of death scenes. The mood is like death and only death.. no light, no exit, only hope, and trust of those around you. So when Harry is reminded that nothing really leaves us if you have them in your heart, same can be said for those Harry Potter fans, Harry Potter will never leave us if we remember him as our favourite hero, and learn from him that hope is something that can't be given up, or that friendship and love is worth more than anything physical. <br/><br/>Sure there are some things that can be improved, especially when Harry didn't give the full length speech to Voldemort, or when there aren't enough explosions to my liking, but these disappointments was paling to how great the screenplay was. <br/><br/>Oh! The Epilogue was done perfectly *laughs*"

","I just saw the movie and I think this was quite a bad ending for the Harry Potter series, loads of useless extra scenes just added,while omitting some of the best that they could have lifted straight from the books.<br/><br/>For the sake of adding more action sequences,Neville's moment of glory was watered down.<br/><br/>Also every time voldemort fires a curse at Harry priori incantatem seems to happen and Harry holds off Voldemort for a long time after they start dueling,which is impossible given Harry's lack of magical training.<br/><br/>Aberforth's character doesn't impress also Luna shouting at Harry is not really believable.<br/><br/>Most of the part in which people grieve over the dead is skipped.<br/><br/>The Trio look totally awkward in the 19 years later scene.They should have watched the first movie again for inspiration, the going to hogwarts scene in it was awesome.<br/><br/>Also in the whole break into gringotts business no explanation is given of Goblins' distrust of wizards.<br/><br/>There are obviously loads of such stuff that was missed but if you haven't read the books, you won't be disappointed."

","Yeah - everything has to end which often is a bad thing, maybe even terrible. But oh well. From the first Harry Potter I've read(which is Prisoner of Azkaban) I fell in love with the series. Alone with The lord of the ring(hobbit included) it became my favorite story. It just has so much to it. So much spirit, heart and awesomeness. And now the end has come. OK that's enough of me rambling. So the screenplay. I thought it was pretty good, damn even really good. Of cause there are some lines that was much better in the book but the ending is awesome, I can even say that even though it's unlogical it's almost better then in the book(it would of been better if they said everything they said in the book during the fight). The acting is great. I loved leads perfomenses, loved Helena Bonham Carter and even though Alan could of done better than that I loved him too. The special effect's are the best I've seen. The 3D is awesome. It almost - yeah just almost - got that special book atmosphere. All in all it's the best movie about the young wizard and the best ending possible.

","The harry potter franchise has gone on for ten years and it has been the most anticipated and rewarding franchise for people all around the world. The second part of the last installment is easily the best in the series, and is also probably one of the best movies of all time. If you've read the book you know exactly what to expect, because it is almost a movie just poured out of the book. If you haven't read the book, I will tell you this, the other movies in the franchise don't even compare to this one. This movie is emotional, action-packed the whole way through, and immensely satisfying for a conclusion to a franchise that has been going for over ten years. If you are a fan of harry potter or not, you should still see the movie because it is that good."
"mithilbhoras-103-581296","6","0","1","20 July 2011"," For those who are Harry Potter Book fans, don't watch it...
","I am just coming after watching the movie and my review: it was too fast and had many loopholes(though the ones who did not read the books will love it). I have read the books many times, especially Prisoner of Azkaban and Deathly Hallows which happen to be my favorite in the series. <br/><br/>If you loved the books very much, you will not feel the same emotions or the same thrill or the same satisfaction that one gets after reading the Book. The fighting scenes are not shown in great detail. The robbery scene is also very lame. It seems that the screenwriter and the director both loved being hasty. The movie was too quick, so quick that there was no time for the audience to react during the emotional or the shocking scenes. Instead of an adaptation this movie seemed like ""Robbing"" the story of the book. But it could not rob it's soul. I did not even feel like the saga had ""Ended"".<br/><br/>But being a great lover of movies I keep the movies and books apart. Ignoring the books, I will give the movie an honest 8. The movie is enjoyable and emotional and shocking only if you keep the book apart or if you have never read it. This is a live example of how books can be better than movies almost every time. I did have a lot of experience of it. However the third installment and the Lord of the Rings trilogy are exceptional cases. So, otherwise, the movie is great.<br/><br/>Well what more can I say? You read the summary, that's enough..."
"blackmamba99971","Null","0","1","20 July 2011"," What Can I Say?
","Absolutely fantastic. What a great ending to the most popular movie series in history. Harry Potter, (Daniel Radcliff) goes for it all to stop Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes). A seething evil entity who does not know the word lay down and die already. With hog warts at the brink of destruction, Harry and his team must find key elements to quell Voldemorts life force which are bound to a cup, a snake, a tiara, and Harry himself. A brilliant look into the past of Snape (Alan Rickman) who was in love with Harry's mother first Lily (Geraldine Sommerville) but never got to go further than friendship, gave us a peek as to who really was Harry's real father. Whether it was Snape, or was it James Potter (Adrian Rawlins). We will never know, yet the battles were breath taking, with magical wands at full strength, and soul eaters flying across the field looking for more victims. This was truly a marvel in itself. A wonderful story, fantastic acting from legendary actors such as Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Maggie smith, Tom Felton, Gary Oldman and many many others. This is a pinnacle of film making. But the last part was by far the best, where Harry and his team are now Mothers and Fathers to their own children, sending them off to hog warts. Maybe in the future, a new evil presence will show itself, to give the new age a brand of justice in their own way. And it is all thanks to Radcliff, Grint, Watson and above all, J.K Rowling, the mastermind behind the books and movies, thank you Rowling for so many years of expanding the imaginations of children from all around the world."

Those who criticize that it was not including the whole story so it was bad, should understand that it is very difficult to squeeze in everything from a thick novel into a two hours movie. It exceeded expectations. Without doubt it is the best in the series. The Shell's Cottage, The Gringotts Scene, The battle of Hogwarts, Death of Severus Snape, King's Cross, Epilogue...everything was so perfect.<br/><br/>And I love the part when Hermione changes into Bellatrix . She 's so polite. <br/><br/>Helena Bonham carter did a good impression of Hermione. There was so much more that could have /should have been included. <br/><br/>The whole of Dumbledore/Ariana/Grindelward/Gregorowich story was missing. I just wished that there was more of Snape's memories. But anyways, it was fantastic. The epilogue which was shot earlier was longer and had more dialogues. but It was re shot and shortened.

","So, the series comes to an end, with Harry and his friends in the big showdown with Voldemort. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"" continues the style that the series began to adopt in part 5, as a look at resistance to totalitarianism: you may recall that the Death Eaters aim to ""purify"" the wizarding world by eliminating anyone whom they don't consider a ""real"" wizard.<br/><br/>Obviously, the movie can't really compare to the book, but I still found it to be a good conclusion to the series. It was always good to see that, as with the books, each successive movie got more mature and complex. Therefore, I recommend it, even if it isn't the ultimate masterpiece."

","This is the moment we've all waited ten years to see. This movie is very entertaining and doesn't disappoint. I was very satisfied with the outcome. The battle scenes were awesomely epic. This movie is probably the most emotional, because of a few deaths of characters we've gotten to know over the years, and because it's the final chapter. There was a scene in the middle where I shed a few tears. This movie picks up exactly where Part 1 ended. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are still on the hunt for Voldemort's Horcruxes. When they sneak back into Hogwarts, they try to find the remaining Horcruxes but Hogwarts is soon under attack by Voldemort and his Death Eaters. In the end, only one can live. This has been a great decade journey. I highly recommend HARRY POTTER AND THE DEATHLY HALLOWS PART 2!!!"
"treeline1","Null","0","1","19 July 2011"," Well, it's finally over
","Part 2 starts at the moment Part 1 ended with Voldemort getting Dumbledore's wand and Harry grieving at Dobby's grave. Harry and his pals then go to Gringott's Bank in search of a horcrux which must be destroyed so Voldemort can be killed once and for all. They also would like to find the three deathly hallows, objects which give the owner immortality. Their journey leads back to Hogwarts, which is now under Death Eater control and a grim place, indeed.<br/><br/>This movie is exactly like the book, so I knew what to expect and wasn't surprised or disappointed, just not particularly entertained. This director loves CGI and the film's cartoony and chaotic mood doesn't lend itself well to emotions. Big events like deaths are rushed, the movie is confusing even if you're familiar with the plot, and it just didn't deliver a Grand Finale to Remember. Ron and Hermione have very little to do here and their big kiss is robotic; speaking of robots, Ginny still can't act and has no chemistry with Harry. The long-awaited epilogue scene was just like the rest of the movie - okay but not, ""WOW."" If you like computer animation and explosions, you'll love this movie. If you prefer heartfelt emotion and meaningful dialogue, you'll be disappointed but glad you stuck it out to the end."
"Nuz_Reviews","10","0","1","19 July 2011"," The best Harry Potter movie. Magically brilliant.
","It's weird to think that there will not be another Harry Potter movie. I've spent the last decade waiting for the next one in either a year or two later. I've never read the books and hear they leave out so much in the movies, so that is definitely my next Harry Potter adventure. With that in mind, let me continue on to the review of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2.<br/><br/>Nothing to really complain about with this Harry Potter conclusion. That's a great thing to write for a movie review.<br/><br/>Having not read the Harry Potter books I particularly enjoyed the story above anything else. I realize there's so much left out in the movies from the book, but I had so many of my ""Potter questions"" finally answered.<br/><br/>Part 2 picks up right where Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1 left off. I hate to be a spoiler so I won't go much into the plot. But for those of you who forget, ""He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named"" finally has the power to kill Harry Potter. Both movies focus on Harry, Ron, and Hermione trying to hunt and destroy all of the Horcruxes. What will happen to Harry? Will the three get all of the Horcruxes before it's too late?<br/><br/>We also see the huge cave underneath Gringotts Bank in Diagon Alley. That was visually one of my favorite scenes! Blew me away. Bloody brilliant.<br/><br/>I'm still not anywhere close to being sold on the whole 3-D film movement. I am, however, bought on the quality of sound and digital picturing that can be seen at IMAX and it's new competitor RPX at Regal Cinemas. For a few bucks more I can experience the movie with a bigger digital picture and hear the uncompressed surround sound that comes with it at my local Regal. IMAX is obviously better than RPX, but it's much further away and holds a smaller capacity of seats.<br/><br/>With all that theater quality mumbo jumbo out of the way, let me express my opinion on Harry Potter's picture quality. Truly the CGI was spectacular and this was my favorite 3-D movie that wasn't only good due to the 3-D (i.e. Avatar). TRON: Legacy is a close second with the amazing Daft Punk soundtrack. Still the picture is a lot brighter if I took my glasses off, but this Harry Potter finale does a fine job. Personally, the 3-D film experience won't be perfected until it doesn't require the glasses.<br/><br/>Back to the film itself.<br/><br/>I was so pleased to have director David Yates back yet again. Yates directed the three Potter movies before this one as well. The Harry Potter series only got better as it went on and this final installment proves it. He does such a great job working with the talent to portray their characters. Thank you, David Yates!<br/><br/>This movie is both literally and narratively dark. And, I've heard the final book is even more so. With that being said, I exuberantly enjoyed the added laughter to the movie. Mainly by interaction between Ron and Hermione, but also else where along the way; it's that old school Harry Potter fun.<br/><br/>You probably notice that I didn't mention any of the actors' and actresses' performances. Well, let me assure you that all of them did a phenomenal job. There, I said it.<br/><br/>I couldn't have asked for a better film to end this series.<br/><br/>10/10 Star Rating!"
"Generic_Gooner","8","0","2","18 July 2011"," Satisfying conclusion, worth it in the end.
","Well its been a long road to have travelled watching these films, and although it has had its misses as well as its hits, the franchise as a whole is worthy of its status as one of the all time greats.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of the books, it had never appealed to me to read the children's novels and so coming into these films the story was completely fresh. It almost worked against me because the one key thing about these films as I'm sure it must have been with the books is that they age with the audience. By this i mean the first film was very much rooted in a children's film theme and didn't dare stray into darker themes for more than the odd fleeting moment.<br/><br/>But This film certainly did. Everything you might be looking for from a fantasy tale was present here, the action was plentiful, the characters remained complex and we were given yet more insight into back stories and twist elements that were previously unknown. There was a touch of comedy at times but it was deliberately low key to ensure the overall mood of this finale was where it should be, that sense of despair you need to feel with the main characters before they make their final stand against the great evil.<br/><br/>The 3d doesn't add enough to make it an enhancement to the film experience, but in honesty the film doesn't need it. From the beginning you are on your way with an adventure that contains suspense, magic and then a dramatic action sequence or two, so you aren't having to wait on any build up.<br/><br/>To sum it up without any spoilers is tough, but needless to say this is Harry's final stand off against Voldemort and his followers, and its packed with a variety of creatures and magic and revelations that if you haven't already read the book will tie a lot of previous elements together in a clever way. Characters you might have preconceptions about will surprise you, those who you may not expect to be a key player in it all will suddenly step up to the plate... This is easily for me the best of the entire series, and not just because it has all the pay offs that the rest have been leading up to but because its the darkest and most adult in theme of the lot.<br/><br/>It helped that a lot of the more tedious elements were used up in the first half of this two part finish to the series. I am aware that a book can make more descriptive and explanatory parts to the story more entertaining, but the translation onto screen in deathly hallows part 1 was dire by comparison to this. Whre the drawn out tedium of part 1 affected both the pace and the interest this film turns it all on its head, as if this was the pay off to reward you for sticking with it after that initial slow start. In many ways these films will work better in tandem on a DVD, so you are introduced to all the plot details before being taken on the wild ride of the final stand between good and evil.<br/><br/>The fact that after 7 previous films you have invested yourself in the characters is a big assist here, because they are almost like old friends that you are seeing in one last adventure together, and that is the mark of a great story.

","They should redo the other movies according to the standards of this last one. This is almost the best we (fans of the book story) could have hoped for.<br/><br/>It is sad that they decided to cut the dialog of the showdown between Harry Potter and Voldemort, that was the most important bit of text of the 7 books and it would have made the ending a more satisfying one.<br/><br/>They removed some books chapters but overall, and FINALLY, they managed to get the tone right as well as the most important details of the story.<br/><br/>If only the other movies would have been like this last one.<br/><br/>Clearly, this shows the positive impact of having 1 more year of post-production. Perhaps a lesson to be learned by the money-hungry studio at Hollywood; This movie will still be good in 10 years, the others will not.<br/><br/>The musical score is also better and more adventurous this time; amazing studio mastering on the soundtrack. The ""Hogwarts"" musical theme is still as bad as before however."

","Personally, my main complaint was that the movie could have been longer. It seemed that they tied up all of the loose ends too quickly. At shortly over two hours, I think they should have put the mark closer to 2.5 hours and not rushed some of the scenes. Especially for the fans that have only watched the films and not read the books for clarification of events.<br/><br/>That being said, since I have read the books, I thought what was there was very well done. The young ones in this series of films have grown up in front of us, and had unbelievably talented mentors in their costars, and their acting talents have astronomically improved from SS to DH2. Daniel, Rupert, Emma, Bonnie, Tom, Evanna, Matthew, James, Oliver, etc really were brilliant in their roles. How could they not be, when they have the likes of Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Gary Oldman, Julie Walters, Ciaran Hinds, etc to teach them their craft.<br/><br/>I must say that Alan Rickman was utterly brilliant, as always, as the tormented Professor Snape, but he was particularly phenomenal in this one. Absolutely breathtaking. Maggie Smith's Professor McGonagall was courageous and strong. I just adore Julie Walters as Molly---that is absolutely one of my favorite characters in the books that was so masterfully portrayed on screen. Ciaran Hinds as Aberforth was a welcome addition to the cast in my opinion. He's awesome.<br/><br/>I will undoubtedly see it again. We saw it in 3D for the first viewing and will likely go to a 2D showing next time, but it's a fantastic tribute to the fans of the series. I highly recommend it."

Don't waste money on watching it in 3D. Climax was a little disappointing. I couldn't figure out why Dumbledore had to fake his death. And you know who didn't seem so menacing as i was expecting. <br/><br/>Usually in such movies, the hero discovers some secret power and uses it defeat the villain but in this one not many surprises. <br/><br/>over all, always good to see a potter movie.<br/><br/>I am interested in seeing what mr potter and the rest of the cast will do in their lives now.

"KingNY","10","0","1","17 July 2011"," Best Harry Potter Movie Ever and Movie of the Year So Far!!!
","Spoiler Alert!!!!!!! I went to the midnight show yesterday. The theater was packed. All the potter fans where extremely eager and excited to see the end of a very long and emotional journey. The movie started off with an amazing dark scene where dementors have surrounded Hogwarts and Professor Snape has become the headmaster of Hogwarts. The movie has its pace from the start as director David Yates is trying to fit as much as he can in this two hour flick.<br/><br/>After giving Dobby the elf a burial, where it was left on the Part I of the Deathly Hallows, he starts inquiring about breaking into Gringotts with the Goblin he had saved from Malfoy's manor and he also started inquiring about the elder wand with Mr Olivander as it was one of the Deathly Hallows Voldemort had just found. It's a race against time as Harry is trying to find all the horcruxes before Voldermort finds out that the boy knows his secret.<br/><br/>From breaking into Gringotts, to flying out of Gringotts, to the secret passage from Hog's Head to the Hogwarts, to Professor McGonagall dueling with Professor Snape, to all the house standing up (except Slytherin) to fight for Potter, to Hermoine destroying the Horcrux with Basilisk's Fang, to Harry fighting the cursed fire in the room of requirements, to Harry saving Draco Malfoy, to entire Hogwarts fighting Death Eaters, to affection between Harry & Ginny and Ron & Hermoine, to Professor Snape getting murdered by Voldemort, to Fred Weasley's death, to Remus and Tonks's death, to a very emotional past of Professor Snape and Lily Potter, to Harry getting cursed by Voldemort, to Voldemort and the death eaters celebrating Potter's death, to revival of Potter, to Molly Weasley killing Belatrix Lestrange, to Neville Longbottom chopping off Nagini's head, and finally the duel between Harry & Voldemort. It all has been covered by David Yates.<br/><br/>The visual effects were stunning and the scenery were breathtaking as usual in all the Potter movies. It was very sad to see a decade long journey full of action, adventure and emotions end. In fact, I saw some fans cry in the theater. The only thing I think would have made this movie out of this world was if it could have been half an hour longer, there could have been a lot of emotions added to the movie which were left out. Oh, and the 19 years later part was hilarious to watch!!! Nonetheless, David Yates gave his best and it was a magnificent finale!!!! Movie of the year so far!!! If you are a Potter fan than it's a movie to die for!!!! If you are deciding on which movie to watch and can't come to a decision I recommend go for the final part of Potter as you won't be disappointed. And if you hate Potter and can't stand it, the entire movie is worth the teaser trailer of The Dark Knight Rises!!!!!!!! Christopher Nolan = Genius!!!!!! Well, it all has ended!!!! And lets hope one day there will be another wizard to save the day!!!!"
"KnightsofNi11","8","0","2","17 July 2011"," An incredibly fitting end to a ten year endeavor
","Well this is it. This is the film that ends the legacy that began an entire decade ago. 2001 saw Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, and eight films later we are ending it all with Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2. This is an incredibly impressive feat to make an entire book series into a film series with literally only one recast. I refer of course to Michael Gambon's recast as Albus Dumbledore, but that is only because his predecessor, Richard Harris, passed away. The series has seen its highs with works of art like Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban which proved that this was no longer a small time family series, to the terribly unconvincing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire which showed us how awkward the series could be. But now we've arrived at the very last film which provides us with an explosively grand ending to a series that has been mystifying our minds for ten fun filled years.<br/><br/>In this final chapter Harry must face Voldemort for the last time. He's down to only three horcruxes and Voldemort knows it. Harry returns to Hogwarts to save the school from Severus Snape's iron fist of oppression but then must save it from a bigger threat. Voldemort has amassed an army to attack the school so that he can find and kill Harry Potter. And so the epic battle for Hogwarts begins. This is one of the most grandiose and loudest Harry Potter's in a long time, making it wildly exciting and a wondrous entertainment for the eyes and ears. For the brain, not as much, but for the heart most definitely as we reach an emotionally stirring conclusion to a series that has been with us for so long.<br/><br/>The first part to The Deathly Hallows was all about character development as the final steps were taken to mature these characters that we knew as little kids in 2001 to true adults in that film. Part 2 is a much more action and plot driven story as we wrap up everything and come to a complete conclusion for this long tale. The dialogue isn't as sophisticated or driving as it was in part 1 and the thing we will really remember from part 2 is most certainly the action and the key parts of the storyline which resolve everything. The film does have a great plot and I don't know that you could ask for a better way to end the story. Ten years and you need something explosive and that is just what you get.<br/><br/>This film is a visual spectacle that brings together every great wonder we've enjoyed about the Harry Potter series since film one and throws it all into the final chapter. We are treated to things like little flying blue imp creatures from Chamber of Secrets and the giant spiders from the same film. We get a taste of Dementors from Prisoner of Azkaban and even some long overdue flying broom sequences which are incredibly fun and very well shot. Sadly, we still get no Quidditch but due to the things going on in this film there wouldn't exactly be any time for it. The film also brings back practically every character that hasn't died, and even some who have. No direct spoilers here though. All I can say that it is incredibly satisfying to see so many characters all together once more, fighting alongside one another in the most epic battle in the history of Harry Potter.<br/><br/>Honestly, you couldn't ask for a much better conclusion. It would have been incredibly disappointing if the final film to end an eight film series didn't live up to the hype, but I would say it does. It gives us everything we ask for and respectfully puts an end to a series we've loved for a whole ten years. This isn't a perfect film on its own, but putting it into context it is fantastic and plenty satisfying. All sorts of things could have gone wrong with the final Harry Potter film, but none of those things happen and we are delivered a mighty conclusion to an incredible series of films."
"dfranzen70","9","0","4","17 July 2011"," The perfect way to end it
","Yes indeed, it's all over. The eighth and final Harry Potter movie is perhaps the best of the entire lot, as it seamlessly mixes fantastic action with intricate exposition. It satisfactorily completes the story, tying up all essential loose ends, and leaves you with a sense of acceptable finality. It's a textbook example of how to finish a film series.<br/><br/>HP 7a begins right where the HP 7a left off, a departure from the other films (which dove almost right into a major action scene). I liked that, because even though the final book was split into two movies, for the sake of continuity it's best to think of them as one long, long movie. This continuity allowed us to remain in sync with the characters and their plight, rather than removing us from the action.<br/><br/>Harry is still on the lookout for the remaining Horcruxes, objects into which Voldemort has placed portions of his soul. He, along with Ron and Hermione, have left Hogwarts, which is now under the ruthless rule of one Professor Snape, who may or may not have had something to do with the death of the last headmaster (Dumbledore). Snape may or may not be working for the Dark Lord; it's something that's been ambiguous for many movies now. Meanwhile, Voldemort is assembling his forces and, knowing the prophecy that says only he or Harry may live, seeks his enemy's demise.<br/><br/>There are two major, long scenes in the movie: one involves a break in (and break out) of the goblin bank Gringotts, and the other is the epic Battle of Hogwarts. Both seem terrifyingly real, especially when viewed in IMAX 3D. I don't often go for the IMAX experience, or for 3D, but this was a good choice. Director Peter Yates made great use of the technology.<br/><br/>I think the movie is fairly true to the book, with only some minor changes. For example, the character of Crabbe, one of Draco Malfoy's buddies, doesn't appear in the movie - because the actor who played him had had a drug conviction, thus necessitating a script change. But for the most part, things are as they were in the book.<br/><br/>The most touching moments are the quiet, sometimes unexpected ones. There are many times during the movie when characters feel that they could die at any moment, so they say and do things believing there may not be time later on. The terrific cast - especially the younger actors - is compelling as always, believable not only as witches and wizard but as loving, feeling human being just like us.<br/><br/>Of course, the biggest emotional moment takes place in the Forbidden Forest, an ethereal scene that brings back a lot of memories for Harry; it's somewhat reminiscent of the cave scene on Dagobah in The Empire Strikes Back, except that in this case the scene propels the plot and serves as an emotional counter to all the battling going on around it.<br/><br/>There are no major flaws in this movie, and the minor ones are inconsequential. The film maintains its sense of urgency, seriousness, and dark attitude; you genuinely feel as if the fate of the world rests on this manchild with a lightning scar. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II is a beautiful, elegant coda to a long-running series that began as a kids' movie and became more mature as it progressed, much like its youthful main cast."

","This movie lived up to its expectations. This movie is epic, as noted by many. Many sub- plots were missed that were in the books, and many new plots that weren't necessarily relevant were introduced. While the plot of having Harry use the elder wand to repair his previous wand was missed, along with many other small details. The producers introduced other fight scenes or irrelevant special effects. <br/><br/>The performances were amazing (as usual). Maggie Smith, Alan Rickman, Emma Watson, Helena Bonham Carter, and Ralph Fiennes really brought the characters to life, and made the movie so amazing. Other mentionable performances were Rupert Grint, Matthew Lewis, and Tom Felton. Many may disagree with me, but I found that Radcliffe's performance was just mediocre. I believe that many out shone his acting. <br/><br/>Overall this movie will probably be remembered, and never go out of style. I recommend all to watch it (if you are over the age of 10). It was worth the many hours of waiting to get in. Those who are wondering, there is a epilogue. The epilogue caused myself (and many others) to cry. Thanks!"

There wasn't too much violence and there was enough of the traditional Harry Potter vibe needed to please die-hard fans.<br/><br/>SPOILER!

"freemantle_uk","9","0","2","17 July 2011"," The Battle for Hogwarts
","One of the biggest film franchises has finally come to an end. We have seen around 20 hours of magical fun, way over $6 Billion revenues, made stars out of its three main actors and been a major boost for the British film industry. It was a fitting end to the series.<br/><br/>Picking off where Part 1 left off, Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson) have destroyed one of Voldermort's Horcruxes and need to find the reminding three. They go to Gringotts Bank to break into Bellatrix Lestrange's (Helena Bonham Carter) vault to retrieve of the Horcluxes. When they get it they know they need to go Hogwarts, now run by Professor Snape (Alan Rickman). Professor McGonagall (Maggie Smith) defends him Harry search for the last Horcruxes, Ravencroft's Diadem whilst Voldermort (Ralph Fiennes) and his forces plan to attack the school. And whilst this goes on Harry finds out the truth behind his past, his family and Snape's.<br/><br/>All the previous films in the series had a long time scale, normally lasting months, this Harry Potter film takes place over the space of a few days, starting with a bank heist and the majority of the film being a battle. This makes the final Harry Potter a little different to the rest of the series and it was a very quick film with all the events happening at once. The mystery has to be figured quickly and Part 2 is certainly an action packed film. The director David Yates has done a wonderful job with series, able to make the series more darker and mature, making sure the drama and character development is fully realised but also making sure there is plenty of action and comedy. Whilst I think Alfonso Cuaron was the best director overall the series had, Yates clearly did an excellent job, making sure his films are stylist and he has made the transition from TV director to Blockbuster director. The action in excellent and the battle itself reminded me of the Battle for Helm's Deep in Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers. It reminds me of that for two reasons, first that it was fought in a tight location, but mainly because it was cut with Harry searching for the Horcrux and seeing how individual fighting in the middle of it all. Yates also made sure there was plenty of drama and emotion throughout the film, mix with moments of humour.<br/><br/>Acting wise Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are solid with what they have to do and obviously improved from the first film. Radcliffe is actor I personally believe will be the most successful after the Harry Potter series. Whilst Part 1 focused on the main three characters, Part 2 was mostly Harry's story focusing mostly on him. Maggie Smith is finally allowed to shine as Professor McGonagall as she leads the defend of Hogwarts. Alan Rickman has always been a great actor and no actor could have done the role better, but with Part 2 he made sure that Snape was not just a cold character but brought out the complicated nature of Snape. Fiennes showed that that Voldermort was becoming scared and more irrational when each part of his soul was destroyed and as Harry said in the film, becoming a wounded animal, making him more dangerous. Many of our favourite characters return to the film, even if it was just for a cameo, like Emma Thompson.<br/><br/>Whilst Part 2 is a very entertaining film, my one major criticism is because the film was made to be in 3D some of the set pieces were very obvious, like the break into the Bank where it looked like a theme park ride. But for the most part it was a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>With the Harry Potter series we got to see these characters grow, not just the main three, but also people like Neville Longbottom who started as a clumsy and incompetent boy who grew into a brave young man and had skills as a wizard. We were slowly brought into this world, learning the rules, the norms, the society and its history and it is good to see a series has a real end game and not a forced ending like the X-Men 'trilogy'."
"sworup_shakya","9","0","2","17 July 2011"," Absolutely what a finale is supposed to be
","The movie is really an epic. It start on a high and never lets down. And since its so grand and fast, it does looses out on the parts where we have to slow down a bit and feel sorry for those who are dying between the epic battle scenes (most of the time they are important characters).<br/><br/>I have particularly noticed that this movie shows ""You Know Who"" as pretty weak compared to the previous ones; I believe this is done only in the movie so that Daniel Radcliffe could be shown of equal match if not superior, to Ralph Fiennes, from the moment the movie starts, cause if it is done at the exact time this is needed, I don't think Daniel Radcliffe has the acting powers to pull it off. I always liked movies where villains are more stronger so this is kind of a set back.<br/><br/>These are minor setbacks however, the movie makes up in terms of visuals, in 3D its a real treat. And don't worry about the story, this is the final chapter and this is more about concluding everything and giving you a good final showdown, the story was supposed to be Part I, this one is all about these are things you didn't know, this is how it ends, and in case of kids stories, ""and they lived happily ever after"", but Harry and Co. don't look much like kids anymore."

"lao4950000","10","0","3","17 July 2011"," Spectacular finale to our beloved HP series
","All good things must come to an end, a wise man once said. After a full decade of the magical HP franchise we all know and love, it all ends here with this final film. I have to say just walking into the theater I was a bit teary-eyed, I had grown up right along with Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint and watched as they matured both physically and emotionally, so this has been a whole full circle moment. I'm sad to see it end but I'm proud to say it ended on spectacular high note.<br/><br/>Part II picks up right where Part I left off, with our beloved trio hunting down and destroying every last one of Voldemort's horcruxes, so that he could be rendered mortal and finally be killed off once and for all. This leads to a surprisingly comedic scene where Hermione disguises herself as Bellatrix Lestrange so that they can gain access to her bank vault, where one of Voldemort's horcruxes is kept. Watching Hermione wobble and nearly trip over herself in Bellatrix's heels while trying to act like her was very laughable. The other memorable moments (of which there are so many) include the final battle at Hogwarts where the students and professors defend their school and each other against Voldemort's Death Eaters, Neville stepping up to the plate as a hero with an unbreakable spirit, and Hermione and Ron's long awaited kiss.<br/><br/>The actors all did a superb job here. Alan Rickman gave the character of Severus Snape redemption in this last film. In his dying moment he gave Harry his memories, where we finally see Snape's true motivations. It was Dumbledore who orchestrated his own death, he asked Snape to kill him (A) as a mercy killing so he wouldn't die a slower, much more painful death due to the curse inflicted on him and (B) to set up a chain of events which would make Harry the rightful owner of the Elder Wand so that he would gain the winning hand in defeating Voldemort.<br/><br/>And Daniel was outstanding in his final performance as Harry. He captured Harry's character perfectly, he conveyed both vulnerability and strength all at the same time. Harry willingly sacrificed his own life to Voldemort, as a bargain to save the lives of everyone else at Hogwarts(and also to destroy the horcrux that Voldemort had unwittingly made Harry into when he first tried to kill him as a baby). He went willingly knowing he would die. By showing both how scared he was and yet still finding the courage in him to face Voldemort, Daniel made Harry a real flesh and blood hero. After that, Harry's resurrection and his final duel with Voldy was just the icing on the cake. Altho it was cool to see Harry come out victorious and Voldy getting his just desserts.<br/><br/>The only slight complaint I have is that a few of the scenes were rushed. The battle scenes were longer and harder fought in the book than was shown in this film, but I can definitely forgive that. It would probably be over 4 hours long if they set out to make it exactly like the book. Nevertheless, this film did its job and captured the true essence of its characters and its story, and my emotions ran wild with every high and low. I urge you all to see it, its an experience that you just have to have."

","I saw the last HP yesterday . Great movie but after so many years HP fans deserves a much more better ending , an epic ending . This was not absolutely not epic ending at all for Mr. Potter and the fans ! ... The end was the cheapest in any franchise ! Overall a great movie , good VFX not better than Transformers 3 thought of course , a cheap finale and an awful 3D . I speak honestly without any influence ! I think Transformers : Dark Of The Moon 3 is the best movie this year out there both in 3D and in the story :) Overall 7/10 because Mr.Potter deserved a better ending more epic and more impressive ! 10 years this ending was a lame Mr.Yates !"
"abrahamsamuel","10","0","4","17 July 2011"," The Best Harry Potter Movie Ever!
","As the tagline says it all ends here! Watch the movie in 3D for the best experience you can get. The movie takes you on an unforgettable journey through a world filled with good and evil and which triumph over what and how it all happens. The story is filled with emotions, sentiments, twists, turns, stunts, action and all the right ingredients which makes one Humongous BLOCKBUSTER! Please be sure that you have seen the previous Harry Potter movies cause this one has lots of flashbacks and memories and you would be pretty much confused if you haven't seen the other ones. This movie is one of the very few movies which has utilised 3D technology to the maximum."
"maximvit","9","0","3","17 July 2011"," A spectacular, melodramatic ending to an epic saga with slight glitches
","Harry Potter has been one of those remarkable franchises, truly comparable to Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. Even tough i am a huge fan, have read and loved all the books and watched and loved all the films, the finale of the finale isn't as it as perfect as it seems.<br/><br/>Let's start from the beginning: The screenplay is wonderful as always and a proper ending chapter, just like in the J.K. Rowling books. The main actors are to live with as always and the veteran supporting cast, especially Alan Rickman, excellent as always.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is amazing. It is far the visually best of the Harry Potter films and the most filled with spectacle and action. Even the un-action scenes, such as the shore near Bill and Fleur's house is also visually beautiful, while the enchanting Alexandre Desplat score fills out the missing pieces.<br/><br/>The movie loyally follows the book, mostlyand will satisfy both the fans and the ones, that haven't read any. Even tough the movie is the most dark, mature and bloody of any in the franchise, it will satisfy a lot of people, because the spectacular action and engaging storyline will suck in even the non-fans.<br/><br/>The ending is epic as it should be, explaining all the needed elements. But then comes the epilogue. The epilogue, showing the protagonists 19 years later, is done with some creepy aging effects, so we basically see Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, Bonnie Wright and Tom Felton with different haircuts and clothes, some of them slightly reminding of Al Bundy and similar. The incredibly-badly done epilogue completely ruins the truly epic ending and will probably cause nothing but laughter.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows: part 2 isn't as perfect as it might could be, but it still an incredibly good movie."
"BarbaraEvans","10","0","2","17 July 2011"," Perfect Ending
","You may have had high expectations and leave the theater kind of disappointed, you may have been angry because they cut a lot of things and made everything faster and not as epic.. I could have agreed with you, but I just saw it several times and it couldn't be much perfect... Because that's the beauty of the differences - the books and the films will never be the same and will never make you feel the EXACT same way. Perhaps something similar but the amazing thing is that you will always prefer the book, that's why the film is so brilliant. You'll LOVE it, you'll FEEL it.. but you will never prefer it over the book, just the way it should be. <br/><br/>Now, off to the film stuff - GREAT acting. I was just stunned. Obviously, (as everyone, I'm sure, has write before) Alan Rickman was the man that stole the whole movie; still, every single one of the actors portrayed perfectly.<br/><br/>Score was the perfect way of keeping it calm or making it fast.. Putting pieces of the first films was just as touching as watching flashbacks from them as well.<br/><br/>Special Effects. What can't I say about the special effects? STUNNING AS ALWAYS, even better, I might say. The 3D is really impressive. You'll have to watch it in both formats to really think it was mind blowing or at least have some references of other films in 3D. They didn't put the classic ""coming to your face"" 3D effect, instead you felt there - it was pure magic. Watching the dragon, dementors and spells in 3D really gives you goosebumps.<br/><br/>And what can I say if you are a Potterhead? I've watched the film 3 times already (planning to watch it 7 times, the magical number) and I can tell you there are still tears coming when the most heartbreaking scenes AND the end comes to the screen. <br/><br/>It was a great ride being in this fandom, and it was a pleasure to share it with all of you guys."
"skbubbly","9","0","1","17 July 2011"," A better than expected sign off
","Agreed that the adaptation was not much paid attention, but wasn't that the cruel case since the Goblet of Fire? Nevertheless this part did so much better on those lines. <br/><br/>Unlike the previous 4 installments, where the Novel fans would find themselves comparing the plots, this one has you absorbed in its pacy screenplay. Right from the starting, the intensity was brilliantly maintained. The critical moments were carefully laid down. The dialogues were better, be it the the heavy emotional ones or the light-hearted witty ones. The small dosage of humor in its otherwise dark envelope worked well this time. The scenes weren't left hanging. They were thought out well. The characters were brilliant. The finale nostalgia evident. <br/><br/>The post-interval saw a dip in the momentum. Though the screenplay and the acting remained as better, the plot came loose at the end. The adaptation level that was maintained broke down especially at the parts around the showdown. That could have been penned better. The visuals were a bonus with the 3D. <br/><br/>I would give a 9.5 for the start and a 7 for the post interval part. All in all, one of the better films of the franchise and signs it off well."
"KrazzyDJ","8","0","1","16 July 2011"," Too bad ... Its over
","Its here. The moment we've all been waiting for and the moment we've been secretly dreading. For believe it or not, the fact is, that there might just not be any more Harry Potter left after this movie. The books are over, and with the latest Harry Potter installment, the movies are over too. And so, with Harry Potter, we've all entered adulthood.<br/><br/>First off, the movie was great. With the rave reviews it has been getting, I was of the opinion that most of these might have been given out of sympathy and an emotional attachment to the Potter franchise considering that we bid goodbye to him and his circle of friends with this. But the movie actually deserves all the applause its been getting. What struck me as different about this movie is that it has a constant feeling of movement - a feeling similar to what you get when watching Christopher Nolan's masterpieces like Inception and The Dark Knight. Even in a scene which could otherwise have been a simple dialog taking place between two characters, the background score gives the impression of movement - which in turn gives you the on-the-edge-of-the-seat feeling that you usually crave for in movies. And irrespective of whether you've read the novels or not, you're surely going to enjoy this movie because you are well aware that this is it, it has to end here. Either Harry has to die, or Voldemort will. Or maybe both ??? I'm not going to mention anything about the story lest I inadvertently manage to reveal a spoiler. Suffice it to say, that Harry, Ron and Hermione continue their quest of finding and destroying the Horcruxes and hence attempting to destroy Lord Voldemort and in their quest, are joined by almost every character we can recollect to be on their side since the inception of the Potter universe. For those who ain't read the novels, the plot is still simple to follow since most of the explanation bit has been done in Deathly Hallows - Part 1. For those who have, they've according to me included almost everything they could from the novel. Dumbledore's past has been left out and the sequence of events and the manner in which they take place in the ending slightly altered but apart from that, its like watching the novel come to life.<br/><br/>The recent Harry Potter movies have become increasingly dark, not just tonally, but also visually. The visuals are great although the darkness sometimes makes it difficult to see what's going on in the screen. I'd imagine the 3D to have an even worse effect which is why I saw the movie in 2D and apart from the opening logo and the ending sequence, I could not see how the movie could have been better in 3D than without it. The background score is simply excellent - just hear the bits playing during Snape's presence; they're haunting. The performances have come up too and again, although Fiennes as Voldemort gives us a scary act and Radcliffe, Grint and Watson are commendable as the trio, the best performance comes from Alan Rickman portraying Severus Snape. His eyes alone manage to convey a wide range of emotions, in some cases, with the rest of his body standing still. Its sad that he has less scenes in the movie. Just like Severus Snape, Rickman here proves to be the secret star of the show.<br/><br/>On the minuses, the movie is incredibly dark. Of course, considering that all the action happens during the night, it should rightfully be so but nevertheless, this makes things happening on screen sometimes, difficult to follow. Also, with the time they had, they could've easily extended the movie by 10 minutes or so and included all of Dumbledore's past. That would have added for some interesting character study from a movie's perspective and it would have ensured inclusion of the whole novel in the movie at just a few extra minutes of screen time's worth - something Potter fans and even non novel readers would not have minded. Besides, they should have shown how some of the characters who get bumped off (yes they do) have died instead of just showing us their dead faces. What is bugging is that they actually were cribbing of time all this time along and this movie being 130 minutes approximately, they could've gotten enough time (in fact all the time they needed) to put in those extra scenes which would have only enhanced the movie.<br/><br/>I've been preparing to watch this movie for months (three to be precise). I've been reading up all the novels and watching all the movies again. It is while reading the novels for the first time that I realized what I did miss on in all those years of my childhood. Nevertheless, the last few months feel as if I've been living in an alternate universe myself. And finally, I was able to watch this movie while having read the novel before hand - something which I wasn't able to do all these years. And now, its over. I have a hollow feeling inside me telling me that its all over - the event which I've been mentally preparing myself for 3 months is over. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable experience while it lasted. An of course, who knows, they might re release all the Potter films in 3D later on. Which reminds me, who's stopping us from re-watching and re-reading Potter all over again. For what it is, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows - Part 2 is a ride that's fun, scary and filled with a tinge of sadness. As a sort of a bonus, you even get to see scenes from the previous Potter films. A must watch. Long live Harry Potter. Longer live Severus Snape !!!<br/><br/>Score: 8.0 / 10"

To capture the same enchanting feel in a series of seven films is a commendable job.<br/><br/>It was a complete entertainer, from the mysterious soulful background scores, to the breath-taking visual effects, to the crafty performances of Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort), Emma Watson (Hermione), Daniel (Harry) and the strange but rightful dialogue delivery of Prof Snape, it has all the elements of being amongst the best in the year so far.

","It's over. It's finally over and I feel like I, too, have lost a part of something that's been with me for so long. It's always been thereâ€”the anticipation, especially since each movie would come out near my birthday. I'll miss it.<br/><br/>*SPOILER* This movie was overall magnificent and the best of all 8 movies for me. What made it so special was: Alan Rickman. He blew me away and I felt his love for Lily was more real than reality itself. Having read all the books, I never realized or understood the trepidation of his situation, his decisions and the angst, the helplessness that tore him apart day by day and the depth of love he harbored for Lily after all those years. When Harry saw the memories of Snape, I was tearing up without noticing that I was trembling a little bit too. Those scenes were beautiful.<br/><br/>The funny moments were utterly hilarious. Now that I recall it, I was either laughing my eyes out or crying my eyes out and sometimes, simultaneously doing both. I love how each actor has grown so much with each other that it's believable on screen how they've grown together for seven years as students. The funniest part that had me pissing my pants was probably the ending. After the ""19 years later"" passed, I didn't stop laughing once. God, they did a horrible job with presenting them as being 19 years older! Only Ginny was slightly in character with her old-lady hairstyle. Everyone else looked like they had gone on drinking binges and had forgotten to shave for a week or two. But, their children were so cute nonetheless!<br/><br/>Now, I must buy the DVDs once they come out and re-watch and relive them all over again. I have to say though, it never really will end for me and many other fans out there. It's just that.. magical."
"Bsbball66","10","0","3","16 July 2011"," Some added scenes but it can't be exactly like the book
","The final film was perfect to end it all off. Some key moments that were a lot like the book were the ending of Harry's talk with dumbledor where dumbledor said if it's in your head that doesn't mean it's not real, when Harry gets the resurrection stone, when he gives himself up to voldemort, when Snape is dying, and the way that Harry sees that lupin and tonks are dead. Some things that were added to the film were, that Harry jumped off a bridge clutching voldemort, the way that Bellatrix died, the chamber of secrets showing, the extra time added on to killing nagini, and McGonnagal casting her spell and loving doing that. Some people think that this film is bad because it adds parts and skips out parts from the book, however what we need to remember is that we don't want to pay 20 dollars to see a movie or buy a movie that we already know everything about."

","When Lord Voldemort appears at the beginning of the film, we know this movie will be different and it is. There is more action, more sacrifice and a feeling of completion that Part One didn't have. Once again the burden is on Harry Potter and he rises to the occasion, but at what cost? I think that movie goers who have not read the book, may enjoy the film even more than those who have read the book. The surprises that lay ahead and the complexity of certain characters will keep you on the edge of your seat. The epic journey that is Harry Potter's life has reached it's final climax and is pure movie magic. This is not to be missed!"

","A fitting finale to an adored series!!.....<br/><br/>I have been forced to write my first ever review and that too here on an IMDb(not that anybody was dying for it :P)...a lazy guy like me..such is the power and awe of this motion picture!..<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly hallows-Part 2 is one of those rare films you'll ever see that marries awesome action,jaw-dropping special effects with a heart-wrenching soul and the profoundness of the universal truth of good over evil,humanity,love,friendship and sacrifice.<br/><br/>Yates' final film of the series..not to mention last Potter film ever..(now never say never!)..is a roller coaster ride in every sense!...from the emotional scale of our beloved characters..to the challenges they undertake...to the evolution of the storyline..its secrets..truths..and lies..to the emotions we experience..as an audience.<br/><br/>Everybody knows the story..so i'll not effort in that direction. Daniel here plays his part(of harry of course)..with a maturity of a man grown older than his years(Clearly !) and shows a steeliness resolve and vulnerability of Harry unlike in any of the previous films.What i like especially of his performance here is the doze of believability and commonness of good he provides to his Uncommonly Hero of a character.<br/><br/>While the audience knows every page,word and hell....shred of the novel,story..Yates masterly portrays the story with such visual splendor and emotional depth that you are surprised and feel yourself shaking in those harrow,moving moments.<br/><br/>Rupert(Ron) and Emma(Hermione) both play their respective parts perfectly,especially Emma(she makes you cry more than one time..) and Neville too gets his moment in the sunshine..finally..and boy! he shines...so Matthew Lewis also delivers in that regard.<br/><br/>Tom Felton meanwhile plays his conscience-challenged character with such haunting and simmering quietness that you can't help but feel for Draco!<br/><br/>Romances are believable and heart-touching with the exception of Harry-Ginny..the principle one..that i felt the filmmakers failed to exploit the gravity of..! (This is my only quibble with the movie!!)<br/><br/>But none of all this makes Harry Potter such a persistently awesome experience until you count the Cast of the legendary British thespians..<br/><br/>Ralph Fiennes (Voldemort) is exceptional..conveying the kind of ethereal evil..beyond redemption..that is Voldemort with the nuances of the mad-transformation he goes through not just in the film(when Harry starts destroying bits of his soul!) but throughout the series!<br/><br/>Maggie Smith(Prof. Minerva McGonagall) tugs at your heart..when she says,""Its good too see you ,Harry"" and makes you laugh with teary joy when she says,""I always wanted to do that Spell!!"" and Hogwarts comes alive!!<br/><br/>Micheal Gambon(Albus Dumbledore) is his usual brilliant self in that ethereal,surreal sequence with Daniel(Harry).<br/><br/>But the Star of the thespian cast is undoubtedly Alan Rickman (Severus Snape). His performance is so exquisite and heart-wrenching that i feel that he should definitely get a nomination for best supporting actor come this years Academy Awards.<br/><br/>This films provides closure to all the subplots and secrets and mini-stories and doesn't leave any thread hanging out loose.As so it provides a perfect closure to us,the fans,too....if that's possible...from this adored series of stories,movies of a generation."

The effects at Gringots scene were awesome and the way it was filmed was astonishing. They were many scenes, when I was like : wow!... The scenes at Hogwarts, with Minerva's battle with Snape and then the protection of the castle were very thrilling and the background music would make you say: oh my god! how did they do that?. The battles? EPIC! The death-scenes? I WAS CRYING AT THE WHOLE TIME! All the scenes were similar to the book and for the first time Minerva, molly and Nevil fought as real wizards... The Pensieve scene (my favorite one) really touched me and made me cry and the music & effects made it even better! The epilogue was really good, with John Williams' theme at the background...<br/><br/>the ""--"" of the movie:<br/><br/>There were many bad things that annoyed (only because I had read the book). First of all, the Shell cottage scenes were short, and the Gringots one. Generally speaking, the whole movie was short (only 1:57 hours - the other hp movies are 2:30 each) and many parts from the book (which I think were really important) were cut... The epilogue was kind disappointing, because everyone at the cinema were laughing with the actors' transformations...

But let me tell you that this movie was my favorite over all, specially because they made it in a way that there was action during the whole movie, and it stayed confident to the book in most ways. The way Snapes dead was played was dramatic and tense and i loved that!Also one of my favorite parts was when Molly Weasley killed Bellatrix, it felt intense and you can actually feel the fury she fights her just to defend her daughter.

The worst thing about the whole movie is they didn't end the movie (Voldemort dying) the way the book did. In the movie, he just flaked away when he died and no one saw him die. In the book, if i remember right, everyone saw that his own killing curse rebounded and hit him. THats not what happened in the movie. Also, in the epilogue, you could tell the actors only had a cheap amount of makeup put on because they only looked about a year older than they were minutes before (in the movie). But otherwise this movie was extremely exceptional in all perspectives! everything was made and set out well, and i even believe this was the funniest movie out of all 8!

","I do wish everyone would stop comparing the Harry Potter movies with the Harry Potter books!! This has been going on as long as they have been making the movies and I am sick of it. I never read any of the books and therefore went into the first movie with an open mind. I saw the final film today, and I must say, the complete saga of Harry Potter and his adventures has been thrilling, exciting, rollicking adventure and one of the best book to movie series that I have ever seen. For me, the phrase ""based on the book by J.K. Rowling"" does not mean that I am going to see a page by page representation of the book on the screen. Even if I had read the book, I would not expect such an adaptation. It just can't be done. They've been trashing Ian Fleming's James Bond books for decades now, and still, millions of people are rabid fans of the character of James Bond. Lines go around the block when the latest James Bond film appears at the local cinema. Yet, there hasn't been a Bond film that actually followed a Fleming original story in years! Those of you who have an issue with the movies should accept the fact that the books stand on their own, but so do the movies. The script writers worked with the material they had, along with input from the author and the time constraints that they were given by the studio. Under these conditions, they made the best set of movies possible. Everything in a book cannot possibly appear in a film, and if your favorite scene is missing, then I suggest that you go back and re-read the book so that you can capture the scene as J.K. Rowling envisioned it. Even if J.K. Rowling had written the scripts for each of the movies, do I believe that everything from the books would have made it onto the screen. A movie - based on a book - will always be a compressed, rewritten version of the original source material. This is the way it has been for over 50 years, and the way that it will continue for long into the 21st century!"

","Let me begin this review by saying that I'm a huge Potter Fan, I have all of the books and movies, I've enjoyed them all even if the movies do make changes to the books. But I have to say this film was the closest one to the book, it still made some changes to the material but as far as I'm concerned these changes were not that big, unlike the previous films in the series, fans of the book should enjoy this film as much as the non fans will. The film is quite short, the shortest of the series, running for about two hours and ten minutes.. But this also happens to be the best film in the series, the acting of the main lead actors has improved a lot since the first film which came out ten years ago, out of all three I have to say Daniel Radcliff is the best of the group, he delivers his line in such a perfect way, this is not to say the other two actors are not great, because they are in their own way. But as good as they are, they are no match for Alan Rickman who play's Snape with such an ease, Rickman is truly Snape I cannot picture anyone playing but Rickman, and you'll see why if you go and see this film, his acting has always been great in the films but in this one he really delivers a truly developed character that you feel for, even if you happen to hate Snape. All of the other supporting actors are all great as well, but I had to mention the three main leads and Alan Rickman because they all steal the show, especially Rickman. As far as the story goes, this is the best of them all because the story is much more developed this time around, the stakes are high and you can just feel it. There's so much happening in the movie that you can hardly breath, not that this is a bad thing because it's a wonderful thing, the characters are even more developed this time around and it shows because you start to care for all of them even the characters that don't really matter to the story, they are all developed in their own way. The only problem I have with the movie is the battle it's a little short but this is only a minor problem and it does not stop the movie from being perfect in my option, I hope you guys enjoyed my review for the film, and I hope you enjoy the movie as much as I did, thank you for taking time out of your day to read this."
"troestrup","10","0","1","16 July 2011"," Wow...Fantastic ending on one of the greatest sagas ever!
","I was at the premiere in Denmark today (the 13th of July) and I simply do not know where to start, probably because I got a lot of thoughts and emotions running through my head and veins right now..At 02.45 am. (Excactly 2 hours and 45 minutes after the first midnight premiere of Harry Potter and the deathly Hallows part 2 started.) But let me begin with the size of this saga. From when the first Harry Potter book was released in 1997 (ever since I was a small boy at the age of 4) the Harry Potter-universe has just grown bigger and bigger. The effects have become more and more fascinating and exclusive, the mysteries and riddles have become numerous and besides of that our dear characters (naturally) have become older, smarter and (I can say this because I'm a male)some girls even got real women. And really beautiful ones as well. Now what I am trying to say is that Harry Potter has been a gigantic part of my life. (Not many sagas can say they have lasted for 14 years.) The Harry Potter series has always reflected my life in another world. A magic world. This was the place where I could be when I needed to dream myself away from our world's struggles. And I am not even shy to say that I even have (in my Harry Potter-trance-dreaming) been in love with Hermine Granger (Emma Watson), and realizing the truth wasn't easy for me in that age, so I always felt like I was stuck here in Denmark...I just couldn't get over there..To: London! Now that I am 18 years old, an adult, I know that it has always been a dream. But a very good dream :) So I still (especially now after this last movie) for some reason feel the burning desire to get up in the air and fly above London..And even above every capital city in the world. Because that's how huge the Harry Potter series is. Imagine EVERY SINGLE capital city of the world seen from above in ONE place (and then even at night with all the beautiful lights on.) Then you understand the size of the Harry Potter series when I watch it. (I hope it isn't too difficult to follow me.) So if there is anyone out there who feels kind of the same crazy addiction to the Harry Potter series, then PLEASE respond to me, invite me to your group or whatever you have...Because I really need to share the immortal Harry Potter series with somebody. Especially after this spectacular ending for which I thank the producers, directors, actors, actresses and the entire rest of the crew from all my heart. It really means a lot to me. It always did.<br/><br/>I hope my thoughts there above should be enough to get others to watch the movie, cause it is really a MASTERPIECE...But of course I also want to say some more concrete words about it. (I hopefully do it without spoilers, I will try:)<br/><br/>The more I think about this movie, the LESS negative elements I find. You see, the only negative element (which does not affect the amount of stars by the way) is actually something in the ending even though I am not really sure actually if it is negative...Maybe I was just affected by some stupidly laughing girls behind me when I watched it that gave me a bit of a wrong angle. Even though they did not succeed (those girls!), because I WILL watch it again next Sunday together with my family, and then I might even get a closer look at the ending, although I don't think it was that bad at all. Quite the opposite actually: It was right tailor-made out of the book, so here it succeeds in all ways. Now I've been reading a few negative comments saying that a lot of the story misses. I don't think that's quite true. You see, the main moves of the book are also with in the movie. These people obviously don't know how hard it is to make a movie, and they just overlook how brilliant work every single helper on this film has done. At last it has to be said that the story (at some points) went a little fast, but I think this did catch up again by short breathing moments to give the important scenes an outline.<br/><br/>So all in all I can only say thanks again for this great MASTERPIECE of a movie and I certainly hope that we'll see more of all the actors, actresses and crew in the future. (Despite the fact that some of them :) he he...Really don't need to work anymore. But I certainly hope they will, cause it would be a shame not to see more of these brilliant people.)"

","*WARNING* If you haven't read the book and/or seen the movie, DON""T READ THIS REVIEW. *WARNING*<br/><br/>I just got back from an opening day showing of this movie. Read the title. This movie is great. No, it's amazing. No, it's epic. Heck, it's all three! Let me say that, as a general rule, I enjoy the HP books a LOT more than the movies. That rule applies more to some movies than others (I am not a fan of the movie version of OOTP, to say the least). However, this movie is the only HP movie to be recognized by me as an excellent movie that lives up (almost) completely to the book, and actually surpasses it occasionally! The amazing thing about this movie to me is it blends breathtaking action sequences with heart-wrenching emotion. For example, there is a 45 minute period towards the end of the film during which I almost cried several times. The highlight of this is Snape's back-story. During this scene, they take most of the key parts from that part in the book. However, towards the later half of it, they gradually show footage of Snape walking through the Potter's house after James and Lily die. When he finds Lily's body he actually breaks down. At the very end, there is one shot of Snape holding Lily's dead body and bawling his eyes out which maybe the most emotional shot in the whole series. Another thing that the movie does right is that it captures the epicness of the situation that Harry is in just like the book does. When Harry is in Hogwarts and he (slight spoiler) reveals to Snape that he is there, everyone gasps and they gain hope. Everyone is looking to Harry to guide them. It just made me think of the first movie/book when Harry was a little kid and he was actually getting made fun of. Lastly, this movie, along with last year's Toy Story 3, should be the prime example of how to end a franchise on the right note. I can't stress this enough. It packs so much emotion and action into the 2 hours and 10 minutes, and you can't leave the theater disappointed. It gives you everything you wanted and more. As everything wraps up, it finally hits you- this is it. As the poster said, it all ended. This movie, to me, symbolized the end of my childhood, similarly to how the more recent movies have symbolized the same for the main characters. As a standalone movie, this movie is perfect. However, having read the book, I have to point out certain things. For example, they kind of forget about Dumbledore's back-story and Harry's wand. Also, they add a little humor, a teeny bit of which is kind of unneeded. However, this movie is still the best movie of '11 so far, with Super 8 in a very close second.<br/><br/>They've saved the best for last. 9.6/10"

","Harry Potter has been a tremendous film series spanning a decade, and it seems like we have grown up along with the characters in these films. They all do a fantastic job, especially the big three who have learned so much over time. But how could they not sharing the screen with the likes of Richard Harris, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman etc.<br/><br/>The series, for the most part, has stayed true to the books. Obviously things had to be cut out because there was no way possible they can fit every little detail of the books into the movie. However, in part 1 I was upset with leaving out Kreacher's Tale, and now in the 2nd movie the whole ending sequence left me baffled, as to why they changed it. In the book we had Grawp and house elves attacking, but there was really none of that, and Neville kills the snake right away, not when it's about to kill Ron and Hermione. But my favorite part of that last battle was Molly's duel with Bellatrix, but that scene left a lot to be desired, as there was really no build up, but at least Molly got to say her line. Ugh. All in all, it was still a very good movie, but in the end this battle sequence left a lot to be desired.<br/><br/>The Prince's Tale though was about as great as I was hoping for along with the Resurrection Stone scene, as both of those parts were full of emotion, mostly due to Alan Rickman's acting. He has always done the best in these movies.<br/><br/>The books were better of course, but the movies were entertaining to watch, and I guess I probably couldn't imagine a much better series, but I would have liked to see them a little closer to the books."
"wyattwooten","Null","0","1","16 July 2011"," Excellent end to the series.
","I can't believe we have been watching these movies for 10 years. I watched the movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. It was action-packed and buttoned up everything nicely. I was surprised at how well the pensieve scene wrapped up everything in the series and prepared us for the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I have enjoyed watching these movies. However, I personally have grown tired of watching all the gloom in these final movies. Perhaps that was from empathizing with Harry as he goes through everything. I must admit that I haven't read all the books. I haven't completed year 6 and haven't read year 7 at all. So as far as comparisons with the books I can't say anything about that.<br/><br/>If you have watched all the other movies, then you will be happy with this final installment. If you haven't, you must live under a rock if you haven't, you will definitely want to catch up before going to see this one."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","0","2","16 July 2011"," Gives meaning to the phrase, save the best until last
","I have enjoyed all the films and love the books, and after how much I loved Deathly Hallows Part 1 this entry, continuing from exactly where the previous film left off, had a lot to live up to. It is less faithful to the mammoth but very interesting and wonderful book than its predecessor. However I found this, apart from one or two disjointed parts where you could tell that details had been left out and the arrival in Hogsmede and the duel between Mrs Weasley and Bellatrix seemed a little rushed, had more flow, was better paced and had more coherent storytelling and less of admiring the scenery than the previous entries.<br/><br/>What stood out for me was not only the darkness of it, particularly the last thirty minutes or so which was a tad anti-climatic but very intense too and also Snape's death, but also the emotional impact. Gringotts(especially for the effects, the dragon being the standout), the moving Ressurrection stone sequence and Harry's final scene with Dumbedore were very well done, but my favourite was the Snape's memory sequence, which was beautifully done and quite poignant. Not only that, it's my favourite Harry Potter scene alongside the Three Brothers animated sequence and the Cave Scene. The 19 Years Later scene was quite affectionate as well, with the use of the original music and all.<br/><br/>Once again, the production values are impeccable. The effects, apart from the odd ropey one in the Room of Requirement scene and Bellatrix's death, are excellent particularly at Gringotts, while the scenery and cinematography are magical with a touch of austerity too, and David Yates delivers his best directing job. There's also my favourite of Alexandre Desplat's scores, I loved his ones for Girl with a Pearl Earring and The King's Speech, the score was also one of the few good points about Twilight:New Moon and I found his score for the previous part very effective. What I loved though about this score was not just how beautiful, haunting and how incredibly melancholic it was, but also how much it enhanced the drama.<br/><br/>The script is very good a vast majority of the time, doing a noble attempt to stick to the spirit of the book. The humour is less stilted and corny than I can find it to be, and when the tone is tense and poignant the writing does an above decent job reflecting that. The pacing is never dull, if deliberately less rushed(Goblet of Fire) or glacial(Deathly Hallows Part 1) as some of the other entries, and the storytelling is always interesting and compelling while never convoluted.<br/><br/>The acting is very good. Rupert Grint is great as he consistently is, Emma Watson while not quite as good as she was in Deathly Hallows Part 1 gives one of her better performances of the series, Maggie Smith and John Hurt are always good value and while I didn't find him easy to warm to at first until Half-Blood Prince in his brief but relevant appearance Michael Gambon is also good. Helena Bonham-Carter, David Thewlis, Gary Oldman, Robbie Coltrane and Tom Felton while neither are at their best here bring a pleasing sheen to the film. Three actors in particular I found stood out and gave their best performances of the series. One is Daniel Radcliffe, at first I found him likable yet wooden with some questionable delivery, however overtime I think he's grown with more emotional range than usual. Two is Alan Rickman, while I have considered him one of the more consistent actors of this series him and the character of Snape really shine here, Rickman is especially good in the Snape's memory sequence. Three is Ralph Fiennes, I think it helps that like Snape Voldemort is given more scope here, that said Fiennes is appropriately sinister in the role and certainly looks the part.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a wonderful film and for me the best of the series. And I still stand by my initial feeling that it was better filming the book as two movies, it would've have felt far too rushed as one. 9/10 Bethany Cox"

","From the first moments as the music beings to the final credits, this film lost not time in engaging, tying up all the loose ends, bringing a tear into the eye (more than just Snape) and answering questions that the book sorely lacked. Screenwriters captured the highest points of this film, showing that Harry was the hero he was born and bred to be. Every character supported him, kept his spirits up, and filled their special effects magic with eye-popping cinematography. <br/><br/>The IMAX 3-D is not to be missed, the audience is totally immersed inside the hallowed halls of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>Run don't walk to take a seat in your local Imax. <br/><br/>Haven't been this enthused about a flick, since the chariot race scenes in Ben Hur....and Harry Potter beats that, because the ""race"" goes the entire 2 hours. You leave the film feeling like you were there, standing next to all the actors, living their experiences yourself.<br/><br/>This is a definite don't-miss!!!"
"dy158","8","0","2","16 July 2011"," Ending with how I liked
","It brought me back to how it all started. To how I come to be a Harry Potter fan by reading the books as well after watching the first film. The theme music from the first film which was played when the credits rolled in was a reminder of the more innocent times, of how like many in the fandom, we have come to grow together with the characters. But there has to come a time where the series has to end.<br/><br/>The film continues where it left off in the first part of the final instalment of the series, after the burial of the elf Doby. In what would become a theme for throughout the film until the aftermath of the grand battle of Hogwarts, the solemn marching of the Hogwarts students in the school compound before the start of the film would become the embodiment of how much the wizarding world has changed. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) and his determination to search for the remaining Horcruxes apart from those which were already destroyed in the first part of the final instalment, and Lord Voldermort's (Ralph Finnes) ever-determination to finish Harry off by himself.<br/><br/>After burying Doby, Harry Potter manages to convince Griphook (Warwick Davies) of breaking into Bellatrix Lestrange's vault at Gringotts after Griphook was convinced that he would get the sword of Gryffindor in return. Harry believes that a Horcrux lies in Bellatrix's vault, which would turn out to be Helga Hufflepuff's (who was one of the four Hogwarts founders) Cup. He then turned to Ollivander the wand maker, whom was also being rescued from Malfoy Manor from the first part of the final instalment, to identify the two wands that they took from there which Ollivander (John Hurt) later explained belonging to Bellatrix and Draco Malfoy, but Malfoy's wand has changed its allegiance.<br/><br/>Using the Polyjuice Potion to disguise herself as Bellatrix with Ron being disguised as a random wizard and with Harry and Griphook who are under Harry's Invisibility Cloak, they managed to breach the security at Gringotts. They nearly did not get to Bellatrix's vault, but with the help of the Imperius Curse, they managed to get to the carts and onto the vault. After Harry managed to retrieve Hufflepuff's Cup, Griphook took the sword and turned his back on the trio, with the trio fled by jumping onto the back of the dragon which was guarding the vaults earlier. During the escape, Lord Voldermort manages to enter Harry's mind and has been learning that his Horcruxes have been discovered and destroyed. At the same time in the vision, Harry saw that the next Horcrux he needs to find and destroy is in Hogwarts itself and it belongs to another of Hogwarts founders in Rowena Ravenclaw.<br/><br/>When the trio arrived at Hogsmade, they were nearly being found out. But it was the owner in Abeforth Dumbledore (Ciarán Hinds), who is the younger brother of the late Albus Dumbledore, saved them. He had seemed to lose all hope in fighting Lord Voldermort, but Harry manages to change Abeforth's mind in letting them reaching Hogwarts so that they may be able to find the Horcrux. Abeforth instructed the portrait of his younger sister Ariana (Hebe Beardsall) to find Neville Longbottom who leads the trio back to Hogwarts. But Harry's Hogwarts return would eventually be found out by the new Hogwarts Headmaster in Severus Snape (Alan Rickman).<br/><br/>For those who have stuck with Harry and his friends since the very beginning (that means people like me), there are reminders of the past in the second part of the final instalment. The most evident is Hogwarts itself. It is a time when the wizarding world knows where their loyalty lies in the Battle of Hogwarts, a time when Neville Longbottom has really come onto his own. But even despite the gloomy theme which happens throughout most of the film which was expected, there are still spaces of moments which stand out for me. Harry's confrontation with Snape at the Great Hall, the duel between Professor Minerva McGonagall (Maggie Smith) and Snape, and probably the most heart-warming moment for me came during when Harry was looking at Snape's memories in the Pensieve, (the untold story of) Snape's unrequited love for Harry's mother Lily which was shown especially after she sacrificed herself to save her then-one-year-old son.<br/><br/>A fitting ending to the series, bringing an end to which the neutrals should like where the good triumphs over evil. Even if I don't review it as a Harry Potter fan who first got onto the fandom after watching the first film, it is an ending which I still do like."
"Reel_starz","8","0","1","16 July 2011"," The Boy Who Lived casts his final spell
","How do you review a movie that, for many in a certain generation - my generation - marks the end of an era, that represents the last chapter in a story that defined their childhood and youth? From the moment Harry Potter first stepped on the now-iconic Platform 9 3/4, his adventures became theirs; they laughed, cried and cheered with him, delighting in his world of magic, wonder and danger.<br/><br/>A personal, emotional connection to the world and franchise of Harry Potter seems to have such an integral correlation to one's enjoyment of this movie that I feel obligated to lay out where I stand before diving head-first into my review. My love affair with Harry Potter, which lasted from book one to five, deteriorated with the sixth installment, one I still find to be self-indulgent and, frankly, rather unnecessary. The movies, while mostly enjoyable, have often felt more like rote adaptations than fully fleshed-out, living, breathing works in their own right.<br/><br/>That said, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows – Part 2 is the best of the series. It doesn't approach the greatness of The Lord of the Rings, that fantasy saga to which all others are inevitably compared, but it's still a well-executed, satisfying conclusion.<br/><br/>Credit must first be given to the producers and director David Yates. The Harry Potter series has become the most successful franchise in movie history, surpassing such legends as Bond and Star Wars, and the film-makers could have easily taken the lazy route, phoned it in without regard to quality (see: Twilight, or rather, don't). The money would've flooded in either way. Instead, Yates and his coworkers put genuine effort into producing films the series' fans deserved. They injected the Deathly Hallows, both Part 1 and 2, with artistry and passion that were often absent from previous movies. You can sense they'd finally, fully realized that ""bringing the books to life"" means more than just following the words on the page; it means merging the author's vision with your own, being unafraid to add creative flourishes and, when necessary, changes.<br/><br/>The movie begins on a rather rocky slope. Because this is a continuation of the previous film, we're immediately thrown into the thick of things, and there's no real opening to help the audience adjust. In fact, Deathly Hallows might work best if you watch the two parts back-to-back. However, once our heroes return to Hogwarts for the epic battle that fills the majority of run-time, the movie picks up and settles into a comfortable rhythm. To enrich the story's inherent action, suspense and drama, Yates utilizes all tools at his disposal: state-of-the-art special effects, painstakingly manufactured sets, smart usage of color and style in his cinematography. Though Alexandre Desplat's score sometimes veers into melodrama (John Williams is sorely missed, though his classic theme does pop up) and the aging process used for a 19-years-later epilogue is dubious, the technical elements largely come together with ease.<br/><br/>However, what truly makes this movie work, the secret charm behind the franchise's success, is the cast. The love every actor, young or old, has for his or her character shines through. It's been a running joke that every veteran British actor worth his salt has appeared in at least one Harry Potter movie. While that isn't necessarily true, it's hard not to marvel at how many greats the series has attracted: Emma Thompson, Brendan Gleeson, Gary Oldman, Kenneth Branaugh, etc. Even more impressively, where many A-listers might've just sleepwalked their way to an easy paycheck, these actors treat their roles with the same care and devotion they would've given any Oscar-bait drama or Shakespearean play. Maggie Grace embodies Professor McGonagall's stately dignity, while Ralph Fiennes and Helena Bonham Carter bite into their parts with sadistic, scenery-chewing glee. Yet, no one stands out more than Alan Rickman, who has played Professor Severus Snape, always one of Rowling's most interesting and complex characters, for the past decade to oily perfection; occasionally, Rickman relishes the former potions professor's signature line delivery almost too much. Still, the tragic scene when Snape's motivations are finally explained is, for me at least, the best in the movie.<br/><br/>But the films' stars have always been those portraying its three central protagonists: Rupert Grint, Emma Watson and Daniel Radcliffe. All I can say is, wow. What a joy it has been to watch them grow up and mature from baby-faced, bright-eyed kids who, according to original director Chris Columbus, could barely get through two lines of dialogue to intelligent, nuanced adults more than capable of holding their own beside their more experienced costars. That they did it all without encountering the woes that befall many of their peers is all the more remarkable. In this outing, Grint and Watson are significantly and unfortunately sidelined in favor of characters like Neville and Luna, neither of whom I ever cared for, but they make the most of what they have. Naturally, the spotlight falls most on Daniel Radcliffe. Of the three, he has had the most detractors, criticized as bland and wooden. That may, at one point, have been true, but here, he acquits himself admirably. Faced with the most challenging scenes he's ever been given as Harry Potter, Radcliffe dives in fearlessly and successfully brings out Harry's virtues, foibles and internal struggles.<br/><br/>This movie has its flaws, most of which were also issues in the book and, if listed out, probably seem nitpicky on my part, but overall, it is a triumph. It may never receive the respect and accolades of awards giants, who still seem to regard the films as silly, kids' blockbuster trifles not worthy of their attention beyond a couple of tech nominations, but its cultural impact, not to mention the box office returns, is an, arguably, more valuable reward. To our three main stars, I wish all the luck, success and happiness in the world. They've earned it."

","This final entry in the Harry Potter series ties up all of the loose ends in a grand style that is both rousing and triumphant. I haven't had this much fun at the movies since I was a kid, credit that to the magnificent characters and stories created by J.K. Rowling. Also script writer Steve Kloves is able to mesh the most important plot points into a tight storyline that is suspenseful, thrilling and very moving.<br/><br/>This final installment is by far the darkest in the series and director David Yates has created dozens of powerful images throughout this film. He sets the stage with a wonderful shot of Severus Snape leering from a parapet high above Hogwarts, an eerie prelude to the high adventure and drama lying ahead.<br/><br/>The acting once again is top rate as the cast is chock full of some of the finest British character actors. Several newcomers deliver particularly strong performances Ciaran Hinds as Abeforth Dumbledore and Kelly Macdonald as Helena Ravenclaw command the screen in captivating fashion.<br/><br/>There are several laughs along the way to ease the tension, Ron Weasley provides a chuckle or two but, this film belongs to Harry. Daniel Radcliffe has emerged from this series of films with some serious acting chops and his powerful performance here is certainly Oscar worthy. Alan Rickman is haunting and very memorable as Severus Snape. Ralph Fiennes bubbles with delicious wickedness and an evil hissing whisper that will curl your toes.<br/><br/>Some critics have argued the film is too short, I disagree. I found The Deathly Hallows part 2 to be highly enjoyable and compact storytelling that whisks the viewer into a magical world and cleverly and carefully sums it all up. This is movie-making at its finest, a team of highly talented professionals creating a thoroughly entertaining movie for now and for the ages."

","When the first Harry Potter book came out the 30th June 1997, no one not even JK Rowling herself could have predicted the storm that would follow as millions of people of all ages from the young to the elderly fell in love with the fictional character of Harry Potter along with Ron, Hermione and all the other characters throughout the seven book series. Told in books, played through computer games and now turned into movies with websites, forums and fan clubs based on ""the boy who lived,"" Harry Potter has become an iconic symbol of British/world culture with the values of trust, honesty, friendship, love and courage lots of human beings show everyday. The character has been and will continue to enrich all our lives for pure enjoyment for generations to come as well as being a terrific role model for younger kids.<br/><br/>Part I of the Deathly Hallows was brilliant at conveying the burden and isolation Harry, Ron and Hermione felt. Part II promises heart stopping action on an epic scale and it delivers. We see the trio try and find and destroy the remainder of Voldemort's Horcruxes as they break into Gringotts and Hogwarts where battle takes place with student/teachers against Voldemort's army of Death Eaters, Trolls and Spiders. The acting is brilliant all round as everyone gets their moment to shine like Maggie Smith as McGonagall, Gary Lewis as Neville Longbottom and Julie Walters as Molly Weasley. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson pull off their best performances since the beginning of the franchise. But it's Radcliffe who I think steals the film with his most believable performance yet. All three deserve to go on to more things with their acting career as they truly deserve it from learning to adapt and grow from film to film with their acting. However the other stars cannot be ignored with Ralph Fiennes being truly menacing as Voldemort who gets more screen time, Alan Rickman as Snape, Helen Boham Carter as Bellatrix, Micheal Gambon as Dumbledore and Gary Oldman as Sirius amongst other actors all get their moments to shine.<br/><br/>The special effects are better than ever with a truly realistic dragon at Gringotts and the design set pieces of Diagon Alley, Gringotts and Hogwarts. It was also quite good in 3D, which was very well implemented. The script as well had it's sharp moments producing some comic bits when Herminone tries to act like Bellatrix at Gringotts and some heartfelt moments when Fred and Lupin and Tonks die. This brings me on to the action, which truly is spectacular and choreographed superbly on a massive scale. The best bits of the fight and most exciting though being when Harry and Voldemort face each other after the forest and when Ron, Hermione and Neville conspire together to kill Nagini. <br/><br/>The narrative as well by Steve Knowles is held together quite well as the important story strands are tied beautifully into the conclusion. Of course it still is a bit patchy from previous films and the editing is a bit choppy like Molly Weasley amongst other characters suddenly appear out of Hogwarts from nowhere and some of the last battle sequence for a small part it is a bit hard to make out what is happening on the screen. But this is only a small gripe compared to it's overall achievement as I liked the part of Snape's memories, which was well done and the last sequence of nineteen years later when Harry, Ron, Hermione and Ginny have grown up with their children bought a tear to my eye as it is really quite beautifully done. <br/><br/>This film is the best of the lot and truly does justice to the books and ends a much loved and will be missed franchise that has entranced millions. Thank you JK Rowling and all the actors and directors of all the film particularly David Yates for the last three films (and superbly directed this last part) for giving us many wonderful years of enjoyment and entertainment. Harry Potter is a legacy that will be passed on through telling of the stories and watching the films as generations to come will immerse themselves in the world of Harry and Hogwarts. To that I say farewell to Harry and all. These characters will all be greatly missed by lots of people including me."

Fortunately, it is a great film, ending the series on a high note. The pacing of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2 is fast, meaning action happens almost non-stop. Watching Harry Potter and the other wizards in Hogwarts in dire danger from Voldemont is very engaging. The special effects are very smooth and realistic, and one can only be marvelled by the complexity of the special effects in the battle scene. The only complaint I have is the underwhelming 3D effects. In most scene the 3D is barely noticeable, and there is only one scene involving fragments scattering in the sky that the 3D is spectacular.

","THE EPIC has finally arrived.<br/><br/>It is a film is shocking, touching and gorgeous. So I trust that will receive nominations and awards it deserves. And I say ""I trust"" because I fear that ultimately it is not. In the juries of the prestigious awards always occasional stuffy academic who thinks that action films with special effects deserve only technical awards (photography, special effects, makeup ...). Then there are the popular awards where the public can vote, but there are too many girls with hormones to lose their heads dislocated by fangs and a naked torso. I know that our comments that some are afraid that the good reviews make us believe exaggerated expectations which lead to a huge disappointment after seeing the film. To you I say, in my humble opinion, this is the best film of the saga and one of the best movies I've seen in a long time. Others walk a little angry that many scenes have been leaked and I thought I had seen the movie almost complete. Well, I can tell you have not seen anything ... The first thing I will be interpretations favorably surprised. I've read somewhere criticism from professional critics in a totally different, but they have their opinion and I mine. Certainly not for anything I recommend a movie with professional critics. After the film, have remained cool as the breath of a Dementor, and then they said to one another in whispers that they liked the movie.<br/><br/>The leading trio curdles his best performance, and Daniel is fabulous. As for the side, Maggie Smith and Matthew Lewis literally eat the screen every time they appear. No need for me to say, but what good is Helena Bonham Carter! When does Hermione, Emma seems to have taken possession of his body. And Alan Rickman ... well, his performance is masterful. It would be a crime that did not receive the recognition he deserves for his performance in this film. There's a scene in which Snape invented visits the house of Godric's Hollow after the attack of Voldemort ... No Kleenex in the world able to wipe many tears ...<br/><br/>The soundtrack is the best in the series, with a winning combination of new songs with the classic and magical Hedwig's theme. Unlike the first part, the editing is good (finally!). The photography and special effects are excellent, but the rapid pace at which advances the action and force of argument make do not look too much. There were times I thought being swallowed by the dragon burned by the fire in the Room of Requirement, or that my soul was going to be snatched by a Dementor. Although there has been a good experience.<br/><br/>The argument is quite faithful to Rowling's text, although they sacrifice stories like Dumbledore's family. With respect to licenses that takes the writer on the book, I think you will like. These are things that Rowling did not write, but I could have written that could have happened in this fictional universe. I'll talk more about them when everyone has seen the film. The future I am a couple of characters takes a different tack in the film. There are a couple surprises, a couple that many will like. I like it, of course.<br/><br/>For a long time I thought that if they dared to retractable my favorite of the series (""I will join you when hell freezes over. Dumbledore's Army""), screenwriter and pursue the curse cruciate tortured, but I forgiven because it substitutes a very moving speech (more of a rally) Neville. I understand that the change was necessary to give spectacular final duel. And speaking of the final duel and battle, I'm not at all agree with comments like those of Philip Womack, The Telegraph, in the sense that the battle in the movie better than the book. Womack describes the battle written by Rowling as a ""damp squib"" and says the film correct ""the deficiencies of Rowling's writing."" If the last chapters were written by a damp squib Rowling, now one would be interested in seeing the film and Warner would have to hire scavengers to capture fans and forcing them to enter the theaters. And it seems that is what will happen. We must be clear that literature and film have different languages ​​and resources, and a resource that works in a book does not necessarily work on screen, and vice versa. The important thing is to convey the same feelings and emotions. For me, the book and the film are two of the best contemporary cultural products, each in its kind. I hope you enjoy the movie, scream and get excited. Rowling dedicated one of his books to his family because ""make magic"" their world. Thanks J. K. Rowling magic for making our world, for having given us this story in the lights and shadows struggling in the depths of the human soul and which shows are our decisions that shape our destiny.<br/><br/>Applaud JK Rowling, David Yates, David Heyman and Steve Kloves: BRING TO THIS WORLD OF MAGIC AS IS HARRY POTTER!<br/><br/>THANKS!<br/><br/>(As for 3D, comply at all is made in 3D See it in 3D, I have said this better in IMAX 3D format.)<br/><br/>FINAL SCORE: 10 STARS / 10.<br/><br/>OUR HARRY HAS FINALLY GRADUATED."

","Absolutely amazing finale. The narrative, visual effects, acting and the soundtrack made this an absolute classic Harry Potter film. It brought the end to the best franchise of all time.<br/><br/>Anyone who doubts the acting in this film, doesn't know anything about film. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson have deserved the plaudits and success since the very beginning. They were magnificent. Their acting in these last two instalment's brought; happiness, sadness and excitement. If I was JK Rowling, I'd be very, very proud of them. The likes of Ralph Fiennes, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter and Matthew Lewis, should have had more screen time. They were all excellent in this film. The scene with Snape dying and the scene with the memories was truly outstanding, it was very emotional and it was a real tearjerker.<br/><br/>The film picks up where the last ended. Voldemort had got his hands on the Elder Wand. The film was very faithful to the book and it was excellent. The battle of Hogwarts scene was just mind-blowing, the action was epic and was just magnificent to watch. I'm a very proud fan of the way this film was made.<br/><br/>Although I'm a massive fan of both the books and the films, I was a little bit disappointed about some things that weren't included from the book. E.g. The Ravenclaw common room scene where Harry and Luna tries to find the diadem and gets ambushed by one of the Carrow's. The scene where Fred dies, although there was the mourning scene, but it didn't really feel emotional because it was rushed and went straight into the next scene. The nineteen years later felt a bit rushed also, it was like nothing happened apart from Harry talking to Albus Severus, although some reviewers have stated that there was no chemistry there. I disagree, the dialogue in that short sequence was brilliant and the way that Daniel Radcliffe used it, pulled it off very well.<br/><br/>It sounds like I've moaned a bit about the disappointed things, but I'm just a lover of the books. Don't let this review put you off seeing it, as it is a phenomenal piece of filmmaking and is also brilliantly written. David Yates done an incredible job in making this film an epic experience.<br/><br/>Of course, without JK Rowling, none of this would have been possible. So I'd like to say a big thank you to a wonderful woman who gave me a brilliant childhood and looking forward to the next book/film. This is pure imagination by JK Rowling, thank you so much. This woman will always be remembered and the books and films will always live on."

","Harry potter and the Deathly hallows Part 2 starts off the very next second the part 1 ended. Yet somehow, everything looks a tone murkier and creepy , maybe it was the haunting music or maybe it was the 3D. But to make one thing clear the 3D here is done just right. Its not distracting but its not even Avartarisque.<br/><br/>The trio continue their journey to find the Horcruxes while the once safe heaven-Hogwarts is eventually under attack by Voldemort. The entire 2 hours runs really fast, filled with splendid action sequences and plot twists all ending in a fitting climax.<br/><br/>Radcliff , Watson and Grint give earnest performances.Most supporting characters from the previous seven films return, at least for a cameo. Its is no doubt that amongst them it its Alan Rickman as Severus Snape who stands out with his best performance till date. A flash back sequence involving him is one of the finest moments in the film that the audience will remember for a long time.<br/><br/>The only thing the movie allows us to complain about is the 'pace'. Its moves at such fast pace that you cannot help feeling that the ending seemed a tad rushed. There is not enough time to feel sad about certain deaths nor will you find time to cheer as a death eater falls. But probably its the price to pay for 3D. Too long and it might have taxed your eyes too much, to take the attention away from the plot. So the fault could easily be forgotten.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Many potter fans felt the third film was the best of the lot, but Deathly hallows part 2 easily dethrones it. Director Yates must be commended for not getting tired of the series and giving it a respectable, memorable and most of the all the most enjoyable swan song."

","This movie was almost flawless! The acting was superb (Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Helena Bonham Carter - you are gods among mere mortals) and the writing was very sharp. I for one have loved all of David Yates' HP movies and he doesn't disappoint here. The shots, the angles, the colors, the effects - a very visually appealing film.<br/><br/>I do wish we had gotten to see Fred's death on screen - the twins have always been my favorite characters so I do wish that a bit more respect had been paid. But I rather liked their little moment earlier right before the battle; I thought it was sweet and a good addition. In fact in general that's my only real problem with this film. I wanted more of all the characters, but alas I understand this would have been difficult. And I wish that Neville had killed Nagini in front of Voldemort, but he still had a defiant speech and he did eventually kill her so I'll let it slide.<br/><br/>But for me Neville, McGonagall and Snape really stole the show. And Bellatrix as always - HBC is annoyingly gorgeous and obnoxiously talented and she OWNS the screen. And the Grey Lady - she was fantastic! So creepy...<br/><br/>In general I thought this was perfect way to conclude the series that I grew up with, a realization that's a bit crushing though I count myself fortunate I got to be a part of this. Thank you JK Rowling, thank you cast and crew, thank you fans who allowed this to bloom into the phenomenon it has been - it's been a blast. And this final film - more than worthy of the Harry Potter name."

","I had the highest expectations for this movie going in. And let me tell you from the start of this review: as a fan of the books as well, I enjoyed it much more in my second viewing, because in my first I was analyzing the changes from the books continuously (and I have to add they were surprisingly many). Nonetheless, I still enjoyed it the first time, but adored it the 2nd.<br/><br/>There indeed were many changes, but a lot of them are understandable and played out on screen. That said, there were a couple of changes I'm gonna have to get used to, like Harry telling Ron and Hermione that he's about to die, or Voldemort and Bellatrix dying like smoke... Yet the movie had much more good than bad.<br/><br/>The effects were top notch and Oscar worthy, the music was beautiful, the cinematography and editing were really well done, the direction was superb... and the acting was practically flawless. The trio did an amazing job, the younger cast as well; the adult cast was amazing and Alan Rickman was just... PERFECT. I bawled my eyes out in a certain scene with him, and in many others. Ralph Fiennes did a great job too.<br/><br/>So, whilst I admit some part could've been handled better, the ending result was very satisfying: an intensely entertaining movie, with a few laughs and a lot of tears while you go through some perfectly executed scenes and some kind-of-rushed-yet-also-great-ones. An absolute must-see, and an amazing finale for the best series ever. Mischief managed!"

I loved how they had Narcissa portrayed. they showed a softer side of her and how much she loves her son. and McGonagall was amazing. she was amazing. i think there was a perfect amount of love, drama, angst, and action. and i am very pleased with the epilogue. i love who they had as the next generation kids. and i loved how they showed Draco and Astoria with Scorpius. the only thing i wish was done was a bigger scene with harry and Voldemort like in the book where harry defeats him in front of everybody. overall i loved it."

","I have just returned from a Deathly Hallows Part 2 premiere and it actually felt kind of sad knowing that it's all over. And this is definitely one of those films that are ""the best for last"". Also, everything that may have been confusing to viewers in the other films will begin to make sense in this one.<br/><br/>The plot is the same as Part 1: The trio need to find and destroy all of Voldemort's horcruxes and then kill him. Unlike Part 1, we finally get to see Hogwarts!...well despite the fact that it's in ashes... Most of the film takes place in the Battle of Hogwarts, so there's A LOT of action, which I love! Parts of the film may be really sad to die-hard Harry Potter films. There's a lot of important deaths...<br/><br/>In this film, you see a whole new side of some of the characters. For example, you finally see a soft and sensitive side of Snape. After watching this film you wont look at Snape as a tough jerk ever again. Alan Rickman was the BEST actor in this film, no argument. Ralph Fiennes was also great in this film. He really knew how to play a scared and angry Voldemort. And finally Matthew Lewis (or should I say Neville) and a really surprising role in this. He came a long way from a small wimp getting bullied to a young man standing up to the Dark Lord.<br/><br/>Do I recommend this movie? OF COURSE! So stop reading reviews, get off your lazy butt, and go watch the movie!"
"alasdair_maciver","10","0","3","16 July 2011"," A Classic
","I have enjoyed all of the films but this is the first time since Harry Potter and the Philosophers stone that I have been genuinely moved by one of them. <br/><br/>This is more than just the next or last Harry Potter film, this is head and shoulders above the quality of the rest. <br/><br/>Character development is at its best with McGonagall showing more emotion than ever, Voldemort at his most vulnerable and most arrogant, Neville turning into Rambo, and Molly Weasley also in full action mode.<br/><br/>But of course and predictably its Snape's death scene and memories which provide the most emotional and satisfying material of the films to date. <br/><br/>Alan Rickman's performance is perfect and although he has always been a great Snape, it really shows why an actor of such talent was needed for the role and he does not disappoint.<br/><br/>The changes from the book and omission of in my opinion some of the best material such as Dumbledores back-story, and the history of where the Horcruxes came from, don't matter so much this time as the tone, momentum and emotional gravitas of the film are so strong that you don't miss them. <br/><br/>Any complaints I have would be that Fred's death could have had a little more screen time and been more emotional as could Lupin and Tonks. <br/><br/>Also the scenes after Voldemorte is defeated seem to fall a little flat. I really think they should have added in the scene in the headmasters office with the portraits applauding and perhaps to have seen Snapes portrait there too. <br/><br/>However the epilogue was done very well and provided the closure we all needed for this incredible 10 years of storytelling especially by using the same music that ended the first film. <br/><br/>I should also add that a big part of the success of this movie is that the soundtrack is breathtaking. I heard the soundtrack before seeing the movie and could already tell that it was going to be powerful. Using the theme that they did for the opening credits set the mood amazingly.<br/><br/>I'm not surprised the films have never won any Oscars so far but I would be surprised if this didn't. <br/><br/>I feel the same way after seeing this movie as I did with the Dark Knight, Braveheart, Star Wars, Back to the Future, Shawshank, The Godfather, and the first Harry Potter. Affected by the movie still in the days afterwards. So by my own standards this is a classic movie."

","Yates continues to cop criticism yet i think what he has done with the movies (Deathly Hallows Part 1 & 2 especially) is amazing! Part 2 picks up right where part 1 left us, at Shell Cottage after the narrow escape from Malfoy Manor. From there on it takes us on a fast paced, action packed adventure and the visual effects that go with it are simply astounding. The movie takes you in with raw emotion aided by some terrific acting and the whole film seems to be crafted so well that it flows beautifully from start to finish. It is the proper goodbye to the series that has captivated millions and been going for 13 years strong. However, I had to take off one star due to one reason. (spoiler alert) The ending of the battle and how it had been changed from the book. Referring of course to the fight between Harry and Voldemort. I understand why it had to be changed, to make it more intense and dramatic for the cinema but i didn't care for it. <br/><br/>Aside from that, it was more than anyone could of asked for and i think it will definitely please most die-hard Harry Potter fans and the average cinema-goer. Special mention to the acting talent of Alan Rickman as Severus Snape, throughout the whole series he has been a scene-stealer and in Deathly Hallows part 2 he couldn't of done a better performance - Academy worthy in my eyes."

","Seven films have led up to this eighth film, and every film has teased what the Battle of Hogwarts now presents to us, an all-out war between Hogwarts' students and teachers, and Voldermort and his trusty death eaters.<br/><br/>The film begins with a break-in into the wizarding bank Gringotts, and Helena Bonham Carter (Bellatrix) imitates Hermione (Emma Watson) perfectly. The 3D works brilliantly as we sail thousands of feet under ground to the depths of the bank where the Lestrange vault is hidden. This is by far one of the superior action pieces of the film, including the dragon flight which shows how well 3D can work, although others, it cannot.<br/><br/>The Battle of Hogwarts was also superb. Everyone reunited and no one is holding back, and neither does it feel like David Yates was either, it doesn't seem like they were trying to make the battle too 'kiddy', because it really does show the blood and sweat that leak out of these characters.<br/><br/>For me, Maggie Smith really stood out for me, and her attack against Severus Snape was perfect, the effects were stunning.<br/><br/>The epilogue too was very touching, it had emotion, class and humour and stemmed far away from being too cheesy (which the book slightly was).<br/><br/>Overall, a brilliant finale, I shall treasure this film for a very, very long time."

Although I haven't read any of the books, or seen all the eight movies, this film was remarkably well done. <br/><br/>Except for the 3D. Watching this movie in an IMAX format was great, but since the film is mostly in a dark, shadowy setting, seeing it in the third dimension makes it look more dim.<br/><br/>Superb performances that didn't disappoint. Especially from the older members of the British acting fraternity. <br/><br/>After ten years, in this final film, the evolving maturity of the characters seemed natural, especially since all the actors have steadfastly committed themselves to the franchise, playing their characters right to the end.<br/><br/>A good mix of serious dramatic moments, action, humor and sadness.

","...and ends with a bang. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is a near-perfect movie, with jaw-dropping visual effects, spectacular acting showcase by veteran British actors, grand production design and an emotional end.<br/><br/>The film starts out where the Part One ended - Voldemort now possess the Elder's Wand, Harry and his company set out for a mission to destroy all the remaining horcruxes. The first outstanding set piece in the film is the breakout at the Gringott's Bank and a bumpy ride on a enormous Dragon (very, very well made CGI).<br/><br/>The film will make most of the fans happy and a wee bit emotional as well. The film has certainly the most critically acclaimed film of the year, and sure the film will break many box office records.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe is pretty decent as Harry (as always), Hermione and Ron don't have much to do except for supporting Harry. But the Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman stole the show - Ralph's vulnerable Voldemort is highly affecting - specially his hisses and heavy dialogs - are perfectly delivered. Rickman, although with even a with a screen time of some 10-15 minutes, gives a performance of his career. Among the others, Maggie Smith is awesome as McGonagall, Julie Walters finally gets a kick ass moment and Helena Bonham Carter, is just outstanding in the early scene where she plays Hermione.<br/><br/>The film is not flawless - specially after King's Cross scene onwards, the film feels a little rushed. The whole Elder Wand theory is not properly explained. And the final showdown feels a but anti-climatic.<br/><br/>But still, it is one of those rare films in which you have to over look the flaws - after all it is the end of a generation. Director David Yates, screenwriter Steve Kloves, production designer Stuart Craig, cinematographer Eduardo Serra, composer Alexandre Desplat and hundreds of other technicians gave the fans most fitting finale.<br/><br/>3D is a bit dim (as always), but not very bad. Still, there are some standout scenes in 3D - watch it in both 3D and 2D if you can.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 marks the end of an amazing era. I wished Jo wrote another novel.<br/><br/>10/10"
"Filmaholic78","8","0","1","16 July 2011"," Great end to a fantastic story
","I haven't read the books yet so perhaps I enjoyed this film more than true Potter Fenatics. All I can say is I'm sure they will have missed loads of the original story out but unless you are aware of whats missing the film as a whole is great. In the defence for the Director and Producers I would imagine there was just far too much to cram in to the film and some of it possibly wouldn't have translated well on to screen so this has to be forgiven. Doesn't it? Any way I have loved all the films from year 1 to year 7 and it was nice to have David Yates back to direct this one. He stuck to his guns and this second instalment carries on with the same feel as the previous few he made. I found the first films all felt slightly different and disjointed, with each director, quite rightly, putting their own spin on them however with David at the helm there is more consistency here.<br/><br/>The acting is surprising good for a change, the special effects are off the hook and the action is captured perfectly. What I will say is, and this is starting to be a common occurrence in my honest opinion, that the 3D doesn't actually add anything to the film. When you consider you pay more for the 3D experience you would expect more. It doesn't ruin the film but just doesn't do, well anything for it.<br/><br/>One last thing I will say is that if you live in Cheltenham or the Cotswolds for that matter I recommend you go and watch Harry Potter in the new screening rooms that Cineworld have opened here. It's a completely new experience for a day out at the cinema, you are greeted when you walk in, served drinks and food in the waiting area, escorted to your seats, which by the way are huge, made from leather and have a table and ice bucket, and then before the film starts have at seat service. This just added to the fun and comfort and I can't stress enough how much it made the overall experience just that bit more special. Here is the link to the Screening rooms website if your interested http://www.thescreeningrooms.co.uk <br/><br/>To sum Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows part 2 up. A great ending to a Fantstic story and it doesn't disappoint."

The surround sound really sends a shiver down your spine and makes you quite scared at some points, you'll have to find out how though!(: There's not really any sexual sort of content, it more about it being scary. And it really is quite scary. There is one use of 'b**ch' but that's pretty much the worst language you'll get.

Fiennes is perfect as the dark lord, proving that he may be one of the all time movie villains up there with Gruber and Lecter. Whenever he is on screen, there is an eerie quality to the film.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the cast, it's much of the same really, having such a huge array of stars in a film will lead to people being sidelined.

Being someone who was a big fan of the books there are some things I wish they hadn't left out or changed. I feel like they didn't do the deaths of Fred, Lupin, and Tonks justice. They simply showed each dead body for a few moments and kept on going. Another thing they left out was the centaur charge. Instead of including this heroic moment, they simply had Harry jump out of Hagrid's hands and run off...not in line with the book at all. Now hey, don't get me wrong, I know I just pointed out a few negatives but there were way more positives than negatives. The acting was great, the special effects were awesome, and you really walked out of the theater feeling a lot of closure. Everything just tied together, it was wonderful. The scene with Harry sending his children to Hogwarts was great, I was really glad they included the epilogue in the film.

"vincent_loy412","8","0","1","15 July 2011"," A Fast-Paced End to Harry Potter's Exciting Battle
","'It all ends'. The magical adventure of a young famous wizard known as Harry Potter on the big screen for over a decade has come to a conclusion . I did not read the books and so I judged the movie as an usual audience. The first part of the 'Deathly Hallows' had been released last year,and I find that the film concentrated more on character's development and getting us to warm up before the exciting final battle from this Part 2. Harry Potter and his two best friends continued to find and destroy the remaining horcruxes before finally dealing with Lord Voldemort. <br/><br/>I felt disappointed on the flow of the story. As the story in Part 1 flows in a steady manner with ample of time for Harry Potter to find the horcruxes and deal with his friends, everything gets too rushed in Part 2. Everything is squeezed into the final film which is taking only two hours. I think around 30 minutes should be added for additional depth given to certain parts of the story as stressed from the book as far as I knew from the book readers. I find myself confused for a moment where the true story behind the character of Professor Snape is revealed after he died. That part is explained too fast, and it is hard for people like us to get to understand it. <br/><br/>Professor Snape is my most favourite character in Harry Potter's films, and I think same goes to many others too. He is actually a very complicated character with not much to reveal on him, not until after so many chapters. He is indeed a good character as I have predicted from even the first film itself. In many ways, he is actually helping Harry Potter on the other side, unseen by others. Alan Rickman, portraying as the character of Snape did a fantastic job all over the eight films. More time should be given in justice for Snape whom is one of the main characters especially at the moment everything of his complicated history is shown after he died.<br/><br/>The battle at Hogwarts had taken almost half of the film and I'm glad for that. This is the main portion of the film that gets people excited and even emotional. The staffs, the members of the Order of the Phoenix and even some students are finally shown to be using their powers in defending Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. I like the part where Professor McGonagall is taking control back of the school from Snape with her magical abilities and acting as head in defense of the school. She is given very minor role in all the other films, except the first one and this final one. <br/><br/>Yes, the film succeeded in bringing the audiences into an exciting fast- paced ride through Gringotts with the goblins and dragon, through Hogwarts with all the battle with Death Eaters, and through final battle between Harry and Voldemort. Whenever a scene comes and goes, I am then saying 'What? That part is gone? A bit wasted, isn't it. That particular scene can be described even more, isn't it, for a better film with great story flow?'. And so, I find this film still lacks something, some important details which should be shown. (I don't mean the very much details from the book). Anyway, I still think this is considerably fine.<br/><br/>The acting performances by the casts, especially the main ones are getting improving after so many years dealing with their imagination in wizard world, especially Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter himself. I like the moment when he stood out and talking with Severus Snape in anger. And finally, the pair, Hermione and Ron started their love relationship and shared their first kiss in a tough time, while Ginny is still in love with Harryand it is very satisfying that their relationships are just shown in a quick manner which is sufficient enough.<br/><br/>The epilogue; 19 years later may be necessary for Harry Potter, but it is created in a way too simple and ordinary in ending the film. It would be very emotional and great if a moment where the turning-old Harry is flashing back on his childhood memories full of great obstacles while looking at his children boarding the train to Hogwarts at the 9 3/4 platform of King's Cross Station, which is invisible to muggles like us. A scene showing the rebuilt Hogwarts back to its glory and fame should also be shown in the epilogue for a captivating ending not only to the movie, but also to the whole thing of 'Harry Potter'.<br/><br/>I also find that the last words from the book which is very significant to be placed into the end of the film too. The last words are '""The scar had not pained Harry for nineteen years. All was well."" I have to mention also that the soundtrack for the film is suited well in the final film, with additional intensity or emotion added at proper moments, even though the film delivered the emotional approach not at its best. The visual and sound effects are impressive too, especially at the parts where 'Hogwarts is threatened' – a quote from Professor McGonagall. The computer generated images (CGI) effects shown in the film are just great, like the part where Snape flee away from McGonagall, Voldemort breaking the protecting barrier of Hogwarts, and Death Eaters casting their destructive spells to the school, and many others. <br/><br/>The whole franchise, the whole story, the magical world of Harry Potter would be kept forever in our hearts even all the books and movies for it ended. This final film can be considered well satisfying, beautifully created, and in some way, is a truly epic conclusion with happy ending as predicted.<br/><br/>This review is edited from my original review from my blog; www.vincentloy.wordpress.com"

","Harry Potter has taken moviegoers on quite a ride ever since the original flew into theaters 10 years ago. There's been some decent moments (Sorcerer's Stone), excellent moments (Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire), and some miserable moments (Half-Blood Prince). With the final installment, the cast and crew pulled out all the stops to try to deliver the most epic film in the entire saga. The drama, tension, and action were revved up to the maximum to compete with the final book—which was also a plethora of drama, suspense, and resolution. And while the tone still isn't as sinister as the book it's referencing, Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 remains a very entertaining and emotionally-charged finale that wraps up the saga nicely.<br/><br/>Just in case you haven't actually read the novel, Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 follows the events from part one as Harry and company attempt to find the essential parts to crippling the strength of He-That-Shall-Not-Be-Named to a point in which he isn't ridiculously invincible. Along the way, major sacrifices are made, Hogwarts is in major trouble, and nobody is safe. Considering how good the original source material is, Steve Kloves' biggest job was to be able to translate it all in a reasonable amount of screen time. Considering that they were willing to split the last book into two colossal films, it shouldn't be too big a problem, right? Kloves actually decided to minimize the dark tone of the final book and cut back on the amount of ""grimness"" that was featured in the final third of the story. Adding to that are a few small changes in terms of content and structure. Whether or not this is good depends on how much of a novel purist you are. To me the changes were not necessary, but didn't distract too much. The entire cast was back and all delivered their performances with no trouble. Let me just say: it is a pure miracle that the kids from the original grew up to become quite talented, and it's a miracle that they were able to maintain such an excellent group for all these years. No other movie franchise can ever boast such an achievement. We honestly take it for granted: Alan Rickman, Helena Bohnman Carter, Ralph Fiennes, Maggie Smith, Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman <br/><br/>It is honestly the cast that makes this movie work, since they perfectly bring the literary characters to life. J.K Rowling was totally on the lucky side in terms of casting. But enough about that, let's praise the pure amount of effort put into each of these movies. The special effects, sets, background design have been top-notch all these years and did not disappoint in the final act. Every detail from the book has translated well on-screen with barely any controversy. While there wasn't much to marvel at in the first third of the movie, once the final battles at Hogwarts took center-stage, the visuals will leave you breathless.<br/><br/>David Yates for some odd reason became the main director of the franchise after the fifth installment—which was not as well-directed as the previous two Harry Potter movies. After his awful sixth installment, I lost faith in him. With Deathly Hallows however, he proved to me that he has learned his lesson. While the movie still paces a bit slow, unlike the last installment the slower moments were still very necessary. The backstories sprinkled throughout the film added a layer of emotion to the movie that we just didn't experience in the previous three movies combined.<br/><br/>That being said, the action could have been better. Deathly Hallows has clearly the most battling of any Harry Potter story/film and could have really delivered a battle to the scale of a Lord of the Rings showdown. Unfortunately despite the great special effects and gargantuan scale; the fights themselves felt a little underwhelming. David Yates wanted to give every major and minor character in the movie some screen time and their final chance to say/perform something memorable. And while this does happen, it leaves less room for the wand battles between the dark forces and our heroes. Come on now, after years of torment and years of the destruction of countless innocent lives, Harry deserves at least a 15-minute showdown with his nemesis.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: Deathly Hallows Pt. 2 improves over the first, definitely improves over Half-Blood Prince, and is a nice and touching finale to the franchise that the world has grown up with and loved. Prepare those tissues, because the deeper invested you are in the series and all the characters involved, then the more its going to hurt viewing the final half. Everyone did a phenomenal job translating a quite difficult novel into a watchable epic and misses the ""epic"" quality by a few notches. The main question now is: what are we going to do in a world without an upcoming Harry Potter piece of work?"
"fred-kolb","Null","0","2","15 July 2011"," The final journey of the boy who lived brings the greatest film franchise of this generation to a spectacular close!
","Harry Potter, a series of novels that defied everything that was possible and started a phenomenon unlike anything that ever existed or ever will exist. An entire generation has come to identify themselves with the books and the movies, especially those who shared a similar age with the characters when they came out. Last night, when I saw the eighth and final Harry Potter movie at the midnight screening, I was yelling and cheering when the curtain came open and once again yelling and cheering when the credits started to roll. But I had tears in my eyes, both of joy and immense sadness that it was now over, as one of the greatest film series of all time comes to an end.<br/><br/>After having destroyed their first Horcrux and having buried Dobby, Harry, Ron and Hermione are hiding at shell cottage with Ron's oldest brother Bill, his wife Fleur, as well as the goblin Griphook and the wand maker Mr. Olivander. Griphook tells Harry that the sword of Gryffindor in his possession was supposed to be in the Gringotts vault of Bellatrix Lestrange and the three eventually start to suspect that a Horcrux might be hidden there. After successfully breaking in and barely escaping on the back of a dragon, the three realize that the last stop in their journey will have to be Hogwarts, the school they went to for six years, and where the final showdown between Harry Potter and his nemesis Lord Voldemort will take place. Neither can live, while the other one survives.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned the right adjectives to describe this film haven't been invented yet. No words I can think of would do the grandness and perfection of the spectacular conclusion of this film franchise justice, and for now I'll just have to leave it at saying that this has good chances of becoming my favorite movie of the year. When you sit there and watch the movie at midnight with a group of teenagers all nearing the age of 20, who define their childhood with ""Harry Potter' you are swept right into a different world of enthusiasm, emotions and nostalgia. I didn't think it was just great, I thought it was flawless. The sad and emotional scenes are so heart-wrenching that I could hear the entire movie theater tearing up, mainly during the scenes involving Snape and his memories that Harry watches in Dumbledore's Pensieve. Snape really comes to define this movie and his character really got to me as a man, who seemed to be the epitome of coldness and villainy throughout the entire series, and in the end turns out to be a tragic hero of the greatest measure, who would even have made Shakespeare proud. The movie is a huge extravaganza of action and visual spectacles, and while the first part was really solemn, apocalyptic and quiet, this one almost indulges in its grand scales and procures a huge battle of magic and some very powerful spells, bringing rock statues to live and creating an enormous energy shield around the castle. I always said that I wanted the series to go out with a bang and in the most memorable way possible and David Yates ensured with his vision that this film will be remembered for years to come.<br/><br/>The acting in Harry Potter has never been as good as it is here. Daniel Radcliffe in his final performance as the hero of this great franchise takes absolute center stage here and after ten years in the role he makes an incredibly convincing, brave and courageous hero, who conveys emotions with credibility and there are some scenes, where his facial expressions are just heartbreaking. Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are really just supporting players here, but they have both made quite a name for themselves in their roles as well and all three actors are capable of continuing their careers far beyond Harry Potter. However, I think the key to the film's immense success are the performances by Ralph Fiennes and Alan Rickman, both of whom are more than deserving of an Oscar nomination. Fiennes, who is one of my favorite actors working today, finally hits the mark completely as Lord Voldemort and he is so menacing, cold and scary in his role that he has now become the living embodiment of evil and the defining villain of a generation. Alan Rickman though has a personality unmatched by any actor I have ever seen before. Snape is someone you love to hate and hate to love at the same time. Rickman's facial expressions as Snape are incredible subtle, but just the slightest change can reveal so much about him, and his carefully chosen enunciation of each syllable he utters is beyond belief. Although he is scary and seems cold-hearted most of the time, in the end when all comes to a close, everyone will feel so sorry for him. Finally though I have to give a shout out to Matthew Lewis who played Neville Longbottom, and after starting off as a chubby and not too bright lad in ""The Philosopher's Stone"", he's become a rough, determined and courageous fighter who believes in freedom and defending yourself. I was really impressed with his transformation.<br/><br/>For the first time in eight movies, I honestly believed that the screen version worked better than the written version. The pictures just seemed to tell the story so much better, and while some of the book almost felt like a letdown to me, the film finished it all off on such a brilliant and high note and the final image was heart-warming and really felt conclusive, and that's when I knew that it was all over. This franchise will never quite finds its equal, as it has moved and influenced so many people who now come off age. It's always sad to say goodbye, but long live Harry Potter, the boy who lived!"
"jmclaughlin90","7","0","2","15 July 2011"," A Grand Finale Indeed
","It's been almost ten years since the first Harry Potter film came out and now the series comes to a close. And what a fantastic and satisfying conclusion it is. It just about ranks up there with cinematic finales like The Return of the King and Toy Story 3. <br/><br/>The film is definitely the most intense of the series. There's a lot at stake. The wizards of Hogwarts are making a final stand together knowing that they may even be killed. There are many losses, some more tragic than others, but there's also much triumph and courage. The battle of Hogwarts is a real spectacle to watch. And it's a good thing the action isn't overdone. It never really has been in these films, which is good to see in a blockbuster this big. It still sticks to the story and doesn't let the action overlap it. The visual effects seem to have improved over each film. And the cinematography is excellent with the dark and gloomy tones.<br/><br/>The performances are as good as ever. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson are at their finest in this. They handle the emotional scenes greatly. It's been a pleasure to see these three grow into such fine actors and I sure hope they all have great careers ahead of them. The scene where Harry goes into the Forbidden Forrest to confront Voldemort is probably Radcliffe's finest moment in the entire series. Grint and Watson share their first kiss and their reactions after are priceless. Many of the characters have their own shining moments. Maggie Smith has some great scenes including one where she brings the school's army of stone knights to life. Another character that gets more time to shine is Matthew Lewis as Neville Longbottom. He has a very heroic part in the battle and it's good to see this character finally grow out of his clumsy stage and become a hero. Michael Gambon makes a nice appearance as Dumbledore as well. There are two performances that shine the most though. First Ralph Fiennes is more menacing than ever as Voldemort. Since pieces of his soul are being destroyed, he's pretty angry and will kill anyone he can. Usually Fiennes hasn't gotten a ton of screen time, but this is his film to dominate. He has achieved the status as one of the great cinematic villains. The scene where he and his army step up to the ruins of Hogwarts, telling the students to join him or they will die, is one of his best. Then there's Alan Rickman as my favorite character, Severus Snape. He's been fantastic in every film, but this is the one where we finally see the man he truly is and Rickman plays it excellently. It gives him a great send off.<br/><br/>So here we are. Ten years and eight films later the grand Harry Potter series comes to a close. Is it the epic finale we've all been waiting for? It sure was for me. Being someone who hasn't read the books, I think they've done a great job at telling a good story. I'm sure those who have read the books will find something to nitpick, but looking at these just as films alone, they've made something pretty legendary and I feel proud to have grown up with them and to be part of this wonderful experience. This is a series that will be remembered for a very long time and it very much deserves that. I will truly miss it."
"aharmas","10","0","2","15 July 2011"," An Amazing End to Harry's Adventures
","David Yates has done it. He has directed the perfect companion to a wonderful literary work. The conclusion to Harry's adventures was one of the best books in the series, and when it was turned into two films, people didn't exactly approve. The first half was a meditative study (calm before the storm), the bridge to a dark and exciting final chapter. In here, characters have fully developed, dropped their inhibitions and must face their destiny. No one hesitates anymore in this battle. Voldemort's goal is to conquer, and Harry seeks to end his threat.<br/><br/>This film works well with technology, especially 3-D, giving it some of the depth it needs in some of the terrific battle scenes, some involving magical creatures, and others enhancing the good old fashioned swords or magic wands matches between villains and heroes. Truly, they succeed because of all the acting and writing talent involved. The drama hits all its targets, the sadness, the violence, the evil, the connections between the past, present, and future. Nothing is left to chance, and every note rings true.<br/><br/>Harry's quest is to destroy the various objects that contain the dark master's soul, and through some creative plot devices, things don't quite come out the way we expected, but the results are satisfying, and every great hero needs a great villain, and the match is satisfying.<br/><br/>We get everything we want from the eventual meeting of souls, the romantic revelations, the soul baring events. There is one guarantee, very few eyes will remain dry by the end of the film, and all questions regarding what and who is evil will be answered. Snape will be given his due. Overall, it's a terrific piece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Sometimes the hype manages to kill our expectations, but here is a case where the end is exactly what we deserved, a rich, rewarding, and magical movie: a true work of art."

","Although i love a lot of classic films series, awesome films are hard to come by now. I was pleased with the start of the Harry Potter series but as usual with most series; they seemed to get worse until the deathly hallows. Part 1 was good but Part 2 was amazing and a great way to end the series, will be sad to not see another but i guess it will be a great way to end the series.<br/><br/>Part 2 was filmed was full of comedy and at times was a great drama and had me on the edge of my seat towards the end, when i first heard that the film would have a mini battle so to speak in it i didn't really think it would come off well but mixed with great effects and great acting so they managed to pull it off well.<br/><br/>The only criticism i have for it which is nothing really is the bit when Harry speaks to Dumbledore, thought that looked very strange and the whole scene just looked out of place from the look and feel of the rest of the film but as i said its nothing; just being a bit picky.<br/><br/>To sum it up. Amazing film and a great way to finish to what has been a great film series for the last decade."

It was over 10 years ago, we were introduced to a young boy who unlike any other boy thought that he was a normal 11 year old kid. But he wasn't normal – he was a wizard and that's how the boy Harry Potter melted the hearts of readers and moviegoers. The creator of this great epic phenomenon, gave us what we had foresaw – Harry Potter was and is and will always be a part of our lives. For you see, it was at the hand of a young writer by the name J.K. Rowling that gave us something to live for.<br/><br/>I have been a true fan of this movement for 10 years and I can honestly say, that I am extremely proud to be a true Harry Potter fan. I could not have asked for more. I read the books and I have the movies, if anything that I have gained from both is that Harry Potter will always live within me and the fans that have graced the books and the movies. Tonight as I was watching the movie, I was thinking the entire 2 hours, how one boy at the age of 17, give so much of his life to save the world from annihilation.<br/><br/>The prophecy is true when it says ""but he will have power the Dark Lord knows not"" that power was and will always be the love of his parents and his friends. Thank you, Harry Potter for teaching us what it means to live a life of love and you have given us something to live for – a life full of hope and joy. Thank you, J.K. Rowling for allowing us to dive in your world of magic into the pages of Hogwarts and teaching us that magic lives within us. As Dumbledore says ""help will always be given to those who need it the most."" And one big THANK YOU to Dan Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint – for allowing us to watch you grow up into fine young men and woman – we wish you the best in the future, we will be seeing you again and again."

","I'm not really a Harry Potter fan at all. But this film was a fitting end to the series. The movie was pretty fast paced and moved right into the action. Though I never read the books or remember the characters from the previous movies, I felt this movie was great. The effects were cool. Only thing I didn't like about the movie was that the lighting was pretty dark throughout the movie, especially with the 3d glasses.<br/><br/>Well, the acting was okay, I mean, it's the same guys they used in the movies. Sound, music, same as usual. The visual was fun cause it was now in 3d.

"joshuaiyer","Null","0","1","15 July 2011"," Best movie ever! :)
","(Just in case, this review might contain some minor spoilers. Nothing too big, but...)<br/><br/>Harry Potter is a series of books (and movies) that will forever be a part of many people in the world. It's sad to think that the HP movies are coming to a close, but I think this movie is the best of the best! It's a great combination of all the other previous movies, including a large cast of characters, a dragon, action, comedy, everything you could ask for in a Harry Potter film.<br/><br/>I was a little worried about this movie. I mean, what if they messed something up? But no, they didn't. They did an amazing job, and it was pretty fun to watch. The emotion was darker than it ever was before, and there was a lot of wand action and special effects that were pretty cool to see. A lot of the lines were taken word-for-word from the book itself, but that's not a bad thing, because it means they tried to follow the book as much as possible. They did switch around some scenes, however, but still made it in a way that you'd be able to understand it.<br/><br/>There were a ton of special effects in this movie that made it even cooler, like the wand effects and the exploding moments when the castle got damaged. Friends and foes are killed off in this film. You'll creep out a few laughs. Some scenes offer applause. There's just a lot to this film, it will be fun to watch multiple times, along with the rest of the series. This movie is much darker than the rest of the series, and isn't afraid to show it.<br/><br/>Some very small complaints are that some sections of the movie flew by without a moment of breathing time. That's okay, I guess, if they have a limited amount of time for the movie.<br/><br/>This movie gets a perfect 10 out of 10. There is just so much to this film, it's hard to take it all in, especially if you haven't read the books. That's the one thing I have to say about the HP movies, you need to read the books in order to fully understand the movies. Still, this was an epic conclusion to the series. There were references to the other films, which I thought was pretty neat, and it's just overall an amazing movie."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","1","15 July 2011"," Excellent - a more than worthy punctuation mark for this franchise
","Eight films in just about 10 years and no rusty wands in the bunch — or however you wish to phrase it. The success of J.K. Rowling's ""Harry Potter"" series theatrically has been unprecedented in both box-office receipts and critical success. Perhaps Warner Bros. and producer David Heyman are to thank for their careful supervision, or original director Chris Columbus for helping to envision a foundation for future success and casting three kids who proved as right for their roles at age 10 as they do at 20. Maybe it's long-time ""Potter"" scribe Steve Kloves for finding a way to give both fans and studio heads exactly what they were looking for. Yet as the credits roll on ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2,"" the satisfying punctuation mark at the end of a true cinematic journey, it really all comes back to characters and storytelling — to Rowling. <br/><br/>""Part 2″ continues the final quest of Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe): find and destroy the remaining three Horcruxes and finish Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) once and for all. To do so, Harry must sneak into the vaults at Gringotts bank and then make his inevitable return to Hogwarts, where a tremendous battle looms and his toughest test awaits.<br/><br/>The path seems as equally harrowing for Kloves down the stretch. The second half of the book — as with the final chapters in any saga, let alone ""Potter"" — contains a lot of dialogue to tie up loose ends and a variety of old (and even new) characters reasserting themselves in the narrative. In more than a few instances he's faced with losing propositions, but mostly comes out ahead. For every rushed or unusually slow sequence, untimely bit of humor or random bit of dialogue, there's something he's personally added to make the film stronger. For example, a wonderful exception to much of what goes on in the film depicts Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione's (Emma Watson) venture into the Chamber of Secrets, whereas the book never leaves Harry's side. We get to revisit the second film's chilling and impressive Chamber of Secrets set, which helps create a ""this is coming full circle in a dark and mature way"" that Yates strives for throughout the film.<br/><br/>As for the promise of action unlike anything we've ever seen, there's definitely a spectacle to ""Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" but the infamous battle in Hogwarts is 80 percent background noise while Harry pursues the lost diadem, one of the final horcruxes. Essentially, the battle possesses no narrative(s) of its own. We see all the things the book mentions: giants and the spiders of Aragog and more, but it's all tossed together into mere presentation. Yates continues to make the danger more gritty and palpable as he's done with the last few films, but ""Part 2″ does not blossom into an action epic. For the shortest ""Potter"" film of the lot, I would've exchanged 10 more minutes of my time to see some creative fight choreography and more of a flow to the battle, at the very least to give some of the story's significant characters nobler deaths.<br/><br/>Part of this is rightfully to keep the focus on Harry, which Yates has always done well. We feel his journey, we know what's at stake and we admire the person he's become, the young man who knows what must be done. The overall character focus of ""Part 1″ gets a bit diluted, especially in terms of the dynamic between Harry, Ron and Hermione, but Radcliffe truly emerges into a leading actor in its place. The level of increased maturity throughout the series, namely in Yates' films, from the acting to the fact that the script respects the audience's intelligence and doesn't spell things out with excessive dialogue, couldn't be more astounding. Little ones won't get this movie at all other than figuring out who wins when it's all over, but to be fair, who cares; the film gets to be much more profound in its tensest moments like any grand finale simply has to be.<br/><br/>On the topic of maturity, perhaps the most pleasantly surprising thing about the film is its stillness. Even at the end, there's a calm and a sense of maturity suggesting that the triumph of good over evil doesn't come with an Ewok celebration and fireworks montages, but a recognition of all that was sacrificed. Other than the way the film handles a couple romantic moments, there's nothing cheesy or cliché about it. Most filmmakers would likely be inclined to give in to those types of things in a conclusion, but Yates stands firm with his grim and softly-spoken vision. The film ends happily, but not in the strictest sense of the word.<br/><br/>So in spite of some unmet expectations and rough script edges, this ending still turns out worthy of the beginning and much more, which simply gives final testament to the power of the characters and the story Rowling has told. Her sheer creativity results in the summation that is ""Deathly Hallows Part 2,"" a film that could not possibly be disliked unless you disapproved of nearly every chapter before it. Her words are the ones spoken in the most affecting moments of the films and her creations paved the legacy it will leave. Although few make it this far, I doubt most franchises could end on a final note that wasn't better than every note before it and still leave its audience as happy and satisfied as ""Part 2″ does.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"
"Argemaluco","8","0","2","15 July 2011"," A satisfactory and very entertaining conclusion of the saga
","I am going to explain my general posture about the cultural phenomenon Harry Potter, in order to give some context to this review, which will be positive; but maybe not as positive as the opinion of the fans who grew up with this saga, and who are acclaiming this last movie as a milestone of universal cinema. Anyway...I found the first three Harry Potter books to be moderately good inside the parameters of juvenile literature, but as the saga advanced, I noticed some loss of in the control of the narrative, which introduced characters and ""ret-con"" without rhyme or reason, trusting the reader not to ask for any explanations nor an adequate development of those elements. Nevertheless, author J.K. Rowling could conclude the saga on an emotionally satisfactory and dramatically consistent note. As for the film adaptations of the books, my reactions for every one of them were also irregular, because there were occasions in which the movies tried to very faithfully follow the books...something which duplicated the missteps, ""deus-ex-machina"" and forced ""suprises"" from their literary counterparts. So, my big doubt was...Would Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 minimize the cons from the book and maximize the pros? Fortunately, the answer ended up being positive, even though I do not consider it to be perfect.<br/><br/>The basic premise from this film starts simple in order to later become more complicated with multiple adventures, action sequences, romance and the obligatory visits to the past which generate new narrative tangents or try to justify some characters' behaviors. Some of those digressions genuinely enrich the story and tie loose ends which had been crawling from a decade ago. Other ones look like simple excuses to introduce more extraordinary special effects, or to visit some popular actor from the supporting cast, or in the worst of the cases, to create forced dramatic moments which were difficult for me to digest, even though some of them are better raised in here than in the book. However, screenwriter Steve Kloves knew how to ""tighten the nuts"" from the story, and he abandons any filling during the final 45 minutes in order to fully explore the darkest passages from the entire saga. I have to say that the general result Kloves achieved in here is pretty good.<br/><br/>The technical aspects from Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 are brilliant. Eduardo Serra's cinematography is excellent, and I think that he could achieve an adequate balance between the ""fairy tale"" visuals we saw in the first films, and the colder and more severe atmosphere which started to be employed when the ""dark side"" of the saga appeared. As I previously said, the special effects are magnificent. And finally, John Williams' music fulfills with its purpose of accentuating the emotions deployed in every scene.<br/><br/>Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson show that they have not only grown up on the physical aspect, but also on the histrionic one. They are totally credible in their roles, and they have a very good chemistry with each other. As for the adult cast, my favorite performances in here are the ones from Maggie Smith and the great Alan Rickman, who both bring excellent works.<br/><br/>8 months ago, I found Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 1 to be so slow and dramatically inert that it bored me very much, and that it considerably reduced my expectations for the final chapter. After all, I do not care very much if a movie is faithful to the book it is based on, provided that it finds its own ""voice"" and becomes into a solid experience which does not require any comparisons nor cooperation to its written version. After 7 movies of a variable level of quality, I think that Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, Part 2 is the one which could most achieve that, and even though it will definitely be more appreciated by the fans of this saga, I can recommend it also to those ones who do not memorize every book, nor saw the previous films more than once, because it is a satisfactory and very entertaining movie by itself."

And let me say that this eighth film is a worthy finale to the saga, in terms of action, emotion, performance and epic visual quality. In particular, Alan Rickman is simply - excuse the expression - spellbinding.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, much as I enjoyed the movie - and I did! - there was one area where I felt the film dropped a ball which the book ran with, and that was the matter of Harry's discovery that Voldemort's death was conditional upon his own. When I read the final book, I found myself within 20 pages of the end, totally unsure of whether Harry would survive or not, and I thought this was a spectacular piece of storytelling. Here, that circumstance is discovered and, five minutes later, bingo! Problem solved.<br/><br/>That aside, this final movie contains most of the payoffs we have waited for. Not without other flaws (read other reviews!) it is a hugely satisfying movie for fans of the series."
"jonnyhavey","Null","0","1","15 July 2011"," A Magical Adieu: The Unbelievable becomes Believable
","""Harry Potter"" has become more than a magical book and film series showing us that magic does exist making the unbelievable believable. ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part II"" marks the end of an era impeccably concluding the franchise synonymous with our generation's youth. Director David Yates (""Harry Potter 5-7"") brings the series full circle perpetuating an emotional connection within the heart of the viewer that is nothing short of spectacular. Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron Weasley (Rupert Grint) and Hermione Granger (Emma Watson) are the fantasy heroes of our day leading the fight against Lord Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes, ""The Hurtlocker"") As the harsh realities of life set in with the death of Dobby the free elf and evil growing, the war is in full swing. Harry, Ron and Hermione are regrouping at a small cottage planning their next move. Before the final test between good and evil is unleashed Harry has some final business to finish with Voldemort's last Horcruxes.As their quest takes them to Gringotts Bank and the town of Hogsmeade everyone's favorite characters from the series are preparing for the last stand set to take place where it all began; Hogwarts. The problem is the school is in the hands of Voldemort with Severus Snape (Alan Rickman, ""Dogma"") head master. The journey comes to a close in an epic battle worthy of remembrance accompanied by the relinquishment of the tale's secrets. The dead live on as Albus Dumbledore (Michael Gambon, ""The King's Speech"") guides Harry within conveying that nobody ever dies in vein.<br/><br/>The Good: Stereotypical artsy Oscar films beware as the world of magic guns for your heads. David Yates has inspired the minds of millions of people with his interpretation of the second half of the series. Adversity ensued early on in the franchise, but it all came together in the end. Breathtaking visual effects, superb acting on all fronts starting with its stars and ending with one of the best supporting casts ever assembled, make this is more than a blockbuster fantasy. Alan Rickman deserves his an Oscar birth for best supporting actor. Regardless ""Harry Potter"" has already won; awards would only be a consolation honor.<br/><br/>The Bad: Complaints for this film can all be attributed to perception. If you are a person who never liked the books, or disliked all of the the films why would you waste your time with the eighth installment? This brings me to my second point concerning the film's epilogue. Personally I believe J.K. Rowling's epilogue can be credited to laziness and is the weakest point of the series, but in order to fully conclude the books, Yates had to translate it to film in some way. Yes the film should have ended before this flash forward, but at least Yates approached it as a chance to have some lighthearted fun.<br/><br/>Final Thought: Haters will hate, moviegoers have a reason to experience the saga, fans will be satisfied and die-hard Potter folk will be euphoric. I bid ""Potter"" adieu one last time; thanks for the memories."
"georgioskarpouzas","Null","0","1","15 July 2011"," the battle that ended the war
","This final movie in the Harry Potter franchise constitutes a very impressive effort from the part of the creative team. It is full of poignant and memorable scenes while the battle scenes remind one of the artistry of ""The Lord of the Rings"".<br/><br/>The movie starts from where the last had ended-the appropriation of the Elder Wand from the grave of Dumbledore by Voldemort and the burial of Dobby the house elf, killed by Bellatrix in the previous film. The visit of the heroes plus Griphook to Gringotts Bank gives a fine allegory of the world of finance, in the way the Goblin employees of the Bank are portrayed, serious and absorbed in their business oblivious of the external environment. The book was written before the financial crisis but the way the dragon plays havoc in the bank when unleashed had a symbolic value in my eyes. The sequence of events follows the book and we are treated to the triumphant return of Harry to the remnants of the Order of the Phoenix and his school, the subsequent battle which is something never before portrayed in the films of this franchise, an event of actually epic proportions with gigantic trolls supporting Voldemort and animated statues of medieval knights in armor protecting the school while the movements of the participants were superbly synchronized and choreographed. Meanwhile we see the musings of Harry Potter and his inner struggles as he realizes his responsibilities and mentally confronts Voldemort. When Voldemort kills Snape mistakenly believing that this action will give him mastery over the Elder Wand which he feels he lacks, Harry acquires Snape's final tears and thus gains access to his memories which proves that he was always in the side of the good and that he was acting under instructions from Dumbledore. Harry goes to meet Voldemort alone since this was the term of the truce the latter had proposed and before confronting him he uses the Resurrection Stone to call up beloved dead such as his parents, Sirious and Remus. Fortified with their support he finds Voldemort who stuns him with his wand. He is transferred to a short of Elysian train station where he converses with Dumbledore's spirit who speaks in a riddle-like manner and there we see a blood stained embryo with the characteristics of the Dark Lord which is supposed to be the part of him residing inside Harry that he destroyed unwittingly when he attacked Potter with his wand. Potter returns to the actual world where Narcissa Malfoy lies to Voldemort saying that Harry is dead. As the Dark Lord with his followers reaches Hogwards, with Hangrid carrying the supposedly dead Harry Potter, the defenders of Hogwards do not seem that eager to espouse the cause of He who must not be named. Commotion begins and Harry reveals himself causing defections from the ranks of Voldemort, the Malfoy nuclear family first of all, and heartiness to Hogwards. A second battle ensues where Neville succeeds to kill the snake thus offering invaluable help to Harry in his duel with Voldemort. In the battle Mrs Weasly kills Bellatrix, offering a feeling of vindication to the average housewife in comparison with more colorful women. Finally Harry triumphs over Voldemort whose followers disperse and there is a final scene after nineteen years where Harry and Gini Weasly, Ron and Hermione, Draco and his wife and their respective children are in Platform nine and three quarters where they put the children to the train that will get them to Hogwards."

","I remember when I saw the first Harry Potter film in early 2002. It left me with a good impression, and I grew attached to the film series ever since. I also got an opportunity to read all the seven books. I read the first six in 5th grade, and it wasn't until seventh grade, I read the final book.<br/><br/>It is 2011 now, and I just walked out of the theater, looking back at all the memories I've had with the Harry Potter franchise.<br/><br/>Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 picks up immediately after the cliffhanger ending of Part 1. Harry, Ron, and Hermione have to locate the last few Horcruxes in order to finish off Lord Voldemort, once and for all.<br/><br/>A great majority of the film takes place in Hogwarts, where the final battle takes place. There was a lot going on, with spells being cast, parts of Hogwarts being torn down, it's like the entire world was falling apart.<br/><br/>The acting is very well-done. Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint, Emma Watson, and the rest of the cast members did a fine job. Even the ones that appear for a few seconds or so did a great job.<br/><br/>The action scenes were great and the CGI was great as well. I also love the suspense. I was at the edge of my seat, excited for what happens next.<br/><br/>That's pretty much all I have to say about this film. All I have to say is that my childhood is now complete. Watching from beginning to end, I left the theater with a warm and optimistic feel. It was nice to see the final Harry Potter film end on a really high note, with me flashing back to all the memories I've had with the films. I wanna thank the past film directors, Chris Columbus (Years 1 and 2), Alfonso Cuaron (Year 3), Mike Newell (Year 4), and David Yates (Years 5-7) for making the Harry Potter films enjoyable. Lastly, I want to thank J.K. Rowling for creating the Harry Potter franchise.<br/><br/>Harry Potter will live in our hearts and will live on 'till the end of time."

The first part was fantastic. The trailers of this gave me high hopes and I knew I was in for a treat The acting was spectacular. Every single actor and actress did their absolute best. To me, they get better and better through the films.<br/><br/>The filming was excellent, there are some variety of excellent shots.<br/><br/>The story kept very well to the book from what I remember of the book. I was a bit nervous at first at parts with Snape's truth and the ending because I didn't think they were going to be added. But the great news is, they were. The emotional moments in the story were captured in the film brilliantly. I even heard my mum cry in the film and I'm sure there were more people crying. There were moments in the film where the audience applauded and cheered, for example, Ron and Hermione's kiss, Belatrix Lestrange's death etc. I even joined in on the applause.<br/><br/>They even kept in the original soundtrack from the first movie at times which was great.<br/><br/>The battle scenes were awesome. There were even times where the little child in me wanted to jump and cheer.<br/><br/>When the film ended, all the cinema applauded and cheered and, again, I joined in.

"Nomouth","7","0","1","15 July 2011"," Great Final Film but Rushed
","NO spoilers in this review. :) I caught the very first midnight showing of this movie at my local theater so there was lots of audience reaction and participation throughout the roughly two and a half hour premier. A few minutes before it started we got to see some behind the scenes snippets from other HP movies, including a screen test and with Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson reading the script together prior to filming Sorcerer's Stone.<br/><br/>OK, now on to my review of this film. Let me start right off the bat by saying this is my very first film review and I have read none of the HP books (gasp!). This review has nothing to do with how well it relates to the book or what they left out, changed or ruined, regarding your favorite parts of the books. I'm going strictly from the perspective of Joe Average movie viewer.<br/><br/>I thought Deathly Hallows Part 1 was pretty amazing and it made sense (to me anyway) and was consistent and fluid and kept me watching and very interested. I hoped Part 2 would keep that going and to a point, it does. It is very dark and gloomy and gritty, just like Part 1. I enjoyed the movie a lot but it suffers SO much from being rushed, especially the last half, during the height of the battle for Hogwarts. I get the impression the director made a checklist of things from the book or wherever of things that must be included in the movie, and jam every last one of them in there at any cost. The cost is that the film cuts from one checklist event to the next so fast that it becomes jumbled and almost seems like it's a string of random events edited together, with nothing emotionally meaningful to tie them all together. I think most of the key snapshots of events from the book are there in one form or another but in many cases there's no how or why, and that weakens the movie considerably. Without giving anything away, there were many times that I saw major characters dead and wonder if I missed something because there was no fight scene with many of them.<br/><br/>I really don't know how this stands up to the book but it seems like the movie is missing major continuity/transition scenes that would at least keep the casual viewer from wondering what the heck is going on here, or how'd we get here, or how'd that happen? I only hope the DVD release has about an hour of footage added back in."

","Such an powerful and emotional finale to the magical franchise. I remember the very first time I watch the first film when I was very young. Eight films in ten years, from children to adults. Before the final Harry Potter film comes out, I was afraid it may disappoint me, afraid of creating a negative review, even I have to if it's bad. But I was wrong. This film is really good, tied up neatly. Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows brings the Harry Potter to an satisfying, epic conclusion.<br/><br/>This film is very dark, very mature with little humor. Harry Potter have fought a final battle against the dark lord and ended in victory. With a few emotional scenes, including the last scene, King's Cross scene, and loss of my favorite characters' lives, it's hard to fight back tears. The war is about protecting loved ones, friends, families, and ensuring others' survival. Evil always get triumphed over by good.<br/><br/>Good bye, Harry Potter. It's good to see you on films (and books). I will never forget this magical franchise. You will be missed by many, many fans, including me."
"gigadragon12","7","0","1","15 July 2011"," Harry Potter is Harry Potter
","Review Score 8.5/10 – You've seen it, you love it, you won't stop now. Lacks some of the magic of previous films, but it's the conclusion so go see it.<br/><br/>HPDHP2 (Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2) is well you know, it's the final Harry Potter film. It picks up where the last one left off, Voldemort has three horcruxes left and Harry, Ron, and Hermione are out to destroy them. The film wastes no time recouping anything except the fact that Voldemort just retrieved the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's Grave. The film largely rests on the final act of the Deathly Hallows, namely the Battle of Hogwarts.<br/><br/>The film has probably the most pure action sequences in these films since ever. If the group isn't fighting or fleeing they're probably just licking their wounds for the next scene. Dialogue is sparse, and explanations are momentary distractions from all the different colored lights running around. And the action is great, its some of the best in any action film, but then again that's what action films are supposed to be about.<br/><br/>But this film has perhaps more negative things that can be said than previous Harry Potter films. All the gooey stuff is over, all the characters have been set on their paths and the film isn't about to remind you what path they've chosen. There is no struggle within the group of friends, how to destroy horcruxes is known, what the deathly hallows are is known, and above all, what's going to happen is known. The film does not spend even one full scene talking about what its doing or where its going, there's action to be filmed.<br/><br/>This is particularly disappointing, because I felt that HPDHP1 was one of the greatest Harry Potter films, but that film remembered one thing that HPDHP2 doesn't remember and that's that among its frenzied and confused action it knew how to slow down and allow for character to bleed out. In this movie Hermione and Ron get hardly any lines. Story is completely side-boarded except for the most climactic part of the film, which is about half an hour before the end of the story. Explanation is so sparse, that unless one were to read the books they'd not know why particular actions were taken and this can mostly be blamed on the fact that someone decided to cut down on the sentimentality and explanation.<br/><br/>BUT I save my rant for more personal moments because despite a few issues that dig at me, HPDHP2 is one of the best action films I've seen recently, and it's the end of a series that everyone has loved, either as books, as films, or as both, and whether or not this is a success should not be measured based one less that shiny part. Therefore I say this movie has something for everyone to love, but it is a movie, and its never felt more like a movie than this one and that is a negative thing."

","Harry Potter is just one of those series that you reflect back and fondly remember. You grow to love the great cast of characters and rooting for them the entire time. This film is no exception.<br/><br/>This final installment follows Harry, Ron, and Hermoine as they continue their search to destroy the horcruxes. Voldemort is growing more stronger, and is at war with Hogwarts (much of the film's setting once again) and Harry's friends must band together to put an end to Voldemort once and for all.<br/><br/>Part of the fun and charm is hoping none of these cast of characters die, and how they will end the villains that had preceded these films. Seeing it with the fans on the big screen is something that can never be duplicated watching home. It must be experienced with the fans. There were a lot of complains with the last one being too boring, and I don't see that complaint for this film.<br/><br/>I don't have much to complain about this film, other than the final battle. It plays a lot differently in the book, and even though it's more exciting on the film version, the end result was a tad disappointing. Although I did cheer for Neville. I can't see how anyone would hate Neville.<br/><br/>This is a perfect end to a brilliant series. It's sad to see it end but we all know it had to happen eventually. It's difficult not having another Harry Potter movie to look forward to, but all I can say is: Thanks for the memories, Harry!"

A lot of old characters make appearances in the finale. you get to see a lot of the old professors, old students, Neville luckily has a big role in this film. Neville was always one of the funniest characters. Deathly Hallows Part 2 had by far the most action most compelling twists. Voldemart was played to perfection! Theending had me in tears when I saw Harry, Ron , and Hermiane as Adults with children. This is probably the best film I have seen in at least the past 20 years. All the Battle scenes are amazing!.

And it was not like they couldn't have changed the parts in the movie to be more like the book with out taking up more time. <br/><br/>Now why did I give it an 9? Well lets be honest it was wonderfully executed by the cast and filming crew. The acting was the BEST, and the effects were amazing. It also moved me to tears & shambles the last half so i would say it did it's job. <br/><br/>Overall I wouldn't say I'm completely satisfied, not the cast or crew's fault but the screenwriter & director for messing up the little pieces of the storyline that make it wonderful."

","A decade of magic and seven films later, we come to the gripping conclusion of the 'Harry Potter' films, and let me assure you; it does not disappoint at all. <br/><br/>Again, this film works extremely well because of Steve Kloves' fantastically crafted screenplay. One of my favourite scenes in the movie (which was actually not in the novel) was when Harry Potter (Daniel Radcliffe) confronts Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), who is now headmaster at Hogwarts, and angrily states to Snape that he should not be standing where Dumbledore once stood ('How dare you stand where he stood!').<br/><br/>Once again, Daniel Radcliffe, Rupert Grint and Emma Watson effectively lead an outstanding cast - which includes many veteran British actors such as Ralph Fiennes, Helena Bonham Carter, Michael Gambon, Maggie Smith, John Hurt, Alan Rickman and many more famous faces. Speaking of Alan Rickman, he does a fine job in portraying the complexity of Severus Snape. To me, out of all the fine performances in the film, Rickman's 'Snape' outshone everybody's, and it is revealed in the final film where Snape's true allegiances lie... Ralph Fiennes also dominates as Lord Voldemort - the villain whom Harry and his friends are trying to be rid of and conquer once and for all. Will they succeed? Or will they face failure...?<br/><br/>This final installment is the darkest and most serious out of all the 'Harry Potter' films and the superb cinematography really highlights this as well as the direction of David Yates (who has had the honour of directing the franchise since 'Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix').<br/><br/>I really have enjoyed growing up with these films and observing how Harry, Ron and Hermione have developed and changed both emotionally and personality wise during the course of 10 years. This film is a nice end to the series but also, to me, an emotional one - for it dawns on you how we will no longer experience anymore adventures with these iconic characters, with which many of us grew up with...<br/><br/>4 ½ out of 5 (exceptional)- The end of perhaps one of the most memorable series of films ever.<br/><br/>One Final Note: I highly recommend that you watch this film in 2D - for in my opinion 3D lowers the brightness and clarity of films, and this film is already dark and gloomy in many of its scenes."
"grahamzkg","10","0","3","15 July 2011"," best harry potter film and best film of the year by far!
","now i'm not going to summarize what happened in the last part, because everyone knows what happened already.the first 20 minutes in deathly hallows part 2 start with out 3 heroes in the shell cottage planning to break into Gringotts for one of the final Horcruxes. if your going in expecting some huge heist scene, your going to be a little disappointed. its really short, which is fine because really all anyone honestly cares about is getting to Hogwarts. once they reach Hogwarts stuff starts to go down. Snape is aware of harry's presence on the grounds, death eaters are everywhere. this isn't the Hogwarts you remember 2 films ago. and thats when we really get into the thick of all of the action. some people complained that the battle of Hogwarts isn't very battle like. and thats a lie, the battle of Hogwarts has some of the best cgi effects that you'll see in a movie. from the giant mountain trolls, to the death eaters blowing apart the sections of the castle. but its not about the action its all about the emotion that is in this crazy battle. we see some of the lead characters laying face first in the rubble. but the most disturbing part of the battle was lavender brown having her neck chewed on by<br/><br/>Fenrir Grayback. the best part of the movie in my opinion, was Snape's memories. now I've read all the books dozens of times. and this part was one of the best parts of the whole series. Snapes death was five times more brutal in the movie then in the book. and once harry reaches the Pensieve we see some of the best scenes in the whole movie. Alan Rickman gives a powerful performance as Snape. we see things in the movie that weren't in this section of the book. and thats a good thing. the most memorable moment is when Snape finds Lilly's body and just holds her while crying.Alan Rickman definitely deserves a best supporting actor nomination for this movie. last few things to touch on: another thing that was changed for the better was the final fight between harry and Voldemort. that moment in the trailer when him and harry jump of the castle looked stupid and unnecessary, but in the film it fit perfectly and worked. now the last part I'm going to talk about is the epilogue. i was worried whether or not they cut it, and thankfully they didn't. it's pretty good, it's a bitter-sweet moment, because we know we'll never see these characters again, and the cue to one of my favorite john Williams songs(leaving Hogwarts) from the end of the first film got me choked up, its such a beautiful song and it fit perfectly. all-in-all this is the best potter movie, and the best film of the year by far. one more thing,there is an easter egg in the movie, I'm not going to tell you what it is. But if you look to the far right over harry's shoulder when he's looking at Ravenclaw's diadem, you'll know what I'm talking about."

","Good things are: Part 2 follows the same style as Part 1, dark and wicked. David Yates has developed his own style and finally got the atmosphere right, the camera movement and editing have become jolly mature since OOP and HBP...in other words, these two films are sacrificed for David Yates practising! Jammy little bugger...Anyway, on the other hand, Steve Kloves finds his own way to fix some bits left out in previous films, and it works quite well. For instance, Harry got the ability to sensing Horcruxes because himself is one, which leads him to find Hufflepuff's Goblet and Ravenclaw's Diadem.<br/><br/>Bad things are: Steve Kloves himself has left out so many vital things! Such as the death of Fred Weasley, two shots of his body is the only mention. The worst change would be the absence of the reason why Tom Riddle can't kill Harry and ends up killing himself. There is a slight complex and logical explanation in the book, but they make it like it is the Elder Wand that blows off Tom Riddle. And Harry would able to battle Tom Riddle alone and fly around the whole castle with him...Another problem comes from Aberforth, he's been poorly depicted, and the whole background story of Dumbledore is missing.<br/><br/>In general, it's jolly emotional, a good film for everyone despite those dreadful changes against the book. For me, the HP story ended already four years ago. Here's my list for HP films <br/><br/>Best: Prisoner of Azkaban <br/><br/>Good: Deathly Hallows Pt1 & Pt2 <br/><br/>Alright: Philospher's Stone and Chamber of Secrets <br/><br/>Dreadful: The Order Of The Phoenix and Half-Blood Prince <br/><br/>WTF!: Goblet Of Fire (bloody hate you!

","Ten years ago, we were presented with a story on the silver screen about a boy wizard, whose parents were killed by a man named Voldemort. Along the way, he met Ron Weasley and Hermonie Granger, who became his party companions as he quested to learn more about himself and come closer to his ultimate destiny; to kill Lord Voldemort.<br/><br/>This one was a very emotional, but beautiful ending to a series that a majority of people my age grew up with, and it added more to its grand power by great direction, an excellent script, and powerful acting (especially from Alan Rickman, who really impressed me with his performance in both parts. I actually began to sympathize with Professor Snape when they showed his backstory from his last tear, as it almost made me cry), along with top-notch visual effects and a grand score.<br/><br/>I can easily call this the best movie of the year, and I hope that people don't miss their last chance to see the boy wizard (unless they decide to reboot the series 20 years from now, which will anger a lot of people, including myself).<br/><br/>So, in total, if I give this one 5 stars and the first part a 4-star rating, that would make the 2 parts together a 4.5 out of 5, which is solid for a Harry Potter film considering all the others except the 4th (never watched Azkaban) were not all that great.<br/><br/>Harry had a good run, quite an impressive one at that.<br/><br/>Part 1: B+ Part 2: A<br/><br/>Together: A-"

Well, most of the things were missing from the book even though the last book is divided into two part.. <br/><br/>The funniest part was the ending.. It was hilarious to see Harry and his friends with their children.. I couldn't stop laughing for about 15mins.. <br/><br/>Animation and cinematography was one of the best part in the movie.. It was a visual treat.. I always loved the graphics in the potter franchise.. It was as i expected..<br/><br/>Its not just the movie i enjoyed, i loved the environment that the created... It was so enjoyable.. It was fantastic.. I will miss Harry Potter..<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was great.. It is one of the best movies.. The ""Best Potter Movie"" till date.. Must watch for Harry Potter fans..!!"

","It is the movie that starts exactly from where it ended in Part-1. Being the last franchisee of the lot, and the promos raising everyone's expectations, the epic battle had finally come to the theatres. The shows are going full packed and people coming out with wet eyes have been a Global Phenomenon. But I ask a question: Have you read the Books?? <br/><br/>David Yates, like in his previous 3 franchisees, has given the same look & feel to the movie, Dark & Paced. Deathly Hallows Part-2 looks great on screen and the special effects & sound create magic. I must admit, once the movie starts there's no looking at the watch. The Film keep you bound with its Spectacular Cinematography and Art Direction. Though we have seen Hogwarts in all movies, it never looked the same in this one. <br/><br/>The 3 main actors have given memorable performances. The Highlight is Matthew Lewis who has emerged as an Actor and Character of Longbottom. I feel he stole the show this time. Maggie Smith has come up showing a newer angle in her performance, while Alan Rickman has changed his image overall. Jason, Tom and Helena have lived up to the expectations. <br/><br/>The decision of making 2 movies out of 1 Book was terrific. As an Ardent reader & follower of HP Books I had thought that all the loose ends would be closed. The movie has done justice to the novel at most of the places, whether it's about destruction of Horcruxes or Memories of Characters, or display of battle scenes. However I am bit disappointed with the screenplay. Due to the fast pace of the movie, one could not absorb & get the 'FEEL' of the events happening. Its half time and you realize so much is already shown. However the second half, even with the slower pace could not keep the events getting absorbed in the skin. <br/><br/>Moreover many important things were completely missed out. The battle scenes could not develop characterization. Either people were fighting or dying. However, the audience was not given any moment either to cheer or grief for the characters. The events looked all hurried up. There was hardly any character development in the movie, though there were many new characters introduced in the part. <br/><br/>Some scenes seem overstretched, and some too short to digest. Use of One-Liners for Humour did not work for me. Due to the pace one can hardy differentiate what is happening to whom! The quick change either of scenes or camera makes it even more incomprehensible. It shows Director's desperation to include the most from the book. <br/><br/>Overall, I have mixed feelings for the movie. While I will rate 8/10 on the emotional quotient, it would be 6/10 for story and 5/10 for the effects. The use of 3D was meaningless. The director did not use the camera angles or effects to as create a better 3D experience. Instead the dark look of the movie became even darker with those dark 3D glasses. I literally had to remove the 3D glasses to see the colours and brightness (which was of no use as 3D looks blurred without glasses). <br/><br/>But I must say, the one who has not read the books would completely enjoy the movie and come out satisfied. However the fans of the Books would not. <br/><br/>Despite of lower rating, I would still recommend at least one time watch!! One must not miss the finale of the era created by JK Rowling and the HP movies."

","this is no doubt the greatest potter movie ever. the others were phenomenal but this movie had something new. this is also the shortest harry potter movie, 2hrs 10min long. we all wished is could of went on 10 or 15 minutes longer but it was still an excellent movie. this movie is about harry, Ron, and Hermione searching for the remaining horcruxes. Severus snape has taken over hogwarts secretly trying to protect the students from the death eaters while staying undercover as a death eater. and you will find where his true allegiance lies in the film. all the teachers are back also. Remus, mcgonagall, slughorn, flitwick, all of them. and of course harry and voldemort has a duel that is the battle we have all been waiting for. this is a movie we have been waiting ten years to see. it feels like this is the last film also. what i also noticed was Ron and Hermione play a more supporting role in this film than they did in the previous movies. this movie made your emotional go crazy. it made you cry, made you laugh. your on the edge of your seat waiting for what other surprise is coming.i had wished though that the characters that did die, i wish they had shown how they died. the performance that really caught my eye was Alan rickmans performance as Severus snape. he really brings something new to snape that you didn't see in the other films. you see a different side of snape that you haven't seen before. snape being my favorite character, i was very pleased of how his story played out and how he was in the movie. without a doubt see this movie. if your a harry potter fan you will not be disappointed."

","Plot: It all ends Here <br/><br/>Review: Well, here we are, the end of a franchise that started a decade ago. Let's just get it out of the way, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part 2 is great. It's an emotionally satisfying conclusion that, yes, did have me on the verge of tears, I wouldn't say I cried, like in Toy Story 3, but I was close. <br/><br/>Once again, the acting was great, I swear, someone needs to be nominated for best actor, actress, best supporting actor, something. The visual effects were incredible, they weren't shoved in your face, but when they were there they were amazing. I like the fact that the ending battle changing things up a bit so there a few elements of surprise for us who have read the books. The actions scenes are really fun to watch, and the comedy, for the most part, works really well. It also has to be one of the best theater experiences I've ever had. The exact opposite of the first one, in which the audience was annoying, this one cheered and laughed at all the right moments. And I just found myself laughing at all the screaming girls who were yelling at the top of their lungs at the Twilight trailer. However the film does have a few problems.<br/><br/>For the most part, the problems are near the end, Voldemort sometime went so over the top that it was getting hard to take him seriously. The rest of this review will contain spoilers, so it you may want to stop reading. Then there was Voldemort's death, I didn't mind that it wasn't in the great hall (which ironically was one of my dad's main problems), but I would have preferred just getting hit with the curse and flying back, did he need to blow up (oddly, I didn't mind when Bellatrix blew up.) This truly is a movie for the fans who read the books, because there are a few points that aren't explained well, such as how Hagrid was captured, or that Lupin and Tonks had a kid. But if you have read the book then this really isn't that much of a problem.<br/><br/>I loved the epilogue, I don't know why everyone else hated it in the book, I thought it was perfect. And it was done really well here, the final shot of Harry, Ron, and Hermione had me on the verge of tears, and that famous ""Hedwig's theme,"" just added to it. Overall it is truly a great conclusion to a great series, it isn't perfect, but I give both this film, and Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows as a whole, a 9.5 out of 10. I guess there is no better way to end this review than with the words my theater spoke once the credits rolled...<br/><br/>Mischief Managed!"

","Harry Potter has been something i have cherished through the years, now that it is over i am quite sad. The last Harry Potter film(s) that was based on the 7th book in the Harry Potter Series, was announced to be a split movie. when i first heard this i was very unsure. it seemed like a money making idea by WB as people would have to pay 2 admission fees instead of 1. The first part was very slow and just a general hype up for a big finish. Now the second part of the last Harry Potter left me happy even though as the posters say 'it had all ended' This is the first Potter movie where i was actually impressed by Director David Yates as he captured all elements of the film in accordance to the book very well indeed. He did have some assistance by two outstanding acting performances with Alan Rickman and Ralph Fiennes playing Severus Snape and Lord Voldemort. The movie is packed with action battles, but it did not explain everything i expected it to after reading the book. never the less it was an enjoyable end to the Harry Potter saga. Overall i give the movie 4/5 stars as a few more explanatory science in replace of action would have suited me more. but if you are or arnt a HP fan it is still a must see, i just pray that they are left the way they are and not remade in the future. http://jperusic.blogspot.com/ visit my blog for a more extensive review and of other new movies, polls and film rankings"
"estebangonzalez10","10","0","3","15 July 2011"," A Perfect Conclusion to a Magical Franchise
","¨Harry Potter, the boy who livedcome to die. Avada Kedavra!¨<br/><br/>After ten years and eight films, the Harry Potter franchise has finally come to its magical conclusion and what a great one it was. As the British might say: It was bloody brilliant! This film is by far the best one of the entire franchise because it brings closure to a series that has been a part of us for a decade. I really never expected to like the Harry Potter series as much as I did and I became more and more hooked to the franchise as each new movie came out. It was like if every new film kept on improving from its predecessor. Not only did the series grow darker, the visuals just kept on looking more amazing as the movies were being released. Ever since David Yates was called to direct these movies beginning with The Order of the Phoenix he just kept on outdoing himself and winning new converts. J.K. Rowling can be proud of the producers for adapting her novels so magically, and of Steve Kloves (who should receive some recognition) for writing such a magnificent screenplay. I don't see how anyone could dislike this movie; it's truly a masterpiece. By the eighth film I know most of the people that are going to watch this movie are true Harry Potter fans, since I don't see how if they didn't like his previous movies they would have any reason to want to see this last one anyways. If you enjoyed the other Potter films then you will definitely love this one; if you hated them then there is no reason why you would want to see the eighth one in the first place. This is not only my favorite film of the franchise, it's also my favorite film of the year so far.<br/><br/>The movie picks up right where the last one ended with the abrupt finale of when Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) collects Dumbledore's (Michael Gambon) wand from the grave. It just happens to be the most powerful wand in the world and it ends up in the hands of the most dangerous dark wizard who wants nothing more than to see Harry Potter dead. On the meantime Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint), and Hermione (Emma Watson) are searching for the remaining three horcruxes in order to destroy them before Voldemort finds Harry. As long as the horcruxes are safe, Voldemort will remain immortal. The quest will end up leading the boys back to some familiar territories that we have grown to love. Potter knows that sooner or later he will have to face Voldemort; but there is much more at stake here as the forces for good and evil begin taking center stage for a final confrontation that has been waiting to happen for quite some time now. The build up for the grand finale happened almost entirely in the first part of The Deathly Hollows; now in the second part the action and intensity felt almost nonstop. Most of the characters from the previous films are all back and ready for battle. On Voldemort's side you have the evil Bellatrix Lestrange (Helena Bonham Carter), the Malfoy's, and several death eaters, while fighting along Harry's side are the Weasley's, Luna (Evanna Lynch), Neville (Matthew Lewis), and the rest of the crew from Hogwarts. I cannot leave out one of the central characters of the film, Severus Snape (Alan Rickman), who if we've never read the novel before don't quite really know who he is really fighting for until the very end. <br/><br/>The final film of the franchise will leave almost every Harry Potter fan completely satisfied because it brings closure to a decade long affair. We've grown to love and care for most of these characters that have shared so much screen time with us. There are so many memorable characters in this franchise and they all get plenty of action in this five hour long finale (if we add both parts of The Deathly Hollows). The young actors have all matured over the years and we've grown to expect great performances from the entire cast. The visuals and special effects were also mesmerizing as usual. What I loved even more from this second part is that we came back to Hogwarts, and I really hadn't noticed what a key character that place had become until Harry Potter puts his feet back in the school and is greeted by his friends. Of course it has grown much darker now that Dumbledore is gone, but so has the franchise over time. The battle scenes were also very effective and powerful, but what really stood out for me in the entire movie was the five minute montage when Harry sees Snape's memories in the Pensieve and so many questions are answered as to what was going on between him and Dumbledore, and as to why he seemed to protect Potter at times and despise him at others. His love story is even more powerful than Ron and Hermione's (that was way long overdue) or Harry and Ginny's. Those five minutes really changed my perception of the entire film and made me see things in a whole other light. I really loved Rickman's performance as Snape and think he stood out over the rest, although Fiennes was excellent as the fearful Voldemort and Helena Bonham Carter as the hateful Bellatrix. They did a pretty decent job of making me forget about my favorite character of the franchise: Sirius Black. I absolutely loved this film, and it was a wonderful conclusion to a magical franchise!<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"
"neenahhh","9","0","3","15 July 2011"," Will leave you with that unexplainable feeling
","I don't even know how to begin this review of mine, but let me just start by saying this-- for fans of the decade-long ""Harry Potter"" saga, everything all comes down to this final movie. I've spent the entire week re-watching all seven previous films to prepare for this last movie.<br/><br/>Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry is in danger, now that the Dark Lord has gotten ahold of the powerful Elder Wand. Harry, Ron and Hermione return to their school for one last stand against the dark forces that threaten to take over the Wizarding and Muggle worlds. They must also continue their quest of finding and destroying the last three remaining Horcruxes so as to defeat Lord Voldemort. <br/><br/>If I could use only one word to sum up ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2"", it would be 'intense'. I never once looked away from the movie screen. All the scenes (and I mean, ALL) were intriguing and filled with action. It was as if all the build-up in ""Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 1"" exploded and turned into fiery hot action here in this movie.<br/><br/>I have yet to read the books, so I don't know how the book compares to the movie, but coming from a loyal movie fan, I thought that the conclusion to the decade-long series was brilliant. It wasn't perfect, but it came pretty damn close. Just one minus for some scenes that seemed a bit too rush. Plus points for everything else!<br/><br/>I still don't know how to explain this post-movie feeling that I'm having. I did not cry, weirdly enough. But I am devastated that there will be no more future movies. The best quote that I could find to explain what I am feeling is this: ""I'm sad that it's over, but I'm glad that it happened.""<br/><br/>When the movie ended, the audience applauded. I loved the camaraderie that we all shared. Even if we were strangers to one another, we had all shared a special moment, thanks to Harry Potter. The ""Harry Potter"" franchise has been doing that for years and years now. Thank you, Chris Columbus. Thank you, David Yates. Thank you, Daniel, Rupert, Emma and the rest of the cast. And of course, a million thank yous, J.K. Rowling. ""Harry Potter"" has really touched a lot of lives. Including mine. Thank you for my childhood, guys. Although the movies are over, ""Harry Potter"" will still live on in our hearts. As J.K. Rowling said-- Hogwarts will always be there to welcome us home.<br/><br/>Viewed on: July 15, 2011 ; July 23, 2011"
"DICK STEEL","Null","0","1","15 July 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows: Part 2
","11 years and 8 films, that was what it took to tell the saga of J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter, the boy who survived as an infant against the evilest of wizardry villains, bringing a generation up through its novels and films and had sealed itself as a genuine cultural phenomenon, finally bringing itself to a close through a resounding finale on the silver screen. It had made a success of a writer, and had made stars of its young cast in creating a franchise which many had tried to emulate along the way, but failed miserably.<br/><br/>Was the decision to split the final film into two parts justified? Simply put, yes, as it allowed some room to breathe in its pulsating pace toward the inevitable showdown between its David and Goliath, and in doing so provided plenty of emotional resonance with the audience who had been followers from the start, developing together with story and characters, and allowing many to cling onto just one more film before the much talked about epilogue. At least it wasn't long drawn out and hard to let go, like how The Return of the King had suffered for its reluctance and multiple false endings.<br/><br/>David Yates had come onboard since The Order of the Phoenix, and in that provided some consistency as the storyline made a turning point to address its main threat head on, becoming darker and bleaker and continuing for much into this film as well, with the sense of dread and hopelessness hanging on every frame. It's ""Part 2"" and it doesn't dilly dally with unnecessary (or some say customary) recaps, so nobody needs to remind you to watch the earlier installment first. Even then you would probably lose count of and not be interested in the number of Horcruxes left to destroy as part of the quest of Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Ron (Rupert Grint) and Hermione (Emma Watson),since you'll be rooting for the trio to come out of each challenge unscathed despite increasing complexities and finding themselves cornered more often than not.<br/><br/>It's atmospheric down to a pat, with death at every corner leaving those who have not read the book wondering just who might bite the dust next, since Rowling has no qualms with ridding major characters if there's a need to emphasize the dangerous times that the story had made a turn for. A key battle takes place at Hogwarts between the forces of good and evil, with Harry Potter as a beacon shining that sliver of hope, that Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) constantly tries to snuff out through mass psychic messages. I've always been impressed by the special effects employed in almost all the Harry Potter films in not being flashy for the sake of, but serving their purpose well to make magic believable, yet having enough pomp and flash to treat audiences to an SFX extravaganza that doesn't disappoint in its The Two Towers inspired full scaled assault involving rogues, wizards, witches and magical giant beings.<br/><br/>Many have encouraged me to read the books for they are far richer than that of the films, since there will be subplots dropped in the interest of running time. I may get down to the books one day, but suffice to say the films are sufficiently self-contained, extremely well made especially in its build up in the last few films given the ominous look and feel, and worth the bang for your buck. It isn't everyday that a strong film franchise gets developed through to its intended finale, and does so while packing an emotional punch, especially when the entire scheme of things get unravelled and revealed, throwing up how manipulative some can be for the greater good, and how powerful love can be, either of the tragic unrequited sort, or the various declarations made in the face of annihilation.<br/><br/>Sure there were some scenes crafted to bring back the dearly departed characters and cast members, for fans of the movie saga to allow for some fitting send off to those whom we've come to dearly follow in their adventures and come to grow fond of. Recommended to say the least, and for those who have yet to watch any of the films, perhaps you may want to do so on DVD and top it all off with a cinematic outing."

","We have been witness of the Harry Potter mania since the first movie came 10 years ago. We have seen the actors grow in front of our eyes for 7 movies. And yesterday it all ended with the 8th movie.<br/><br/>Withouth getting in spoilers...... The fighting sequences are great to the view, the special effects don't seem very wasted. Every match perfectly to create a great environment.<br/><br/>The acting is great. The three main characters make a great work in all the movie delivering their feelings. Ralph Fiennes as Voldermort is perfect. Ruper Grint, Daniel Radcliffe and Emma Watson shouldn't have problems to get roles in a future. Hey Emma even has a role in Perks of being a wallflower so they have a good future coming.<br/><br/>But not all is perfect. The environment is dark and that is good because the movie has to be dark, the reason of this commentary is because of the 3D. <br/><br/>The 3D works good in light environment (Avatar, Tron with the neon lights, even Thor makes that work) but in this movie which almost all the time is pass in a dark place the 3D don't seems to work very good. <br/><br/>Overall, is a great movie to end an epic saga. Just don't waste your money in the 3D, is not that worthy."

","The movie was simply great. Gripping from the start to the end. Still some kind of minor drawbacks like any Potter movie. Some scenes were kind of having abrupt cuts and ends. But as a whole it is a wholesome package for any Potter fan.<br/><br/>It was goosebumps galore throughout the movie. When the castle was getting ready for the battle tears were ready to pop out of my eyes. Just dint have more eyes to see it full. :) The confrontation between Voldemort and Hogwarts was a bit let down for me. Voldemort's booming announcements also were kind of like stupid because of the voice. We expected booming voice but got a shrill one. kind of funny.<br/><br/>One drawback I felt was the darkness throughout the movie. I don mean the story's darkness but visually dark. The 3D effect was not much needed. Still was cool. Fitting end for Potter series."

","I have read the books repeatedly and seen the movies more times than I can count. I loved this movie, but was disappointed with all the liberties they took. A lot of the movie held true and all in all it was great fun to watch. I spent a lot of time on the edge of my seat, and the special effects were amazing. I heard a lot of crying at times, and the audience gave a great cheer at some points too. There was some comic relief interspersed with the highly emotionally charged story. I feel it didn't need to be in 3D, but it did add a sense of ""cool"" to the movie at times. It didn't include a lot of things from the book I was really hoping to see. I was also surprised at how short it was. In the beginning, some things were just left out, but then the movie went in a whole new direction and I found myself thinking, ""but that didn't happen that way in the book!"" Overall, it was still awesome to watch and I highly recommend it as with all the Harry Potter books and flicks."

","i must first say that harry potter has not only spoken what goes on in the lives of witches and wizards of J.K.Rowling's world, but it has dazzled us with it's panache story line and mysterious plot that surely comes to wrap in this thrilling finale.<br/><br/>we pick up right were we left of from part 1 of DEATHLY HALLOWS, as Voldermort takes the elder wand from Dumbledore's grave. the opening new scene,shows us that this is not a film to be taken lightly. and this is proved further by the Director's daring choice in camera-work, editing and general direction.<br/><br/>out of all the harry potter films, this has to be the one where the entire cats, including supporting roles as well, give their all. each scene, even with no dialogue is breathtaking. the performances from Daniel, Emma and Rupert where to put it, SUPERB. not one moment did i find myself criticising their performances, because they were just that committed to making sure that this finale went off with a bang. for the first time, Rupert's comedic timing was just sport on, Daniel's panache and daring to show off harry potter was an achievement that many should be proud of, Emma pit forth Hermione in a way we have never seen Hermione before. this is all showing just how their performances were as convincing as i was when i first read harry potter and thought that this world was real. the supporting cast, Maggie smith, Matthew lewis, Ralph fiennes, Alan Rickman and so one make the most of the time they have on screen and let me tell you it is not in an way disappointing.<br/><br/>however, the one person we must truly thank for bringing us an emotional precipice to the harry potter saga, is the director David YATES. There are just no words to describe how marvellous he directed this. each shot, each special visual effect, each movement has a purpose that serves the story and that can only be achieved if the director cares about what happening. he directs this with dignity and dare i say it, a daring sense of humour.<br/><br/>i'm truly glad to call myself a harry potter fanatic, but for those who've yet to see or hear about potter, i urge you to go and see this movie, because trust me when i say, the movie doesn't not disappoint in giving us surprises and delivering the emotion of finishing such an iconic saga.<br/><br/>i recommend this film to anyone who wants to be dazzled by fine film making, amazing make believe and all round phenomenal performances."

What he was punished for refusing to do in class made my entire theater gasp.<br/><br/>-Molly Weasley is awesome and bad-ass and has an awesome sweater! :) <br/><br/>-I could go on and on about so and so was awesome but really, everyone is awesome except Voldemort who is EVIL AND NOT COOL"

","Finales of this magnitude usually come about once every few years for television shows, but very rarely for feature films. However, this is most certainly the case for the epic conclusion to the Harry Potter saga, filled with equal parts fan-servicing closure and genuinely emotive scenes for those less devout followers like myself. Personally, the film falls short of being the ultimate achievement in filmmaking it would've aspired to, but that does not mean it wasn't an exciting and overly engaging movie from start to finish.<br/><br/>Part 2 picks up right where its predecessor left off, with Voldemort (Ralph Fiennes) celebrating his theft of the Elder Wand from Dumbledore's tomb. Cut to our three heroes Harry (Daniel Radcliffe), Hermione (Emma Watson) and Ron (Rupert Grint), who must find and destroy the last remaining Horcruxes: a collection of rare items and the only things keeping Voldemort alive. And during the climactic battle between good and evil, we learn the all-important secrets surrounding Harry, Voldemort, Snape and other key players in the Potter universe.<br/><br/>In fact, one aspect Part 2 conveys better than any other film in the series is the hero-villain relationship. It only makes sense that a film that has had so much time to flesh out its characters should develop some sort of key bond between the two rivals; one that goes beyond the stereotypical battle of good versus bad. I likened the situation to that of Star Wars. We know exactly what the respective hero and villain stand for, and yet they are more alike than perhaps either of them even want to acknowledge. My apologies if this sounds a little cloudy, but I risk getting blown to bits in a minefield of spoilers if I keep rambling on.<br/><br/>I love to see filmmakers taking steps to initiate innovation in directing, and David Yates must be accordingly credited with presenting a unique plot structure. Rather than possessing a clear beginning, middle and end, this film starts off with a short introduction and a set piece at Gringotts Bank (where a Horcrux is hidden). From there, the next ninety minutes play out as one enormous set piece inside Hogwarts, combining the fight for the school, search for the remaining Horcruxes and Harry's date with destiny into a grandiose visual spectacle. <br/><br/>But that doesn't mean the film lacks substance when it's needed. Granted, I felt little sympathy for most secondary characters that were lost, but Harry's delving into Snape's memories (revealing the true colours of his character) is arguably the strongest and most poignant scene of the film. Coupled with Harry's vision of his dead parents before facing Voldemort in the final act, the greatest achievement of these scenes is that they evoked sympathy from someone who did not expect to become so emotionally attached to any character.<br/><br/>The film does temporarily fall into the trap of playing out like a video game considering the task of moving from one Horcrux to another: items that are nothing more than MacGuffins at their most basic level (see: Sucker Punch). This can detract from the pacing at some points, especially since the film tends to intercut between the revelations of Harry's past, and his friends' efforts to destroy the items which, by comparison, seem far less integral to the plot.<br/><br/>Script-wise, Part 2 treads water, delivering a decent screenplay that dosen't exactly stretch one's imagination. It can become rather stale (after a while everything becomes 'brilliant' this or 'bloody hell' that) but overall it isn't a huge concern. What was disappointing, though, was the cheesy 'nineteen years later' epilogue. Aside from the obvious fact that no-one looks as if they've aged a day, it serves no real purpose in the film, and does nothing to dilute my general hatred of tacked-on 'and then this happened' scenes to close out a movie. Still, a solid effort, and a fitting end to an imaginative series.<br/><br/>*There's nothing I love more than a bit of feedback, good or bad. So drop me a line on jnatsis@iprimus.com.au and let me know what you thought of my review.*"

","Well, after going to the midnight premiere packed with hundreds of wizards and even a few house elves and waiting 2 hours in line, finally I saw the the final Harry Potter. And it was simply amazing.<br/><br/>Once again, Harry, Ron and Hermione were great, but hands down the best performance goes to Alan Rickman. My biggest interest going into the movie was seeing how believable Snape would be when his true allegiance was revealed. And it was perfectly played. It was a tear jerker seeing it happen, and for me it made the movie.<br/><br/>The Battle of Hogwarts was simply epic. Watching it unfold was a Harry Potter fan's dream come true, the moment that you wanted to see finally coming to life. Ron and Hermione get their first kiss in the process(finally), and of course thunderous applause followed from the hundreds of fans watching. And of course the search for the final Horcrux continues. To go along with it, Neville Longbottom emerges as a hero, and its very fun to see after seeing him getting stepped on in the previous movies.<br/><br/>The final showdown between Harry and Voldemort was very well put together. While it was a little differently portrayed than the book, it by far was more entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>And of course there is the question, ""Does it follow the book?"" For the most part, yes. All the major events are included, and while there are changes from the book, it is not like they shortened or cut scenes to make it shorter. It was more of adding to battle scenes and making the movie more entertaining. As I said, the final battle between Harry and Voldemort was altered but it was for the better in my opinion.<br/><br/>And of course, as always, Emma Watson was drop dead gorgeous.<br/><br/>Hands down, this is the best Harry Potter film, the action never seems to stop, and it was amazing seeing it all come to life. It is a must see for every Harry Potter fan."
"bhavyarocks28","10","0","1","15 July 2011"," Harry Potter and The Deathly Hallows (Part 2) is the best movie one can expect to end this great journey
","I watched the first Harry Potter movie when I was 5 years old. I still remember that sweet little Harry Potter from the 1st year. This journey has been absolutely fantastic! HP 7 II was the BEST movie of the entire film series. I almost cried when the movie ended. I just wish I could go back to the past and never let this series end. I always felt something missing in all movies of this franchise directed by David Yates, but this time, he has proved that YES, he is the director worthy of directing this film series. The movie is full of action and emotions which would keep you on the edge of the seat until the end. I'd repeat myself again, THIS IS THE BEST HARRY POTTER FILM. Hence, please go and watch this movie in theaters, coz watching the pirated version would be a DISGRACE to such a movie."

","A MUST WATCH. Total entertainer with ample doses of heart-filled excitement. The suspense created in the 1st half is acutely executed with a brilliant end. Harry Potter Series really ends in style. This is one is certainly the best of the lot. Honestly being a crazy fan can't think of any negative points to this one. Maybe since the last part the time-line could have been a little longer something about 2hrs 30mins. The last part surely made me emotional. Perhaps it would have been little better if the character of Severus Snape could be given in a little more detail and maybe the final duel could have been a little fearsome. But the nonetheless THE MOVIE IS BRILLIANT."

","Unlike so many 'Potterheads' out there, I can't call myself a die-hard fan of the series. Yes, I have enjoyed the films greatly, but I have never read a single book, nor have I devoted time to following every piece of Potter news. So, this review comes from someone who has enjoyed the films as a fan of movies. And this final chapter is truly an enjoyable spectacle that brings the series to a wonderful close.<br/><br/>It's been a very long time following our trio, Harry, Ron, and Hermoine, but finally the time has come. Picking up right from the previous film, the three are on a quest to find all the remaining Horcrux, those objects that must be destroyed in order for Voldemort to be killed himself. Standing alone, this feels like half a film, so it certainly won't appeal to anyone who hasn't followed the series or at least seen Part 1. But considering the titan that this series has become in terms of films, it's safe to say that a good majority of film goers will be out to see this one and will quite enjoy it.<br/><br/>Probably the best thing going for this film is that it is almost non- stop excitement. While it starts out a bit slow, it quickly picks up, delivering all the action and excitement that Part 1 brushed over to develop the heavy story. It's certainly the most action driven of any of the films and goes into some truly dark territory, at times looking like a war film. I was reminded of war films during several scenes in which Harry finds himself amidst a makeshift hospital or is crawling along the ground in what is essentially a battlefield. This is the darkest chapter of the series, and rightfully so. What started as a wonderfully magic driven film series delves into it's darkest of elements and reveals the raw nature of the adult world in the Harry Potter series. That primary elements being dealt with here is death, and it is constantly foreboding. For as long as I have watched these films, I have wanted the series to bring about that dreadful seriousness coupled with fantastic action, and this film delivers all of that.<br/><br/>It helps that performances all around are fantastic, and the lead trio have certainly come a long ways. Throughout the series, they have managed to grow along with their characters, and they rightfully deliver the necessary chops that their characters need to. What were once children are now adults and they play their roles up well. Gone from this chapter is any of the angst from any previous film. Each character is faced with a simple fact: they may very well die. And some do. So, what remains is their battle for their lives and to defeat this great evil. It's a breath of fresh air, to finally be rid of so much of that teenage angst. Now, we finally get to have our epic climax, a great battle between good and evil. Ralph Fiennes is also of particular note, as he relishes the role of his evil Voldemort, providing a certain level of campiness that seems appropriate to the character. Alan Rickman is wonderful as usual, but finally breaks free from that brooding mold that had been crafted for so long. We get to see his wonderful acting skills put on display in full.<br/><br/>Now, that isn't to say this is a perfect film. No doubt, many a fan will give this a perfect 10, but as a less connected viewer, I felt some elements were slightly too convenient, as if there were certain things that were rushed in the film. Considering this is the shortest film in the series, it seems like maybe a lot of conveniences could have been more developed if only to provide a bit of common sense. Just as well, there were certain elements that felt a bit underwhelming, including the final confrontation, which seemed to evaporate rather quickly when compared to what came before. The emotional elements are there, for sure, but the film never truly feels like it completely capitalizes on everything that has led up to the final moments. Then again, it's hard to imagine that it ever really could fully live up to what we would imagine the climax to be.<br/><br/>Overall, however, this may very well be the best Harry Potter film. Well, this and Part 1. I still haven't decided. But it's a fun final ride. Filled with action, great acting and directing, and some very intense moments, if you've enjoyed any of the films before it, this is one finale you won't want to miss."
"deepu564","10","0","2","15 July 2011"," Incredible conclusion to an immortal series - totally bewitching and mesmerizing!!!
","I had been waiting for this day to arrive for more than an year & when it did arrive, I was not at all disappointed. I went to watch the movie with some friends of mine who considered the Harry Potter series as a mere 'children's story'. Two hours later, when the credits rolled, all of them said in unison, ""We regret not having read the 7 books"". It's a film keeps you ""spell-bound"". It is, like somebody already mentioned, an action-packed emotional roller-coaster - one moment your heart beats hard thanks to the spectacular special effects and Alexandre Desplat's amazing background score and the next moment your eyes brim with tears seeing the fate of some of our dear characters. I couldn't watch the movie in 3D since it runs in a 2D theater in my city; but that didn't prevent me from giving the movie 10 out of 10. Having said all these, I think it's needless to add that it's the best Harry Potter film till date; in fact, it's one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life!!. I really didn't feel like leaving the theater when the film ended; I felt like something very very very very very(& an infinitely more 'verys') precious had just ended. I could see the girl sitting next to me breaking into tears when the credits rolled and my heart was brimming with even more tears. It's a wonderful ending to an immortal series. Thanks a lot David Yates & team and, of course, J.K. Rowling for giving us such a wonderful story,which is a perfect blend of friendship, love, bravery, emotions & many more. 'EPIC' is an understatement!!<br/><br/>*Spoilers!*<br/><br/>Things I liked the most:<br/><br/>*Lily's theme' by Alexandre Desplat - gave me goosebumps. <br/><br/>*Gringotts scene - perfectly done. -Battle of Hogwarts, which kept me on the edge of my seat. <br/><br/>*Ron & Hermione's kiss - very sweet!! <br/><br/>*Snape's memories - very very touching. I cried when they showed scenes from Sorcerer's stone. Very very nostalgic. <br/><br/>*The intense final battle between Harry and Voldemort. Though these scenes are not in the book, it complemented the film superbly. <br/><br/>*It was so sweet of them to play the 'Leaving Hogwarts' soundtrack during the epilogue scene. Nothing else would've suited that the ending.<br/><br/>Things which disappointed me(very, very slightly):<br/><br/>*Voldemort's death could have been better - it was too soft. I expected it to be more dramatic. <br/><br/>*Harry never repairs his broken phoenix wand with the Elder Wand. I liked it that he snapped the Elder Wand into two & threw it away, but, I would have felt better if he had mended his own wand before snapping the Elder Wand.<br/><br/>Despite these negligible lapses, I would go with 10 out of 10 for the final Harry Potter movie. It's a perfect conclusion to the epic series."
"fayesimmons92","10","0","2","15 July 2011"," Amazing!
","I absolutely loved this film! Over the series I've been getting annoyed that the films are too different from the books, but this film gets away with it.<br/><br/>My favourite parts were The Prince's Tale and Kings Cross. These were beautifully shot, the cinematography was great, lighting and sound were fantastic, the acting was superb and the atmosphere was perfect for those moments. I absolutely loved these scenes in the book, and although they are shorter in the film (hey, you can't fit everything in) I still loved them.<br/><br/>So to sum up, the best film of the series. Everything just worked. It didn't matter that it was slightly different to the book in places because they way everything fitted together, and unravelled the story line, just made for an excellent cinema experience."
"youngman44","9","0","2","15 July 2011"," Simply The Best
","Far and away the best film of the series. Very emotional and moving - great action; tension; and a phenomenally well done ending. Very, very satisfying in spite of the melancholy of the fact that a movie series many fans have followed faithfully for the past 10 years. <br/><br/>I was not a fan of the early movies but went to all of them anyways simply because my kids enjoyed them so much - they ostensibly grew up at similar ages as the Potter - and had read every book. <br/><br/>The films have generally improved but there is no doubt this last film was great. Unlike the other films, part 2 of the deathly hallows was actually, in my view, better than the last half of the book. I found the action in the book difficult to follow and maintain coherency. Perhaps it is that fast paced and complex action is easier seen on the screen than penned on the page. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is head and shoulders the best of all eight Potter films. It brings to a close what is, really, a very powerful cultural phenomena in western society. <br/><br/>The themes of redemption; of imperfection of characters; of love; of justice; and self-sacrifice all play a part. I felt that Rowling had made the teen characters too foolishly flawed and emotional - far more than many are at that age. But this particular film - while not neglecting that feature - presented the characters in a stronger light. Especially Harry. Well done Daniel Radcliffe."
