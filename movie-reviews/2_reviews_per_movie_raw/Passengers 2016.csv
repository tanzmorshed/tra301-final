","I have to admit that I had low expectations when I was going to see this movie. The negative reviews are why. Appearance that the film has gone bad, not earned enough, etc. But it does not make sense to listen to others. The best part is to find out yourself. And I have to admit that I enjoyed this movie well, even though I understand some of the criticisms. At the same time, I know that Morten Tyldum is an incredibly good director. One of the best Norwegian directors, without a doubt. I think it's strange that he made something directly bad. The film is not a featured sci fi movie, even if the action takes place on a spaceship. I enjoyed the movie for three reasons: 1) The story is unique, and something I've never seen before. It's always a good sign. 2) It's beautiful to watch, great movie, spectacular setups and scenes. It was impressive and 3) This movie works to switch between a love story and some action sequences. It seems like a thoughtful movie, and I appreciated the thought behind scenes and action. The few people we meet in the film give insight and one becomes familiar with the characters. It is also a strength, but perhaps also a weakness. The gallery is limited. But anyway, I recommend this and hope to see similar movies in the future."
"steen-mpi","9","775","1096","23 December 2016"," Eminent Science Fiction
","Professional film critics are stupid. That is the conclusion you must reach after watching this movie. I was not expecting much after reading the uniformly negative critical reviews. But I was surprised. The movie is plausible. It is more than plausible, it is realistic. And the acting is so eminent that you are there yourself trying to decide what you would do if you awoke on a fully autonomous spaceship trying to figure out what is going on.<br/><br/>Granted, there are no alien horror creatures, no protracted fast-action sequences, no superficial technical nonsense to cover a thin plot. Maybe this is what the critics were missing.<br/><br/>There is only beautiful scenes, eminent acting, a plausible plot and a surprising ending. But that was enough for me.<br/><br/>So go watch this movie and decide for yourself how implausibly stupid the film critics are."
"Sleepin_Dragon","9","68","89","2 December 2018"," Very original, beautifully made.
","Passengers is a truly brilliant movie, it's hard to place it into a genre, but it is very much a sci fi love story. The concept is a great one, and it poses a fabulous question, could you force someone to spend their life with you, or live a solitary life. The idea is very original and very clever, the special effects are breathtaking, and the cinematography is first class. The main trio of actors do a superb job, but it's the dazzling Jennifer Lawrence that stood out for me.<br/><br/>Attention to the detail to this film was first rate, huge credit to all those behind the scenes.<br/><br/>It's not often the case that I wish a film wouldn't end, but after fifteen minutes or so, I was captivated, and really didn't want it to end.<br/><br/>Fabulous film, 9/10"
"elementxo","10","806","1167","22 December 2016"," Ignore the critics- a great movie with lots of suspense
","I'm almost convinced film critics are paid off...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. This movie had everything- love, drama, philosophical/existential questions, and incredibly suspenseful moments (and not just action scenes!!). The acting was great, pacing was good (never was bored), and the visuals were amazing as well. Also the trailer didn't spoil the movie at all, which was nice. My only gripe would be about the ending, which was still fine.<br/><br/>Overall would really recommend watching over the holidays. Really enjoyed it."
"Samirsbureau","7","461","677","22 December 2016"," A highly enjoyable ride that unfortunately got rolled over by the Critics.
","After the trailer release of this movie it became one of this year's most anticipated movies, but some people were expecting something entirely different than what this movie aimed for, and the result was their disappointment. <br/><br/>People need to be aware that this movie is an ADVENTURE/ROMANCE and a bit SCI-FI. NOT A SCI-FI 2001:SPACE ODYSSEY KIND OF MOVIE.<br/><br/>I will start giving my own honest review of this movie. First of all, The acting in this movie is phenomenal, of course when you get 2 great actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence you know it would work in any kind of role, and it's true, the chemistry between both of them just works flawlessly and it's very gorgeous as they're both very handsome and it's just nice to see them on screen.<br/><br/>Then comes the VISUALS, which i consider to be this year's best ( Along with Dr.Strange ), The best way to watch this movie is at a theater with a huge screen and definitely better to catch the 3D version. I really don't know where to start with the visuals because the whole movie is just beautifully shot and the CINEMATOGRAPHY of this film is perfectly done, probably each scene in this movie is Iconic. <br/><br/>The Plot wasn't as good as the other factors but still it managed to keep the pacing of the movie going and I was definitely not bored, even though the ending wasn't spectacular but again this isn't Christopher Nolan's Interstellar, this is just a movie about 2 lovers surviving on a spaceship alone.<br/><br/>The best way to describe this film is to say that it's Titanic all over again but in space and it's beautifully shot, emotional, and overall an exciting experience.<br/><br/>It's really sad that people misunderstood the point of this film and were going for a complex space/time plot instead of a simple good-looking love story, but I know that moviegoers will definitely like this film. Give it a try and if not for the story then just for Wonderful scenes and for the link between the 2 main characters<br/><br/>Conclusion: Great, Simple, Gorgeous and Highly Entertaining are the four things you'll be saying after watching this movie."
"Ckpankratz","10","384","568","22 December 2016"," Very enjoyable indeed!
","I'm a forty-something male and I loved this movie. I didn't quite know what to expect, saw some less than glowing reviews, but decided to favor the more positive reviews and head to the theater. I'm glad I did. <br/><br/>If you like science fiction, this has it. If you like romance, this has it. If you like excellent special effects, this has it. If you like a good story, yes, this movie has that too. <br/><br/>This isn't a Star-Trek style high-octane Sci-Fi action movie. It's a solid blend of drama, romance, action, intrigue, stunning visuals, occasional suspense, human psychology, and for me was a winning combination."
"Avyrius","9","684","1033","23 December 2016"," I cannot understand all those bad reviews of Passengers
","The movie is definitely worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. Secondly, the acting is one of the best I've seen (I was pretty skeptical about J.Lawrence but not anymore after this movie; and Chris Pratt's acting keeps getting better and better since GotG). The plot is quite unique (I do not believe I've ever seen another plot that resemble this). Lastly, the visuals is BREATHTAKING (I absolutely adore the ship design).<br/><br/>The pacing was a little bit too fast at the end but not that noticeable. <br/><br/>Rating: 9/10 <br/><br/>Sometime a simple movie with simple plot is better than s**t like Batman vs Superman because there are less space for mistakes. Also, do not expect much action in this movie (I expected more action but in the end I was OK without it.)<br/><br/>Also, sleeping beauty is also named Aurora xD"
"patrickjames85","8","550","860","22 December 2016"," Passengers was fantastic!
","Passengers is yet another example as to why you should go see the movies professional critics hate & save your money on the ones they absolutely love. Going to see a movie at the theater is like $30 now for just 2 people & that's without visiting concessions. I don't know about everybody else but if I'm going to spend a few days worth of grocery money for a 2 hour movie experience I'm really hoping not to be bored to tears or looking at the time wondering how much longer it'll be until a movie is over. Passengers just ends up on my very long list, lately, of movies critics tried to bring down that were waves better than the ones they are directing people to see. This movie is visually stunning & the story telling is not only thought provoking but innovative while doing so! It was great to see a story like this one told in a way that didn't spend most of its time trying to dialogue it's way into Oscar nominations. If you are going to venture out to see a movie for the Holidays go see this one!"
"Damien_King86","6","93","136","7 April 2017"," A decent sci-fi rental that plays it too safe.
","I'm just going to list my takeaways from the movie in list format. Maybe it will be helpful to someone, maybe not. <br/><br/>Pros - The production is immaculate. The cinematography, set design, CGI, all of it is top notch, as expected from a movie starring two of the most popular current actors. - Although I'm not crazy about Jennifer Lawrence, and I only really like Chris Pratt as Starlord, I will go ahead and list them as a pro, since they did a good job with these characters. Michael Sheen is also welcome in any movie. <br/><br/>Cons - The science of the movie is a bit slinky at times, obviously to serve narrative motives. Other reviewers have detailed these inaccuracies, so I won't get into it, here. - The movie mostly leans toward a romantic drama vibe, and I personally think there should have been more of a sense of dread and danger throughout the movie, not just near the end. - Given the high profile status of the leads, the sex scenes are predictably tame and brief. Along with the lack of danger, the lack of eroticism is another way in which the movie plays it too safe. - The catharsis at the end that stems from the main moral dilemma (which I won't spoil) does not occur satisfactorily in my opinion. It didn't move me at all, and made it feel like it was never that important to begin with.<br/><br/>In summary, this is an entertaining, but light sci-fi romance. It feels like a 70's sci-thriller that has been thoroughly processed for a general audience. It makes a good rental, but I couldn't help but lament that it wasn't the riskier, edgier film that it wanted to be."
"angieholstad","9","210","333","28 December 2016"," Very enjoyable.
","If you want a very enjoyable, aesthetically pleasing and romantic movie to watch, I think this is absolutely perfect. I think critics are giving it bad reviews because it didn't have the best dialogue, so don't go if you're just looking for something negative in a movie. If you're emotional, I think this would be a good movie to watch during that time. It's beautiful, well done, heartbreaking in some moments, and has amazing actors. It's comedic and romantic, with some intense parts so it has a lot of complements and genres in it. This isn't a negative thing at all, this movie just has it all. The story line and the message are thought provoking, and it's an all around amazing movie."
"retiredat55","8","46","67","13 January 2017"," Don't miss the first two minutes
","It's not a spoiler to say that in the first minutes of the film we get a bird's eye view of the ship colliding head on with an asteroid swarm. Don't ask why this incredibly complicated ship couldn't/didn't attempt any evasive maneuvers. In any case the ship's automated systems are only partially successful in dealing with it, the sequence of events ending with one of the passengers being awakened prematurely from his hibernation pod. It's also important to know before the curtain goes up that the passengers are not astronauts, they literally are just passengers on a space-borne cruise ship which is taking 5,000 people on a 120-year journey to colonize a new world. If you can suspend disbelief long enough you will be very entertained."
"Nobody-27","8","324","532","21 December 2016"," Haters gonna hate, but moviegoers have plenty to enjoy here
","I don't quite get all the hate that this film gets... I can also think of great number of recent alleged sci-fi films that don't deserve a minute of one's time, yet they are cherished and loved.<br/><br/>In any case, I went to see Passengers with high expectations. While I am not a fan of either Jennifer Lawrence or Chris Pratt, they were very good in this film - good enough to immerse me in the story (unlike most other alleged sci-films these days). I've been a fan of Michael Sheen ever since I saw him in Midnight in Paris where he was brilliant also, and his performance in Passengers was so good that it is easy to forget that this synthetic robot with a plastic smile is brought to you by a thespian. What a performance! Worth seeing just for that alone.<br/><br/>The story is by now well known, due to spoilers being given away like candy during Halloween and partly due to (leaked?) script that was posted a while ago. Most importantly: the film has been changed from the original script and for the better.<br/><br/>The thing that I liked about this film is that first of all - it is not stupid. I did not have to put an extra effort to suspend my disbelief the way I had to for most recent sci-fi favorites (except Martian which I liked). Yes there may be one or two occasions when I knew that ""such would be almost impossible"" but even then, there is also an option that the situation had something that we, the viewers may not be aware of. For instance, the sudden loss of gravity would require sudden stopping of the rotation of the ship; that would require enormous amount of energy, otherwise things don't just stop in space. But, who knows - maybe the ship did decide to stop the rotation? So not entirely impossible (this is not a spoiler because the official trailer clearly suggests loss of gravity).<br/><br/>The drama of the film is obviously based on the fact that two passengers woke up too early during their cross-universe trip. No matter what you think of the morality of how that all happened, remember this is a film and not televangelism. In other words: there is no space for political correctness in character portrayal.<br/><br/>In the end, I can say that there was plenty to enjoy in this film, from excellent visuals to great performances all around. I actually plan to buy this in bluray, which I don't do that often with new movies (my library of recent films includes ""Argo"", ""Dallas Buyers Club"", ""Midnight in Paris""...) If you are expecting another marvel-comic inspired super-hero driven FX fest, you will be disappointed. No iron-men or spider-men or any other mutants in here. Just your plain simple ordinary humans with all their shortcomings.<br/><br/>But if you are looking for an interesting story, with an interesting premise, and no cringe-worthy ""even kids know this is impossible"" moments, than this is for you.<br/><br/>ps. I loved the attention to detail which translated to some really cute and funny scenes..."
"papslappy-270-725139","9","134","219","23 December 2016"," ""Passengers"" offers more than the reviews are giving credit!
","I read many of the reviews too, and while I always say that every movie will treat everyone in a different way, I am a little surprised by the amount of people who didn't enjoy it! I thought this movie was beautiful!<br/><br/>If you want a movie with conflict, space exploration, romance, and sci-fi...this movie is for you. While it's not loaded with 'blow em up' action, the movie is filled with tension and does have some great action scenes. The best aspect of the movie (to me) is that the filmmakers were very successful at turning a situation so incredible into something simple and human. <br/><br/>I walked away from this movie not wanting it to end. Screw the bad reviews, see it for yourself and maybe you'll see what I saw!"
"fig-75275","8","59","92","3 January 2017"," A moral problem beautifully presented and executed.
","I enjoyed Passengers a lot. It's not perfect though. The spaceship is beautiful from both the outside and the inside, and you get the impression that future technology is really fantastic. The computer systems are pretty dumb though (including Michael Sheen's android). This is all forgivable though, because if the computers weren't dumb the story wouldn't work.<br/><br/>The only part of the film that doesn't really work is the bit in the middle with Laurence Fishburne. I could see three reasons why his character was needed, but it all felt very contrived. He has one important line though, so I can forgive it (just about). I just wish the writers had thought about that part a bit more, as the rest of the film was really great. Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen were brilliant too.<br/><br/>Passengers is clever, thoughtful, science fiction, and I would highly recommend it."
"Argagax","9","300","517","21 December 2016"," Are we hitting a golden age of SF?
","Amazing film. I didn't know what to expect, all I knew going in was that two people woke up 90 years too soon, on their way to a distant planet.<br/><br/>I came out having seen well-developed characters faced with difficult choices and having to come to term with those choices. To me, a very realistic movie about human nature, ultimately. I guess Neil DeGrasse Tyson or whoever will soon make a statement on the movie's accuracy, but as far as I could see (being a closet nerd for interstellar travel), it did it better than many films in the past have.<br/><br/>The one minor nitpick I could find in the whole film, was when the ship announces them passing a star close up - why did the ship have it programmed to announce it, if they were not going to be awake for another 90 years? But to me, this film had everything. Good pacing, just enough action, emotion, suspense, and believable characters that I ended up really feeling for, and like in another film I just watched (Light between oceans), you see one of the main characters making a terrible decision but you know that in the same situation, anyone would have done the same thing.<br/><br/>To those that down vote it or boycott it because ""a man is taking advantage of a woman"" - get a life. Not everything has to be about your political agenda, or gender or race. If the gender roles were reversed, we wouldn't be hearing a peep from you. So sit down and enjoy an amazing movie."
"stefan-morcov","5","143","243","24 January 2017"," First boring, then unrealistic to absurd
","The first half is incredibly boring. Nothing happens for half of the movie. I understand that we need to ""feel"" the loneliness. But there are so many good movies that portrayed the Robinson experience without being also boring. And then: completely unrealistic on each level, on each detail (maybe apart from the love story, which is cute and romantic). This is not supposed to be fantasy or adventure. It is supposed to be a pure-blood SF story, whose main character is a mechanical engineer. So I expect that at least most of the technical details should hold a little water, as well as the main story line. But no: every little technical/scientific/engineering detail is completely illogical, and the methods deployed by the main character to solve the situations are absurd. Look: my motorbike has, I believe, around 5 completely different methods to stop the engine in case of emergency (cut the contact, cut the electricity, cut the gas, put it into neutral etc); but a huge stellar ship has: NONE ? A huge stellar ship the size of a village (5270 inhabitants) has only 1 (one) bed in the infirmary ? No sensor detects for 2 years that there is an open hole in the hull of the ship, and loss of pressure in some rooms ?! There is no backup system for anything – instead they repeat ""this system is supposed to be impossible to break, so this cannot happen"" – gosh I don't remember any engineering 101 lesson to ever say this line, they all speak of redundancy, backup, fail-safe and fail-over mechanisms. The individual space costume resists the heat of a reactor that would otherwise break the hull of the whole spaceship ?! There is absolutely no method to alert the large sleeping crew of a huge ship that something went wrong ?! There is no alarm system on a huge space ship ? My car has a better information collecting system from various sensors than that space ship, you actually DON'T need to plug-in floppy-disks around your car to collect data, they kind of get collected automatically and displayed on the screen. And if something stops, you still have the history of what happened before, stored in some central memory chip. Airplanes today have 2 independent black boxes to store everything that happens on board, all information from all sensors, any sound etc; for a space ship they just forget about this. For a space ship I would actually add maybe 3 or 5 different independent backup storage devices, plus maybe 2 or 3 backup computing devices, stored in completely different physical locations, completely independent, each one able to resume operation automatically and instantly if another one fails and maybe other 1 or 2 of them manually. Also: an intelligent passenger decides to solve a complex problem himself alone, instead of waking up like the whole 250 engineering crew of the ship. OK, we all expect a couple of goofs in any standard reasonable SF movie, it is difficult to keep track of all details and even good movies miss things. But when you hear a stupid idea every couple of minutes for the entire half of the movie when something actually happens, then the movie is crap. Good pictures though, loved the graphical effects. And the final completely weird finale to put the cherry on top: what is one young loving beautiful heterosexual couple expected to do alone, their entire lifetime, on a spaceship with 5000 vacant seats available ?... I would have said ""children"". Well, guess what: they decided to just plant a lot of trees."
"jason-210","6","60","96","7 March 2017"," An good sci-fi flick with some excellent special effects.
","Note that this contains spoilers. If you haven't watched the film, I suggest you do before reading this.<br/><br/>The first hour or so of this film was fantastic. Just taking in the spacecraft with all its amazingly conceived features, was reminiscent of the first part of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It also struck me as being a realistic version of the type of spacecraft in Wall-E (think of the little cleaner droids, buzzing around, fixing things and cleaning the mess the characters make!) The premise of being alone on a vast, automated, self-repairing craft that is aware of your presence and provides all the conveniences you require, was an interesting concept. The technology and physics seemed plausible, cool, and realistic; and the special effects were restrained and effective. The robot bartender was fascinating, and provided some welcome entertainment.<br/><br/>For the first hour the story seemed meaningful and thought-provoking, but after that it began to fall apart. A major aspect of the plot during the first half of the movie was being unable to get to the crews' quarters to wake them up, and the hopelessness of the situation because of this.<br/><br/>Then, as if by magic, one of the crew wakes up, says there's something wrong with the ship, wanders around a bit, then dies. From then on it seemed to me like the script had been taken over by a different person, there to ensure the film served the public the usual smattering of sensationalist action scenes at expense of both the plot and plausibility of science. There is a brief promise of mystery as the trio realised there was something wrong with the ship and tried to figure out what it was, but this quickly evaporates as the problem turns out to be nothing more than a faulty nuclear reactor that is heading for self-destruction.<br/><br/>The obvious thing to have done here would have been to wake more of the crew, now that they had access, to see what could be done. However, we are told there is not time for that, so the protagonist miraculously fixes the nuclear reactor all by himself. What a genius! This involved finding and hot-swapping a replacement circuit board, getting blasted into space, being spectacularly rescued by his female companion, dying, and finally brought back to life by having about a dozen or so different resuscitation techniques applied to him at once by a machine! Yeah. Face palm."

Some spoilers ahead:<br/><br/>1. A woman passes out while in a bubble of water, effectively drowning, then miraculously ""wakes up"", while still in the water a few minutes later just because the bubble splashes down into a pool. <br/><br/>2. On multiple occasions people slipping on something and crash landing on their back leaves no damage other than them simply getting up and saying ""ouch"" as if it's a cartoon. <br/><br/>3. Male lead withstands thermonuclear blast at the end without as much as a heat rash, then runs out of oxygen due to a cracked helmet and drifts into space, but instead of freezing and suffocating when the air runs out gets rescued by his girlfriend who simply jumps off the star- ship in his general direction and miraculously catches him.<br/><br/>4. Out of 5000 pods, the one of the guy they really need malfunctions, who wakes up, explains how they can save the ship (which he's completely unqualified for given his job), and then being the token black guy, dies pretty much straight away.<br/><br/>6. Woman suffers major upper body trauma but carries on as if nothing happens.<br/><br/>With a bit of care to some details and without the totally artificial and forced happy ending this could have been really good.

Only his, so he's the only person on the entire ship awakened early and there is another 90 years or so until destination arrival and allegedly there is no way to repair the pod on a ship with the most advanced tech equipment known to humanity.

","I dislike reviews that summarize the plot or discuss the plot unless the latter is done to support an opinion. So, I will not do this in this review. Here are my thoughts and impressions.<br/><br/>This film that was a very pleasant surprise. I had no expectations and enjoyed seeing the two actors (Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence) in a genre film and role I hadn't seen them in before. My only previous experience of seeing these two on the screen previously were 5 year engagement (which I LOVE) and hunger games (meh, its okay).<br/><br/>These two are great in this film. There is a great chemistry and given the romantic turn this film takes, it works. <br/><br/>The plot is great too--I like how the film explores the nature of space travel and the realistic challenges that it creates in the life of mere mortal humans. I also enjoyed seeing these characters grapple with some very serious predicaments that forced some decisions that could be viewed as selfish and suddenly turns to be completely unselfish.<br/><br/>This film is not a run of the mill film--it has some great ideas and perhaps even themes (if you give it some thought) that are explored exceptionally well."
"Yumna402","10","168","305","21 December 2016"," I loved it
","Spoilers!<br/><br/>In this movie, passengers Jim's hibernation pod malfunctions. He spends a year in utter loneliness until he decides to wake up another passenger. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is spectacular in this movie. It reminded me of why I love her so much. She's just so talented and really brings on the emotion. The scenes where she was upset and unhappy or excited and delighted I really felt it all with her. Honestly, she's just such a phenomenal actress and I really don't get why anyone thinks she's overrated.<br/><br/>My favorite scenes are probably after Aurora finds out Jim woke her up. The raw emotion and feelings that I experience while watching is what makes Jennifer Lawrence so astounding. <br/><br/>Chris Pratt is also incredible. The emotion he is able to invoke in viewers is incredible. I loved him in Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy, and in Passengers he does just as well. <br/><br/>A movie with such a small cast needs actors who can deliver. And deliver they did. The other members of the cast include Lawrence Fishburne and Michael Sheen. I haven't really seen any of their movies before (at least none that I can remember) but they were both pretty damn outstanding in the movie.<br/><br/>I love the story of the movie, it feels original and exciting. <br/><br/>So why is this movie so unpopular with critics? I mean the cast is fantastic and the story feels incredibly original. <br/><br/>I mean honestly, with critics, there is really nothing to worry about. Critics will dislike everything for absolutely no justifiable reason, and for movies, critics represents the tiny insignificant minority (ouch, right?). Who cares about critics? We should start a revolution against them because honestly no one cares anymore. <br/><br/>Some of the best movies have the worst critic ratings. Some critics think their job is to find everything wrong with something and rant about it. <br/><br/>What's more important is the people who actually see the movie, who make up the vast majority of moviegoers. Critics are literally insignificant really. <br/><br/>I was surprised to see that some people said that Passengers was misogynistic with a flawed story. I have to say that I strongly disagree. <br/><br/>The idea of Passengers is about a man stranded alone on a ship, destined to die. The movie examines the human condition. The loneliness he feels is unquestionable (at one point he is close to committing suicide.) Jon Sphaits (the writer) wrote a script that asks the important and difficult questions. What would you do?<br/><br/>Like they say in the movie, Jim is very similar to a drowning man, he will do anything he thinks will save him. Loneliness causes him to wake up another passenger. And this movie I felt dealt with it appropriately. <br/><br/>And I am not trying to justify his actions, because they are undoubtedly wrong, however, I strongly believe that everyone would've done the same thing had they been in the same situation. Besides the fact that Jim redeems himself in the end by allowing Aurora the choice she was never given."

","My initial thoughts after first seeing the trailer for Passengers was that it was a gross excuse to put Hollywood's two hottest actors on screen together. I saw that the critics had given this abysmal reviews and I wasn't surprised. I was however surprised to see that user reviews contradicted what critics had to say. Reviews contained descriptors like unexpected, great acting, suspense and the like. Well let me tell you this film was none of those. Passengers was forgettable. It wasn't bad, it wasn't good, it just was. Like I said, nothing more than an excuse to have studly guy and sexy girl on screen and cash some cheques while they were at it. The visuals were meh, the acting was passable, the script was something a fourth grader could have written. I feel like I've seen this movie 100 times in some different form. I'm only writing this to detract from the other user reviews that say to ignore what the critics are saying. Though it's not terrible it DEFINITELY isn't worth going out to see."

","OK, the whole movie is hanging on the idea that in future spaceship engineers and designers are complete morons.<br/><br/>First of all, the shape of the spaceship. Come on. Secondly, no one ever will send 5000 people on a 120 year journey without the crew rotating in and out of hibernation precisely for the purpose of managing the emergencies. That would be insane on many levels, yet this is the premise of the movie.<br/><br/>Thirdly, in Space everything has a backup, or you die. It's fricking Space. But in our case if your hibernation pod malfunctions you can't go back into hibernation. Because pods are ""fail-proof"". ""Cant' break"". It would've been my first question at the presentation, ""Um, sorry, but if my pod craps out, is there a way to put me back into sleep? And will there be anyone on duty to do it? What? No and no? Really? OK, thank you, good bye.""<br/><br/>On a psychological level ""Passengers"" makes even less sense. If someone literally ruins your life and all your hopes, you don't forgive him and live happily ever after with him. Doesn't happen. Could've been a cool stalker/survival horror movie, but no, screenwriters aren't smart enough to pull something like that off.<br/><br/>One more thing - if you're directly at the exhaust hatch of a huge thermonuclear reactor when that hatch opens - you die. Movie ends right there. Unless screenwriters are idiots. Then you live.<br/><br/>Also if you pass that close to a star its gravity sucks you in.

"Robotvideo","4","37","61","10 April 2017"," Definition of Script Problems
","In all science fiction, suspension of disbelief is required to become engaged in the story. However, what the writers of Passengers fail to realize is that suspension of disbelief applies to technology, not human stupidity. The audience can overlook warp drive, ray guns, transporters, etc., but what can't be overlooked is a total lack of common sense in using this technology. There were many opportunities for interesting story lines, but Passengers attempts to patch plot holes that don't work instead of exploring concepts that do.<br/><br/>The story centers around a star ship with 5000 passengers and over 200 crew members placed in hibernation for a 120 year trip to another star system to colonize another planet. This part of the story is plausible and even thought provoking. Even the ship itself is based on realistic designs. The science behind this background is sound. The ship is traveling at half the speed of light to a star system 60 light years away for a 120 year trip. Passengers are placed in hibernation to make the trip. So far all of this works and is interesting, but this is about a 5 minute background setting. After that things fall apart. Two passengers are accidentally awoken 90 years too early and face death from old age out in the void of space before reaching a destination. To make this plot work, the unbelievable is required. First, no one is watching the ship, not even automation. If this was a real ship, when an anomaly is detected the crew would be awoken to take care of the problem and put back into hibernation even if they do not take shifts over the century long trip. Second, there is no way to get a person back into hibernation in any way whatsoever. On a trip like this, that disbelief cannot be suspended, because it is too absurd to imagine. There are other things about this story that cannot be disbelieved, but the ones I have mentioned make this plot fall apart.<br/><br/>One aspect that is interesting, but not properly explored is the reference to The Shining that dominates the movie. When this reference is first introduced the parallels to the insanity that develops from isolation or even possibly a haunted ship were obvious and the prospect exciting. However, the movie does not explore this and the reference is relegated to a running joke. Unfortunate.<br/><br/>The setup of the plot has so many possibilities, but you will end this movie realizing that it is a classic example of a problem script that piles on the increasingly absurd and unbelievable in an attempt to cover the holes."

","<ul><li>This review does contain spoilers -</li></ul><br/><br/>With all those spaceship analogies along the movie, it's impossible not to relate those two romantic stereotypical movies! Except Titanic didn't got the ending so wrong. Passengers begins as a fine movie, and derails real quickly when Chris Pratt discovers how he can wake someone up. Right then and there I couldn't understand why, for the love of what's sacred, wouldn't he wake up someone who could actually help him solve his issue. He had access to everyone files, I'm sure he could figure something out. Oh no, of course the obvious choice is to chose a female, stalk her, and wake her up without she being able to give him consent. What a lame excuse to try and explain it by saying ""a man drowning will try to drag someone down with him. It's not pretty but the man was drowning"". Seriously, Morpheus? Give me a break!<br/><br/>When they both got out of the ship to do their space bungee jump, that scenario and that music seemed taken out from a very bad Disney movie.<br/><br/>So, Morpheus dies (how convenient him being the third to wake up, a person who knows exactly what to do, right?), they discover what's wrong and go fix it. There's this ridiculous ball of fire they need to take out or the whole spaceship will blow up, and for that, Pratt's character has to go out, hold a door open and die burning while letting the fire get out. Except he doesn't die, cause his suit and a small door he takes as a shield are, apparently, enough to take the heat of a meteorite that almost ended the whole spaceship. And for the romance, right? He gets out of it with only a small hole in his suit and a broken cord. Totally not feasible. Him flying through space, when his cord breaks after fixing the whole thing reminded me of Gravity. The scenes at bar reminded me of The Shining. And that was all that was good with this movie, besides Pratt's and Lawrence's pretty faces.<br/><br/>Then comes his resuscitation. I laughed through the whole scene. First she gets out of the spaceship, floats towards him, and of course she can't reach him cause her cord ends, then, of course, she reaches his cord and pulls him. Then we watch a 138 pounds woman, carrying a 250 pounds man to the robotic infirmary and resuscitating him. I can't describe the absurdity of this scene. He's getting oxygen, while he's taking shots on his legs and neck, while he is getting an electric current to the chest wall. Then he wakes up just fine. Not even a brain damage (obviously).<br/><br/>You think the absurdity is over, but no. 88 years later and he messed up the specimens that were being carried in the ship, I mean, they were obviously there to be used in the planet, or for people to learn stuff, maybe? Whatever it was, it surely wasn't to make a little forest in the ship? I mean, why? How did the mechanic became a biologist who could create the right environment for that? That was just so awful my eyes hurt, there were even birds flying inside, I could not believe I was actually seeing that.<br/><br/>It can be called sci-fi just as much as 10.000 BC can be called historically accurate! Unfortunately that's not how people seem to be taking it. This is gonna be a bad year for movies."
"kelmech","1","159","300","27 December 2016"," Appalling on so many fronts
","Fair warning, this review contains spoilers, don't read it at all if you want to see this piece of trash movie.<br/><br/>My goodness. This is the most disturbing film I've seen in so long, perhaps ever. But first, the general comments outside of the disturbing part. This film is about a man (Chris Pratt) on an intergalactic journey on a ship with 5000 passengers and almost 300 crew who, due to a malfunction in his hibernation pod wakes up 90 years before his destination, all alone. It's about the problems he encounters and how he solves them.<br/><br/>That premise could make for an interesting movie in someone else's hands, but in writer Jon Spaihts version, it's one gapingly huge deus ex machina after another of impossible and unexplainable events, from medical to gravity/science to even the hospitality industry. You might expect a few of those, and if the story in general holds up, those can be overlooked, but, the story in general doesn't hold up and isn't believable. In fact, the science is so poor that I'd say this is a movie set in space rather than a science fiction movie--there's been no attempt to create any kind of cohesive scientific setting or environment. <br/><br/>Now for the big spoiler. The main problem I have with this movie is it takes a hugely immoral, rape-y act and makes it the basis for a love story. Also, general sexism up the wazoo.<br/><br/>Journalist Aurora (Get it? is the Sleeping Beauty reference beating you over the head enough?--If not, her last name is Lane, as in Lois Lane.) is another passenger asleep in her own hibernation pod, and Jim discovers her while wondering around alone. At some point, just after a year in, he makes the decision to wake her up so he can have company, even though he is condemning her to a life with just him and no one else and ruining whatever dreams she had of her new life on the new colony. This isn't spur of the moment. It's premeditated. He doesn't wake her up because she has special skills that can help him and the other passengers survive, he wakes her up because she's hot, and he's fallen a little in lust with her. He doesn't tell her he woke her up, and lets her think that her pod, too, malfunctioned.<br/><br/>In fact, when Aurora does find out, after they've had repeated hot sex and he's about to give her a ring, she tells him he's murdered her. <br/><br/>The story of the big pseudo-sciency-sort of problems they solve and how it brings them back together is rendered obscene by his taking away her life, her destiny, her choices. Jim's not a hero. In fact, the casting of sweet pretty boy Pratt instead of whoever today's Crispin Glover equivalent is makes it even worse.<br/><br/>Even the overslick lucite cool monochromatic palette shiny black production says bachelor dudes. <br/><br/>And Aurora? Aurora's dream, which Jim dashed forever, is mentioned and then killed, too. Her dream was to travel millions of light years away, stay on the new planet of Homestead II for one year, then go back to her home in New York about 450 years in the future and write about her year on the planet, because ""no one has ever gone to the colonies and come back before."" <br/><br/>It seems like someone with that kind of panache would have enough going for her, but nope, apparently not. Partway through the film, we see her looking at video from her going away party, where her best friend tells her ""I hope you find someone who fills your heart and I hope you let him in."" The film ends with a sickly voice-over proclaiming ""Jim and I live our accidental happiness. We are all passengers — we go where life takes us"".<br/><br/>I'm sorry I saw this movie. What a trash heap."
"guinsguy","10","47","82","5 January 2017"," Great Concept, Great Performances, Great Movie
","I will never understand how so many critics and, by extension, the ""word of mouth"" that ferments following their reviews, can be so wrong. This movie is a perfect example.<br/><br/>The first time that I heard about the concept, I was intrigued and really started looking forward to it. Also, I like both Chris Pratt and, despite her recent annoying public forays into the PC world of Hollywood, Jennifer Lawrence. Both actors seem genuine, don't fall into the overacting habit in an attempt for critical accolades and make enjoyable movies. No performance in this movie was a let down, even the very limited time for Lawrence Fishburne who, again, is someone who doesn't disappoint. The story is well developed and the cinematography blows you away, particularly on a 3D screen. Granted, not the same concept as another great movie, Intersteller, but similar in ""feel."" Just like that movie, there's a lot of ""what ifs"" that make you think. One of the biggest is Chris Pratt's dealing with the question of waking up another passenger because of his own loneliness. I think anyone would have done the same and it wasn't haphazardly tossed aside as a given.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't say enough good things about this movie and I really hope it doesn't get cast aside with so many other highly anticipated/marketed movies that fail to perform as much at the box office. Excellent movie overall and well worth your time. Give it a chance and you'll be blown away."
"bjornarsvingen","9","69","125","28 December 2016"," Great sci-fi fairy tale, but some all too obvious physics/science errors
","First I must say I really enjoyed this movie. A love drama in space is not a very usual theme for a movie. As the movie unravels, I was wondering more and more about how this will end, because there is no obvious path, anything would be possible. I liked the end, it was the only end that would make any kind of sense, yet it was a mystery all the way.<br/><br/>Great actors of course, great effects etc. simply a joy for the eyes. A great fairy tale in space, absolutely worth viewing.<br/><br/>Then all the physics mistakes. I have seen enough movies, sci-fi and others, to not let physics errors destroy the fun. I take them as part of the amusement. Still, I cannot stop wondering why these multi-million projects cannot hire one single person with some master degree in physics/engineering to at least filter out the all too obvious ones.<br/><br/>1. The ship is traveling at 50% of the speed of light. Then they ""sling shot"" around a star in a spectacular view for the passengers. At that speed there would be nothing to view. It would be all over in a microsecond. Secondly, the view would be all distorted due to relativity effects. Thirdly, there shouldn't be any passengers to view it, yet the ship announces it of the loudspeakers!! Why they would need to sling shot in the first place, is also a mystery considering the obvious and rather insane brute force of the ship (50% of light speed and plowing through asteroids).<br/><br/>2. The gravity on the ship is caused by the whole vessel rotating, centrifugal force. Then there is a scene when the rotation just stops, creating some spectacular effects in the swimming pool. Why should the rotation stop in the first place? But, getting passed that question, stopping the rotation in an instance would case an acceleration in the tangential direction of several g's (infinite in fact). The ship would disintegrate. Lets say the rotation stopped gradually, there would be a tangential acceleration lasting over that period of time causing the water in the swimming pool to first flow towards the wall. The rotation also starts in an instance. Well, it is all very, very wrong in the movie.<br/><br/>3. The ""thermonuclear"" engines are at full speed. The space ship is constantly accelerating. This will also cause an acceleration giving the effect of gravitation on board. Yet the engine starts and stops with no apparent effect.<br/><br/>4. The engines are at full speed and both Jim and Aurora do space walks. This would simply not be possible, because the ship would accelerate away from them.<br/><br/>5. The ship has a ""force shield"" that clean up rocks in the path. No matter how you look at this, cleaning out rocks and asteroids in front will cause the ship to slow down and wriggle from side to side if the rocks do not hit 100% straight on. Again, the acceleration (gravity) effects on the ship would be insane. The mass of that ship is nothing compared to those asteroids it travels through.<br/><br/>6. Jim survives the ""exhaust gases"" of a thermonuclear reactor. This may not actually be that far out, since these gases were only there as a ventilation mechanism, To let out the steam so to speak. It is not clear exactly what the reactor is. Still, the reactor would have to be some fusion reactor of some kind and insanely hot viewed from the inside of the ship.<br/><br/>7. The engineering of the ship's systems. What can I say. There is no such thing as a fail safe system. The whole thing seems very messy indeed, designed by a 10 year old.<br/><br/>8. The food problem. Two person would need a lot of food for 90 years. The ship was designed to have all the people suspended in hibernation, thus no need for any larger supply of food or any need for recycling mechanisms or that sort of things. This does not add up in the movie."
"saranedelka","5","63","114","17 January 2017"," Good ideas, Bad scenario
","I had really great expectations for this movie, and maybe that's the reason why I was so disappointed. Of course, all the actors are great, and even though the direction is not bad, it's really a typical love movie scenario, with the doubt at the beginning, the intense love, the betrayal, and finally the traditional happy ending. That could've been good without all the inconsistencies there are. For example, why didn't they thought to resurrect the captain, just as Aurora did for Jim? And there was enough place for both of them in the end. It would be Titanic all over again if Rose had decided to stay in the water with Jack. Not a bad movie, some ideas are great : leaving a man alone with his thoughts and robots to see his attitude evolve is interesting, the fact that he sacrificed a life instead of staying alone too, but those ideas could've been pushed so much further if they did not decided to focus on their love story. Honorable mention to Arthur, the best character in my opinion."

","""Passengers"" takes place on a spaceship, travelling for 120 years, at half the speed of light, to a new planet. Before criticising the science, think of how far our knowledge and technology have advanced in the last hundred or thousand years ; and extrapolate that forward, to whenever the movie is supposed to be set. Imagine Shakespeare's company performing Titanic, The Longest Day, or Apollo 13 ; and how the critics of his day would have panned the implausible science. Either put your scepticism aside, or let it spoil your enjoyment.<br/><br/>When Jim is woken from hibernation, 90 years before reaching their destination, he is certain to be dead before they arrive. Faced with a lifetime of solitary confinement, he contemplates suicide, but can't go through with it ; so instead considers waking one of the other passengers. To all the critics and posters who say he did the wrong thing, try to imagine his position ; not only no physical contact with friends, but no messages, and not even the interaction with guards that a prisoner has. This article gives an insight : http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2009/03/30/hellhole Even if we, in our socially-rich circumstances, think he should have accepted his fate ; we should at least recognise he had ""diminished responsibility"" when he made the choice.<br/><br/>Waking Aurora doesn't condemn her to the same fate of solitude, but instead to a lifetime with someone she might not have chosen, in a place she might not have chosen ; bad, but nowhere near as bad. Having forced her into a new life plan, he then sets about trying to make the best of it ; to make her time with him so good, that if she could wind back the clock, she would have made the choice that he made for her. Perhaps that is the only possible way, to measure if he atoned for his action. <br/><br/>The way the two main characters interact, is very engaging ; and there is enough action and danger to spice up what is otherwise ""just"" a love story.<br/><br/>BIG SPOILER BELOW<br/><br/>If you prefer an unhappy ending, as you are leaving the theatre, trip over and fall flat on your face."

","I should start by saying that I think this film gets a lot of things right. It's very real, it's very beautiful, it's wonderfully acted, it's interesting and engaging. But I have a MASSIVE problem with the central premise, and I am astonished to the point of outrage that other user reviews completely ignore this glaring, morally bankrupt problem.<br/><br/>**SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER**<br/><br/>I am glad that the movie takes the time to have Jim think very carefully about whether or not to wake Aurora. I am totally on board with the emotional anguish Jim must have felt, with no human contact for over a year. I have sympathy for his situation.<br/><br/>BUT!!!!!!<br/><br/>What he did in waking Aurora was an abuse of power. He ignored her right to choice (and she had chosen to be in extended hibernation until the ship docked in Homestead). He woke her for entirely selfish (albeit understandable) reasons. When Aurora tells Gus - rightly - that Jim's actions are tantamount to murder, he basically responds, ""get over it, what was the poor guy to do?"" And none of us should be okay with that.<br/><br/>This plot device is deeply disturbing because it propagates the view that men's emotions are more important than women's. It's okay for men to abuse their power/authority if there are ""extenuating circumstances""- and if there are, then the victim (woman/other man/child) just needs to shush up already. The victim's trauma is immaterial if the perpetrator was feeling upset/stressed/unhappy/whatever.<br/><br/>Look. I understand that Jim was suffering in his loneliness. But what happened to him was an accident; what happened to Aurora was Jim's choice, and he had no right to make that choice.<br/><br/>And what makes it worse is that this moral travesty is being sold to us as a love story. What exactly was Aurora going to do, stuck on a ship with only one other human being? Of course she was going to form an emotional connection with Jim. But that's not love, it's called Stockholm Syndrome. And once it developed, the manipulative, victim/abuser dynamic was established. Aurora's choice to stay awake with Jim was not a choice - it was impossible for her to regain agency by that point.<br/><br/>I want to like this film and I thought the actors were fabulous - Jennifer Lawrence, especially. But I'm sorry - I just can't get past the implicit message that abuse of power in relationships is ever okay. Keep your kids away from this one."

With 3 human characters, there is also absolutely no threat nor tension. At one point in the film, an allusion is made to being stranded on a desert island and this is the point in a nutshell: with a little rewriting, this story could have been set in the middle of the Pacific with a volcano as the present danger.

"artmania90","5","87","171","16 January 2017"," Titanic in space... for dumb people
","The premise for PASSENGERS is a smart one, so are the actors. What if you awoke on a 120-year mission on a voyage to a new planet only 30 years in? With no chance to go back to sleep, you are a castaway amongst a sea of people who you will never meet. This turned out to be a movie of 'what-ifs,' with an ending that was so silly and left me moaning out of annoyance. So much could have been explored had the writers used half their brain.<br/><br/>This is Morten Tyldum's first directorial work since ""The Imitation Game"" which was a fine movie about code-breakers in WWII. Here is a movie that is more simple. Jim (Chris Pratt) is the unfortunate man who awakes far ahead of his colleagues. At first, he doesn't know what is happening. He comes out of cryo-sleep and follows the normal protocol and settles into his room aboard the spaceship. Were he to have awoke at the proper time, they would have had 4 months of life on board to adjust before heading to their new planet (an earth-like home that provides an escape from those wishing to leave their homes behind). Jim quickly sees the problem, alone on a ship with no one to talk to (besides a chatty robotic bartender who was clearly written to serve as a lazy plot device. Notice how none of the other robotic aids on board look remotely human). He explores the empty space and spends a year in isolation before even making contact with anyone.<br/><br/>Here is where the trailer led us astray. I would argue that the trailer set up an entirely different movie, because the occurrences that lead Jim to meet Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence, what a coincidental name for an actual sleeping beauty) are morally gray and make our hero an altogether bad man. I don't want to spoil it, but the film is so silly that it seems like a waste if I don't. Jim falls in love with Aurora after walking by her in cryo- sleep. He reads about her, listens to her recordings. Faced with a future alone, he makes the choice to wake her up and essentially commit murder by denying her the chance to wake up with the others 100 years from now. No matter his actions, this is a corrupt action that (love story or not) turns Jim from lovable to villainous.<br/><br/>Of course they fall in love, and as luck would have it another crew member is woken up (Lawrence Fishburne) who helps them realize that there is a fatal error on board that could lead to the destruction of the ship. Like the bartender (played by Michael Sheen mind you), here is another character that was lazily included and dumbs down the plot by turning the story into a clichéd action flick. Yes, Aurora discovers that Jim woke her up, but in the end they still manage to say their ""I love you's"" before heroically saving the 5,000 sleeping passengers on board and living out the rest of their lives in a Stockholm- syndrome lover extravaganza.<br/><br/>The movie could have been interesting if it stuck with one character learning to live by himself. It also could have been interesting to see what would happen if Jim and Aurora managed to fall back to sleep and meet again 100 years from now. Would they still fall in love? I liked the idea but didn't care for the actual story. Lawrence and Pratt are fine actors, but even their chemistry can't save this sinking ship. One trailer declared that this was ""Titanic in the stars."" That's quite a statement. Maybe they were referring to the actual wreck and not the plot."

","The trailers to this film gives the impression that it's something of a weepy romance set aboard a spaceship . Guess what ? If nothing else at least the trailers are being relatively honest and to be honest I almost gave the movie a miss due to its predictable content , but decided to give it a chance to find it perhaps wasn't as predictable as I predicted it to be . Even so I still came away thinking it was a missed opportunity <br/><br/>Let me explain . The pivotal plot element of ""Person waking up prematurely while in hyper-space"" is not only a good one but had been done earlier in the first season of SPACE 1999 which led to one of the most shocking endings I have seen in a TV show . Here however it really only exists to set up a story which will involve two people falling in love . Hey don't report me for giving away the story because this is exactly what happens . To its credit PASSENGERS does include a couple of twists involving obsession , betrayal of sorts and redemption and being something of an angst ridden tortured poet myself I did find myself being swept along to a degree as to the character interaction between Jim and Aurora and more specifically as to if Jim will be found out <br/><br/>It's hardly the most complicated film of 2016 and I found myself wishing for a more complex and darker type of movie . As you can imagine - and imagination is in short supply from the Hollywood studios - you can't have this type of film without two good looking leads . The truth is Chris Pratt is maybe a little too handsome and hunky . How about a scenario where Jim is played by Robert Carlyle or Andy Serkis ? In other words someone who it's slightly difficult to fall in love with ? Love like life itself is a horrible , really horrible thing but not if it's featured in a Hollywood movie it seems"

","This film is bad. Its not bad in a funny way, its just bad.<br/><br/>There are elements from past sci-fi films in Passengers DNA that make you hope that the film will pick up in pace, or quality, which sadly never happens.<br/><br/>This film is flat, dull, with flat characters that you probably do not care for.<br/><br/>I feel bad for larry fishburne who has seen better roles in his career.

"abbyrandolph98","10","73","143","22 December 2016"," Doesn't deserve the negative reviews
","Even though I normally enjoy everything Jennifer Lawrence is in, I was kind of bummed out by the early reviews of this film. I read many calling the film ""creepy"" and I now that I've seen it, I highly disagree. If you don't already know, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), wakes up 90 years too early on a voyage to a colony planet due to a pod malfunction. For more than a year, Jim is alone, his only companion being a robot bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen). At this point you feel for Pratt's character as you see the unhappiness fold across the screen. After almost taking his own life, Jim sees Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) asleep in her pod. Jim begins to have what some would call an obsession, constantly watching videos of Aurora and reading articles she had written as a journalist on Earth. After weeks of contemplation and long talks with Arthur, Jim decides to wake Aurora so that he wouldn't have to live the remainder of his life alone. <br/><br/>Why this film got so many negative reviews, I couldn't tell you. I loved every second of it. Pratt and Lawrence had chemistry that lit up the screen, it was visually stunning, and the acting was some of the best I've seen in a while. As for reviewers calling the film ""creepy"", I say to make that decision for yourself. In Jim's defense, I couldn't imagine being the only person awake on a ship that wouldn't land until I was dead, but maybe that's just me. <br/><br/>If you are curious about this film, I urge you to go see it- you won't be disappointed."

","Passengers is an excellent film, great cast, very enjoyable. I don't understand why people, and critics are giving it bad reviews, it deserves better than that, it is certainly a much more satisfying watch than Arrival which leaves you feeling cheated, and yet at the time I write this Arrival has an 8.4 rating, and Passengers 6.6. <br/><br/>Chris Pratt and Jenifer Lawrence are a pleasure to watch, if you're a fan of these two, then I don't think you'll be disappointed. The story keeps you interested all the way through, good writing, good directing, great visuals, and a few laughs thrown in too.

"hajnalrita","1","71","139","31 December 2016"," This movie is everything but a sci-fi
","This movie is everything but a sci-fi, and please don't compare it to Interstellar, or any other space movie. This movie should be removed from the sci-fi genre, as it has nothing to do with science, it is basically a good old American love story, sugarcoated so badly it melts on the screen. Just because the story is set in space on a spaceship doesn't mean it deserves to be called a science fiction. What a waste of cast and money, what a waste of my time watching it. This story could have had so much potential, instead of just showing good old stupid and weak human thinking. Does anyone honestly believe that once we become space traveling species, colonizing other planets millions of light years away humans would still crave for the good old lifestyle we crave for today on planet Earth, like egoistic needs, marriage, live happily ever after, etc.. Really? This is usually what irritates me the most with some sci-fi movies, they bring the story into a distant future, but forget to align the thinking and understanding of their characters along the line. By the way, the most ridiculous scene in the movie was when they both stood in front of a panoramic window and watched a red giant as the spaceship flew by while holding each other romantically. Again, what an unrealistic piece of garbage this idea was, it was so bad it made me laugh very very-very hard. Go watch it teenage girls and boys, keep fantasizing about a lifetime love, a love of your life, a prince charming on a white horse. For any other true hardcore sci-fi fans out there DO NOT WATCH IT!!"
"varnium","9","39","72","2 January 2017"," Memorable Scifi Love Story
","This is perhaps one of the most memorable scifi love story ever made. I mean it really. It's so great that it should rival The Titanic. I just don't understand why people would say it otherwise.<br/><br/>From the scifi aspect, it is super fantastic. Every technology available on the ship was in fact real science and nothing science fiction about it. Especially if we look at what humans can achieve today. Well except for the artificial gravity technology. I just think that artificial gravity is too far fetch and it will remain science fiction for centuries to come. The only possible artificial gravity that is not science fiction, is a gravity caused by centrifugal force, just like in ""The Martian"" movie or ""Elysium"" movie. The ships overall design is artistic, very cool, and unique. If there are people who despise the ship's design, then they are people who won't accept the perfect harmony of technology and art.<br/><br/>The other technology used, like holograms, electronic glass, automated robots, and advance AI, are also real science. There are no fiction about them. The fact that the ship carries all spare parts with it is also a brilliant idea and will actually be a common sense. I mean why not? With decades to travel, surely, something will go wrong. Thus spare parts will be deemed necessary for long voyage across the galaxy.<br/><br/>Well, enough said about the scifi aspect. Let's start about the love story.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is a perfect actress for this movie. She's hot and pretty. She's able to act seriously at some scenes. She's able to show signs of frustration, hatred, anger, hopelessness, and sadness all at once. I mean she's just perfect for that character.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the male counterpart is not as amazing as she was. The studio should have chosen another actor, because he just doesn't seem to fit in the overall movie. He can't show the perfect emotion as he should have in many scenes. Tom Cruise would probably give more in-depth personality for that character. This is a flaw that the studio made.<br/><br/>The love story itself is rather alluring. Motivated by loneliness, a male will seek out his counterpart to be his spouse. This is the perfect analogy to every human being in this world. The female character then show up and slowly fell in love with the male character. At first, many people would think of it as cheesy. But actually, it made perfect sense. As the only couple in the ship with nothing else to do for decades to come, they might as well hook up and make babies. It's not cheesy, it's perfect logical sense.<br/><br/>Despite all of that, they should have changed the ending scene. Seeing a huge tree and plants growing all over the ship was just terrible. It doesn't fit the expected emotion.<br/><br/>The studio could have made the male character permanently die. It'll leave a perfect romantic scar within the audiences heart. Just like the Titanic movie. Such condition, will make this movie memorable. But if the studio want to make a happy ending, then it is more suitable to show the descendants of the main characters. Well, either way, the ending scene ruined the entire romantic emotion that all audience had."
"cristiandeiana","7","37","68","28 December 2016"," I really enjoyed the journey we are taken on through with the depth of the characters and their experience.
","I really enjoyed this movie and it's a shame that it's somehow attracted some very negative reviews, so I'd like to take this chance to respond to some of the negativity that I've read and why I think it's a great movie.<br/><br/>The conclusion of one of the reviews I read was basically this 'This movie is by stupid people for stupid people. Tons of missed opportunities. Good leads. But stupid people, stupid people everywhere.' A bit ridiculous really, but what some people seem to think is that the movie lacks a plausible realism in several areas. But to that I say this, it's a sci-fi movie, of course it's not going to be realistic, I don't watch a sci-fi movie to check if everything passes my satisfaction of realism, and I think it defeats the whole point of what the movie is trying to achieve. Sure maybe if I was a scientist or something I might realise how the movie is somewhat stupid in regard to real science, but I'm not, and yet I'm certainly not stupid.<br/><br/>Another point I've read is that the relationship between the two protagonists is not realistic, and that in reality if she found out what he did she wouldn't forgive him and how their relationship was merely based around playing basketball and some dancing game. I actually thing there's great depth in the relationship between these two characters and the movie spends a great amount of time building this. *big spoiler alert* I think the conclusion that she would want to spend her life with him despite what he did is a plausible one, I think she could have very well realised that him being an engineer and the 1 person who got awoken was an ideal person to fix the ship and actually save everyone's lives. Also he clearly wouldn't have been able to succeed in doing so if he didn't have her help, so he actually needed to wake her in order to save the ship. She in turn also played a role in saving everyone and actually they are both heroes, and this becomes far more important in the grand scheme of things. Also there's a moment when she tells him to make sure he comes back because she can't live on the ship alone, so we can clearly see how she's understood why he did what he did.<br/><br/>Lastly, and this point I actually agree with somewhat, is that the act of the guy waking her up wasn't a choice of pick someone who might help to fix the ship, but instead a creepy choice as he get's obsessed with her and sleeps with her without telling her the truth. Well partly I'd say look, we're all human, humans aren't perfect and you will always have people out there who'll do immoral things. Also at the end of the day this guy did spend over a year alone, that's plenty of time to lose your mind and do stupid sh**. Overall we are given the message that what he did was OK, and despite what he did we are supposed to like this character by the end of the movie. Sure we could have easily had a negative ending where he get's some karma for what he did, and it all could have ended more negatively, I suppose more like a thriller than a romance, which would have completely changed the whole dynamics of the film. Still, I like how the movie makes us ask these questions, and actually succeeds to show us the message of how human beings are not perfect, we can make mistakes but we can also make up for them.<br/><br/>Overall I'm very satisfied with the ending and I really enjoyed the journey we are taken on through with the depth of the characters and their experiences. Only in a sci-fi setting could we have experienced such a story and the certain questions it presents us with, which is a sign of a great movie. Also it is paced very well and the build up to the climax is executed wonderfully."
"tigerfish50","1","72","142","25 December 2016"," Romantic Disaster in Space
","The trailer for 'Passengers' promises mystery and suspense, but the finished product is just a luke-warm romance spiced up with some tepid thrills at the conclusion. Its threadbare plot kicks off several hundred years in the future, with a spaceship encountering comet debris a quarter way through its 120 year journey to another solar system. The vessel sustains damage and starts to malfunction, awakening one of the 5000 hibernating colonists aboard. With no way to put himself back to sleep, this unlucky Jim faces the dismal prospect of spending the rest of his life alone on the vessel. Unaware of a growing crisis in the ship's vitals, Jim passes the next year discussing his dilemma with a supercilious android bartender, playing solo basketball and unsuccessfully trying to break into the sleeping crew's quarters to seek help. Eventually he decides to wake another colonist - an airhead journalist called Aurora - for some company and romance.<br/><br/>After this so-so set-up, it's soon clear screenwriter Spaihts has nowhere to go, and his script's most appropriate destination would have been the Black Hole of a producer's waste-bin. The 'Prometheus' debacle should have purged Spaihts of his obsession with interstellar basketball and smug androids, but apparently not, because Jim and Aurora's embarrassing flirtations are portrayed through extra basketball practice and more chats with the Jeeves-bot bartender. After some disco-dancing classes, the ship's system failures become impossible to ignore, and this juvenile melodrama limps into its half-baked climax."
"jordanando","10","27","48","5 January 2017"," Take a seat because you're now a passenger in this thrill ride
","Jennifer Lawrence made this movie, her brilliant acting has come through once again. The way she personifies her character in this movie and it includes her others as well, makes you feel that she is actually that person and that the audience is drawn in to ride with her character throughout the whole film. When we talk about character development and acting, actors/actresses portray someone who is parallel to reality because the circumstances a movie presents to an audience are typically unrealistic. In some instances the characters are put into situations that are realistic to the ones we face in life, this movie carried with it some important meanings and posed philosophical questions to the audience about their own existence all done through the acting of Lawrence and Pratt. Together they worked as a team and combined with the amazing lighting of the set and camera work to show the audience true emotions that are rarely seen in Hollywood films. If there was one scene in the movie that stood out, it was the scene where Aurora found out that Jim had woken her up, this scene carried with it so much emotion that the audience is forced to choose who they support because up until this time, we favored Jim because he portrayed everything we don't want in life unhappiness and loneliness. I think it was crucially important for Aurora to be told by Arthur because then the character development does not happen to the extent that it does in the movie and instead you would have a boring 2-4 minute conversation between Jim and Aurora about why he woke her up and this would not develop our understanding of both their character motivations. In the end even though it may have been a typical Hollywood style ending, I felt satisfied that the price I paid to see this movie was definitely worth it so overall this movie deserves the 9 I am giving it because of the brilliant acting that combined with the lighting, camera work and editing to bring us a movie that I would recommend to anybody who is going to visit the cinema in the new year."

","As it began, this was a story that could have left one with the strange feelings of isolation, but it went into a different direction.<br/><br/>This was a romance/love story that follows that path for a while, then veers off in the opposite direction. <br/><br/>This was a mystery, to a degree, that effectively starts when one sees the advertisement, that tells us something has gone wrong. <br/><br/>Mostly this is sci-fi adventure that has a lot of tense moments, as it builds to a pretty strong climax. <br/><br/>I am not going to write about the acting here. I do not know about acting. I like many people do not recognize good or bad acting and I even took a long time to recognize a movie plot that revolves around acting talent (See the 1991 movie ""Career Opportunities"" with Frank Whaley and Jennifer Connelly and figure out what famous town that movie will wind up in). Besides it is difficult to determine the difference between good acting and good direction/editing. Bad directing, that's another story. <br/><br/>But this as a whole was a good movie, and more powerful than I expected."
"Glyn-52-910242","9","42","80","23 December 2016"," An Excellent film for Sci-Fi fans
","Firstly, let me get this out of the way.. was it just me or did this film seem massively inspired by 'Red Dwarf'? You have your Lister character, your Kochanski character, your Kryten character.. and even the 'Skutters' and the manic vending machines! And the opening line '3 million years from Earth, the mining ship Red Dwarf' seems similar to the situation faced on the Avalon in rather a lot of ways!<br/><br/>To say there is a large 'Red Dwarf' theme though is not a bad thing. In fact seeing how a serious grown up version of Red Dwarf might have been was quite refreshing and thoroughly enjoyable in what will be quite familiar territory to a lot of fans. Add that to some great acting and some truly spectacular sets and CGI, and you've got a really good film. The sets are certainly on a par with the likes of 'Oblivion'.<br/><br/>Some people have reviewed the intricacies of the characters and interactions and found it somewhat lacking. But to be honest, as a Sci-Fi fan I didn't really notice any of that as there was too much going on in what was generally very pleasing film to watch. I felt the characters played their roles really well, and the chemistry between them seemed believable to me.<br/><br/>If you're not a Sci-Fi or action fan then you may not get as much from it as others. I can't see my wife massively enjoying it for example! But what I will say is.. watch the trailer, and if you like the look of it then I'm certain you'll enjoy the actual film.<br/><br/>I can't wait to watch it again!"

","We finally made it out to see Passengers (2016), and to break it down real quick and simple; ""It had me at Hello"" (the beginning) lol. When the marketing started and the trailer first came out, this film was already a success. The film ""Passengers 2016"" has an amazing cast such as Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2, Guardians of the Galaxy), Jennifer Lawrence (The Hunger Games, Joy), Michael Sheen, of course, and Laurence Fishburne; who else could you need in this film? Every actor and actress were fully on their game in this movie, the graphics were unbelievable; the story was perfect!<br/><br/>From the moment this film started we were totally thrilled, of course, one of my favorite genres, so we were like kids in a candy store. The concept art, the effects; where to start without giving things away? I'll just leave it at ""OMG, This movie was great!"""
"Hbarker-32233","3","72","145","21 December 2016"," A gross, what-the-hell-were-they-thinking debacle!
","The more I learn about how the industry operates these days, the more I come to the conclusion that at our current moment in Hollywood history, for a big-budget studio picture to turn out even halfway decent qualifies as some kind of goddamn miracle. The lesson of the Sony hack and all those leaked development emails –the ones I think I'm supposed to pretend I didn't read voraciously– is that when such large numbers are at stake, there's so much panicky meddling from so many micro-managers on so many executive levels that it's almost impossible for expensive blockbusters to *not* end up all pear-shaped and incoherent.<br/><br/>Passengers is the last what-the-hell-were-they-thinking debacle to be released in a year that's been lousy with them. Majorly miscasting two hot young talents who I think we're all starting to feel like we've seen quite enough of for a little while, thanks – it's a $120 million science-fiction chamber piece hinging on an act of violation so monstrous it shatters the film into a thousand pieces. What happens in this movie is really, really horrifying. But then thanks to either market research, cowardly execs or perhaps just filmmakers who are sociopaths, the pretty movie stars quickly get over it and live happily ever after.<br/><br/>There's no way to properly discuss Passengers without inciting the wrath of the Spoiler Police, so if you can't deal with plot details please close your browser right now and trust me that the movie sucks. Thanks for reading and happy holidays.<br/><br/>Okay, for everyone still here: Chris Pratt stars as one of 5,000 intergalactic pioneers happily snoring away in hypersleep chambers on a 120-year-voyage to an off-world colony. Rotten luck for our hero, there's a malfunction in his pod and he wakes up about ninety years too early. Unable to fix it, he's destined to die alone on this giant, empty spacecraft before any of his fellow passengers so much as stir. Pratt wanders around in increasing despair for about a year or so, getting drunk with a robot bartender (the very amusing Michael Sheen) and growing a hilarious fake beard.<br/><br/>He eventually becomes fixated on a sleeping beauty played by Jennifer Lawrence and dude gets the bright idea of sabotaging her pod and waking her up so at least he won't be alone anymore. (Also hey, she looks like Jennifer Lawrence and it's not like she'll have any other options out here.) Of course viewers with even the tiniest scrap of morality realize that this is, for all intents and purposes, murdering her –or at the very least condemning her to the same purgatorial existence in which he suffers– but within the arc of the movie it's really not such a big deal and everyone moves on rather quickly, considering.<br/><br/>So, yeah. Passengers could have made for a brutal psychodrama about male entitlement. I spent most of the time wishing Roman Polanski had re-written and directed it. But instead we've got Morten Tyldum, whose Academy Award-nominated direction of The Imitation Game was so anonymous I remain half-convinced his name might be an acronym for a committee of some sort. He mostly hangs back here and lets genius cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto (who also shot Scorsese's Silence this year) go to town with 3D planes of action in the cavernous, luxuriously empty spaceship.<br/><br/>There's a nifty, hair-raising effects sequence during which Lawrence is swimming when the ship's gravity simulator craps out, but it has so little to do with anything it could have been removed without changing the story in the slightest. (In fact, I'm even having a difficult time deciding where to mention it in the body of this review.) Passengers is a great-looking movie that does not appear to have any discernible point of view on its material.<br/><br/>Ditto for the great-looking stars, neither of whom has ever been this uninteresting on film before. You'd think our protagonist would be suffering some guilt over selfishly robbing this woman of her future, but besides batting his puppy-dog eyes once in a while, Pratt's decidedly not the kind of actor who conveys inner turmoil. (I liked him better back when he was a funny fat guy.) Lawrence is given frightfully little to do besides look amazing in a bathing suit and cheer on our hero while he does heroic, manly stuff with wrenches and levers to fix the foundering spaceship.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, I almost forgot. Instead of resolving the ""Hey, you woke me up and sentenced me to die alone with you, pervert"" conflict that dogs the movie for a matter of like fifteen minutes, Jon Spaihts' screenplay brings the characters back together by having them repair a lot of catastrophic mechanical problems and allows her to be so awed by his amazing, manly prowess with tools that she falls swooning back into his arms.<br/><br/>In the Roman Polanski version of Passengers that was concurrently running in my mind, the only logical ending was for Pratt to die while fixing the ship and leave us with Lawrence a year or two later, sick with loneliness and contemplating the sin of waking up another sleeping passenger. Alas, this particular version of the movie ends with a bizarre cameo from Andy Garcia eighty-odd years in the future, mugging for the camera when he discovers that our lovebirds have planted trees in his spaceship. He's speechless, as was I."

At the end of the official Trailer, Chris Pratt says, ""there was a reason we woke up early"" which makes it sound like there was some kind of a conspiracy, or perhaps aliens on board wreaking havoc, or a corporation cutting corners. This led us to think that something ""more"" was going to happen on the ship. Instead, the cause of them waking up early was simply a prosaic accident of nature. My wife was very disappointed because she expected something a lot more treacherous cause (human or alien life form) than there was, due to this misleading trailer. <br/><br/>There were at least two other major events which were scientifically impossible too, but I am willing to forgive those since it was necessary for the sake of the story."

","Enjoyable movie. Not the greatest, not for a 10 rating but a 9 for the effects and story I think it's well deserved. Life means Living not Planning I think it's the message of this movie. It's about being human. If your not alone, if you have at least one person with you, you can live a full and happy life even if it's contained between boundaries you can never go beyond. Of course it has some lack of action scenes and I expected a big twist towards the reason the ship was malfunctioning. They could have been more mysterious and create more suspense about it. I have to say that if there were some unknown actors playing the characters I wouldn't have watched this in a theater. Jennifer and Chris were the main reason I went to see it. Altogether I liked the story partly because I'm a sci-fi fan and I think those who feel the same will understand what I'm saying."
"csauces","10","22","39","4 January 2017"," A 120yr hibernation journey on the star ship Avalon to the colony planet Homestead II.
","The sci-fi action film Passengers was released December 21, 2016 and directed by Morten Tyldum. I say the film itself has a beautiful scenery, and excellent costume design. The theme of Passengers very well should be ""Do not worry to much about the future,"" ""and enjoy what is in front of you."" Often times we get caught up what we want to do, instead of what we can do at the moment. The overall content of the film was intriguing, surprising, and very heartwarming. I rally liked the chemistry between Jim Preston(Chris Pratt), Arthur(Michael Sheen), and Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence). Both of them had an excellent portrayal of their characters thoughts, feelings, feelings, and actions from the beginning of the movie to the end. The context was pretty good too I thought. Especially, between Jim and Arthur when Jim explains his feelings to bartender to try to cope with his loneliness. There was not really anything that I did not like about Passengers at all. In closing, I say Passengers is a must see for ages thirteen and older. Just about everyone can get something out of seeing it."
"PyroSikTh","8","22","39","28 December 2016"," Offers a Controversial Ethical Dilemma
","Passengers follows the 120-year trip of the spacecraft Avalon to an off-world colony, carrying over five thousand passengers looking to start a new life. Unfortunately something goes wrong along the way and Jim is woken up from hibernation early - ninety years early. He finds himself alone on a luxury cruiser where his travel bracelet will only allow him basic amenities, with only an android barman for company. Slightly spoilerish, but I will be discussing at length: After a year of painful loneliness, Jim discovers Aurora's pod, is captivated by her beauty, watches her boarding logs and reads her books and falls into an obsessive infatuation that leads him, out of desperation, to decide to wake her up and condemn her to spending the rest of her life aboard the Avalon, just like him.<br/><br/>It's this moral and ethical dilemma that drives the film's most interesting premise, and is the most controversial part of the film that has people and critics up in arms. To me, this is where the film's biggest strength lies. It turns Jim from a charming and likable chap into something a bit more grey and murky. The film posits to it's audience; what would you do in his situation? There's no denying it's an awful choice to make, to condemn someone to your fate. It's far more noble to suffer the malfunction by yourself rather than drag someone down with you. But if you were in that situation, facing complete loneliness without any human contact for the rest of your life? Everyone would be tempted, and most I'd gladly wager would come to the same conclusion as Jim.<br/><br/>The movie's third act moves this ethical foundation to the sidelines in favour of a more bombastic climax, as Jim and Aurora discover that the ship's problems extend much further than just some malfunctioning hibernation pods, and the lives of the other five thousand crew and passengers are at stake. From a narrative standpoint, the third act does little than to add a bit more excitement for more attention-deficient viewers, and unite Jim and Aurora to lead to a more bittersweet close. If I was directing this movie, there are probably a few different avenues I'd have liked to have attempted that would've changed the tone of the film a little more. It was a premise rife for a mystery. Say, if it opened with Aurora waking up and being greeted by this handsome gentleman that she slowly falls for, it would've lent a bit of mystery as to the surroundings of her waking up, and could've been used to place some suspicion on Jim and paint him in a less than heroic light. Or for the ending to have a bit more of an emotional force or sense of legacy (I won't expand on that, but you can guess what I mean once you see it).<br/><br/>Passengers' other great strength is with the acting. You don't cast two of the most promising young stars today for no reason, and they're both worth their staggering paychecks. Chris Pratt is as effortlessly charming as ever as Jim. His first year on the ship, entirely alone, is heartbreaking, and the conflict inside him surrounding the moral dilemma is a pain to see on his face and in his body language. He certainly employs those puppy dog eyes that he does so well. Jennifer Lawrence once again proves why she's one of the most talented actresses working today. Besides the simply fantastic chemistry she shares with Pratt, a talent they both seem to share effortlessly, her own performances of love, desperation, anger, and shock are simply on another level. The moment she learns she was woken up by Jim, you can see her stomach sink at the crushing realisation of what's happened. Michael Sheen is simply great as Arthur, the android barman as well, providing words of wisdom and a deadpan expression throughout, while Laurence Fishburne and Andy Garcia never really get enough to sink their teeth into (particularly the latter, who appears for a matter of seconds and has no lines at all).<br/><br/>The visuals are also quite impressive. The starship Avalon itself is an impressive imaginative design, spinning some iconic tropes and clichés of sci-fi ship design that crafting itself something new. It takes the spinning circles held together by gravity, but twists them into an appearance that more resembles strands of DNA. I can't say this is an entirely realistic movie in it's treatment of space (the sun they pass is far too dark, for example), but this is sci-fi after all, and not a retelling of The Martian. Where Passengers really excels in it's visual flair are the setpieces. Every room is a physical space with smooth, clean architecture. The variation in design and colouring from the bar to the Mexican restaurant, for instance, brings life to an otherwise dead and clinical environment.<br/><br/>Passengers is a sci-fi that offers different questions than many other sci-fi films tend to gravitate towards. It still plays around with ethical and philosophical questions like most, but Passengers is far more controversial in it's treatment, and for me this is a strength rather than a weakness. Jim is a likable charming guy driven to something horrible by pure desperation and grief, and it shows his humanity. It shows that we all live in a grey ethical area and we can all succumb to horrible actions in extreme circumstances. Even fundamentally good people are capable of doing terrible things. I give Passengers a solid, critic-defying 8/10."

"contact-445","9","31","58","28 December 2016"," What is everybody going on about? This was a great movie
","Maybe it's because I came into the theater expecting to see pretty much what the movie ended up delivering, but I really liked this movie, in spite of not being a fan of sony after the string of crap they've put out the last couple of years (the smurfs, the interview, ghostbusters and whatnot).<br/><br/>The movie was drenched in cynicism about the cult of corporations, and automation taking over our lives. We are more and more serviced by machines and are completely on our own with no help from our fellow humans if something goes wrong, I thought this story, beyond the usual romantic comedy formula (complete with the reveal of the false pretense and the guy having to re-earn the girl's love by redeeming himself) was a nice echo to that fact. Seeing that I saw the movie in a theater that was near-fully automated, it was almost poetic.<br/><br/>The acting was fine, even jennifer lawrence's, the ship design was great, the world that was hinted at beyond the story seemed to be interesting.. The movie hit a good balance between characters and action (even if maybe it could have used a bit more urgency in the second act).. In summary, as with several movies I've seen recently, I wonder if I saw the same movie that everyone seems to hate? I really had a good time and don't understand the ratings nor the critics, although everyone is of course entitled to their opinion. All I ask from a movie is escapism, and that it makes sense from beginning to end, and it delivered, much more than the endless treadmill of 'comic book movies with 1 hour of city destruction in the middle for no reason at all'<br/><br/>If you expect a pratt/lawrence vehicle that's mostly a romantic dramedy with some scifi backdrop and a cynical view of our modern corporate life (think weyland-yutani in aliens) then don't miss out on this movie, I think you'll have a good time as I did. Between Arrival, Rogue one and Passengers, this has been a very enjoyable xmas holiday in the theaters"

","To me the movie was disappointing. There is no reason to call this movie science fiction. With everything added and the plot clear, it could have been anywhere. Speed 3 for that matter. Writing in some terrorists shouldn't have been any trouble. Perhaps I should say that I am a great fan of SF. To me writers like Asimov, Heinlein and Van Vogt are masters of the trade. When I first read about the story line I thought it would be a movie in their tradition. It is clearly not. I cannot go into details why not, because I could (would?) spoil other people's enjoyable evening. As a love story it is not that bad. And I like a plot in which you don need a lot of characters to tell the story. A must see for the fans of the actors."

","I've made poor decisions in my life, but paying 12eur to see this film without researching it a little has got to top them all if measured by the misery I felt watching it. The only reason why I didn't walk out ~40mins in is that I didn't come alone. To avoid ranting, here are the reasons in bullet points:<br/><br/><ul><li>Poor acting. I'm only familiar with Chris Pratt as a comedy actor, and based on Passengers he's better off in his lane. Limited emotivity and emotional range in the context. His last man on earth entertaining himself intersected with blips of despair routine felt like a less effective imitation of Will Smith's in I am Legend. What happened to Jennifer Lawrence since Winter's Bone I will never know. It feels like she may have expended all the nuance and subtlety there and only has routine-issue single emotion faces to display. Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen both did their thing. Which is, display complex emotion while asleep. They weren't exactly given much to work with. Which segues me into..</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Insipid, regurgitated dialogue. Uncharacteristically, I felt like quipping sarcastically at the screen pretty much the whole time. The lines were so typical, lifeless and expected, I felt like I'm in Premonition. *Spoiler* The captain of the ship dies, says something casually humorous in that cliché heartbreaking way before about women appreciating a man in a uniform. The ship is breaking down, and the writer says ""So we're in a ship that's sinking"". Perhaps you were born yesterday and have never seen a film before and found this profound. I cannot fault you. Alas, I. simply. can't. stomach. recycled. garbage.*End spoiler* The regurgitated feeling extends to other criteria as well, from visuals to character types.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Frankensteinian, empty plot: It feels like you're watching barest motifs of actual sci-fi films stitched together last minute/unoriginally. Except that even these motifs are just used to prop the ""love story"". Which brings me to..</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The film revolves around a love story that's, once again, just a stitched up collection of poorly executed clichés. Falling in love with a stranger who you don't know, getting together because there's literally no one else around, The Secret That Ruins Everything Whoops, Female In Anger Won't Listen To Empathy But After Tremendous Selfless Sacrifice She Will Forgive Immediately, and so on endlessly. The problem here is that I'm not merely recognizing tropes, the plot line is really just a sequence of clichés, there's no character substance - let alone development - to flesh anything out. </li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>One-dimensional universe we know or care little about. It's a far off future. It feels realistically capitalistic in an unassuming, normative kind of way. People emigrate from earth because it's crowded and some jobs are almost obsolete. But that's irrelevant because love story. Space travel is just a cardboard background for it, that is all.</li></ul><br/><br/>Passengers is a simpletonic, flat attempt to make money because Jennifer Lawrence in space is in love, then sad, then in love again. I couldn't even enjoy it as mindless entertainment because it was a soulkilling drag. Don't waste your money or worse, your precious time on planet earth, yeah?"

While this movie is an excellent Sci-Fi flick with an amazing story, photography and visuals of space – while it's extremely well done on that front - the 'misunderstanding' may be that this is another slam-bam science-fiction flick like the latest star wars.

He decides to disable her pod and wake her up but keep the decision from her.<br/><br/>This movie needs to start when Aurora wakes up. His decision is workable storytelling if we figure it out along with her. It could be a mystery with tension that turns into an action thriller. Also the movie is too desperate to be romantic. The fact that the audience knows what he did makes it impossible to get into the romantic mood. By starting the movie at the later spot, it can inject some creepiness and tension. It also makes the movie shorter which would help a lot. These are two hot A-list actors. It's easy to see how the studio automatically goes for the romantic route but the story is built for a tense thriller."

","Science Fiction is supposed to be about big ideas. It's supposed to utilize our highest aspirations, exhibit our biggest accomplishments, perhaps exploit our biggest fears. When we venture to a long time ago in a galaxy far away, go where no man has gone before or stumble into another edition of Thunderdome, it's expected that in these fantastical worlds, there's something important worth saying. Passengers seems to be saying anything, and I mean anything, is justified in the name of romance. Oh goody, a space adventure with the mentality of a mid-nineties romantic comedy. Bring on the creepy.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt plays...well he plays Chris Pratt, there's no point spelling out names because you won't remember them but you will remember two of the hottest stars in Hollywood today getting freaky amid lustrous starlight. Chris wakes up 90 years too early on a 120 year mission to a distant planet colony. Jennifer Lawrence joins him later and the two struggle to adjust to the prospect of living their entire adult lives in isolation and solitude.<br/><br/>Your opinion of this space adventure, glitches and all, is dependent on whether you can stomach one fateful decision on the part of Chris Pratt. That one decision colors the entire movie and can either force an audience member to actively rationalize everything afterward or squirm uncomfortably as things slowly fall apart. If you're the forgiving type, keep in mind that you will have to excuse a gauntlet of romantic and sci-fi clichés, propped up by funhouse mirror versions of everything you've seen before, splattered against the two most cardboard characters since Adam and Eve.<br/><br/>If you're a squirmer like me, you will not be enthused by the rudimentary character dynamics, forced sci-fi pablum and syrupy verbal diarrhea that bursts forth with the intensity of an oncoming meteor. Nor will you be happy by the fact that Jennifer Lawrence, an actress famous for playing a host of strong independent women, is stuck playing a space-age pinup whose big climax should come with a Schubert aria. To say nothing of Laurence Fishburne's character who speaks fluent exposition and, likely sizing up the room, decides to leave the movie without so much as a goodbye.<br/><br/>Make no mistake, you're stuck with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence for almost the entirety of this movie. And unlike one-man shows like Cast Away (2000) and Moon (2009), Passengers has absolutely nothing important to say about anything. It's a sleek-looking but dull and infuriatingly brainless movie that amazingly thinks the solution to every complex human relationship is live in the present, and the solution to every technical problem is, turn it off and turn it back on again."

","showme-themovies.blogspot.co.uk/2017/01/review-passengers.html<br/><br/>With its' limited cast and seemingly cliché story, Passengers surprisingly succeeds in its' depiction of a moving tale of loneliness, morality and belonging.<br/><br/>When I first caught wind of Passengers, I pictured an atypical, unimaginative love story only made slightly more interesting by its' sci-fi setting; Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt the lucky A-listers brought in to up-sell a bland, poorly-scripted movie that's' only discernibly interesting concept has been stretched out over a two-hour substance-less picture. Proof that you should never judge a book by its' cover.<br/><br/>Giving the movie a chance to prove me wrong, I found not only a well-written story with underlying themes but excellent casting in the form of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Being the predominant (and almost only) characters, Aurora Lane (Lawrence) and Jim Preston (Pratt) had clear chemistry and an ability to command the attention of the audience in a rather unique way.<br/><br/>The film primarily follows Jim Preston, a passenger on the spacecraft 'Avalon', on an intergalactic, 120-year-long journey to a new colony. After waking up in his cryogenic sleep chamber years too early, Jim finds himself alone (all bar (!) an android named Arthur - played fascinatingly by Michael Sheen) and unable to force his way back to sleep, despite multiple attempts and methods. Eventually, on the advice of barman-turned-confidant Arthur, Jim accepts his fate and decides to make use of all the spaceships' facilities for the time he has left - cue video-games, swimming pools and first-class cabins.<br/><br/>Despite previously resigning himself to a life devoid of social interaction, Jims' loneliness, desperation and understandable depression slowly begins to drive him mad (a nod to The Shining, anyone?!) and he contemplates suicide by opening an airlock without wearing a spacesuit. The decision to exclude a large cast becomes apparent (and appropriate) here, where one can empathise with Jim's isolation and his longing for new faces.<br/><br/>Enter: Aurora Lane. Thought-provoking and filled with moral dilemmas, Aurora and Jim hit it off from the start, and Jim shines to Aurora almost instantly after managing human contact for the first time in over a year. After hearing his story, Aurora is sympathetic towards Jim, and though doomed to perish years before anyone discovers what has happened to them, their dynamics make way for a seemingly good life. Unaware of the dangers that befall them, the circumstances surrounding how both Jim and Aurora woke up then becomes apparent, and the spaceship begins to experience severe failures that have to be solved in order for the passengers and crew aboard (all still asleep) to be saved.<br/><br/>What I can absolutely commend about Passengers is how very economical it is with its' hidden meanings aside from its main concepts, and how it flawlessly takes the plot where it needs to go, at a reasonable pace for the viewer. Jennifer Lawrence doesn't appear until the film has properly set the scene - and whilst Pratt carries at least the opening act alone, it doesn't feel like 'The Chris Pratt Show'; it remains entertaining throughout.<br/><br/>The acting quality is superb all around; Martin Sheen will likely be overlooked this awards season, but deserves an honourable mention - the presence of Arthur (a representation of the viewer), allows the thoughts, feelings and troubles of the leads to be known - the unemotional voice between character and movie-goer.<br/><br/>My one real criticism stems down to the charming-yet-essentially-predictable romance between Aurora and Jim - though the writers' clearly self-aware. I would have preferred a story that focuses on a boy-meets-girl turned friendship than blatant, unnecessary cheese - though the relationship itself entirely integral to the plot. Though easily foreseeable, Passengers did not suffer as a result.<br/><br/>Visually, the film is professional, the spaceship itself looked incredible - and the soundtrack had some great choices in it including a well-used Bob Dylan track and a made-for-movie Imagine Dragons tune. Passengers is an overall great film, a sci-fi-come-romance that achieves the best of both worlds; an enjoyable presentation, very compelling to watch. Don't be fooled by the trailers, it isn't that bland, I promise."
"KatieB181997","7","11","18","9 January 2017"," Passengers isn't as bad as you think.
","Critic reviews have bashed this film because of a certain action Chris Pratt's character, Jim, makes near the beginning of the film. This has lead to a lot of people saying that his actions were 'sexist' which I don't agree with. The main plot is about Jim and Jennifer Lawrence's character, Aurora, who are both woken up 90 years too early whilst on board a spaceship that's on a 120 year journey to a new planet. Because Jim is the first to wake up, he's completely alone, apart from an android bartender known as Arthur (Michael Sheen). Jim spends most of his free time with Arthur, getting drunk, playing basketball and also trying to make the most of his situation by finding a way to go back to hibernation. Unfortunately, after a year, depression kicks in which leads to him almost committing suicide. After walking back, he walks past one of the hibernation pods and notices Aurora in it, who is, clearly, a beautiful young woman. Now, isolation can drive people to become mentally unstable and make quick decisions. This is what happens here. Jim spends a long time trying to talk himself out of waking Aurora up but, unfortunately, he can't bear being alone and, because he's a mechanic, he knows how to wake one of the passengers up. Aurora believes that her pod has simply malfunctioned, like Jim's, as he can't face the truth. I think that people are being too quick to judge Jim and the entire film just from one action. Not one of us has ever been in his position where he's truly on his own. This is where Passengers succeeds, in my opinion, as it's caused some thought provoking discussions between viewers. Yes, Jim's decision could be considered a flaw but that's no reason to hate the film as there's so much to like about it. Yes, I do think it would've been better if the film was shown from Aurora's point of view and Jim's decision to wake her up could've been revealed as a plot twist but I'm not the filmmaker. Passengers could've been better but it's still, overall, one of the best science fiction films released in 2016, along with Arrival and Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence both give strong performances as the two leads. In the run up to the film's release, they went on a international press tour where they visited various countries and did press conferences and interviews. In these interviews, I could clearly see the chemistry between them and it radiates on screen. A montage shows them having fun together by watching films, playing basketball, dancing and going to the bar, just like any normal couple and is one of the most entertaining parts in the film. The set design of the Avalon is exquisite. I can tell that a lot of hard work has gone into creating it. A lot of ships I've seen in science fiction films are quite standard and there's nothing special about them. However, the Avalon is like a outer space cruise ship. This is because the passengers are woken up six months before they arrive at the new planet and this is when they can enjoy the rest of the journey. The bar is also a clear remake of the bar that features in Stanley Kubrick's classic, The Shining. Passengers also feature some impressive visual effects. There's a scene where Jim and Aurora fly outside the ship and, because of the computer generated imagery, it really does look like they're in space together. The point I'm making in this review is that I don't think it's right to judge a film based entirely on one character's action. Despite the unfair negative criticism this received, this is still worth a watch for fans of thought-provoking science fiction and romantic drama. No, it's not as good as Arrival but at least it's not as bad as Independence Day: Resurgence or Jupiter Ascending."

Then watching a beautiful and steamy romance emerge bringing warmth to this otherwise cold and dire situation they found themselves in. Along with the action to keep the audience on edge.

","This is probably the worst movie I have seen in years; the story so implausible that, even after you made your best effort to suspend any judgement of believability, it still looks totally absurd. The dialogues are so poor, so bad that you feel like laughing even in the most supposedly dramatic sequences (an example? the starship is about to explode, and when the main reactor starts collapsing the protagonist's comment is ""this is a bad sign!"". The acting reminded me a low budget cloak-and-dagger movie of the 60's, it just reinforced the ridiculousness of the dialogues. I thought it was a shame to see an actress like Jennifer Lawrence in such a b-league movie; it made me wondering if this was a mistake of his agent or if something bad is happening to her career"

","Saw the trailer and assumed this would be science fiction. Don't make the same mistake - this is 'stalker' territory masquerading as romance.<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning, and set designers would score a 10, as would the effects department. <br/><br/>The film's full of plot holes, but let's start with the distasteful aspect first. Jim Preston's suspended animation pod malfunctions and wakes him up 90 years early. In a ship of several thousand sleepers and a few hundred crew, he's left to walk the ship alone for over a year.<br/><br/>During this time he hatches the plot of waking up a fellow passenger, who he's picked. He reads up on her, essentially profiling her.<br/><br/>Despite (or in spite of) knowing it will ruin her life, and condemn her to the same miserable existence, he goes ahead and wakes her up.<br/><br/>As many others have said, this could have worked as a much darker film, where she gets revenge etc. What we get is a sappy romance story where she hates him after finding out the truth, then decides she loves him and sacrifices her future to be with him.<br/><br/>The film left a nasty after taste for me, as it was essentially a stalker type film, where the victim forms an emotional attachment with her 'captor' - 'Stockholm Syndrome'.<br/><br/>This is evidenced when she could have gone back into suspended animation, but chose to stay with the man who trashed her dreams.<br/><br/>Again, this could have worked if it had been far darker, exploring the human psyche. What we get is sugary coated romance.<br/><br/>Anyway, some obvious plot holes.<br/><br/>1) The ship's built on the premise that nothing will ever go wrong. This despite the film showing spare parts for every aspect of the ship later. Yet there's no facility to awaken the crew, or even having an android repair crew (despite there being service androids in abundance elsewhere).<br/><br/>2) It's impossible (apparentally) to go back into suspended animation once you're awake. Yet much later in the film, it shows it's possible to be put into suspended animation in the medical department. Why do the pods not have the same facility ?<br/><br/>3) Why was the bartender shown as human like, yet the waiters and breakfast dispensers are just machines ? <br/><br/>4) How did he survive a massive venting at the end ? Okay he technically died in space, but was bought back with some very dodgy procedures.<br/><br/>5) What would planting trees and vegetation do to delicate electronics ? Looks like a jungle at the end of the film.<br/><br/>Overall a massive letdown, with the message seeming to be if you're 'hot' you can get away with anything."

","Wow what a horrible movie. I thought Jennifer Lawrence was a good actress until I saw this movie. Hard to tell if it was her performance or if the movie was just that bad that no one could pull this one off. Chris Pratt was what I expected, mediocre at best. I thought Arthur was probably the best character in the whole movie. I thought the story was going to get better when Larry Fishburne was introduced. His character was not really necessary for the story-line as he didn't last long and did not provide anything to the movie; wasted of time. I'm still trying to figure out what story the movie was trying to tell. With good editing the movie could have been shortened to about 45 minutes and still been just as bad. I do have to admit the visual effects were very cool."
"ben_jimenez","5","27","53","20 January 2017"," Not what it could of been
","I can say that with a budget of 110 million dollars this movie could of been so much more. They basically took a weird love story and turned it into a sci-fi movie, and not a good one either. Everything that happened in this movie was predictable, unimaginative, and had holes in it from the start. <br/><br/>Not allot of dialog or actors in this movie other than the main characters so I guess the 110 million got spent on CGI? I wanted to try to do this review without giving spoilers but I have to in order to explain my complaints.<br/><br/>First the main character is woken up by the ship, because the ship had a glitch or problem, but this state of the art ship was not able, with all it's different computers, to let anyone know there was a problem? It took a dying crew member to figure out there was an issue. Also, if your going to send a space ship into space across the galaxy wouldn't you make sure it's computer chips were protected against energy bursts or whatever crap it was that hit the ship in the beginning? <br/><br/>I wonder if the actors read the script and were like, OK, whatever, just pay me.<br/><br/>The bar tender was the dumbest robot in any sci-fi movie ever. He had no clue that something was wrong with the ship. He was there when it got hit, but he didn't notice it? and You would think if something happened to the ship that the computer would wake up the crew so they could investigate it, but it conveniently couldn't do that. And with all that technology there was no way to go back into hyper-sleep? How would the crew get back to Earth after dropping off the people. <br/><br/>Like I say so many holes in the story in order to keep only the two main characters together throughout this crappy love story. If it wasn't for Jennifer being so hot I probably wouldn't of watched the whole way through(thanks for the bikini shots by the way). No aliens, no killer virus, the robot didn't go crazy and try to kill them (which would of made the move way more interesting), but some how we can grow trees in the spaceship without sun or UV light and fry computer chips like peanut butter cookies!?. Come on Hollywood you can do better than this. If you were gonna make a part two (which you won't) I'm available for story ideas. Hit me up."
"jessejedi","10","17","31","24 December 2016"," Lessons learned from the movie
","When my mom, who usually go to the movie theater for the sake of being in the environment instead of watching the movie, was deeply attracted by the movie, you know it is going to be good.<br/><br/>Many other reviews have talked about the good, the bad, and the ugly of the movie, so I just want to share a few things I learned from watching the movie. It contains small spoilers.<br/><br/>Without any flamboyant introduction, let's dig into it:<br/><br/>1. Autopilot of any kind, just like Tesla's autopilot, definitely should never be trusted as being able to left operating on their own, no matter how many experiments proved they could. No technology can be promised as fail-safe because the universe is too big for us mere human beings to claim 100% failure free.<br/><br/>2. If you have hibernation chambers, you better have re-hibernation chambers on-board. When things go wrong, someone gotta wake up to fix things, and that person gotta go back to hibernation because there is another century to go.<br/><br/>3. Biggest problems often fail at places designer never thought would be a problem. The Avalon's shield is supposed to prevent all meteoroids from hitting the ship, and meteoroids were probably one of the less worried obstacles due to the powerful shield, yet that was the whole problem. Just like how icebergs were never thought to be a problem for the Titanic.<br/><br/>4. Sometimes just one backup plan may not be enough. You need to have backups of backups, especially when the lives of 5258 people are on the line. Perhaps a whole crew should have been wakened up and given temporary full access to the ship. One of the issues in the movie was that the main guy did not have sufficient access and the on-board AI have no clue that he wasn't supposed to be awake this early -- a complete lack of a backup plan.<br/><br/>5. The movie served as a good warning, but I believe with the way our technology is being developed, the people of future shouldn't be so short-sighted like the designers of the starship Avalon."

The effects were appropriate for the action without overriding the core of the film.<br/><br/>All of the actors were superb, and as I watched I was drawn into their lives, thoughts, and feelings.

There are some nice twist in the movie and the characters develop well in my opinion. <br/><br/>I felt some of the things in this movie are a bit overdone but for me this also ""broke up"" the seriousness a bit. Some parts felt a little rushed and I'm hoping there will be an extended version sometime in the future.

"LBarlane24","9","14","25","1 January 2017"," Passengers review
","Now, first off, I have seen the RT score for this film before going to see it; about four or five days prior, more specifically. And just for that, I became somewhat nervous about seeing about seeing the film. So after doing just that, I will say that this film was ABSOLUTELY OUTSTANDING. I have no idea why it has the rating that it does (I mean, I would expect it to be at least somewhere in the 50s), because this movie is one of the best I've seen all year. The movie is directed by Morten Tyldum, written by Jon Spaihts, and stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who share very decent chemistry with one-another.<br/><br/>With all of that said, I must say that this by far the best Sci-fi film I have ever seen since Interstellar. I mean, the opening was, there I say, breathtaking, but the way the whole thing is executed is absolutely brilliant! Now many critics, from what I know, have complained about its story-line, and I can certainly understand why.<br/><br/>From my first thoughts, as soon as Aurora awakens from her pod, Jim immediately goes running off to, what I can assume, hide from her until she walks out and about the same way he did. And when introducing himself to her, there really isn't much of a mystery behind him; we already know him but we don't really know her, or so we think. Maybe if they had switched the first and second and, then maybe we would've gotten to know HER character more before his. But that really isn't the case.<br/><br/>It seems as though many have complained about the way the plot was structured, but half of them, surprisingly, have criticized it for its execution of most things; more specifically, the fact that Pratt's character wakes Lawrence's up. And yes, I'm aware that they didn't make that quite clear in the trailer. But for the sake of unpredictability, I'm actually glad that they didn't. The first half of this movie focuses entirely on Pratt's character, Jim. And the reason for which is because we UNDERSTAND HIS ACTIONS. Being the only human awake and active on a ship for that long, that can and would be very difficult to cope with.<br/><br/>The one problem I DID have, however (but it may just be a nitpick), was during the first act when Pratt had that long facial hair coming in; not only did it look laughably fake, it seemed goofy and a little bit out of place.<br/><br/>For my final verdict, for a long time I was expecting to see a science fiction movie that would let me actually think, and that is exactly what I got when and after viewing this; like Interstellar, as well as 2001: A Space Odyssey, IT LET'S YOU USE YOUR MIND."

","Passengers sets the bar high with its high powered cast and flashy special effects...and it doesn't disappoint.

The story is surprising original, although it does carry some of the clichés that go along with romantic movies. The movie itself is far more than the trailer shows...and that's as far as I'll go into that. I personally have some issues with the last scene of the film, which prevents me from giving it a higher score. But I can overlook that when thinking about the relative cohesiveness with the rest of the plot. I recommend going to see this film based purely on the cast, and the emotion. The acting alone was enough to keep me engaged. Don't expect it to be the next Titantic, but it's definitely an excellent date movie. Ladies will love the love story and the emotion and Chris Pratt, guys...it's J- Law and it's in space (c'mon). Solid 8-9 movie."
"rgkarim","8","25","50","22 December 2016"," All Aboard For Interstellar Romance and Visuals
","Space! The final frontierand the setting for so many movies in this day and age. Welcome to another Robbie K movie review. Tonight's focus is on Passengers starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as they voyage the stars in a pretty cool (albeit odd) looking ship. Based on the trailers this science fiction adventure looks to have romance, drama and mystery, but is this the case? Can these two mega stars bring a love story to life? As always read on to hear my take on Passengers!<br/><br/>LIKES:  Fantastic Acting  The love story component  Beautiful visuals  Beautiful score<br/><br/>No surprise here, the acting is one of the leading components in this movie. Jennifer Lawrence's edgy mood is very welcome in this setting, painting a character that is vulnerable yet strong when faced with the dilemmas. Her emotions are so well-balanced in this film, painting a realistic character that many will anchor too. Yes, her cracking voice is getting a little stale, and she is playing similar characters, but it works so well. As for Pratt, again the man impresses me with dynamic characters. Pratt substitutes his normally silly persona for a more serious nature, and it works well. He sells his idolization of companionship, radiates misery from the isolation and betrayal, and still manages to come off heroic at parts. And the chemistry between these two is a reaction gone well. Pratt and Lawrence sell their passion for one another, almost as if they are actually in love with each other. Not easy considering Hollywood relationships these days. Speaking of the love story, Passengers' strongest story component has to be the relationship of the characters. It's a very dramatic tale packed with emotion that fluctuates between blissful happiness and heartbreaking revelations. As stated, the actors' chemistry helps sell the story, but the writers did a nice job designing this tale to be not only passionate, but believable. Yes, my friends, Passengers isn't a Nicholas Sparks fairy tale, but actually highlights the work involved with a relationship, nice work guys. And for those who want passionate love making scenes, it's got a few to spice up the film, but not so much to fall into the overdone (or pornographic realms). Well done guys, well done! Yet my favorite component has to be the beautiful visuals and music score that was designed for this film. Hollywood certainly knows how to create eccentric looking ships on the outside, but seldom do they create a large world within. The attention to detail is astonishing, each section meticulously designed to fit with the theme of the station. Even the engineering components have a logical explanation in regards to their purpose in the ship. And these settings are further amplified by the orchestral score that accompanies it. While many symphony tracks sound the same, Passengers adds a little something to help it stand out, especially during the spacewalk scenes where the music established both the beauty and spirit of adventure. <br/><br/>DISLIKES:  Slow at the beginning  No mystery  The science fiction dilemma is semi rushed  Fourth character almost unnecessary<br/><br/>We know some movies take time to build steam, but Passengers certainly struggles to get its ion drives going. The opening sequences are devoid of any edge, serving to introduce the ship and the dilemma involving one of our characters. However, this montage probably could have been cut down a bit to get to the exciting parts of the story (and cut down on the run time). In addition, the boring opening could be due to the lack of the mystery. Despite the teaser line put in the trailer, you'll get 95% of the answers in the first twenty minutes of the film. I had so looked forward to uncovering a conspiracy regarding their abrupt waking, but sadly the explanations are lackluster. The only mystery that remains is the technical explanations for what happens, which most viewers will not give a darn about. <br/><br/>In regards to the science fiction component, Passengers is both good and bad in this category. The good is the ship, the technical jargon, and the looming threat of insanity in the void of space. However, the bad far overshadows the good for me. Passengers dilemma starts out pretty low key and remains low key for much of the film. Then at the drop of a hat things escalate to danger levels in mere minutes, a solution comes even faster, and the resolve is predictable and quite corny at parts. Even the introduction of a fourth character played by Lawrence Fishburne can't save the rushed plot development. Fishburne's role is touching at points, but the writers diluted his role to merely providing quick answers and a trinket to get the job done. Such a shame that the mystery and dilemma could not have shined like the love story. <br/><br/>The VERDICT:<br/><br/>Passengers surprised me by how much I enjoyed watching the movie. While a bit slow at the beginning, I enjoyed the love story and sense of adventure our characters shared as they hurtled through space. In addition, the beautiful visuals and strong attention to detail further impressed me, designing a set worthy of special effects awards at the Oscars. Outside the love story though, I was disappointed with the lack of mystery and rushed dilemma they placed in this movie. For once, I think the movie needed to be longer, to help make a more suspenseful film and get a little more kick to the relationship. This film is worth a scope for romantic audiences and those who like beautiful visuals. However, in regards to story over all, save this one home viewing. <br/><br/>My scores are: Adventure/Drama/Romance: 8.0 Movie Overall: 7.0"

Yes, I know it's not possible to put people back into hibernation on board, but that's just the first idiotic plot device that the scriptwriter lumbered this film with.<br/><br/>Next, the spaceship is constantly rotating, yet a tiny meteorite (judging by the size of the hole it made) managed to miss the outer sections of the ship, punch through numerous internal metal walls (!), and smash into the one bit of equipment that guarantees the protracted destruction of the ship. There are repair droids all over the place, why couldn't one of them have fixed the damage? Why isn't there a backup system? Why?<br/><br/>Next, a third person wakes up. How lucky is it that out of over five thousand people on board, he just happens to be someone with high level crew access codes?<br/><br/>I'm going to pass on the bits where gravity fails and affects the swimming pool, and where the ship passes within a few hundred kilometres of a star, but there's still idiocy aplenty, like...<br/><br/>Venting the nuclear reactor; what the hell is that spacesuit made from, and why can it get just a tiny hole after what it's subjected to? The rescue following that makes the Iron Man scene from The Martian seem almost plausible.<br/><br/>Lastly, the guy's an engineer, and everything on board has spares, so why can't he build another autodoc to act as a hibernation capsule? Yes, it might have taken them years, but everything seems to be made just to clip into place, so it couldn't be that hard surely?<br/><br/>I gave this four stars after coming out of the cinema because, despite its numerous flaws, it's got some nice visuals, and because Michael Sheen's performance is pretty good. I won't, however, be watching it again."
"cruise01","8","24","48","21 December 2016"," A beautiful sci-fi romance thriller with two wonderful leads.
","Passengers is a science fiction/romantic film that delivers a wonderful cast, and visuals. It may not be the best and feels a little short on the conflict that these characters face. Director Morten Tyldum does well with building a better romance story and showing some stunning visual effects. <br/><br/>I think Passengers deliver on the science fiction plot and for those who are seeking a romantic film. This film will fit in that expectations and better than most of the predictable redundant love movies out there. <br/><br/>The plot follows a starship Avalon that is on a 90 year voyage, transporting 5,000 colonists to a new home planet. Engineer Jim (Chris Pratt) hibernation pod malfunctions, awakening him 90 years early. After discovering that he is stuck on the ship alone with no back up support from Earth. Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) wakes up and realizes they are stuck in the ship alone and are unable to go back to their sleeping pods. With some occasional power outages, gravity shut offs, robotic droids malfunctioning on the ship. They realize there is something more happening that they need to fix. In order for the ship to make it to the new planet. And discovering a purpose for them to be waking up early. <br/><br/>The film starts out great, we have Jim waking up, and realizing his fate has been sealed that he will be dead by the time they reach their destination. It feels like a character study of loneliness. He can be alone for so long until his desire of needing a human companion. He takes a great advantage of the luxury ship to himself, except for the cafeteria and their restricted menu cause of his class on board. His only company would be a bartender droid Arthur (Martin Sheen), but to what length when he does not have a human connection. Jim's actions may not be the best in logic or some may call it greed or creepy. Without giving much spoilers from were the direction goes from there and would make better sense when seeing it for yourself. Aurora and Jim build a relationship, realizing they only have each other, when their is no hope of seeing their destinations by the time they get there. <br/><br/>Morten Tyldum does play with the direction of isolation on Jim's loneliness and his desire for love. Chris Pratt is a great actor, playing a character that is humorous, and emotionally driven at the same time. Jennifer Lawrence is a beautiful actress that gives her best with the role as well. Seeing the two is a perfect chemistry on screen. What also made the film even better is music composer Thomas Newman. His music score is beautiful, and the sound works with the stunning visual effects. Visuals when seeing Jim floating in space and out in the horizon of stars. Or seeing them witness as they pass by a big giant red star. Cinematographer Rodrigo Prieto did well in capturing some fantastic shots from the visual set pieces to set design. <br/><br/>My only problem with the film is the conflict. The conflict is the ship malfunctioning and threatening the lives of everyone on board. This does not happen until the third act which switches gear into a science fiction thriller. With this film on a good concept idea on a central theme of mortality, human connection, etc. I feel like screenwriter Jon Spaihts could have build so much into a more complex thriller with this space voyage instead of a simple quick fix conflict. It is still a wonderful film with two amazing leads, impressive visuals, and direction."

Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do just that...really well.<br/><br/>This might have been billed as a Sci-Fi as other reviewers have stated, but it is definitely romance, adventure and drama, with a little suspense thrown in.<br/><br/>I saw this without reading any reviews and loved it straight away, so much so that I watched it again within a few days. It is one of those movies that can be watched over and over without becoming boring.<br/><br/>When I read some of the critics reviews after watching it, I really thought they had the wrong movie. <br/><br/>My recommendation is if you like romance movies you will like this one, it is that simple.<br/><br/>8/10 for me and it could easily score higher, but I am being conservative."

The chemistry of Pratt and Lawrence was a catalyst for tangible tones of romance, conflict, and survival in this space of nothingness.

I think the main topic in this movie is loneliness and how it affects our lives.

"jan-hranac","6","11","19","31 December 2016"," A ""wasted"" opportunity.
","This is yet another film which had a good shot at being truly great and ended up being barely above average.<br/><br/>The actors (all four of them) and their performances are completely stellar, the CGI effects are great and will hold for decades to come, and the central idea is simple and ingenious at the same time. Unfortunately, this central, initial idea is where the ingenuity ends. The actual premise which came out of it mostly wasted it, as did the plot.<br/><br/>It felt like somebody had a truly great basic idea: two people on a ship trying to have a relationship whilst facing dangers of interstellar travel. As a matter of fact, it sounds like something I would come up with. Then somebody else started to build on this initial idea and didn't do a very good job. Not just the plot but the whole setting contains such a large logical holes which don't make any sense each on its own and even more so in combination with each other. These holes completely broke my suspension of disbelief and convinced me that the writers of the screenplay didn't even bother to read the Ender series (a recommended reading for pilots, officers, etc. and one of the ""bibles"" for building of fictional worlds containing interstellar colonialism).<br/><br/>For example, the story is set a thousand years in the future and yet the society still uses American dollars! Thousand years from now on, not only there won't be any dollars but there won't be even any United States and FED to print them! It's also rather ridiculous to expect that (fiat) money would still be used even locally, let alone on an interstellar level. It's also laughable that colonists would have any incentive to pay their debts to any corporation back home even if the colonies provided means to earn dollars which they have no use for. Earth-colonies relations simply wouldn't work that way even if FTL was possible and in this universe, ships travel at half the speed of light. Any corporation sending these ships wouldn't exist by the time a ship would reach its destination.<br/><br/>The logical structure (or lack of it) of the plot suffers a lot just for being set in such a flawed universe. At the same time, there are some (usual) plot-holes where things happen just for the dramatic effect.<br/><br/>To end on a bright note, I'm not saying that I didn't enjoy the film. All the four actors which had any substantial part on the film (and especially the two leading ones) were absolutely perfect. Strangely enough (or not so strangely), I didn't see Lawrence's previous roles in her character - I never expected her to shape-shift or to pull out a bow and arrows. I saw a little bit of Star Lord in Pratt but only a little.<br/><br/>Like I've said, this film should have been great and it's a great pity that it isn't."

So an added closed shielded system auto defrost a tech to check it out, when the tech has checked everything and verified it (by checking everything), they go back to sleep.<br/><br/>Doing anything else is idiotic to the nth degree and simple wouldn't be done.<br/><br/>I absolutely hate such ""plot holes"" (I know that most like I am the only one), but still I like the film.."

","Passengers opens up with Jim (Pratt), who wakes up in an empty spaceship 90 years too early. He wanders around for 30min (which is almost precisely a one year in the story), drinks whisky and finds a hot blonde Aurora (Lawrence) in a cryogenic pod. He builds a juvenile crush on her while watching her sleep every day like a perv. Tormented by loneliness and boredom, he decides to wake her up for his own pleasure, even though it means he will basically doom her to death by old age. What a lowlife.<br/><br/>And how boring lady this ""writer"" turn out to be. She has nothing interesting to say and is just a pretty blonde, who for some reason wants to travel 120 years to a new home planet, live there for one (1) year and travel back another 120 years to Earth just to witness some kind of a time jump 200 years into the future! Wow, what a fool. Seriously, why see such trouble, when you can't even be sure what happens after the first 120 years (or just 35 years). Maybe the new home planet is not what it seemed, or maybe Earth is not like it used to be. What then? So naive, but so is the whole movie.<br/><br/>Jim and Aurora build a relationship based mostly on lust. They are together alone, so it was mandatory. But all the forced sex and sappy love scenes were too much. I almost left the theater at that point. What a horrible, anti-climatic script writing. It got slightly better towards the end and almost felt like a sci-fi movie at times, but the ending killed it completely. The film could have redeemed itself, when Aurora had to make a choice. I should have guessed it at that point. Instead, like a sucker I still hoped to witness some logic in the characters, but no. Aurora exposes herself to be as depraved human being as Jim when she decides to forgive the ""murderer"" and choose the ""perv"" and continue her life on the ship with ""enter another character flaw here"".<br/><br/>The special effects are sparse for a sci-fi movie. Only captivating scenes were the anti-gravity water bubble and passing of Arcturus. But why bypass a star, if not by a coincidence, if they had already gained about 50% light speed. Makes no sense.<br/><br/>It amazes me what kind of trite actually gets released today by Hollywood. Lame script writing, idiotic and annoying characters, bad physics in SF, compulsory sex scenes, boring green scene acting, absolutely zero suspense. Ever so happy endings are aimed for the masses, I get it, but it mainly sickens me. It kills the creative vision and suspense, same thing as if every book had to begin with a line ""Once upon a time..."". It gets old and repetitive.

It all seemed so forced, right down to their criminally photoshopped cover images.<br/><br/>Not anything against them, they are a talented pair. But their chemistry wasn't there and that's something you'd think would be a problem with the creators not something to be ignored for the purpose of ratings. I mean they did have a $110 million budget to make back.<br/><br/>Heavily promoted, this is one I couldn't avoid if I wanted to so I eventually took the dive and found myself torn with the results.<br/><br/>First off as you'd expect for a movie of that budget it all looks great, polished to near perfection the film is a visual treat no doubt.<br/><br/>Trouble is the movie is your standard Hollywood formula, predictable, clichéd & shiny. Though the premise is solid, the creators clearly didn't know how to fully utilize this so the movie fell short.<br/><br/>Top that off with me thinking Pratt should stick to comedy and being poorly cast here and the movie was littered with flaws.<br/><br/>But again it's big and it's shiny and Lawrence looks beautiful as always so it's very easy to be distracted by the fact that the movie isn't actually very good. <br/><br/>The ending I found questionable but overall this could have been a complete garbage fire, yet avoided this and resulted in a watchable effort if you can get through the overbearing Hollywood tropes."

Depicting this as a film where two people are victims of something mysteriously gone wrong aboard a spaceship, with an insinuation that something nefarious is also afoot could not be farther from the actual plot of this movie. The bottom line for spending two hours watching this movie is that the Oscars needs to add an award category for biggest selfish jerk character in a movie for Jim and an anti-climactic, non- mysterious, non-nefarious, and predictable ""I can't live without you"" ending. <br/><br/>Jim, an actual victim of something gone wrong on a spaceship (the cliché meteor shower), spends a year alone living it up until he gets bored and then struggles to but finally decides the right thing to do is to make someone else (Aurora) suffer so he doesn't have to be the only person on the ship who is screwed. Of course after Aurora learns this she is angry but then, predictably, works with and later decides to forego her only opportunity to save herself to grow old and die with Jim.

Then a bit of a romantic story was introduced. The plot and pacing was done well enough for me to care about the characters and their future. The special affects (especially the swimming pool scene, when gravity was lost) was absolutely fantastic and unique. The score could of been better, but it was adequate and appropriate. The last half hour of the show was pretty action packed. I loved the idea of how it ended but would of rather had a little more time reviewing and seeing how their lives were lived as the message of the story was voiced over.

Every part of the starship Avalon is gorgeously beautiful and based on genuine scientific theories so the movie gives you a feeling like everything you see is really possible in a near future. The effects, voices and the the visualization of the space makes you think like you're in there and gives you a huge dose of excitement all over your body, it just feels electric. <br/><br/>The Romance between Jim and Aurora is really kind of interesting because they are like the best friends having fun everywhere, yet they help each other overcome the reality they live in and that creates a real relationship between them.

Its balanced, takes its time, sets up the characters smoothly, and doesn't jump around to different locations at whim like so many films are doing now.<br/><br/>Speaking of characters there really aren't that many-- and I think it works in the film's advantage. There never is a sense of confusion or the plot tripping over itself trying to stay relevant. Martin Sheen's role is one of comic relief and suave android bartender (not a spoiler, watch the trailer). Loved nearly every second of his screen time. The rest of the roles are obvious-- although I must say Chris Pratt absolutely carries this film and delivers an emotional depth that a lot of A-listers aren't these days. He is truly the next Harrison Ford or Christian Bale. Jennifer is... well... Jennifer. She does her thing, which isn't terrible but I didn't find it particularly inspired. I think the correct word is 'serviceable'. <br/><br/>The visual design is nothing short of post-modern perfection. Sprawling smooth metal textured silver vistas leading to glass windows blanket the ship's interior, giving a view into the beautiful blue hued nebulae of space. The artistic vision of space is not realistic but it certainly is authentic and fantastic to look at-- it doesn't require a suspension of belief to enjoy it unlike many recent space films.<br/><br/>The sound design throughout the film is also excellent. The music throughout is incredibly moving and well composed. Not on the level of Hanz Zimmer but still great.<br/><br/>There are a few technical issues that might stick out to the more scientifically minded but it never disrupts the flow or enjoyment of the film in my opinion. It all simply works.<br/><br/>If you're a sci-fi fantasy fan or just want to escape for a couple hours please support this film-- we need more like it. The critics need to step back and re-evaluate audience responses. They've lost touch."

And now The Passengers nearly ticked all the boxes. And - so sad - failed finally without any need. How could that happen?? Please, Columbia, and please, Mr. Tyldum give us a Directors Cut and fix the minor problems of that movie. 1. find another reason for the couple for not being able to go back to traveling sleep. For sure the space ship traveling service would provide the machinery for woken up technical personnel to go back to sleep, 2. make the final of the movie regarding repair of the atom reactor less dramatic and 3. don't overdo it with all the circumstances to bring Preston back to life. A less dramatic rescue of the spaceship would have done it perfectly. Why I still give 8 stars: wonderful pictures, wonderful acted. But mostly, I myself expect from a SciFi-picture that I am not bothered with an unnecessary love story. But a good movie also provides something new and surprising. The Passengers did this. Because it placed a love story in SciFi a n d it worked out. And so I was surprised. In a very positive way. I got emotionally extremely touched by Lane and Preston. And I could have done without all the final action at all. This movie is a great achievement.

Of course, this was mostly due to the film using just enough ""physics speak"" to be partially accurate, but incredibly wrong. Those parts stuck out to me in this movie and I kept scratching my head while watching it and saying, ""Wait a minute . . ."" That being said, not all of Passengers was bad, just a pretty big chunk of it.<br/><br/>I did appreciate the moral conundrum that Jim (Chris Pratt) encountered in the movie's first act. It did add a bit of predictable drama to the characters, but depicting his struggle highlighted his humanity. In this plot with a clear three-act structure, this first act was the highlight that eventually devolved into a ridiculous setup for the final reveal. With each new character introduced, the tension increased in each act. And yet, I wondered if the spacecraft could have even survived that long given the issues it had.<br/><br/>In a story that initially felt like The Martian (2015), with bits of WALL-E (2008) mixed in (especially with Thomas Newman's musical score for both Passengers and WALL-E), the scientist in me could not ignore a few key aspects of this film. First, a simple Wolfram Alpha search will tell you that it would take 73 years to reach Arcturus at ½ light speed, not 30. Second, for a spaceship that is rotating, why would it need to have a separate ""gravity drive"" to keep things in place (other than to make me wonder why the gravity was strangely perpendicular to the rotation)? Finally, the spaceship was clearly accelerating the entire time, so I wonder if the ½ light speed velocity was at that point or during the whole duration of the current flight. All glaring disobediences to the laws of physics.<br/><br/>An excuse to have Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence star in a movie together, I give Passengers 2.5 stars out of 5."

","Sold on the concept of 'Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in space', the film excels based on their sensational chemistry and performances and the pair manage to command every moment of the runtime. Despite being largely a two-hander - with Michael Sheen popping in every now and then as Arthur the Android and serving his purpose - Lawrence and Pratt make such a compelling duo that no one else is needed; we care deeply for these characters and sympathise with their plight and, without too many spoilers, understand their actions even when they are morally flawed and/or questionable. Sci-fi can often come across as cold and technology-centered, but Passengers is very character-driven at its core, thus making it far more emotionally resonant than is expected of the genre typically. Lawrence's character is afforded some solid character building through her 'character profile' while Pratt's Jim is a little more complicated (more on that later...) but their chemistry - almost a third character in its own right - is the strongest here.

Instead, you get explosions and some robots for an hour, as well as a hulk (something for you ladies) who wanders around in a tank top bashing against the unbreakable walls and mirrors of the ship. Then, you have a completely predictable love story, a character that is awoken only to die a few minutes later to help move through the mindless script.<br/><br/>It's not all bad. There are a few bright spots in this film: a/ gorgeous, sexy, blooming Jennifer Lawrence b/ witty robot-bartender that is the only funny thing in the film and expresses more emotion than the protagonists c/ space always looks captivating d/ Jennifer Lawrence, come on, I am serious! Jennifer, I know you are reading this, I would have awoken you as well!<br/><br/>But two hours of all this? *Yawn*"
"deltaforce7","1","13","24","6 March 2017"," Another dreary, unbearable story of 'emotions'
","This is just another movie about digging deep into someone's disturbed emotions.<br/><br/>This flick is no exception. On a background of space colonization travel, it tells this boring story of 'highly' emotional people dealing with their emotions all the time. Any technical discomfort drives them further insane into their mental weakness. Sad, boring, stupid.<br/><br/>If these kinds of clowns try to inhabit them poor other planets, then the 'emotional' individuals shall find themselves amidst the same dull, weak, boring problems that they tried to escape from. Besides, it is funny how colonists who should be a steadfast and resilient bunch actually need this space cruise ship with all the amenities! If they cannot travel in any conditions other than such as of a 5-star resort, then how would they survive the most likely hard and dangerous conditions of a faraway planet that needs to be colonized?<br/><br/>Sad, boring, dull, stupid. Why do I ever watch such garbage anyway?"
"lucashammar","7","23","48","21 December 2016"," Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt is what makes this movie worth to watch!
","When I saw the trailer for this movie I knew I would experience an amazing travel in a fantastic spaceship in the extraordinary beautiful outer space with two of my favorite actors.<br/><br/>So what's the story? In the future, a giant spaceship with 5000 sleeping passengers from earth is on a space-journey to a new colony on a new planet. But due to a malfunction, a passenger named Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90 years too early and quickly realizes that he will be dead before the spaceship reaches it's destination and will probably be alone for his whole life. He gets very lonely after a while and can't take it anymore. When he discovers that he can make another passenger awake, he wakes up Aurora Dunn (Jennifer Lawrence) in hope that he will no longer be alone and might get her to fall in love with him. But soon they both discover that there might be something wrong with the spaceship and has to do something about it.<br/><br/>So what did I think about the movie? It was great. I liked the performance of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, the scenography, the special effects, the romance, and the thrilling action scenes. The way they try to make space a beautiful scenario to travel through is very excellent, and how the spaceship looks like a very luxury cruise is really cool (and yes, you could think they are ripping off the Wall- E scenario here, but this movie is really not trying to be that over the top, I promise you that). The way the two lead characters are interacting with each other is probably the best thing about the movie. If there is a reason to watch the movie twice, it is to see the lead characters again. Their romance is likable and you believe the chemistry between them is genuine. I mean come on! It's Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt alone in a spaceship. You are gonna get what you want. But of course, the movie is not without the typical ""liar revealed"", and you might think it's gonna ruin the movie. But surprisingly, they made it work without any unnecessary problems in the story.<br/><br/>What's the bad thing about the movie? I think it depends on what you want? Okay, maybe the movie could have worked without the 3D-effects too, but I digress. If you want a likable romance with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence in a sci-fi adventure movie that also provides a thrilling action story, I believe you are gonna get it in this one. I liked this movie and I will watch it again sometimes."
"poppinsm80","2","20","41","11 January 2017"," No plot
","I've just watched this movie and like some other reviewers, I ended up checking my watch half way through it.<br/><br/>Great actors, that's about it. Had potential, but the plot was so under-developed, to the point where nothing really happens in this movie - no proper love story development nor sci-fi plot. About the only wise line throughout the movie is that you should not wish you were somewhere else but make the most of here and now. But jeez, I've heard this saying so many times and watched so many movies on this topic that were done a lot better than this. Conclusion, it can hardly be called a sci-fi or love story/romance."
"angus-silvie","10","2","2","8 March 2020"," Thought provoking and not designed to please feminists
","I think some reviewers have lost sight of the fact that this is a film. A fiction. It isn't real. So they are 'calling out' the sexism, the  fantasy', the male patriarchy elements where a 'man' (ugh) wakes up a woman just because he wants company, and only after considerable agonising. Yes, he did the wrong thing, and he knew he had, but this was the whole point of this fictional film - it makes you think - what would I do in this dilemma? You can't give a film 1 star because you disagree with what one of the characters did. That is not how film reviews work. Otherwise The Shining would have universal 1 star reviews wouldn't it? Oh no, that's fine, because it is only violence, not sex.<br/><br/>It is also helpful whenever accusations of sexism are flung around to reverse the polarities and say ok, what if it was a woman waking up a man? You would not hear a peep out of any of the angry complainants and indeed they would probably give the film 10 stars. A woman empowers herself!<br/><br/>So instead of judging a film based on whether or not you agree with what the characters are doing (which is a stupid approach as then every horror or murder film would be instantly rubbish), let's look at it as an artistic endeavour. Yes, there were some minor plot holes, but this is sci-fi. From my perspective, the acting was great, the sets were magnificent, the directing was excellent, and the story made you think. I was certainly glued to it until the end, and it entertained me. Isn't that what films are supposed to do?<br/><br/>And if Chris Pratt had just carried on in the space ship on his own for the next 60 years chatting to Arthur that would have made for a boring film, wouldn't it?"
"barrocou","8","2","2","31 January 2020"," An imperfect but remarkable film.
","Passengers.<br/><br/>A science fiction film directed by Morten Tyldum, written by Jon Spaihts; starring Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne.<br/><br/>Synopsis:
In the futuristic era of humans colonizing other planets, a hibernation pod fails and leaves one person awake, stranded inside the ship, with more than a lifetime to go before arrival to destination. Will he live his life in solitary, end it all or spread out his predicament to others by messing with their hibernation pods?<br/><br/>Some degree of spoiling ahead.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" is a remarkable film, an imperfect one, but fun to watch and fairly thought provoking.<br/><br/>I have two lines of thought that arise from the film, one regarding the film itself and the other that delves into the subject that the film opens for discussion.<br/><br/>First the ethical dilemma.<br/><br/>Many critics of this movie, have focused on the ethical dilemma. Some have said that it's not even a dilemma because Jim's decision is so blatantly wrong. Some focus on the sexist characteristics of the decision, because it is perceived as Jim awakening Aurora in order to use her for his benefit.<br/><br/>I think they are confusing the character with the writer. The decision is wrong yes, but that's what's interesting about the story. The writer in not saying this is a good decision. He is asking, if confronted with such a dilemma, wouldn't we all be tempted to do what the character did?<br/><br/>Waking Aurora is controversial, but so is almost every decision of life and death caliber we can make in real life. Chris' decision to wake up Aurora reminds me of a situation I have seen countless times in romantic couples in real life. When a wife puts pressure on a husband (or the other way around if you will) to ""stay home more on sundays"" for example, she is rightly demanding him to fulfill his promise as a husband to be with his wife, but she is also egotistically asking him to sacrifice his individual needs, in order to have him near her for her own personal needs.<br/><br/>I'm not trying to find an answer in a couple of paragraphs. We could argue about this situation for months and never come to a satisfying conclusion, the moral and ethical considerations become very complicated and quite a bit subjective when we talk about this kind of question. My point is that we are always balancing egoism and altruism and sometimes there is no clearly defined line to divide the two. Human nature and nature itself has to be egotistical to a certain point or there would be no survival of the fittest, no survival of the species, no personal achievement of goals. We all capture fragments of other people's lives for our personal benefit. The key is that there should be consent, but then again consent is sometimes a result of some degree of pressure. That is why I said before that I suspect (given the situation the movie establishes) we would all seriously consider the option of waking others, rather than just discarding the idea as ethically wrong.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I'm not saying Chris' decision is right, I'm saying Tyldum and Spaihts are right in offering this subject for discussion and I thank them for it.<br/><br/>Now the film and it's merits.<br/><br/>I already said the film is imperfect, but not because it takes a stand on the moral dilemma. Rather, because I feel the third part is a waste of what was achieved during the first two thirds. Why do they feel the need to turn every film towards the action-explosion path when there was a very interesting situation, worthy of a great film, already going on? The movie is not ruined, I like it anyway. The production is top notch, the acting is excellent and the pace is great too.<br/><br/>The cliched action-explosion situation could have been avoided, for example, by having the Avalon's failing system start messing up the hibernating people or even killing them. Or by losing navigation capabilities and going in the wrong direction.<br/><br/>The last part of the plot is coherent given the direction the writer was going once he decided that Jim's decision was fortuitously good for Aurora, hence ""redeeming"" him. Because she would have been killed if the ship had exploded or whatever was going to happen without their intervention. Therefore, he inadvertently ""saved"" her by waking her up. However, it might have been more satisfying to take a more ambiguous direction and explore the situation if the ship was not facing certain destruction. If Chris' decision was not so clearly ""necessary"" for the survival of all the passengers and crew.<br/><br/>I also feel the machine waking up Gus feels too much like a need of the plot, so he can tell Jim where to look and to give Aurora the ""drowning man"" speech. In lesser films, this might be irrelevant, but for me, this movie was good enough that I feel it would have been even better if it had avoided both the action-explosion commonplace and the easy justification of Chris' decision."

Jennifer Lawrence was great. Michael Sheen was too. Chris Pratt however in the scenes where he was meant to be the doting lover or show real emotion was hilariously bad.

","Passengers (2016)
Very credible Sci-Fi. It's asking an enormous, enormous amount for 2 (3) actors to carry a two hour movie and this is its biggest triumph. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence are eminently engaging and endlessly watchable.
The space and science are largely believable. The dialogue and interactions work. The structure and tonal balance work.
It asks plenty of questions among others just why did anyone get on board and questions of humanity.
The film rests upon their relationship and its up to you whether this examination survives the duration but it did....just...for me, or at least I could buy it.
I felt he last 3 or 4 minutes could have been explored differently or to be honest, just explored, but maybe short and sweet was for the best rather than further ""work(ing) the problem"".
It's not its fault that it isn't the searing Sci-Fi of Arrival, the all things to everyone of The Martian or have the peril of say Gravity.
I think it's a genuine feat that this movie will acceptably cross genres and have a greater appeal than one could imagine. Broadening the appeal of a setting I love can't be a bad thing.

The characters they are playing are endearing. Forced to notice that one attaches immediately to the character of Jim, then to that of Aurora. At different stages of the film, I was surprised to ask myself ""what would have I done in his place?"" Some choices made by the characters may seem unfair to us but they are finally justified. Indeed, the human factor is not to be neglected and is often put forward; the characters (and actors) go from laughter to tears with perfect mastery.<br/><br/>The sets are impressive and the special effects are very successful (I think about the scene where Aurora's swimming in the pool, when gravity ceases, water in weightlessness is remarkably realized)<br/><br/>Passengers allows us to observe a future arousing our curiosity but which, as we discover it, also gives way to fear and anguish.

Yes, there will always be quibbles about accuracy when it comes gravity, micro- and otherwise. There were some other plot holes, but what movie doesn't have those? <br/><br/>Chris Pratt has come a long way from playing the doofus on ""Parks and Recreation"". He is adequate, but his story is a cautionary tale to any actor who considers giving up. Apparently anyone can get lucky and end up with a career as an action-film hero. Jennifer Lawrence was fine (and VERY fetching) and I do not understand all of the criticism of her acting on this film. I think she got the most out the material. The crux of the middle third of the movie is the ethical dilemma faced (and failed) by one of the characters, and this was proper for such an enormous decision.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was enjoyable, but not destined to be a classic.

Space related movie can have a simple plot to deal with as well, which probably disappointed the super minded critics. <br/><br/>The passenger who woke up from hibernation pod were not a geek nor astronaut to do something incredible.

"Kaserynofthegyre","7","11","20","2 January 2017"," Curious levels of hate for this reasonable romance
","Most of the anger seems to be about the moral dilemma that Chris Pratt's character faces and his response to it. Clearly many of the critics feel he made a bad choice. However they seem to be glossing over the fact that he knows what he's doing is wrong (he even has an expository chat with the robot barman to ensure we all get the implications). He's already tried, and failed, to kill himself at this point so it's not like he's acting on a whim and his self loathing is evident. The fact that Jennifer Lawrence's character finds a way to forgive him is crime is held up as a 'message' from the filmmakers that stalking is OK cos she'll come around in the end. Really? Leaving aside that 'stalking' is hardly the right term for such an extreme scenario she has the opportunity to kill him - which he knowingly gives her - and chooses not to take it - facing effectively the same dilemma as Pratt's character faced and coming to a similar realisation - the alternative to this extreme choice is suicide. (If she chose hibernation at the end of the film she knows he will kill himself) She chooses compassion. I've read here someone claiming the robot bartender 'sold him out' No he didn't. In the dialogue he is told that the two characters 'have no secrets from each other' and he - being a robot - believes them. (See the collected works of Issac Asimov for full details) There are problems with this film - the resurrection and convenient death of a crew member seems only to occur to get past a plot obstacle -and yes the usual Hollywood requirement is that the leads are both impossibly good looking - but the visuals are impressive and the cast do a good job. The more I reflect on the film the more I like it."

There are scenes which will bring tears to your face, both sad and happy tears. In any case, this movie doesn't disappoint when it comes to emotions.

Jennifer Lawrence showed us who's the boss when it comes to actresses.<br/><br/>All in all, definitely a movie to see. At least twice."
"carlosdz","9","17","34","30 December 2016"," Very good Sci Fi film
","Passengers is a good film, a Sci Fi story about two people stranded in space for the rest of their lives. I cannot understand why this movie is not getting better ratings, I especially enjoyed the bar scenes with obvious references to The Shining (the carpet is the same as in the overlook Hotel). I think this movie is a love story, it has everything to be consider a great film but for some reason people are not liking it. Both actors (Lawrence and Pratt) are excellent at their craft. I'll give it a 9 because in some parts it tends to get kind of slow, but of course is a movie worth watching, much more better than many Marvel movies you forget the moment you step out of the Theater."
"Ramascreen","8","24","51","21 December 2016"," The perfect date movie
","PASSENGERS is your textbook romantic film surrounded by breathtaking sci-fi. After so many survival films about one man only or one woman only, on an island or in space or against a shark, it's nice to see a survival film with two people and nobody else for a change. And with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as the leads, this is a glossy adventure you can't keep your eyes off of.<br/><br/>The story is set onboard a spaceship transporting thousands of lives to a new life on another planet, it's supposed to be a 120-year journey but a malfunction happens that causes Chris Pratt's character, Jim's hibernation pod opening prematurely. Having spent a year all by himself there, Jim decides to intentionally get a woman to wake up as well, that woman is Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). As they begin to unravel the mystery behind the malfunction, they fall in love, but when certain truths come to surface, they find their spaceship and their lives fall apart.<br/><br/>This is a sweet, sleek, romantic film, boy meets girl in a pod, boy wakes girl up, boy falls for girl, o and there's a bartender in a setting that looks kinda like the bar in the overlook hotel in Stanley Kubrick's ""The Shining."" And just the million and one things that the spaceship can do is enough to make any sci-fi fan go, 'Whoah, that's super cool.'<br/><br/>When I was screening ""Passengers,"" I was trying hard to find whether or not the film has some kind of underlying point that I may have been missing but really it's just a story about relationship, can it survive the cosmic ordeals at hand and can it also survive the lies. It is really essentially a romantic drama set in space, it doesn't get much simpler than that. Our future ambitions can't compare to our fear of loneliness.<br/><br/>To this day, I'm glad that writer/director James Gunn gambled on Chris Pratt as Star-Lord in his ""Guardians Of The Galaxy"" movie because otherwise we probably wouldn't have known that hidden gem, that leading man everyman quality that Pratt has, and it shows in this latest character, Jim. And Jennifer Lawrence is just as beautiful and sharp as ever, her quick spot on reactions, how she's there for the moment, is unparalleled. Yes it's got thrills, mystery, and spectacular imagery but when you strip it away, what you have is ""Passengers"" as this season's perfect date movie."

","Passengers is a delight to watch and get wrapped up in. Pratt and Lawrence give the best performances of their career and go beyond the limits delivering a performance that ends up being truly extraordinary to the highest form of art. The story itself won't let you go till it's over and your eyes glued to the screen, wanting to see what awaits each and every turn. It more than deserves praise for Pratt and Lawrence pushing themselves beyond the outer limits into what is deemed extraordinary. People should give this movie a chance and be transformed by the highest form of art I've ever seen in my life. I can see the Oscar nominations in the future. And it's two people you certainly wouldn't mind spending 90 years on a ship alone with. You get enraptured and end up caring about Jim and Aurora's journey with one of the greatest third acts I've ever seen for a film. Truly art. You truly end up falling in love with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. It has a phenomenal narrative putting yourself in Jim's shoes what would you do? My rating- 10 out of 10"

","I think the plot line could've been better. It was basically a space Titanic like other people mentioned.<br/><br/>I liked the romance, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt did well and their love for each other felt real. I wished that both their pods opened on accident instead of him trying to open it without her consent bc it created backlash on social media about rape culture. Also, this isn't a ""based on a true story"" so you cant expect everything to follow the physics/science law. IT's SCI-FI. People need to stop taking it so seriously. Yes the spaceship looks unrealistic and yes crew members shouldve been awake to check up on everybody and maybe there should've been an emergency button. (It was more romance than sci-fi by the way. ) ALSO, you're telling me that if you're stuck on a spaceship 90 years away from your destination, you wouldn't DIE to have someone to talk to or whatever. I feel like if I was in Pratt's character point of view, I would probably have done the same. Plus, their love moved the story along. I don't know how much longer I could watch him grow his facial hair and trying to get back inside his hibernation pod. There would have been a lot of action. PEOPLE GO WATCH IT. Don't LISTEN TO THE CRITICS."

","A thoughtful and compelling film that stays just this side of unbelievable. Great visuals, strong acting and a surprising anti- corporate sense of humor. No icky aliens or extended space warfare scenes, this is pure drama and romance that also wrestles with several moral dilemmas. Special mention goes to Michael Sheen who plays the compassionate if robotic bartender and inadvertently triggers the unraveling of the main character's secret. Most of the movies I've seen on the big screen over the last ten years have been disappointments that made me feel I'd wasted the ticket price.

","Wow, this movie is beyond my expectations, after I watched some space movie like Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian, this caught my attention. Though the space was not that showed in the movie, I loved it. <br/><br/>I just didn't expect the ending, I mean there is something I waited to happen like they just playing there for almost 90 years yet they didn't made a Baby. The ship has complete facilities and things for human survival so there is for sure a chance for a baby to survive there. And also how come there was a chicken and rabbits? at the end (Im assuming here that those fellas undergone hibernation too) but that's quite funny. And also why they only show the crews at the end, how about the other passengers, I don't think you will lose profit if you include some breathing passengers at the end :) There are only 4 casts in there anyway. <br/><br/>Overall, I am impressed on how our technology improved this year, the settings was very realistic!"
"socrates99","9","10","18","31 December 2016"," A true sci-fi story of the kind I used to read as a kid, done beautifully and convincingly
","The whole idea of traveling between stars has been contemplated for a long time. There are huge obstacles that would have scared off most scriptwriters, but not Jon Spaihts, or the director, Morten Tyldum. Not sure who had the most guts, perhaps both, but the result is spectacular and engrossing. Truth be told there are a couple of plot gimmicks employed to liven up the drama, but I was so wrapped up in the story I hardly noticed.<br/><br/>What if you woke up before everyone else on a ship not due to make landfall for 90 years? What might you do out of desperation?<br/><br/>Imagining what might happen in a plausible way is either going to fall short or seem magical. This treatment is definitely the latter. The look and feel of the starship is fresh and impressive. And both Lawrence and Pratt do more than what is required by the story, they not only make it all believable, they make it poignant and emotional too. I could see Jennifer's part going to some stunning starlet, a younger Megan Fox, perhaps, but the movie would have lacked the emotional impact it gets from a pro like Jennifer, who gets more alluring with every picture.<br/><br/>Rogue One seems pretty childish in comparison."

","I hate romance films. I'm also not the biggest fan of many of the scifi stuff circulating at the moment, particularly the space theme that seems to be the taste of the day. When a friend suggested Passengers, I agreed because she has to put up with my tastes most of the time. I was surprised I enjoyed this so much.<br/><br/>Passengers was the most emotionally engrossing film I have seen in months. From the get go, you ache for Jim Preston and witness his demise sympathetically. When his loneliness/insanity causes him to wake another passenger, and thus takes her life away from her, there is no damnation of his character (not from me personally). The whole story has you questioning what you personally would do in that situation.<br/><br/>The special effects were phenomenal: breathtaking shots of space and seamless editing. Yet despite being visually stunning, the film is much more emotionally outstanding.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the critics. Loved this film"

One of the best movies of the year. Not a slow movie, went by fast, very entertaining."
"adrianumx","10","16","32","24 December 2016"," A mesmerising exploration of how spaceflight might challenge our essential human drives
","The movie starts with stunning visuals of spaceflight and you find yourself aboard a breathtakingly realistic-looking Starship Avalon. Minutes later you follow Chris Pratt's captivating portrayal of a down-to-earth engineer Jim, finding his way through a first layer of the ship's futuristic intricacies. Add an impressive performance by Michael Sheen as an android and you're hooked on the potential on this movie. By the time that Jennifer Lawrence's charismatic performance, as an ambitious journalistic writer Aurora Lane, took the movie to yet another level of immersion, I became aware I was witnessing a completely original story that felt humanly as real as it gets in a movie theatre.<br/><br/>Besides the mesmerising chemistry between the two main protagonists, one of the thrills of this movie that stood out for me was that most of the scenarios they were facing were completely realistic, within the context of the story, even by our pre-futuristic spaceflight standards. This allowed me to deeply identify with both of their individual plights, and consequently to fully root for them to find some kind of positive outcome to the increasingly dramatic situation on the ship.<br/><br/>I won't reveal what the surprising twists are that make this movie unique and so fascinating to watch, but I can safely hint at what it is that tipped the scales for me regarding rating Passengers as high as a full 10/10. <br/><br/>Surely most of us here on IMDb love movies that are still percolating in our minds hours after we have left the movie theatre, and this is definitely one of those exceptional movies for me. Have you ever imagined how would your core human drives play out on a spaceflight during a long-term dramatic situation with uncertain outcomes for both awake and hibernated passengers? The excellent acting performances in this movie gave me a visceral experience of what I myself might be intensely struggling with if I were facing those same moral dilemmas that Jim and Aurora were trying to cope with. And I hope that the movie's beautifully delivered take-home message, a reminder of one of the essential building blocks of being truly alive, will stay with me for good.<br/><br/>As for the more technical filmmaking considerations, I have only spotted one very minor technical oversight, and realised, only upon later reflection, that there might have been one potential minor plot hole. That wouldn't make me budge from wanting to rate this film 10/10, if it weren't for what felt like a rushed story development at one or two points in the movie. <br/><br/>But what is a critical review of a film good to either a filmmaker or the audience if it doesn't take into account the reality of filmmaking? I know, from my practical experience with directing and editing on my filmmaking university course, how difficult it can be to make things flow in the edit, without losing momentum or stretching the story to unreasonable length. And so, taking this and all of the above into account, I feel that overall I can honestly give Passengers 10/10 rating for its original story, incredible production design and visual effects, great thought-provoking directing, and mesmerising performances."

","I enjoyed this movie. Great chemistry between possibly the two most in-demand and popular actors alive, visually brilliant and an okay story.<br/><br/>I desperately want to mention though, the trailers portrayed the film as something different from what it is. Watching the trailers makes it look like a thriller or action film in space with romance but it is basically opposite, a romance in space with about 20 minutes of action. I'd be totally okay with this, if I hadn't be led to believe it was something else.<br/><br/>On the story, it isn't super interesting but builds at a good pace and unfortunately unravels a bit too fast.

"urbanswami","10","13","25","29 December 2016"," A fairy tale about global warming
","Contrary to popular belief this movie isn't a sci-fi or a thriller/drama about the psychological strains and moral dilemmas one would have to face and endure on a century long space voyage or anything else people try to label it as. <br/><br/>This movie is a fairy tale. It uses the classic tropes of fairy tales: a minimal set of characters isolated from the world, boy and girl as protagonists and an antagonist which in this case is the setting itself. Boy and girl fall in love, not as a main point of the story but as a story telling tool. You see, the prime directive of all living things (including humans) is to ensure the continuation of their own individual existence, which translates into procreation which through our specie's evolution got reinforced with associated emotions, as in we crave and enjoy contact with our significant other, we experience love. Love then is a shorthand for survival, so storywise you can say 'whatever you do for love, you do essentially to survive which means it's absolutely necessary and morally right.' The happy ending means that the lovers have succeeded, therefor their actions serve as a practical example to what you (the viewer) should do in a similar situation. So the morale of the story is in their actions: under such and such circumstances these actions and/or mindset will be the most beneficial to you.<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>The morale of this movie is conveyed through three key dialogues. Arthur telling Jim to accept his life, his present and make the best of it instead of wishing for some unobtainable future. Jim telling Aurora during her interview that 'back on Earth, if something broke they didn't fix it, rather replace it' (kinda like all of them leaving Earth for Homestead 2 (hint-hint)). Gus tracking the system failures, showing the hologram time line and stating that all the problems and prognosed demise of the ship can be traced back to one underlying fault.<br/><br/>The warning of the story is this: our (westers culture and fast advancing developing countries) materialist obsession with chasing future fulfillment leaves us blind to our present, which in turn makes us unsatisfied and unappreciative of what we have, which in turn makes us neglectful of our duty to preserve what we have, which ultimately makes us extremely irresponsible with our own lives. <br/><br/>The story goes like this: Jim focusing on the present endulges himself for a year but realizes that the opulence and luxury of the ship that is our modern civilization is not enough to satisfy his most fundamental needs as a human being. He seeks companionship, it works, they fall in love, then their love get's tested, their existence is threatened by the failures of the ship. Avalon is a metaphor for spaceship Earth, the malfunction is global warming, the cascade of problems is all the symptoms and side effects of it that we experience. The big tension at the end is the climate catastrophe we are heading towards.<br/><br/>The morale is twofold: seek human connection instead of material goods. Take care of your environment, more specifically the planet Earth. The ending scene is a reinforcement of this, meaning: our true home is the natural ecosystem that we evolved in and which sustains us, not the gleaming metal halls of our technology filled civilization. <br/><br/>The movie itself is a sneaky wake up call to adult western viewers. The choice of fairy-tale-esque story telling is a powerful critique of said viewer audience's mental acumen from the writer and director. The critics' dismissal of this movie is a sad validation of the creators' base assumption about the viewers.<br/><br/>The subplots of the waking up of Aurora with all of the decision's moral issues, the resolution of their seemingly irresolvable conflict are explored just enough to signal the audience, this movie is for adults and the director and writer are aware of these obvious implications and are not trying to sell cheap eye-candy. But are not further developed precisely because they are not this movie's focus and that's where people get off track and misread this whole movie.<br/><br/>tl;dr: If it looks like a duck and sounds like a duck, it's probably a duck. But if the audience is trained to see cats and dogs they'll find a quacking, wobbling, feathered creature to be a f**k ugly dog instead of seeing it for what it is, which is a duck.<br/><br/>All in all, great movie! I recommend you watch it and tell your friends and family about it."

","Critics have once again have shown themselves to be a collection of idiots. Remember these are the people who thought a snooze-fest called Boyhood was a great movie. In Boyhood and Passengers, their reviews have often little to do with what occurred in either movie. Passengers has a great story with fascinating characters. Jim Preston played, by Chris Pratt, wakes up early. He slowly goes bonkers until he decides to wake up Aurora Lane, played by Jennifer Lawrence. Romance and sex follows. When she discovers the truth of why she was woken up, she expresses rage as only Lawrence can. Critics are increasing failing to appreciate how good she really is. <br/><br/>The necessity of working together to save the ship brings them together. the find sequence is as exciting as anything I have seen is a movie. The ending is perfectly logical. Jim and Aurora make a virtue of necessity and decide to make a life together.<br/><br/>Feminists and their male lapdogs have little regard for male rights.They have no qualms in demanding that Jim Preston die alone when he has 5,000 choices for companionship. This was unfair for Aurora but very fair for Jim. Saving the ship brings them together and should answered all objections."
"guflerm","1","9","16","2 April 2017"," Drama aboard the Interstellar Love Boat
","If you're a sci-fi fan, you will be disappointed. There is nothing logical about this film. Nothing. They could have saved on production costs by using a more realistic setting appropriate for this self-absorbed couple, like the basement of his parent's house. Pure nonsense."
"master-bot","3","9","16","6 March 2017"," Logic is out the window. The entire premise is a practical joke.
","It's OK when a well-made science fiction movie requires the audience to take a leap of faith, especially when it's a space thriller. For example, most sci-fi fans take for granted concepts such as time-travel, hyper-space, FTL, wormholes, etc. As long as the story and characters are good, everything else is secondary and certain far-fetched ideas are acceptable. In this movie, the main premise is that a super-advanced, highly automated, human-made space ship transports people in stasis pods to a distant colony while traveling at half the speed of light, and the whole trip will take about 120 years. OK. Fine. This is the future, so we can accept that. The problem is that many of the events driving the story contradict that basic premise. <br/><br/>1. Transporting humans in stasis – that's the single most important function of the space ship. That's what it was made for. Well, it turns out that whoever designed the ship did not plan a fail-safe in case a stasis pod malfunctions. In fact, this incredibly advanced ship automatically comes to life when someone wakes up, and it can sense what a person wants to drink at the bar, or how they feel, but somehow the ship doesn't 'see' the bigger picture - that someone is awake 90 years too soon! And how do they explain this in the movie - ""The pods were not supposed to ever fail"". This is absurd. That would be like building a limousine with a bar and an entertainment center, that didn't come with an airbag because, well it's not supposed to ever crash. <br/><br/>2. Can't go back into stasis once you are awake. Yea sure, this ship - a feat of human engineering, whose main purpose is to transport people in stasis over vast distances over hundreds of years of flight time, does not have the capability of putting someone back into stasis. How is that nonsense explained in the movie – ""going into stasis is a very long and complicated process that requires special equipment, which is not available on this super-advanced ship"". Just to clarify, we are supposed to believe that letting someone go back into stasis is MORE complicated than building a ship that can travel at 50% the speed of light, that can automatically sense incoming asteroids and divert power to the main shield to protect itself, and that can slingshot itself around a red giant star while withstanding super-hot temperatures. But putting people back to sleep well that's just way too complicated, so to hell with it. If someone wakes up tough luck. <br/><br/>3. But wait, it turns out later that that's not entirely true. There is one automated medical pod that can possibly put a person into stasis. HUH? Wait, so it CAN be done after all? Why didn't they engineer that capability in all the stasis pods? And was there really a SINGLE med pod on the entire ship supporting 5000 people? What about spares? What if that med pod malfunctioned? LOL! It turns out that ship was only advanced in certain aspects, but it's really crappy when it comes to preserving human life. The writers basically wrote themselves into a whole, piling up ridiculous explanations as to why only one person on the entire ship could go back into stasis, but two people couldn't. Very weak.<br/><br/>4. The stasis pods can actually kill someone in a slow and agonizing way, by inducing hundreds of life-threatening conditions AT THE SAME TIME. Fantastic! I thought the ship was designed to recognize a pod malfunction and interrupt the stasis BEFORE a person is killed or severely harmed. <br/><br/>5. The flight crew are never awoken, even when critical systems start to fail. So, basically, this ship was designed, so that everyone will either reach the destination, OR everyone will die in their sleep. No matter how bad things get, and how necessary the engineering crew is, there are no fail-safe systems to wake up the people who can actually fix stuff. The only time anyone is pulled out of stasis is when their individual pod malfunctions. Obviously the ship couldn't repair itself without human intervention, so why wasn't human intervention pre-programmed as a response to major breakage? Why would anyone go into this flying death trap? Ridiculous. <br/><br/>Now, about some of the decision making by the three passengers. <br/><br/>6. Why didn't Gus take the pain meds knowing that he had to survive for as long as possible to repair the ship, and why did he later regret not taking them, right before he died? Just another stupidity that remained unexplained. <br/><br/>7. Oh, and when the ship was about to fail completely, why did the two protagonists stop by the bar to deactivate Arthur? For some reason they decided that fixing the android bartender was more important than saving the ship and everyone on it. These two deserved to die just for that stupidity.<br/><br/>8. And more when they searched the main engineering section for ""something broken"", the guy said that it would take too long to wake up the crew. So, somehow he came to the conclusion that it would be faster for two unqualified passengers to troubleshoot and fix a super-advanced space ship, than to wake up a crew of engineers whose job was to fix the ship? W.T.F.! They should have woken people up the minute they saw flames in the engine chamber, or even sooner. <br/><br/>Am I overthinking these things? How do I leave my brain by the door before watching a movie? In some scifi movies the 'science' part is supposed to be ignored to some extent, but this is not one of them because the whole story revolves around the science aspects of the ship, many of which make no sense. FAIL. 3 stars for the special effects."

Laurence Fishburne plays Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso; a member of the crew likewise accidentally thawed out ahead of schedule (although, two years after Jim). And Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane; a beautiful journalist who gets thawed out in between.<br/><br/>The only difference, in her case, is that Jim woke her up, deliberately!<br/><br/>The poor guy was lonely. And, for the first twelve months after her awakening, she eases that loneliness. Vice-versa, too. But, Arthur the android bartender blabs the truth to her, and the romance goes temporarily awry. <br/><br/>This is when the audience gets the real sense of things starting to go majorly wrong. You see, Arthur was specifically ordered _not_ to blab! So, why did he disobey? Because, the ship's governing A.I. is starting to lose power! Causing everything to gradually go haywire aboard the Avalon. That's why I don't think Jim and Gus' reawakening was accidental, after all. I think the A.I. programmed their thaw-outs as part of some contingency plan. Of course, I have no proof of that. <br/><br/>That's just a glorified wild guess on my part.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie more than I initially thought I would. The chemistry between Chris and Jennifer rivals that between her and Josh Hutcherson in the ""Hunger Games"" films. And, it's _definitely_ steamier than the so-called romance between Chris and Theresa Saldana's characters in GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY! The only reason I don't give this a perfect ten?<br/><br/>I wish the film's happy ending had included an uncredited cameo by Josh Hutcherson as Jim and Aurora's son. Ah, well! They say you can't have everything. So, I guess I'll settle for this being my last rave review of 2016.<br/><br/>Happy New Year, folks!"
"danielgj-85299","7","15","30","21 December 2016"," Decent chick flick, frustrating sci-fi
","Passengers is a decent movie for what it is, a chick flick in space. I really didn't know what to expect going into this movie, I only saw one trailer, but I liked the cast and I liked the concept so I decided to watch. Coming out I was exasperated by the last quarter of the movie. There were so many possible ways of pushing the plot to its conclusion and they just picked one of the worst. <br/><br/>Before I get to that terribleness, I want to point out the things that were enjoyable in the film. The sets were beautiful and well done, with some very nice scenes in space. I absolutely loved the beginning of it. Chris Pratt's character, Jim, having to decide whether or not to wake up Aurora was probably the best part of this entire film. His decision is made in a believable fashion and his reaction to waking her and struggle he faces after is amazing. Jennifer Lawrence's acting is superb here, it really shows when she finds out the truth. The acting overall by both leads was great in the film.<br/><br/>SPOILERS Definitely BELOW.<br/><br/>Now, besides those plot points, its a chick flick. The entire middle section is Jim doing everything he did alone the year prior, except with Aurora. The meaning is good, and is pretty much spelled out for you. I didn't love the way this part played out, but it was decent enough. This is where the problems really begin. The meaning is basically told outright to the viewer by the android bar tender, and repeated again in case you missed it. Once one of the crew members wakes up the bs is kicked into high gear and piles on. First off, the entire plot past Laurence Fishburne waking up, relies completely on a crew member being the person to wake up. One thing I liked a lot about the beginning was that Aurora waking up wasn't by chance, this, however, was complete luck. There are 5,000 passengers and its the guy who could open every door and override every computer that wakes up. ARE YOU KIDDING? but lets ignore that, once he's gone, how does Jim know what to do? I get he's a mechanic, which is also pretty convenient, but there is no way he should know how to do half of this stuff, I feel like this would require some kind of very specific knowledge of large spacecrafts. But let's get beyond that too. This entire end bit is ridiculous and unbelievable. Once he survived the exhaust of the nuclear core thing, and who knows how much radiation, it became clear the filmmakers stopped caring about believability, and him surviving to the end became plainly obvious so there was no reason to care about him being left in space, or her tether not reaching to the end, we knew she would get him back, nothing was at stake. This frustrates me beyond belief because there is no reason to make this part so unbelievable. Absolutely no reason at all. If the point of the film was for these two just to spend their lives together at the end, why not go about the climax in any other way? They could have at least tried a little to make this semi-believable.<br/><br/>One last thing that bothered me was the part where the ship was passing by a star and the crew was told they should observe. WHY would that be programmed if the crew weren't supposed to be up by then? I thought this was some kind of clever hint that Jim and Gus woke up for a reason, that maybe what they know could help if the ship faces a problem and it was programmed to wake them if something went wrong. BUT NO. it was all by chance and the star was just a cheap visual. <br/><br/>Again the love story itself isn't bad, the two leads are believable, them coming together so easily at the end isn't, them spending the rest of their lives alone together happily is pretty ridiculous too, but whatever.<br/><br/>To sum it up, Great beginning, OK middle, terrible, terrible end. The end is just all around bad and the fact that the film maker needs to spoon feed the audience the messages throughout the film is bearable at some points, really annoying at others.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is a solid ehh, some really good positives, but not enough."

But Gus is terminal since the malfunctioning of his pod caused more than 600 problems in his boy. What will happen to the Avatar? <br/><br/>""Passengers"" is an attractive romance with the storyline of Robinson Crusoe in a spaceship. The special effects are top-notch and the sets are magnificent. The lead couple is charming, but Michael Sheen steals the show in the role of a bartender android. Andy Garcia only gives name to the credits with a cameo of a few seconds. The story with a commercial happy ending is absolutely predictable and it is hard to see Jim exposed to a nuclear reactor fire without any consequence. But the plot is entertaining and better and better than the overrated and boring ""Arrival"". My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Passageiros"" (""Passengers"")"

This isn't a basic space movie where they go off to another planet and live a new life or even come in contact with aliens. Nope, it has an original plot that makes you question your own moral compass. The beginning of the movie was pretty slow but it started to climax at a very nice pace.

"ykarman","10","12","23","24 December 2016"," Great movie, the hate is misplaced.
","(WARNING: HEAVY SPOILERS and possible bad punctuation) <br/><br/>I really enjoyed the movie and i think the hate is misplaced, the bad things is see mentioned in reviews:<br/><br/>1. Actors not portraying inner turmoil accurately<br/><br/>2. Not actually dealing with the whole moral decision. <br/><br/>3. Jennifer Lawrence just being there for eye candy <br/><br/>4. Water scene in which Jennifer Lawrence almost drowns being useless. <br/><br/>5. Chris Pratt's character being an engineer but him not engineering a whole lot.<br/><br/>I will be addressing these things in the same order with why i don't agree with them.<br/><br/>1&2. I feel like they actually portrayed it very well, Though the timeline not actually being very clear to the viewer as Chris Pratt is contemplating of waking Jennifer Lawrence up we later learn that at the point he actually woke her up he had been awake for a year and 3 weeks, which means he likely contemplated waking her up for multiple months before succumbing to the loneliness, though portrayed fast (movie still took long enough more wouldve been a drag for the average movie goer) it still dealt with the guilt he had and how bad he didn't want to do it in a very good way.<br/><br/>3. Jennifer Lawrence actually had a pretty big part in this movie even though people disagree, She showed a lot of the emotions pratt showed in the earlier parts of the movie when she woke up, which is the obvious cycle of emotions for humans to go trough in such a situation, she then makes the decision, after realizing the man she's stuck with is a complete stranger to her, to get to know him better. A combination of things leads to them falling in love. After this Jennifer Lawrence is a keystone in the reasons of why things happen and acted brilliantly trough out the movie and especially after finding out what actually woke her up.<br/><br/>4. The water scene in which Jennifer Lawrence almost drowned was a big part in the development of the movie, as it showed that the situation could no longer be stalled, the situation had hit a point in which it became life threatening, action was needed. A good point that transitioned the movie into the action.<br/><br/>5. Just cmon, really? Literally the reason ended well, and the reason why it ended how it did, how it developed like it did and how a lot of things were changed for him trough his years there was purely because an Engineer, i really don't think he stopped building things at any part of the movie."

"yangjjj30","10","8","14","7 January 2017"," My first ever review. I felt the negative critics have really done this film injustice
","One of the best sci fi movies I've seen. Thoroughly enjoyed it. Really don't get whats the problem with the critics and their negative reviews. Sure the movie is cliché and have happy ending, but the emotions and acting were real, not to mention about space and cool special effects, cool ship. I would watch the movie again gladly. Spoilers below<br/><br/>As Gus says in the movie, 'the drowning man will always try to drag you down with him'. Can we fault him for what he did? If it were you would you have jumped out of the air lock instead? Not justifying what he did was OK, but he regretted it and would have taken it back if he could. Plus he is willing to sacrifice his life to save others. About jennifer lawrence forgiving him in the end, dude, you'd have died anyway, this guy did a selfish thing, he's sorry, and he saved you and everyone else in the end by sacrificing his life. What is there not to forgive him about?"

","I went to see the movie with a rather low expectation, thinking that this might as well be another over-hyped Hollywood blockbuster movie. Turns out, The Passengers was nothing as I hoped, thankfully, and I had an delightful time watching it.<br/><br/>The movie took place in a sci-fi, futuristic settings. But it is drama- orientated and focused more on the chemistry between the two protagonists, Jim and Aurora. This direction of story-telling has enabled Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt to have an adequate room to demonstrate exceptionally their emotional roller-coasters. The pacing of the movie is well-orchestrated, slow but not staggering; the cinematography is immersive and compelling. Though some plot points are put in a seemingly too comfortable way for the sake of untying the knot of the scripts and the movie is overall somewhat formulaic, you will enjoy the movie given that you see it with a mindset of a person who just want to be entertained.<br/><br/>Is this the best movie of this year so far? Probably not. But it is a great one to start a year of promising movies to come."
"martaalonso-95246","9","11","21","30 December 2016"," Discard professional critics: Highly enjoyable movie, perfect for a family/friends plan
","First of all, please apologize my poor English. It's not my native language and I won't be able to explain in detail and with a rich vocabulary my feelings after watching this movie. I will try my best:<br/><br/>I must say I was pleasantly surprised by this film. I had read several ""professional"" negative reviews and was a bit reluctant to see it but I decided to follow my instincts and give it a try. So glad I did. <br/><br/>To anyone reading this, please trust me, this is probably the best experience you'll have if you go to the theater this winter. Great cinematography, fantastic GGI effects (digital effects are just the right amount,and really well put), original design, beautiful ost, engaging story (you're never bored) and great acting.<br/><br/>I have to particularly praise Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen's work. She's absolutely magnetic, fantastic performance. I've been following her work since she was only an adolescent on The Burning Plain and she's grown in her indubitable natural talent. She can portray any type of character (sexy, strong, weak, hurt, anguished, happy, enraged)and be an outstanding role in any type of film genre: action, drama, comedy, everything. She'll probably be a classic, having the perfect combination of looks and acting skills. Michael Sheen doesn't have much screen time but he does a great work at portraying the android Arthur, he's a really good actor, always serious and committed. British academy actors are rarely a disappointment. Chris Pratt delivers and he's a very likable and attractive man, but lacks of expression and tension in his face/eyes. His dramatic moments in the film are a little bit underwhelming.<br/><br/>Wrap-up: GO SEE THIS IN BIG SCREEN. DEFINITELY WORTH IT."

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie I was excited. It was an interesting love story with some action (probably towards the end). In no way did I think it was sci-fy just because it takes place in outer space.<br/><br/>The idea was great, people traveling 120 years to get to a new planet and start a new life. Two passengers waking up 90 years early and trying to fix it and then realizing there's really nothing that can be done. There was a great twist in the beginning which was not expected by the trailer and the chemistry between Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was phenomenal. I am a huge fan of Jennifer and she player this role perfectly.<br/><br/>The people who are hating on this film were expecting a different movie. Less love and more sci-fy, but when more than half of the trailer is their blossoming love story rather than the action packed ending its pretty clear what the movie will be about. It is the perfect futuristic love story that makes you sad, happy, scared and on the edge of your seat for parts. <br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to anyone as long as they realize this is NOT a sci-fy movie but a romantic comedy with some action at the end. I saw this two days ago and already want to see it again."
"uber_geek","5","19","41","15 January 2017"," Boring and Contrived
","The more I think about this movie, the more irritated I get that it wasn't better. Passengers is neither a good sci-fi nor a good romance. There are also way too many plot holes. It's Castaway meets Titanic.<br/><br/>Jim is an engineer who has a budget class ticket to the Homestead Colony planet that will take 120 years to reach. The ship holds 5,000 total passengers, plus a crew, all in suspended animation. After a meteor shower takes some of the systems down, his pod wakes him up prematurely--90 years prematurely.<br/><br/>As a castaway on the ship with only a robot bartender to talk to, he spends the first year trying to fix his pod and then trying to get to the crew, who are unfortunately behind a fortress he can't breach. And he's drinking...a lot of drinking to the point he almost walks outside the ship without a suit to end it all. Then he sees Aurora in her pod and falls for her. He reads her profile and fights his desire to wake her up, knowing it's an eventual death sentence since they're decades away from their destination. Of course, he succumbs, but tells himself and the bartender that he'll tell her that he's the reason she awoke prematurely...eventually.<br/><br/>After the shock of waking up 89 years early, wears off somewhat, Aurora hits it off with Jim. She's a writer who planned to travel to round trip to Homestead and then back to earth, even though she would arrive home some 250 years later. Just as everything seems to be going great, she finds out what Jim did out of loneliness and wants nothing to do with him (understandably).<br/><br/>And that's one problem: Jim was so selfish, he was willing to destroy someone else's life just for his need to have a human companion. <br/><br/>Another problem is why anyone would want a trip that would take 120 years and your family and friends back on earth will be long gone. Aurora's father has died, but you see a video of a going away party her friends gave her, sad in the knowledge they'd never see her again. You don't get much backstory on Jim, except that he wants to be needed for his skill set instead of living in the throwaway society of Earth. <br/><br/>Unlike the audience, Jim seems to be too preoccupied with winning back Aurora to notice that the ship's systems are starting to fail. Suddenly Gus (Laurence Fishburne) appears, who's the ship's engineer and also a victim of a pod malfunction. Almost immediately, however, he is in medical distress because of his early awakening and his sole purpose seems to be to give Jim and Aurora a bracelet that will allow them access to the ship's restricted areas so Jim can fix the problem before the ship explodes. <br/><br/>The first part of the movie is extremely monotonous and it doesn't take much to make Jim start to go off the deep end. You've got to wonder why the robot bartender is activated when it's supposed to be 90 more years before the first people wake up. The rest of the movie stretches both physics and imagination as Jim and Aurora try to fix the ship before it blows up."

Then I imagine myself in the situation of Chris Pratt after a time. It would be truly dreadful. It makes sense that ""a drowning man will drag others down with them"" - this key point seems to have been missed by some reviewers, and is fundamental to the plot. The relationship that forms between the two main characters is realistic and touching. The ending was perfect. Their situation made me question the choices that they made and the possible alternatives, and to discuss them with family, but all alternatives are inferior to the choices both of these two made.

People thinking along these lines probably find most tomato sauce labels politically incorrect.<br/><br/>The plot is plausible and interesting, the acting excellent, the cinematography beautiful, and the film is quite well-paced. It might not be Oscar worthy, but the last time I checked, most films out there aren't.<br/><br/>So he woke her up. Yes, it was immoral and selfish, but the film does not depict Jim as jumping into this decision. The fact that it took him weeks to decide, that he was alone for over a year and had almost committed suicide by no means justify his action but do show him struggle with the weight of the decision. Just like it weighs on him throughout the film. All that makes him human -- selfish and flawed, but far from evil.<br/><br/>And Aurora is NO pushover. Once she finds out, she doesn't meekly accept her fate as a man's playmate or bed-mate or whatever, but literally kicks the living daylights out of him.<br/><br/>If the film merely jumped to ""she finds out and accepts"" and stopped there, I could understand people panning it. But it doesn't. It ultimately shows us that she CHOSE to be with him -- which is critical -- and also shows us why. She'd never let anyone in before, had actually fallen in love with him before finding out the truth, and subsequently saw enough bravery and love -- including him wanting to let her go -- to realize life was better with him on the ship, than without him. Point in case: by joining the voyage she chose to leave everyone she ever knew behind forever, showing us she didn't have any deep connections prior to him.<br/><br/>As for those complaining about the ""token black character"" -- come on, people. The film only has two big roles. If one of those had been a black person, then the whole movie would have been interpreted as an allegory for racial dynamics. If the only other prominent character had been black -- the bartender -- the film would have been accused of reducing black people to servants again. How about the fact that this important crew position was filled by a black man, and he was key to saving the two white people's behinds? Why marginalize him, as a viewer?<br/><br/>Lastly, I'm sad that poor Jennifer Lawrence was pushed into thinking there was anything wrong with the film, let alone that it would have been better if her character had woken up first. I mean, come on -- it would have been EXACTLY the same, morally speaking. That's the whole point -- what he did had no excuse, but it brought them together in a flawed way like life tends to, and they overcame that bad beginning both individually and together.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, it's a dynamic, suspenseful love story set in space, so if the sound of that appeals to you, by all means watch away for you're sure to enjoy it."

The travelers were eager enough for a new beginning that they abandoned all worldly friendships and associations, and submitted themselves to suspended animation, enforced hibernation, for the 120-year voyage to the distant Homestead II planet.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some thirty years into the voyage the spaceship runs through an uncharted asteroid field, which causes a system failure. One of the passengers, a mechanical engineer named Jim Preston, is accidentally revived from his hibernation. And after a day or two of exploring the cavernous space vessel, he realizes he's not only alone, but also likely to remain alone from the remainder of his life—his shipmates, including the flight crew, all will be remain in suspended animation for ninety more years.<br/><br/>Preston is played by actor Chris Pratt. Pratt is a wonderfully engaging performer who's been attracting a lot of notice recently, not only from his starring appearances in such Hollywood blockbusters as Jurassic World and Guardians of the Galaxy, but also in smaller supporting roles in pictures like Kathryn Bigelow's 2012 film Zero Dark Thirty—he played a member of US Navy Seal team on the mission to kill Osama bin Laden—and Antoine Fuqua's remake of The Magnificent Seven earlier this year.<br/><br/>Pratt's screen persona is similar to that of the late James Garner—a reluctant hero with a stubborn streak of integrity dire circumstances can't quite overcome, often conscripted by circumstances to step up and make a stand against forces which threaten others. But unlike Garner, Pratt projects an aura of sweetly childlike naiveté which seems to make audiences want to reach out and protect him.<br/><br/>But as Vincent Price, Charlton Heston, and Will Smith learned in the various screen versions of Richard Matheson's I Am Legend, it's difficult for an actor to appear alone on screen for an extended period and still maintain the interest and emotional investment of the audience. And despite some support from the versatile Michael Sheen as an amiable android bartender who serves as a sort of Greek chorus, a solo performance is what Pratt needs to deliver for the first quarter of Passengers' 116-minute running time. Then his character makes a choice which risks losing the audience's goodwill entirely:<br/><br/>After a year of isolation and despite the entertainment amenities and activities of the spacecraft—lounges, gymnasiums, nightclubs, movies, spacewalking, and the most awesome Wii system you're even seen—Pratt's Jim Preston is literally dying of loneliness. He's actually considering ending it all when he becomes emotionally obsessed with one of the 4999 fellow travelers still in artificial hibernation, a journalist played by the wonderfully charismatic Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>And the moment Jennifer Lawrence's unthawed feet hit the deck, the movie starts to zing. On full display in Passengers is Lawrence's plain-spoken, self-deprecating let's get this party rolling persona, which has endeared the actress to movie and television talk show audiences over the past handful of years.<br/><br/>Lawrence's performance seems also to ignite something in Pratt—their scenes together are as charming as those between the title characters in Disney's Lady and the Tramp, and for much the same reason. As a means of making sure we're paying attention, the filmmakers have named Lawrence's character Aurora, an obvious nod to Disney's Sleeping Beauty, Princess Aurora.<br/><br/>But also accompanying Lawrence's arrival on screen is the central on screen conflict: In waking Aurora prematurely from suspended animation, Jim has selfishly robbed her of her plans and ambitions for a life on Homestead II and beyond, for no better reason than to provide company for the lonely mechanic. What's going to happen when she finds out?<br/><br/>The filmmakers are not too adept at explaining the science behind the fiction, but are fairly good at covering their tracks: Every time the audience thinks they've spotted an anomaly in the plot, a new wrinkle is introduced that might or might not smooth it over. That's almost excusable in Passengers, because it keeps us on our toes enough to allow other nagging distractions to slip by, such as why Pratt's character left the signature scruff on his face after he shaved off the rest of the fake-looking movie beard he grew during his year of isolation.<br/><br/>The one distraction too large to ignore is that Jon Spaihts' script can't decide whether Passengers is a romance, a character study, or a science fiction thriller: It's too much of each and not enough of any. And despite some eye-popping special effects—there's a honey of a scene in which the ship's artificial gravity fails while Lawrence is taking a dip in the swimming pool—there's too much plot going on to pause and savor them.<br/><br/>Norwegian director Morten Tyldum, who also guided 2014's The Imitation Game, keeps Passengers plodding forward evenly enough to resolve the various plots, although at times the movie seems as tedious as the 120 years required to travel from Earth to Homestead II. And Thomas Newman's techno-pop music score is pleasant enough, with a few old standards thrown in to augment certain scenes, but seems to have been composed for a more lighthearted picture. Whatever it is, Passengers is not a comedy.<br/><br/>In the end, it's Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who carry Passengers and sell it to the audience. The undiluted rapport they generate with the audience inspires us to forgive most of the picture's problems and deficiencies. It's an agreeable expenditure of holiday time. Unfortunately, instead of a love story, a persuasive science fiction saga, or a rumination on the effects of isolation, Passengers instead becomes an explanation of why movie stars are paid such enormous salaries."
"lmoenat","8","9","17","27 December 2016"," Tremendous special effects in a simple history
","I must say that the special effects and photography of this movie held my attention tremendously. I'm not a huge fan of science fiction, but clearly, the film transports you in a spectacular way to many of the tools that in the future humanity will have access too. The story itself is held on the space ship, more than the principal characters. I must say that I expected some turn or twist at the end of the story that could explain some of the questions that came to my mind (for example more details about the purpose of the space mission), however, the end of the movie had a simplistic touch. It is worth seeing especially for its photography and special effects, but not for the history of the movie."
"paul-3991","9","9","17","27 December 2016"," Worth seeing!
","My wife & I hesitated going to see this movie, as the few reviews we read were not that positive. But we decided to go anyway, and we are glad we did. The movie was very good & well worth seeing. It isn't just a simple, comic book plot nor some ridiculous space alien story. It does have good special effects that support the plot instead of overwhelming it. The story line was well written and characters well developed, people you end up caring about instead of just ""bodies"" like many movies have had lately. It does touch on situations a lot of people (especially young people) might have difficulty identifying with. As others have mentioned, I don't understand why some of the reviewers couldn't seem to understand the plot, instead getting side-tracked on some of the things that happened and reading into what they think it meant in the story-line. <br/><br/>If you are mature enough to understand a decently written plot, you should enjoy this movie and appreciate the situations it presents.<br/><br/>I encourage you to go see this movie. The scenes in space are worth seeing at the theater on a larger screen. And the movie itself is worth seeing to begin with. Ignore the negative reviewers. They are wrong in my opinion. See for yourself. <br/><br/>Or just wait for the next version of some remake of the next comic book superhero, with its overwhelming CGI effects and typical fighting & violence, which is apparently what most people think is required to work things out with others, solve the worlds problems and vanquish the various forms of evil. <br/><br/>(While I can enjoy these types of movies too, it is nice to see a movie & story that present something new & somewhat different. At least I didn't feel like I watched yet another episode of the same thing yet again!"

"petra_ste","5","5","8","24 May 2019"," These are not robot questions
","The premise of this sci-fi romance/drama had potential. During an interstellar voyage, passenger Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up from hibernation 90 years before the arrival due to a system error. He is the only person awake on the whole gigantic spaceship apart from a robot bartender (Michael Sheen), while all other thousands human passengers are still asleep in hibernation. After useless attempts to repair his pod, Jim briefly enjoys the luxurious life aboard before loneliness nearly drives him suicidal.<br/><br/>At this point he decides to awake an attractive female passenger, Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), to have some company in his hopeless situation...<br/><br/>I've heard people complain that the premise is creepy, but that's the whole point. If you take away Jim's moral dilemma and selfish choice, and have both passengers awake due to random circustances, you get the most boring movie imaginable (and it's not as if Passengers right now is incredibly lively and exciting).<br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS Sadly, Passengers chickens out in a last act where the two leads cooperate to save the ship, the morally dubious Jim becomes flat-out heroic, Aurora forgives him and the two live together their remaining years in a bittersweet conclusion which is far too sweet and not nearly bitter enough.
The premise was screaming for something darker, like Aurora going to sleep on the repaired pod and Jim resigning himself to loneliness; even better, Jim
dies and a half-crazed Aurora, now alone on the ship for months in the same situation as Jim was, starts eyeing the pod with a handsome male passenger, implying the cycle of selfishness and deception may soon start again. END SPOILERS<br/><br/>Production values are solid; the leads are fine and so are Sheen and Laurence Fishburne in the only relevant supporting roles. Pity about that last act.<br/><br/>5,5/10"
"laylastepford","9","5","8","3 October 2017"," Exceptional commentary piece paired with compelling performances!
","Acting: 20/20 Writing: 36/40 Directing/Editing/Production/Etc: 37/40<br/><br/>Overall: 93/100 A<br/><br/>Review: As with many space movies, there are quite a few unrealistic plot holes in the script but aside from those few, the movie is pretty accurate.<br/><br/>All of the cast in this film delivered compelling performances, playing their roles perfectly.<br/><br/>This film is not your typical pop film (nor a typical sci-fi film as it's more of a romantic-drama-sci-fi), every little nuance shows a deeper meaning and weaves together a great analogy of our roles in nature.<br/><br/>*Spoiler Alert! *<br/><br/>Michael Sheen does an exceptional job as the bartender, especially the part where he ""spazzes out"" when presented with contradictory ""facts"" as he knows them to be. The writing and concept behind this character, as an android bartender, is very well done. (""Jim, these are not robot questions."")<br/><br/>There are a couple of cool allusions in this film, such as The Time Machine, The Shining, Facebook and Sleeping Beauty.<br/><br/>This movie shows the value of human companionship as well as romance - even for a man.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot of interesting choices and points regarding gender: When Aurora first gets a meal and sees what Jim has been stuck eating this whole time, this is an allusion to the way a bachelor eats before a woman comes into his life and starts to cook for him (traditionally), leading to better and healthier meals for him. Jim as a mechanic, represents men and the old world, and the desire to feel ""necessary"". With technology replacing workers and pushes for women replacing men in the workplace (to fulfill 50/50 gender quotas) - as well as the fact that men can't give birth - men in Western society are struggling to find their value/role in the world. Our modern Western society is very sexist against men and constantly putting them down as ""old-timey"", unnecessary and overall ""not good enough"". Our society treats men very unjustly, constantly putting women's feelings and preferences first, while condemning men simply for being men (aka toxic masculinity). Men are people too and just like women, they like to feel valued in society. Love was enough for Jim to be content but not for Aurora, as she was still having a lot of anxiety about their situation after they became romantically involved. Just like humanity works best when men and women are cooperating instead of competing, the two passengers were able to save the ship and everyone on it (aside from the already deceased Chief) when they were cooperating and working together as a team.<br/><br/>Aurora had everything she could've asked for, yet it wasn't good enough just because Jim woke her up instead of her accidentally waking up. She had romance and a reliable, loving, trustworthy mate and she still had her career as a writer for audiences of the future to read her once-in-a-lifetime story, even though it wasn't the exact one that she had originally planned for. She took what she had for granted, more focused on what could/should be, rather than what was. She couldn't see the forest for the trees.<br/><br/>After all of the crap that Aurora gave Jim for waking her up early, she had the chance to ""erase this mistake"" yet she chose not to. In the end, she chose the life that Jim had chosen for her as well. So she gave him hell for nothing. This is very representative of how if many modern women today would focus on everything they do have instead of what they don't have, they would realize that they have a lot to be grateful and happy for. Western women are the most spoiled women on Earth yet they often fail to see that. <br/><br/>And one of the most important overall metaphors from this film revolved around nature:<br/><br/>Nature will not be controlled forever.<br/><br/>There was a point made several times in this film about the ""fact that the pods can't possibly defect"", yet we know that's not a fact as somehow, someway, Jim's pod did defect - even though it was the 1st time ""ever"". This was very important because it was very symbolic of our modern society and the everyday things we take for granted - especially modern women who would choose ""modern society"" over ""nature's society"" almost every single time (since they benefit from this modern society even more than men do).<br/><br/>To this point as well, nature always finds a way to create life; It's why human beings are here. No matter how many extinction periods have occurred here on Earth and wiped out entire species at a time, nature always finds a way to give new life a chance. This was represented by the planting of nature that Jim did all around the information room (especially at the end) but also by both of Jim and Aurora's urge to not be alone, as many human beings feel this way - not in just a romantic sense but in an overall sense (which is why we, humans, often try to create some kind of society).<br/><br/>*End of Spoiler Alert!*<br/><br/>Overall this film was an exceptional commentary piece paired with compelling performances; Absolutely worth watching!"

","The Homestead company makes money colonizing planets. On board the fusion powered, ion drive ship, Avalon are 5,000 passengers and 288 crew, all in hibernation. When an asteroid hits the ship in the first scene, it damages the ship, but it fails to self repair itself. Mechanic/Engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and uptown girl write Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) are awaken 90 years too early and eventually discover (plot spoiler?) the ship is destined for life support failure unless it can be repaired.<br/><br/>While the film is billed as a love story, I found it equally compelling as science fiction. I think they could have written better dialogue for Jim, or maybe had someone else in that role less good looking in order to make their differences more acute...like Woody Harrelson. But, they wanted the film to appeal to women to so they cleverly added a love story in order to get women to watch boring science fiction...or did they add science fiction to a love story in order to get guys to watch it? Either way, the film was enjoyable, although may have been about a dozen minutes too long. I liked the special effects, especially the zero gravity swimming pool scene. Really cool.<br/><br/>Some geek stuff: In the film they approach the red giant star Arcturus (didn't look too red). It is 36.7 light years away, about the time they have been traveling in 30-40 tears. However, according to their dialogue, they are traveling at half the speed of light which means it would take them 73 years to get there. Just saying.<br/><br/>Guide: No swearing or nudity.

"lee_eisenberg","8","5","8","10 July 2017"," Jen and Chris pay homage to Kubrick
","I admit that Morten Tyldum's ""Passengers"" isn't any sort of masterpiece, but it's nonetheless an impressive piece of work. Aside from the main plot, I liked the tributes to Stanley Kubrick's movies (setting in outer space, talking computers, the bar scenes, trying to chop through a door; just add a Beethoven soundtrack and you'd have a clean sweep).<br/><br/>Like a number of movies, the movie warns us about over-reliance on technology, with lots of suspense to keep things going. Even so, I feel like the voyage that the spaceship makes would be a cool one (even if everyone's asleep for most of it). I wonder if we'll ever have commercial space travel.<br/><br/>Anyway, it's an enjoyable movie."
"roygolan","8","5","8","17 May 2017"," Good movie with a lot of atmosphere
","Positive + Great performances from all actors. Chris Pratt in particular gives a very good and relatable performance. + Movie succeeds in conveying the feeling of being alone in space and allows the viewer imagine what he or she would do in that situation. + Movie succeeds in showing the struggle the main character is going through when being alone and when facing with his main ethical dilemma about the other passenger. + The movie successfully raising philosophical questions about the meaning of life, life expectancy, life goals and loneliness. + Very nice visuals and good depiction of what a futuristic spaceship interior might actually look like in real life.<br/><br/>Negative - Plot is somewhat plain, but it serves the story of the movie and the points it wanted to make. - Not many action sequences, but perhaps that wasn't one of the main goals of the movie. - Andy Garcia's cameo was weird and unnecessary, especially because it happened near the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Good movie with a lot of atmosphere that also manages to raise some interesting philosophical and ethical questions.<br/><br/>4 Stars"

","At first I was hesitant to watch this movie because of all the bad reviews I have read about it. As a picky/critical moviegoer myself, I didn't want to waste my time on bad shows or movies.<br/><br/>I wanted to see for myself and confirm the bad reviews. So, even if I am not a Jennifer/Chris fan, I went out and saw the movie. To my surprise, I loved it!<br/><br/>If you are into good story telling on self conflict, empathy, human nature, and some romance, then you would like or even love this movie.<br/><br/>The only reason I could think of why it got so much bad reviews are probably: (1) when people think about ""Sci-Fi"" they expect to see high octane action, scientifically plausible concepts/ideas, etc.; -- It's called Science ""Fiction"" for a reason. A lot of ideas, physics, technologies in the movie are too convenient / ridiculous but are all forgivable in my opinion.<br/><br/>(2) people expect the main characters of always doing the right thing (all the time). * SPOILER HERE * -- I expected Jim (Chris) to do the right thing when he was contemplating on waking up Aurora (Jen), and she'll eventually wake up on her own with a malfunction of some sort. So I was very disappointed when he did. But I realized as the movie progressed, that waking her made the story and eventually saved not just Aurora, but the rest of the crew and passengers.<br/><br/>(3) they felt that the story did not fit the setting. -- They could have set this in a cruise ship in the sea, a bus on the road, or a group castaways stranded on an island, etc. For me, it does not matter what the setting is, as long as the gist of the story is told effectively.<br/><br/>(4) they felt empty because at the ending they were already gone. * SPOILER HERE * -- This is how I felt somehow, I wanted them to be alive and live happily every after (as most stories do). But, realized that they did lived out their lives together and (probably) happy.<br/><br/><ul><li>- - - - I do have one criticism on the ending but it's more of a wishful thinking: * SPOILER HERE * Why didn't they bother waking up the crew and ask for help to go back to sleep? They do have Lawrence's access band. Possibly: They wanted to just live out their lives together on the ship and their search for adventure or new life has ended (?)</li></ul>"
"freeofavia","9","5","8","5 April 2017"," A Misunderstood Personal Film
","The trailers for Passengers sold it as a disaster movie in space. Many people may have been disappointed to find out that was not the case. Not exactly. This was a thoughtful and emotional story about decisions made in absolute desperation that people have to live with for the rest of their lives. <br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way first. This is a cool sci-fi movie. It has cool robots, a cool spaceship, it has an infinity edge swimming pool where you can backstroke yourself out into space. This movie knows how to apply potential technology with a little more inspiration than is typical of sci-fi films today. It invokes a sort of casual use and nonchalant attitude towards fabulous inventions that would astound us today, but are taken for granted in the minds of the characters. Production design is great on this one too. Fantastic wardrobe and costumes, the sets look real, and so so good. <br/><br/>Practical effects are used when possible, special effects are used correctly, and look subtle enough to be real, but fantastic enough to have that ""magic"" appeal. Ultimately, this movie made me feel like I was on the spaceship with the passengers, due in large part to a well thought out and carefully planned aesthetic.<br/><br/>There were a lot of mechanical, electronic, and destructive sounds in this movie, none of which sounded out of place. They were believable and made me feel more part of the world. Thomas Newman's score did not leave anything to be desired. I thought it was impressive how he managed a score for a movie with such varied tones, and was able to seamlessly and suddenly transition between them.<br/><br/>The story for this movie was not complicated. Not overly so. However, the premise is a solid one, and also one that has not been explored on this scale before. Actually this movie deals in two scales; the very large scale of a massive interstellar luxury passenger ship, and the very small scale of a relationship between two people. And before that, just one man, slowly slipping into depression by himself, stranded like a man on a desert island. Albeit with robot servants and video games. The story may not be complex, but it is not dull, or ""flawed"" by any stretch of the imagination. The dialogue is well thought out, and feels authentic. Especially due to the stellar cast. No pun intended.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence breathes life to a character with passion, a woman willing to sacrifice everything for her work, a remarkable human being aiming to be a part of history. So this was nothing new for her. Nevertheless I am always captivated by her on screen, and feel like i'm seeing her for the first time, again. She always commits to her character and brings depth and personality to the screen.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt has always been a favorite of mine, so maybe I am biased, but this film proves he is up there with the greats. That man can act. He has always done comedy from what I have seen (I still need to watch Zero Dark Thirty), but now I know he can deliver a nuanced performance of such human anguish that it tears your heart out before you're halfway through the film. He definitely should have got his first Oscar nomination for Passengers.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this movie was a touching story about two people, with a tragic twist, in space. If that sounds like something you would like to see, you will like this movie, because it does it very well. <br/><br/>If you want Star Trek with J-Law, look elsewhere."

It does not use graphics for the sake of graphics, its so original and part of the setting that it truly takes you in. The level of detail inside the space ship surprised me again and again.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this movie is a love story, something simple, and I think its simple cheezy people like me who will like it.

","If you ask the question ""What is Sci-Fi ?"", you'll get several answers depending on the age and personalities of the people you ask.

It went through the drugged '70s, the business '80s, the internet connected '90s and the opinionated 2K's to the current ""let's do it better than before"", with retries (called ""re-imaginings"", LOL) in film of everything Sci-Fi.<br/><br/>I was expecting the same formulaic ""let's tell an old story again"" attitude in this film but found something else completely. It is an assembly of the best parts of all the eras, not only in Sci-Fi but also in other genres; a seamless mash-up of drama, suspense, romance and , of course, Sci-Fi, created by a mastermind and executed by a talented team.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film as it proved to me that something new can be made from parts of something old - and it can be brilliant."

I can look past that though, and see great performances from the two leads, great visual effects, and great drama at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, if you are reading this while passengers is still in cinemas, please go watch it because it is a good movie despite what the critics say."

","This is the first 10 I have given a movie. I thought the story was unique and plausible. They did an awesome job on the special effects and also how things react in zero gravity.

The ending was different and will leave you thinking. This is a movie worth seeing on the ""big screen"" due to all the special effects. I would highly recommend this movie.

","There might be a spoiler or two in this review. This is more of a sci-fi of the OST / TNG genre, than a romance. The science is sparse but solid enough for Hollywood. The ship is traveling at 0.5c powered by nuclear fusion to an earth-like planet 250 or so light years away, spinning on a front to back axis as it goes, to create artificial gravity which gets wonky when using elevators in certain directions (understandable). It is largely autonomous with complex AI but tasteful and believable. I found myself pondering the ship, software and hardware, as much as the emotions and decisions of the characters from beginning to end. The human story is two-scale. One story is that of human migration, corporations, species propagation through the galaxy, etc. It is a story you have to read into yourself, and certain dialogues through the movie will nudge you in that direction. The other human story is that of our vulnerabilities, forgiveness, sacrifice, and unspoken existential questions that again you have to read into. For example, the scene at the end where he says out loud in two sentences the things he would have done for her if they had both met in saner circumstances on the new planet.. could be mistaken as a kitschy Titanic-esque monologue, but their eyes are almost willing these imaginary situations to life, even if in their minds for a brief moment, before he dies. They live an entire life in those few seconds, and the primal human need for relationships to give our very existence any meaning whatsoever, comes forth. These are dialogues and scenes that cannot be truly enjoyed or understood by the less wise, and I was surprised by the quality of story telling, including the apparently unforgivable fallibilities of humans, and a specific decision made by one of the characters. The human story on both scales was truly compelling, and the future believable. I mention OST/ TNG but this was original in its own right."

I found myself struggling with what the main protagonist had done, but ultimately feeling sympathy for him, in the sense that perhaps he had been unable to control his emotions. <br/><br/>Chris Pratt was great but if I had to choose, then Jennifer Lawrence stood out for me. Action, drama, love, forgiveness, what's not to like? Although it was over two hours long, I was so gripped that I could barely believe it when the film finished.

","The premise on which this movie is build on is rather interesting. But after watching the trailer I just thought that this would be like any other action Blockbuster. Yes you have your action sequence at the end and yes some parts of the story are very predictable. BUT! Not all of them. I was totally taken aback by one major plot twist. I won't say anything more because I want to keep this review spoiler free. But this movie has got so much more depth than you might expect from the Trailer. Sadly the movie casts this over board a little bit to quickly in exchange for a action climax with happy ending. Which fits perfectly in the story line and all but it just gets very predictable. Thats why there are two stars missing. I think its unnecessary to say that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do a real good job keeping you interested in everything that's going on between the two. Perfect Chemnistry. <br/><br/>My Fazit: Go watch it. Not a masterpiece but sometimes all you need is good entertainment and that's what you get."
"Quinoa1984","5","19","43","22 December 2016"," so much talent, and an ideal premise, poorly and even dangerously executed
","It was a tough call for me to even go see this; I knew what the ""twist"" was, which isn't even so much of a twist if you pay enough attention to the trailer (the ""there's a reason we woke up early"" line is and isn't a trick from Chris Pratt's character Jim), and I saw the early reviews, which were and still are not promising. I could have gone on with the rest of my Christmas vacation having not seen Passengers except for the simple fact that I'm currently somewhat a sucker for a movie, any movie, that is made with this ambition and scale (let alone a release at this time, albeit with major stars leading the way) and is an original script.<br/><br/>Oddly enough I could say that about a number of films out this Christmas season - Sing and Why Him? are also ""original"" properties - but this one, still a genre film as those are, looked like it had some real potential as science fiction or at least a desert island scenario with some existential ramifications: what happens if you're out of your cryogenic slumber for more than a lifetime before you're supposed to wake up? And what happens when loneliness settles in and the temptation to have a, uh, 'companion' along the way becomes too great? It struck me as mildly ironic that Jennifer Lawrence fought for and succeeded in getting paid more than her male co-star for a movie that is at least a little, if not more, sexist. <br/><br/>I should try to separate myself from seeing it that way, but I can't help it as what writer Jon Spaihts and the producers present here (don't forget the latter being the ones who also call the shots, Mortem Tyldum directs though who knows how much say he had here with such a massive studio film) is skewed in such a way so that it comes close to (no, maybe, just being) a story of a man committing a life-rape. It's about violating someone's free will, not to mention the sex that comes with it (I'd stop short of saying it's actual rape, but I won't stop any SJW's coming forward with that charge), and then what should be the ramifications of when Lawrence's Aurora discovers the deception on Jim's part - which, I might add, is a stupid character thing that happens (thanks robot Michael Sheen - probably the best character in the movie).<br/><br/>I pondered leaving the movie as to what might happen if the roles were reversed, what if it was about a woman waking up early on a ship with 90 years to go before reaching the destination only to get so lonely as to wake up a hunky guy who thinks that he woke up by accident. To get even more intense about it, what if it wasn't a *white* hunky male kind of likable guy like Chris Pratt (and it's a deceptive thing casting him, since, well, who doesn't like Chris Pratt after all?) What if, say, it was Laurence Fishburne instead, who is also in this movie and brings a great heap of pathos for about ten minutes of screen-time? Was this movie sort of, I don't know, calculated around how audiences would respond to such a monstrous thing as dooming someone to live the rest of their lives on a space-ship? Is that hashtag of white (male) privilege not applicable here? <br/><br/>Maybe I am thinking this over too much, and that I should enjoy this film outside of the context of who these people are and what they do. I think if the third act had done a strong enough job of giving Jim a comeuppance, or bringing in some other stakes into the situation (i.e. what if a bunch of people wake up on their own, no problems to the ship). Instead it becomes one of those scenarios that's familiar from other sci-fi movies where disaster is looming if X isn't fixed with Y doing this and so on. It speaks to Tyldum not being a bad director (he doesn't have a ton of real vision, but he is competent) that I was even, if only on a surface level, feeling some of the intensity as the climax approaches and is executed, sort of like a less risky version of, say, the ending of Event Horizon (which Fisburne's presence reminded me of and made me wish I was watching instead).<br/><br/>But near the end, like the last five minutes, it wastes more of the goodwill I was willing to extend it. I don't know or am not sure if the filmmakers took into context what this story and its consequences mean in line with the images being portrayed - again, forget if it's still a white guy, what if he looked like Seth Rogen or Kevin James, would we buy the redemption as much if it wasn't Star Lord - but beyond that, it ends up having similar problems to Spaihts own (co)scripted Prometheus: a film who's premise and set-up has so much that can spring from it, but how the details come out makes things frustrating, especially given the talent involved.<br/><br/>If the movie had committed more to being darker, embracing itself as a full-blown horror movie (again, not unlike Event Horizon did), or made it less intentional, like if Aurora actually woke up on her own, then it could be different. But it's not, and we're left with something that is slickly made and troubling as hell."

There is a lot of comment about the scientific errors in this movie and yes, there are quite a few things that could be commented on. None of the errors bother me, even the sudden stop of gravity. The gyroscopic effect of the rotating starship makes a sudden stop of gravity a bit unconvincing, but alas. The effects generated with the absence of gravity in the swimming pool are stunningly good.

","(Please note that this review might contain spoilers).<br/><br/>If you have enjoyed the historic sci-fi movie, 2001: A Space Odyssey, then you'll probably fall in love with Passengers (2016). <br/><br/>There is a lot of choices for all sorts of professionals working in movie making, the novelist chooses what details he uses to build the story, the director selects the ways he sees fit to lead the actors, ..etc.; and in this movie it seems to me that all professionals have made the excellent choices. <br/><br/>The story of Passengers (2016) is extremely balanced. For those who criticize some role that appeared and disappeared without reason, I want them to imagine how boring and complicated the story will be if extra characters were emotionally involved, or how strange it'll be for a major incident to affect only one person. The selection of how events went by, has made the story to bring heavy-weight ideas, about human emotional and reasonable behavior, how a crisis may affect reason and how reason changes a crisis. <br/><br/>The story is a nicely ordered hard-core sci-fi, means the science facts were fully respected during all parts (not like other over-rated ridiculous sci-fi movies such as Arrival). Visuals are extraordinarily beautiful, alongside a very precise and professional directing. <br/><br/>
The start of the movie is pretty powerful, as the end is. Passengers is a great movie, and deserves general rating of 9 at least. 10/10 without a moment pause."
"nycfeet","8","3","4","19 November 2017"," Entertaining Story and Superb Acting
","Not sure why this one got bashed so hard by critics. The premise could be considered creepy, that he woke her up, but the man was facing his entire life alone. It would be a very tough decision. Critics seemed to think this was a fuzzy happy ever after where she forgave him and the central issue was never really dealt with.<br/><br/>However, I felt for a movie, which is purely for entertainment purposes, it was dealt with sufficient to lead to a happy ending, and personally I like movies with happy endings and forgiveness. <br/><br/>The critics seemed to ignore two key elements of the story, first that the man was destined to live the rest of his life alone or make the decision to wake another passenger, something as a mechanic he had the skills to do. Was his decision ethical? No. Realistic? Yes. Put in his shoes what would you do? The second very important fact that critics seem to ignore was in the third scene when he had to exit the ship to fix a critical malfunction that if not fixed could cost them both and the entire ship their lives. As he exits the ship she says to him "" come back to me, I can't live here alone without you."" Effectively confirming that if he died, which was a real possibility, she would be in his shoes, the shoes he was in when he made the decision to wake her, and with that realization, at that moment she understood why he made the decision to wake her. Remember, she did not have the knowledge to wake another passenger as he did, but the basic human need for companionship she did understand. It was from this premise, having to face this reality, that she was able to forgive him and also make the decision to stay awake with him rather than be put back to sleep.<br/><br/>Critics seem to think her forgiveness and decision at the end was based on true love, a corny thing that does not exist, but I did not see it that way at all,I saw it as her realization of what he had been living, that really it could have been any of them that had been woken up accidentally to begin with, and that if he did not come back alive then she would be the one alone for the rest of her life, and she was desperate to not be alone, and from that understanding she found the compassion to forgive. I think love for him was an afterthought to this realization and perhaps the tipping point to her final decision rather than the reason for forgiveness.<br/><br/>Was it perfectly politically correct? No. Was it a great story about compassion and forgiveness? Yes, even more so than a love story to me, the deeper story was the basic human need for companionship, the love story being second to that. Was it entertaining? Yes. If you want to see the grim reality of how horrible life can be, watch the news. If you want to be entertained with a happy ending, watch this movie."

","As I write this in my Star Trek pajamas, I can honestly say I did not feel the need to nick-pick the heck out of the technical details of this movie and instead actually enjoyed it for what it is: true science fiction, and one that is written to appeal to everyone.<br/><br/>Sure I could sit here and talk about how they couldn't possibly reach Arcturus in 30 years without going FTL (faster than light), why the computer would heat the whole ship for one person, or why it carried spare parts with only a crew for 4 months to use them, but I won't.<br/><br/>I won't because science fiction is about wonder, it's about what might happen, and what sort of world our descendants might live in. Passengers does that. It comments on our future total trust in technology. The visuals are incredible. The ship is imaginative. The acting is superb, and the characters are truly believable - the ""superheroes"" here are as common a person as you or I.<br/><br/>And frankly, it's refreshing to watch some science fiction that does not center around robots, superheroes, robot superheroes, some form of time travel, or all of the above in one (ahem, X-Men: DOFP).<br/><br/>If like me you want Hollywood to make more movies like this, go out there and buy it. twice.

It is so obvious that many of the professional critics are not Sci-Fi fans, by the way they battered a very likable film. A bit like ""When World's Collide"" and ""Titanic in Space"". It's a little predictable and implausible as well. One passenger on a journey to a new world wakes up 89 years too soon, when his suspended animation pod ""blows a fuse"". Judging on all the skills he has knowledge of, he's not a mechanical engineer, he's ""Scotty"" or ""Spock"" from Star Trek! He wakes up another passenger on purpose as he appears to need good-looking female companionship and stimulation. The first half of the film is a bit slow, but the ""space walk"" and tour of the ship is fascinating. It's certainly a lot better-paced than the slow motion reveal in Star Trek I. In hour 2, everything falls apart including the space ship's power core. First their love affair freezes over when she discovers that he woke her up. One crew member wakes up, just long enough before dying to keep the spaceship ""afloat"". Then as the power core overheats, the power fails, they both turn into ""Astronauts"" and go outside the ship to unjam a stuck emergency vent and each other. He should have died, but she revives him using the super-dooper DIY medical machine. (Really!) Also, why isn't he burned (or radioactive) from the engine breach? Why it works for us space movie ""nuts"": Great CGI. When all gravity fails, the swimming pool rises up and turns into an (almost) death trap.

They in turn are aided by Michael Sheen who is perfectly cast as the Android (not Robot!) bartender Arthur.<br/><br/>The effects work is impressive and director Morten Tyldum stitches the set pieces together admirably, the highlight being a rather superb gravity loss sequence. While the sound mix is also to be applauded.<br/><br/>Newcomers should expect a Robinson Crusoe love story in space as opposed to a sci-fi actioner, though one with more cerebral strains than at first hinted, because then the pic delivers a good time and adds to what is turning out to be a rather great decade for sci-fi fans. 7/10"

","This is one of the best films I've ever seen. As a 26-year-old avid movie-watcher and literary-appreciator, the script is INCREDIBLE. What an idea for a movie, not to mention marvelous execution of what the fallout of waking up (and being woken up) from a 120-year journey ninety years early would actually have been like. What I'm saying is, this is one of the better movies ever made. The acting is superb, though even I'll admit the stretch with Martin Lawrence was a little... stupid. But who cares. What I see here, personally, is a film that literally could have been out-of-this-world extraordinary, but decided to take an ounce of humility instead, for the sake of not being ""too heavy"" or ""too boring"". Honestly, I saw this in theaters and just watched it again a second time and it was literally BETTER THE SECOND TIME. Seriously. So what is specifically so great about it, you ask? Well, let me break it down for you.<br/><br/>To start, this is not a ""Hollywood"" script written for ""Hollywood"" actors. The script is fantastic in its own right, and I'm not exaggerating here. What an excellent script. The fact that they got A- list actors like Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence on board is really no surprise when you see how good the dialogue and transpiring of events are. Now, the finale is a little rushed, yes, compared to the slow, flawless pacing of everything before that, but there really was nowhere else to go at that point. The writer obviously wanted to challenge himself a little bit. Regardless, it was a great ending, in my opinion. See, this is also kind of a love story, so just be ready for that is all I can say. Anyway, the film also kinda brought sci-fi back for me. Don't get me wrong, I've read some of the goofs, I know some tiny details in the film would not have happened the way they did strictly from a scientific standpoint, but there are no major plot holes because of scientific inaccuracy. Which is very refreshing. Especially when everything else is done so well, like in this film Passengers. A good sci-fi film is hard to come by, in any case. A lot of times the dialogue and plot of the film can end up being really dumb, which is the opposite of what we have here. I feel like Passengers would've been a really good book. I mean, the writer had it dead-on. Everything the actors said and everything that happened was so believable. I feel like it could've gone on for hours and I would still have been completely captivated. Maybe that's kind of the secret. He had to wrap it up somehow. And as for me, I couldn't have dreamed of a better ending. Aside from that, awesome sets. I mean, any sci-fi lover can appreciate just the stunning sets that make up the inside of the ship and its rooms. So 5 stars. 2 thumbs up. However you wanna put it. I can't say I'll still like this film 20 years from now, but I just wanted to go on the record and say this film definitely deserves more than thirty-whatnot percent on Rotten Tomatoes. I mean that's pretty harsh. Besides, I did love this film. It might not be flawless, but it had the right spirit, the right heart. Not superficial, which is probably what the average person thought upon seeing the trailer. And like I said, I loved it, so there. And did I mention I loved it?"
"randomStuff101","7","3","4","1 August 2017"," Great ship design, enjoyable flick
","I expected a bad movie but was surprised. The ship is well done, excellent production quality with nice effects. The pace moves along sufficiently to avoid boredom while providing enough contemplative moments.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the lack of people. It provided a spacious atmosphere for the story to unfold. With any futuristic ""romance"" movie, there's always unlikely flaws related to technology and science, but for the most part it's not too bad, and certainly doesn't do worse than any other sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>I get the feeling a lot of work was done on the design of the ship including the exterior and power generation. This deserves to be applauded, as the ship has a first class, highly evolved appearance. I really hope we humans build something like this in the future.<br/><br/>I like it when a movie makes me think about the realistic potential of space travel and how it would work. This movie encourages such pondering, and on the whole is well done.<br/><br/>Sure, there's plenty to question in terms of how likely this or that element is, but you can literally do that in any movie."
"petteritontti","8","3","4","29 July 2017"," Jennifer Lawrence made this movie
","The story in this movie isn't in any way unique but the movie is just very well made. I can't imagine what kind of pressure had been set to the casting for an obvious reason. There being only three actors in the whole movie they all needed to be great. No question, they were. For me Jennifer Lawrence is the one thing that makes this movie worth watching. Without she being so absolutely fabulous the actions of Chris Pratt's character just wouldn't have made any sense and the movie would have stayed just mediocre."
"grovee19","8","3","4","29 July 2017"," Negative Hype Undeserved
","I just saw this movie after having heard various negative reviews swirling about. If you ask me, this movie was quite good. No, I am not a critic. Yes, there were several instances of implausible occurrences (i.e. Jennifer Lawrence's character functioning normally with an impaled arm). However, I thought the acting was generally good, and the set was just marvelous. Great premise, too."
"bheadher","8","3","4","26 July 2017"," This is an excellent movie, period !
","I always take the professional critic reviews with a grain of salt, because after all they get saturated with watching movies, and generally lose that natural magic feeling after a while...many of them definitely missed the mark on Passengers...<br/><br/>A solid 8, that's what I gave Passengers. In the modern world of movie making, I have had a hard time finding one or two that really grab all the emotions...<br/><br/>This is one of the best scifi movies I have seen recently. It possesses all the elements that make for excellent story telling, yet without all the space action the usual space epics have...in short, this is a love story, a well done science fiction story, a human condition story, and everything in between...all rolled into one extremely well told and entertaining narrative...<br/><br/>One thing I noticed in some of the reviews, is the technical accuracy in the movie. By that I mean that much of the science implied is already being experimented with, so it isn't hard to relate to the movie from that perspective. But the story itself isn't really about science at all. It is totally about two people, and their lives on a star ship...<br/><br/>No, I won't tell all the story, it needs to be seen to be appreciated completely. If you want fast paced movies, this is not it, but it does have a lot of fast action scenes woven in...and, some viewers will find the ending something of a let down. My housemate finally watched it, and she wanted more to the ending, heh heh...but even though it ends rather blandly, it is nonetheless very poignant...<br/><br/>I am very glad they created this one...!!!"
"kosmasp","8","3","4","13 May 2017"," Long way to go
","I heard the critics too. And I get that this is not for everyone. But I do believe that a rating that is currently around 7 (out of 10) is pretty accurate for this movie. It is good, it's not amazing or breath taking (excuse the pun), but it really is suspenseful and it does keep it real (if you buy into the whole notion that this space mission/travel thing is or will be possible in the first place of course).<br/><br/>We do have some great actors involved in this, but you can imagine that there are moments in the movie where some may feel the movie could offer more. But that would not be keeping it real. Of course there are some decisions that are questionable at best, but that's life and that's how people work sometime ... Really good character piece surrounded by Science Fiction, but only watch it if you like human drama mixed with it!"
"gornasa","7","3","4","1 March 2017"," We'd all do the same thing
","So apparently a lot of people were SO offended by what's going on in this movie. Some said that 'it's not stalking if he's hot'. Looks like they missed out on some things in life, to say the least. This one is actually a no-brainer: no, it's not stalking if he's hot, well, let's say in 99% of cases. The thing is, this is how courting works. A guy who's interested in you tries to get your attention. At first you may not like him, and it doesn't matter if he's objectively attractive or not (here the critics of the movie claim that Chris Pratt is hot to everyone, which is definitely not true, so that kind of renders their argument void), but then you get to know him and you see that he's actually cool so you change your mind about him. Oh, and sometimes the guy may even be the total opposite of your type but he won't leave you alone, and you hate him for it, and then somehow as if magically he manages to make you fall in love with him. I'm sure everyone knows a story like that or two. But that's not what happens in this movie because here the characters are clearly into each other. So enough of the Stockholm Syndrome whining because 'Passengers' doesn't deserve all the hate. And yes, I'm a woman. But I grew up before people started going crazy about all this feminist/sexist/misogynist/chauvinist/perverse/stalker stuff that most of the time they only pretend to understand.<br/><br/>There, I got it out of my system. Now on to the review. I give this movie a solid 7 for being a warm, pretty love story. I didn't expect it to be some great sci fi flick so I didn't feel cheated when it turned out to be a romantic drama. The story could've been a bit more fleshed out because there was potential there, and then, with all the special effects, it would've been amazing. I thought for a moment that this could be like 'Titanic' in space, but there wasn't enough substance. Still, the movie is interesting and definitely worth a watch. And even though we don't really see how hard life was on the ship for Jim when he was alone, we can infer enough from what we do see. And anyone who's seen 'The Martian' or 'Moon' can compare and imagine what it's like to be alone, having no one to talk to and nothing to do. What do you do once you've played a little basketball and done a little dancing? What is Jim supposed to be doing for the next 90 years? What reason could he possibly have to go on living? <br/><br/>The movie does show very well how bad he feels when he has to wake Aurora up, and she does hate him, and that part of the story is pretty damn straightforward: he stole her life from her, sort of murdered her. But perhaps these two were meant to meet like that and make the most of what they got. If he didn't wake her up, their lives wouldn't be the same. And I don't think any of this needs explaining, really. When you watch the movie, you can understand all the human reasons for why they do what they do - why he doesn't want to live anymore, why he wakes her, why they fall in love, why she hates him but then forgives him. Seriously, this is so plain and simple. Like I said in the title of this review: we'd all do the same thing. Just imagine living alone in a place like this for a MONTH. I challenge you to survive that long without thinking of killing yourself at least once when you know it's all there is, that's all you've got, this big empty ship and 90 years of solitude and utter, mind-scrambling boredom. You'd be banging your head against walls all the time. So don't blame Jim for looking for a reason to live. <br/><br/>I quite enjoyed this movie and I hope that the critics get a grip and get a life. This isn't a story about a stalker. If Jim is a stalker then Jack from the 'Titanic' is also a stalker, and so is Christian Grey (OK, that one is a bit of a weirdo), and so is Richard Gere's character in 'Pretty Woman'. Not every guy chasing after a chick is a pervert (or a chick chasing after a guy, just think of Scarlett O'Hara 'stalking' her dear Ashley). These are movies, meant for our enjoyment. Let's not get political about every freakin' story we see on the screen."

"gortx","Null","3","4","26 January 2017"," Better than expected
","a tough one to discuss without spoilers. They will be below and clearly tagged.<br/><br/>In general, I thought the movie was better than the reviews. The acting is fine with a limited cast (mainly Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence). The production design and music are very good (both Oscar nominated), as is Rodrigo Prieto's camera-work (he's nominated for SILENCE). The premise is intriguing if not highly original (apparently Harlan Ellison has complained; and others have cited antecedents). The basic idea is that a crew of 5,200 people is in hibernation on a 120 year journey to another planet. By accident, Pratt's character Jim gets awoken - 90 years early! And, later, so does Lawrence's (Aurora). But, the crux of the movie is a major moral dilemma which pops up about a third of the way into the movie (discussed below). For the most part it is handled well enough. Unfortunately, the last act dashes much of that goodwill, if not entirely. So, if you haven't seen it, then it's worth a look for sci-fi fans. Others beware.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: The turning point of the movie is when Jim makes the choice to manually awaken Aurora because he is alone and knows he will likely die that way long before reaching the other planet. He becomes smitten with her after reading her profile in the ship's logs (really!). And, that's where the movie falls apart for most people. By waking her up, he essentially dooms her to the same fate as he. And, of course, he assumes they will become a 'desert island' couple. It's certainly a moral dilemma. But, I think the script, for the most part, addresses the issues. But, others can't get over Jim's actions, and have taken to calling his character a selfish bastard all the way up to a sexual predator. I don't argue with critics on the film about their attitude towards Jim, but, I do defend Screenwriter John Spaihts (DR.STRANGE), Director Morten Tyldum (IMITATION GAME) and the cast for how they play out the situation. There's nothing wrong with depicting a morally dubious decision. In fact, that is the primary drama here. It's really not that far different from what they did in numerous episodes of The Twilight Zone, for instance. But, now, our judgmental social media zealots won't even entertain that debate. Now, the last act? That I won't and can't defend. It is very much a ""Hollywood Ending"" that invites and deserved ridicule. Apparently, Spaiht's original script (which was in much demand during its 10 year development), handled things a bit differently."
"dorianj-81953","4","12","25","23 December 2016"," The point of the movie being...?
","Really really disappointing, I'll skip next two movies of Jeny. In few words, it's a reversed Snow White movie, but with no purpose, no romance, little dialog, typical shape of the ship (Elysium). Professional acting only by the British guy... It's a multi-million $ movie with the imagination of a teenager, even worse. Compare this with Arrival...!!! Sadly, it's a failure also because the characters act like singled dimension people. If I was one of them, I would have waked up more people, based on their strengths and started a new breed. How much sex can you have surrounded by 5000 dead people? Haha! And: can someone calculate if 2 people eat in 50 years more or less than 5260 in four months? Cheers!"

"unrealmuscat","8","4","6","13 June 2019"," Underrated movie
","Forget the metacritic reviews. This movie worth a lot more than a 4/10.
It is not an action movie or some kind of Alien horror titles. The movie is well balanced and very well produced. Actors are flawless. Everything is made to be an enjoyable movie with some kind of moral. Life has no sens so why people try to be someone they never gonna be. Just live the present. All you need is around you. It is some kind of total dream situations in a spaceship. It is a pure fictional movie with an happy ending and many tensions happening at the right moment. Very good script. The spaceship is a very beautiful environement. It is maybe an existing place on earth. How it is possible to say something wrong about this movie? Nothing is wrong at all. So in short .. Don't expect an action movie with Aliens eveywhere or super heros it is clearly not that kind of movie but it is a good very well made pop movie no doubt on that."

","This movie is an underrated gem that was unfortunately let down by the marketing.<br/><br/>I've seen a number of criticisms that the movie is 'boring' and 'nothing happens', and from what I remember the trailers did promise a suspenseful, action-packed sci-fi adventure.<br/><br/>That's not what this movie is about.<br/><br/>Passengers is a beautiful, slow-paced story about a man who is facing a lifetime of total isolation. It takes its time exploring his desperation, distractions and despair before sidestepping into a love story between two characters who are surprisingly genuine, and who manage to be sympathetic even when they're being immoral.<br/><br/>The movie is atmospheric above all else with fantastic acting and a haunting score, but I never felt that it dragged, and I was invested in the story from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I'm so glad that I ignored the critics and gave this movie a chance - it's so much better than I expected."

It is a total blend of genre's, maybe that's what threw some critics? But usually the stuff they love I find pretentious and boring, snobs really. This film is far from some simpleminded crap, it's quite complex in it's study of human emotions, existential crises and action/adventure/sci-fi. Beautiful, beautifully shot w/gorgeous actors, w/great chemistry. You'll really want to make up your own mind, don't let snobs rob you of a great film. This is so worth watching and I've seen it in 3D, 4K, HD, 4K again and I'd watch it at least every 6 mo's. Big movie fan, but I don't like time wasting crap, this is nothing of the sort.

","I am so angry about the critics. I did not see the movie before, because of the bad critics. After 1 year i just got the chance to see it. After i saw the movie i reread some of the reviews(user and critics also). The bad critics based on following points: <br/><br/>-This was not expected according to trailer (Mostly i do not see any trailer before seeing a movie, so?)<br/><br/>-Not realistic about physics (I never thought that every reviewer a professional physic in real life. What about a sci-fi has it's own physics rules that differs from ours? Moreover who cares about physics in Star Wars movies? No one. However the space battles should have been done without any sound you know) <br/><br/>-This is a romantic movie (No it isn't! This movie is a drama about loneliness and more with some romantic element. This movie could be awesome without any romance. However there would be much less sex scene. <br/><br/>-Boring (Then you watch this movie from the wrong aspect. If you find this movie boring and you don't know why then imagine that you are alone in a spaceship. What would you do until end of your life?<br/><br/>What i found in this movie are: Great acting, OK story (i would have done the ending differently), great atmosphere, awesome scenes.

"Reno-Rangan","8","4","6","4 August 2017"," A space-travel tale!
","I was going to watch it, but not expecting it to be a masterpiece. It was not, yet surprised to be a lot better film when it comes to todays film overcrowded with space themes. The entire story takes place on a spaceship. It's a space journey tale, when the mankind with 5,000 on-board heading for a new home planet, but one of them unexpectedly wakes up from his hibernation pod. It's supposed to wake him and everybody a few months before their destination, so now he's up nearly a century early, and what he plans to do is what the adventures covered in the rest of the film.<br/><br/>There's no connection to the 2008 film of the same name. Initially I thought it was like a live-action version of 'Wall-E'. Not entirely, only a few scenes and the main two characters remind Wall-E and Eva. It is also a limited cast film and I loved the simple screenplay, but strong enough to be one of the best in its kind. The actors were very good. The visuals were beautiful, a perfect film for the late night to watch alone peacefully.<br/><br/>From the Norwegian director of 'Headhunters' fame. This is not his Hollywood debut, but previously he had got an Oscar nomination for the film 'The Imitation Game'. The concept was like 'The Blue Lagoon' or kind of the space version of the Eden Garden tale. I had predicted a few scenes, those were too simple to do that. The real big thing came in the later part, especially when all the focus shifts to more than the initial narration. Scientifically, not everything believable, but cinematically, anything can be possible. So with a such concept, the film headed to the conclusion where a twist came into play. Entertainment is guaranteed. One of the year's best that should not be missed. Recommended!<br/><br/>8/10"

One to pull the lever and one to hold the door open. If Jim hadn't woken Aurora up and somehow managed to figure out the problem on his own, taken a spacewalk to open the door, and then planned to come back in to pull the lever, it wouldn't have worked and all 5200+ people would have died. Bummer. <br/><br/>So while critics are panning the movie as stalker-y, maybe it written so as to portray fate? <br/><br/>A big clue in this regard is when Aurora sees the midwife in her pod and can tell by looking at her that they'd be friends. ""You can tell just by her face?"" Jim asks her (paraphrase), and she says yes, and the relief on Jim's face tells the audience that he's NOT some crazy stalker, but had a normal human intuition.<br/><br/>Apparently subtlety and common storytelling techniques are too abstract for internet movie critics these days."

Once everything is set up in the first 25-or-so minutes, the story, just like its protagonists, gets stuck in space with nowhere to go.

There was a little bit of everything, comedy, action, drama, romance. The special effects are outstanding. The design of the ship was beautiful. I don't know what rating the ""critics"" have this film but all I can say is that I watched it 4 times already because I enjoyed it so much.this story was like being a castaway on a deserted island. I understand Jim's dilemma. If I was marooned on a huge starship with a 90 year sentence, with no one to talk to except an Android bartender with limited social skills. I think I would've woken up the most beautiful woman also. But with my luck she's a hardcore lesbian."
"eddie_baggins","7","4","6","1 February 2017"," A visually impressive Sci-Fi romance
","It's not hard to see what Passengers could've been, but this big budgeted and much hyped Sci-Fi romance starring two of the worlds most well-liked Hollywood stars is one of the more curiously forgotten-about spectacles of the increasingly busy end of year releases. Really, though, this largely critically panned feature is not half as bad as many have called it out to be.<br/><br/>Very far from the Titanic in space it was looking to become, Passengers is still a polished and visually arresting tale of love and survival on human transport ship Starship Avalon that allows everyone's new favorite good guy Chris Pratt a chance to show his solid leading man credentials and The Imitation Game director Morten Tyldum a chance to go wild with the possibilities of imagining what life would be like aboard a ship designed and catered to delivering such valuable cargo on a 100 plus year voyage.<br/><br/>From themed restaurants, spacesuit adventures, swimming pools right through to a manned bar, Passengers design of Avalon is a sight to behold and provides a point of difference to our average movie space ship that is often grum and lifeless while the film's often lighter tone is highlighted by Pratt's turn as the unfortunately early awoken Jim Preston.<br/><br/>To say that Passengers doesn't go to dark places however would be a disservice to a film that perhaps goes too dark for some people's tastes, but it feels as though Tyldum and his team can't do these element's full justice and some of the films 'big questions' don't get fully formed answers, while the films 4th act is a particular letdown, especially after the movie's impressively captivating opening stanza.<br/><br/>The other rather glaring problem that stops Passengers from becoming the sum of it's parts is the introduction of Jennifer Lawrence's Aurora Lane who plays a true support turn to Pratt's Jim, but while the two likable actors clearly get on like a house on fire (as evidenced by the press tour) the budding romance of Jim and Aurora as they come to grips with their situation on Avalon never really comes out trumps.<br/><br/>Had the duos off-screen rapport been better utilized between the pair it's likely that much more of Passengers more corny dialogue and underdeveloped situations could've come off a little smoother, while the sometimes uneasy relationship the film develops between it's lighter and darker moment's would've felt much more fluent.<br/><br/>Heading into Passengers with an open mind and willing attitude will allow the viewer to experience a fun deep space adventure filled with enough romance to keep the Hallmark crowd well and truly happy and Sci-Fi fans intrigued by the imagination on show. By no means a Sci-Fi classic, Passengers is still a journey worth jumping on board for.<br/><br/>3 and a half pesky security doors out of 5"

","The first thing I read about «Passengers» is that it was a poorly made movie, with an equal poor plot.<br/><br/>After seeing the movie I can only tell the so-called professionals: Pure Hogwash.<br/><br/>Passengers is actually a good movie, with a good plot. Morten Tyldum has done a good job, and John Spaihts has written a good script full of suspense, intense and interesting ideas and questions.<br/><br/>The many philosophical questions raised in the plot are highly interesting and are well worth pondering.<br/><br/>Most important is not whether it could happen or not, but of course What would you have done in this situation. It is not a question of whether it is possible – but if it was possible, what would the solution to the various quandaries be.<br/><br/>If you want not only good entertainment, but also food for thought, this is two hours well worth spending in the darkness of the theater."
"ktmkamran","7","4","6","5 February 2017"," Critics are just critics, the movie is entertaining!
","I don't write a lot of movie reviews, but the Metascore of 41 - come on! I will be honest in my review and will state all pros and cons that I noticed and I will try to minimize spoilers. Science: the movie is not the best from scientific point of view. It contains a lot of scientific goofs, a couple of which are easily noticeable. So if you are good at astronomy (like me) you might feel annoyed at some points. However, you can just ignore these. Ethics: a lot of critics wrote about the ethics of the movie (spoiler ahead), because Jim woke Aurora from sleep. They said that was an unethical choice. Well, critics, go and live alone for a year yourselves. And then, almost no one seems to give a damn about Game of Thrones' ethics. So, please, shut up about ethics. Romance: Not a superb one, but better than average.<br/><br/>Overall I was thinking to rate the film with 6 or 7 stars, and decided that 7 fits it better. I would never watch it twice, but for one time only, it is great!"
"falconeranatolia","10","4","6","4 February 2017"," Another movie the critics got wrong
","Fortunately I didn't listen to the (preposterous) critic reviews, and watched this movie and was totally flabbergasted. I wasn't a Cris Pratt nor a Jennifer Lawrence fan until this movie. I cant depict any flaws in this movie. It has special effects, action, drama, comedy, a love story, the complete package. However, do not expect a Star Wars, Star Trek type of sci-fi. The movie is in line with real facts, such as NASAS endeavour to colonize other planets (due to the earths overpopulation & its inevitable demise etc). I have seen this film twice in the cinemas & about 10 times online. Will definitely be purchasing in 4K as soon as its released. The acting was exceptional. You are morally challenged by some actions that take place. I believe its every mediocre mans or commoners dream, to be in an environment that will grant you access to a beautiful women, who would otherwise be unattainable. I just pray they make a sequel to this fantastic movie. It has been a while since watching such an enjoyable movie. Best movie of the year."

","I don't know why, but watching the film ""Passengers"" I have raised in my soul nostalgic memories about the album, ""Еlectric Light Orchestra"" (""ELO"") ""Time"" (1981), the theme songs on which the fate of a man caught with the help of a time machine in the year 2095 and are not able to come back. I especially remember the song ""21st Century Man"", the meaning of which is that despite all the great technical achievements of mankind of the 21st century, they themselves do not make people happier, and even on the contrary, make more aware of their loneliness:<br/><br/>""Fly across the city, rise upon the land,<br/><br/>You can do most anything,<br/><br/>Now you are twenty first century man.<br/><br/>You should be so happy, you should be so glad.<br/><br/>So why are you so lonely, you twenty first century man?""<br/><br/>In my opinion, the main theme in ""Passengers"" is the theme of human loneliness. How it is shown in the film, deserves a separate description, but to avoid spoilers let me just say that at all times the universal, and yet the only cure for this epidemic of our age is the Love, and it is capitalized. This is light feeling that had test heroes Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, it helped them better understand themselves and defined the whole meaning of their lives. No matter in what conditions was their fateful meeting, the important thing is what impact it has had on the future of Aurora lane and Jim Preston, through some painful doubts, fears and uneasiness were the heroes on the way to the realization of a common destiny that bound them aboard the space ship ""Avalon"". I believe it is the desire to live ""here and now"" in the earthly present, not ""someday"" in the future transcendental determined the final mutual decision of the lovers.<br/><br/>As for the actors, I can say that they excellently managed with their images. Chris Pratt was able to show courageous and at the same time, not alien to romance man, which by the fate, or maybe, by the chance, took, perhaps, the most difficult decision of his life. I respect and love Jennifer Lawrence as an actress, I don't think that her roles as a strong and independent heroines somehow spoil her, on the contrary, it perfectly reflects her character and willpower. Here, as in ""The Hunger Games"", the actress showed herself from the best side, performing the role of a young writer feeling a certain emptiness in life and seeking to fill the dream of a new life. But, as often happened in life, what we seek is sometimes much closer than we think, it is enough to look inside yourself and look around, and we understood what is our main earthly value, not illusory, though very attractive and alluring.<br/><br/>A film for romantics and those who love and appreciate a movie that raises questions about major life issues such as loneliness, finding yourself and your place in this world, and, of course, about love as a unique way of coping with reality and at the same time to escape from it.<br/><br/>""When you feel your ship is sinking,<br/><br/>When you feel your heart is breaking, <br/><br/>Hold on tight to your dream""!

"jrarichards","9","4","6","11 January 2017"," Simple/simplistic or fundamental/elemental? For me, the latter!
","This film from Director Morten Tyldum has quite a lot going for it. First and foremost, it is incredibly bold in its envisioning of the future, with spacecraft travelling to the stars on missions extending in length to centuries. (in this scenario, Arcturus, at 36.7 light years away from Earth, is a point closer to the beginning of the journey to ""Homestead II"" than the end; with a close pass of that star being used to further accelerate the truly gigantic vessel, the Avalon). Not the slightest hint of how we got to that from our present primitive, first-toe-in-the-water stage is given here, and that is surprisingly refreshing: we may simply take for granted that this kind of technological level has been reached somehow, and go on and ""enjoy the show"".<br/><br/>I certainly did! <br/><br/>While the most recent Star Trek movie, ""Gravity"" and ""Interstellar"" all set high standards for imagining vessels and worlds into existence, ""Passengers"" takes the prize for me; the ship is simply exquisite, but also surprisingly ""realistic"" and believable. Inside, it is sumptuous, full of hi-tech ready to serve; but that comes at a price - the more you pay, the better standard you get. Shades of the Titanic, but - although our great vessel does indeed sustain a serious collision that injects some edge into the story from the very outset - all is at first subsumed by a rather light touch, as the commercial side of this venture is made abundantly clear.<br/><br/>This then is no Star Trek-like exploration, no military/public-sector mission, no last attempt of human civilisation to escape the Earth and save itself for posterity. Rrather, it is a paid (basically one-way) passage to a new world, whereby 200+ crew serve 5000+ passengers/colonists/upper-class economic migrants, but all are in suspended animation for just about the entire journey.<br/><br/>All, that is, except for one unlucky guy Jim (a very good part for Chris Pratt), who is awakened from stasis by the aforementioned collision and proceeds to ponder/despair on how he is going to manage for decades with only machines of various degrees of sophistication for company. The latter reach their peak in (the top half of) barman Arthur (Arthur in Avalon - get it?), as very well-played by Welshman Michael Sheen. Sweetly, various systems on the ship also feature the British voice of Emma Clarke - art imitating life, as Emma also voices the London Underground, and - to the best of my knowledge - also many lifts (elevators) around the world.<br/><br/>Hence the ""canvas"" against which the main drama plays out is huge and stark, but in other places also rich and entertaining.<br/><br/>Now set that against a surprisingly simple storyline that nevertheless has a very great deal of meaning to offer. There is a definite hint of The Bible in here, as our lonely Adam in his Paradise needs an Eve, and he commits a kind of ""original sin"" to get one (in the pleasant enough shape of Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence)). Not too many more clues from me over that, but let us say that we get to think about many issues of basic human need and loneliness, and what these things can justify. This occupies much of the film, as does a rather beautiful (and at times erotic enough) on-and-off love affair between the stars (in every sense of the term).<br/><br/>Eventually, briefly, our two humans are joined by a third. But for a lot of the time, it's just the two of them, with hopes, ambitions and memories, and of course with Arthur the android, who is a great deal better than a laptop, but can't quite bridge that gap to full humanity.<br/><br/>Given that we also have several sub-stories about the desire to hand-make things in a ship that repairs and maintains itself (or at least should do), the desire to bring untidy nature into these rather clinical commercial and entirely human-oriented surroundings, and of course a main plot line about those same surroundings gradually deteriorating into a death trap, there is a lot said here about loneliness, love, meaning, need, sacrifice, devotion ... and basically what is superficial in our lives and what isn't.<br/><br/>The film's very final plot device is justified artistically, and quite moving, even if it resembles the beginning in deliberately dodging a number of difficult and complex moral/ethical (and also intellectual) questions. This ""less is more"" approach is interesting, and all the more so when we note that some moral and intellectual issues ARE addressed in detail here, while others are skimmed over. Since I normally ""demand"" an entirely cohesive scenario with no plot holes, I surprise myself by noting how much of a virtue the approach taken by ""Passsengers"" actually turns out to be. It evokes an idea of ""Impressionism"" that goes a long way to confirming the status of this particular film as a piece of art. It also suggests that the makers are firmly in charge of their film, and know what they want/choose - and do not want/choose - to achieve with it (actually a rarer commodity than it would seem these days, given certain recent, utterly-chaotic sci fi efforts on the big screen also reviewed by me!) <br/><br/>This is then what I personally have been looking and hoping for for some while: sci fi in a spectacular, at times stunning, setting, but with heart and brain alike in very much the right place."
"srdjan_veljkovic","5","10","20","31 December 2016"," Passengers trying to go everywhere end up going, well, nowhere
","The basic problem of this movie is that it tries to do too much in too little time. To make good use of all the ingredients, this should have lasted at least an hour longer.<br/><br/>It just tries ""everything"" - a space drama, love story, disaster movie, sci-fi, survivalist/existential movie, AI interaction, road trip (in space)... But, none of it is explored enough, so it ends up with pretty much nothing substantial.<br/><br/>It also has many strange things, to say the least (and be polite). Like, why in the hell is the space ship lit up like a Christmas tree while everybody is in hibernation? Sure, they have a fusion reactor, but, that doesn't mean they have fuel/energy to spare. Who in their right mind would let a commercial space ship of this size go ""auto- pilot"" for 120 years? I mean, we all know that there's stuff flying around out there and you can't just let AI handle it. Even so, why wouldn't the ship's computer(s) wake up some skeleton crew on signs of such significant failure? I could go on like this for hours.<br/><br/>An example of ""too much to do in too little"" time is the first ~half an hour which deals with Chris Pratt on his own. We don't really feel his sense of the despair and the need to wake up Jeniffer Lawrence. Yes, we see him suffering, but it's too short and like a music video or a video game (and he doesn't do a great job either). But, we don't _feel_ it.<br/><br/>Most other parts are similar. From a plot POV, fine, but, when executed, somehow incomplete, flat, and not a movie. <br/><br/>The more-or-less classic Hollywood happy-end doesn't help here, especially because it is really silly and beyond any reason. Sure, he's Star Lord, but having Chris Pratt survive a blast from a fusion reactor with a shield made of what seems like an Aluminium door... He may be Star Lord, but He is not Groot.<br/><br/>On a separate note, there was lots of fun to be had with this set up, and we end up having very little of it.<br/><br/>On the plus side, it does look good, Lawrence Fishburne is fine, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do have this ""we like each other, but we're together because there's nobody else around, otherwise we probably wouldn't be"" kind of vibe and the plot is generally interesting. It just feels like that with some more screen time and some more work, this could have been good. As is, it's a nice-looking misfire with some redeeming qualities."
"Hellmant","8","10","20","26 December 2016"," Asks some good moral questions.
","'PASSENGERS': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A sci-fi romantic thriller, starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt. It was directed by Morten Tyldum (who also directed the 2014 critically acclaimed hit 'THE IMITATION GAME'), and it was scripted by Jon Spaihts (who also co-wrote the sci-fi hits 'PROMETHEUS' and 'DOCTOR STRANGE'). The movie tells the story of two passengers; that awaken 90-years early from induced hibernation, on a 120-year space flight to another planet. The film also costars Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's also under-performed at the Box Office. I enjoyed it, but I enjoy everything with Jennifer Lawrence in it. <br/><br/>The story takes place sometime in the near future, aboard the spacecraft Avalon. The Avalon is transporting 5,000 colonists to a planet called Homestead II (from Earth), and it's supposed to take 120-years for it to get there. Since the trip takes so long, the colonists are cryogenically frozen (for the duration of the flight). Two passengers unexpectedly wake up early, 90-years too early, and they also discover there's something seriously wrong with the ship. <br/><br/>The film asks some good moral questions, the kind that can create some great conversations (and good debates); like all good science fiction should. It's definitely not a perfect film; I blame most of it's flaws on Tyldum's direction though (I had similar problems with 'THE IMITATION GAME'). I do think it's a good story, and a great concept, and the two lead actors are both good in it (Lawrence is much better though). It's also great to see a woman star getting top billing, in an adventure film like this, and also getting paid $8 million more than the male lead; even though he has quite a bit more screen time (and is arguably the central character of the movie). I think Lawrence definitely deserves it; she's a huge star, and this is a pretty entertaining vehicle for her.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://youtu.be/Bm1uDreRMGU"

","This was an amazing piece of art that was also so truly romantic. While I understand it will not appeal to much of the audience who is looking for meaningless violence and bullets flying everywhere this movie has an incredibly deep touch of the human mind and soul, looking within ourselves and trying to define concepts that transcend time and distance all wrapped up in a space opera rendered in extraordinary colors.<br/><br/>I went into the theater with my girlfriend at my request and she was ready for a good nap while I was ready for yet another star wars like disappointment. And boy was I wrong... I was so surprised to see this type of movie that goes into the rich and amazing ideas of old giant sci-fi writers such as Stanislav Lem or Asimov. It all reminded me of a very old book from my childhood called ""Magellanic cloud"" by Stanislav Lem. <br/><br/>I have been connected with this movie on so many levels as this story depicts the human soul in all its loneliness, craving for companionship in the vast empty void of space. While the main story line is somehow predictable and not much is happening action-wise the true magic of the movie happens in the background, provided that your soul is sensible enough to cope with the very subtle nuances that question our very own existence.<br/><br/>The concepts unraveled here are so vast and deep that you simply end up thinking about it all days after you saw it. And this really is something in a day where most movies don't even require you to think but just to consume the provided content.<br/><br/>It more than exceeded my expectations and it's a solid 10 for me, absolutely no hesitations."
"terhitapiainen","9","10","20","26 December 2016"," Existentialism in space
","The movie has received rather poor professional reviews which claim that the concept is superficial and the romance misogynistic. For me, the movie was excellent study on what makes us human; the social relationships or the idea of right and wrong. It is about the choices we make when forced into an absurd and profoundly hopeless situation. It is about the fear of death,both the fear of empty and meaningless life and the fear of immediate death. Of course there is a romance plot, but for me, the movie had a strange existentialist feeling that touched me deeply. The movie is highly underrated as most reviewers see it as a shallow and strange ""date movie"". The movie is shot in a beautiful and breathtaking way, the actors were excellent and the slow pace is justified: It gives you time to think. What would you do in the situation? What would be your choice? I recommend this philosophical movie disguised as a romance for everybody who are ready to challenge the opinion of professional reviewers."
"liamkenny91","8","10","20","24 December 2016"," Enjoyable, if you don't think too much about it.
","Let me start off by saying I enjoyed this film. Two very pretty actors who very good at their jobs, with support from Michael Sheen, made the almost 2 hour run time fly past. They, and Laurence Fishburn to a lesser extent, all did exactly which was asked of them. I actually laughed a lot more in this film than I thought I would have - but maybe that was just my dry sense of humour, but the Sheen character provided a lot of these juxtaposed moments.<br/><br/>The problems come with the script and the plot. The movie doesn't really know what it wants to be, and therefor struggles with its own identity. It could have easily been a love story, or a disaster movie, or even something much deeper, but fails to really tick any of these boxes. It introduces very complex questions at an early stage: what would you do if the only person you will ever know or love for the rest of your life, decided your fate and to take your sense of purpose away because he was lonely? It then glosses over the emotional implication of this - for example why is she never shown to be anything other than angry? Why isn't she scared, why isn't she empowered? And most of all, why does it not matter as soon as the threat of life or death for others is introduced? She is already dead, as he took her life away, so why should she care any more. <br/><br/>I can get over the questions relating to the science of the film, its left ambiguous enough that we don't know how long has passed from present day and which technology advances have happened, which can possibly power the ship for 120 years at half the speed of light, for example. There could have also been additions to clear up the time between the last time we see them, and the end of the film - once they had dedicated the main characters were choosing love above all, adding a child to this would have introduced even more thought provoking questions, but I can see why they didn't want to add more. <br/><br/>Yes there are big plot holes, yes there are dues ex machinas and yes the film raises more questions than it answers. But it was enjoyable, sexy and fun. Michael Sheen's performance as the comic android was a personal highlight. Would I see it again? Probably not, but I'd recommend it to my parents."
"mrvibrating-49072","5","13","28","16 January 2017"," Above average sci-fi, but still mediocre
","Is it supposed to be a romance or a sci-fi movie? I'm not into romance so can't comment much on that count, although it doesn't seem like a very compelling example of the genre.<br/><br/>If the latter, why on earth would you choose Arcturus - or any star, for that matter, least of all a red giant - for a slingshot manoeuvre? The energy gain from a slingshot comes from orbital angular momentum donated by the celestial body used - not its axial / spin momentum... If the red giant was orbiting, say, a neutron star or some other more massive object, then it might make some sense. But Arcturus has no companion star. And even if it did, you'd be at such great radius (because it's a red giant, with barely more mass than the Sun), a slingshot would take months, for a comparatively tiny gain in momentum.<br/><br/>However we're later informed that the ship is at 50% of light speed! At that kind of velocity, only a neutron star or black hole would be able to offer any significant speed boost, and a red giant would pass by in a matter of minutes, with the closest approach lasting mere seconds.<br/><br/>Throughout, we're shown a bright blue nebula in the sky, perhaps 30 AU away... but Arcturus is 36 LY away, while the nearest nebula (the Helix) is 700 LY away! Besides which, if the ship has taken 30 years to reach .5 C (it's powered by an ion engine, which is still firing throughout the movie so the ship is still accelerating), then it surely can't be much more than 18 LY out from Sol - it couldn't possibly have reached Arcturus in the 30 years since its departure. Much less any nebula..<br/><br/>The skydome palette is totally blue. Blue is actually a nice choice, cinematographically, since it provides a good contrast range and bloom from bright light to black, helping stars to 'pop' while maintaining the impression of depth and distance. However in reality, red is more likely to dominate, since it is subject to less dissipation, and most stars are red dwarfs, but also, whatever their class, they're progressively far, far away and all light sources get more red-shifted the further away they are. Plus the nebula - if that's what it's supposed to be - should be predominantly hydrogen which gives them their characteristic red / orange hue. Not blue. The plane of the Milky Way from space is an awesome and colourful spectacle, and might've found pride of place here, but no, we get meaningless blue splodges...<br/><br/>In one cliff-hanger scene, the ship's centrifuge momentarily brakes (negative torque must've been applied since angular momentum is conserved), disabling the artificial gravity and causing the water in a swimming pool to float up into a ball - which is a nice touch, however a swimmer in such a scenario would be squeezed out of the ball by the water's intrinsic tension and higher (than human) density, not sucked helplessly into the center.<br/><br/>All of which should by any rights be moot, since the initial cause of all the technical problems is a large asteroid strike. The plasma shield meant to protect the ship from such strikes is a nice idea, but plasma is simply ionised gas, so to destroy even very small and slow asteroids it'd have to be millions of degrees Kelvin, if not orders hotter... yet the ship is travelling at .5 C! A 10 tonne lump of anything at that speed will have an impact energy of 4.3 trillion Joules! The entire ship would've been instantly vaporised! Plasma shield? The whole ship would've been turned into plasma! Despite all this, given Hollywood's usual contemptuous regard for sci-fi, this isn't half as bad as any of the other recent offerings, and not nearly as imbecilic as Denis Villeneuve's Arrival.<br/><br/>All in all, good performances, sets, and styling, and worth a cinema ticket, but won't leave any lasting impression."

","The Starship Avalon, in the midst of its 120-year journey from Earth to a colony planet known as Homestead II, suffers a collision in space which prematurely awakens one of its 5,000 passengers (Chris Pratt). With 90 years to go before reaching his destination, Pratt is sure to die of old age on the spaceship, so--with a guilty conscience--he awakens another passenger from hibernation, a pretty female writer. With such an engaging 30-minute opening, detailing Pratt's daily adventures while being the only person awake on the huge ship (and baring his innermost thoughts to a pleasant robotic bartender), one gets the sinking feeling screenwriter Jon Spaihts won't be able to keep up the momentum for long. True enough, for as soon as Jennifer Lawrence is awakened--a sleeping beauty aptly named Aurora--the film slips into formula (not necessarily a science fiction formula, more like a man and woman against the elements formula) that feels staid and familiar (they bicker and make up like the shipwrecked kids from ""The Blue Lagoon""). Lawrence isn't convincing, anyway, as a New Yorker on her way to another planet--her bright, inquisitive personality is so of-the-moment and earthbound that to place her on-board this Starship is an automatic mismatch of actress and milieu.

Everyone's asleep for the whole trip, including the crew... For that matter, why would there be a manual lever to override a door? Who's going to be there to use it anyway? For THAT matter, why even HAVE a crew at all? The ship basically flies itself, so the crew is just on board to say adios forever to all their loved ones on Earth for no apparent reason. <br/><br/>Of course you could also bring up the speed the ship is going, which would not allow for little jaunts outside.

The effects and the visual experience is decent if that's what you're looking for.<br/><br/>However, the acting, the script and the general execution didn't do the promising premise any justice.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt was less than mediocre at best, and (Aurora) Jennifer Lawrence's first scene of confusion made me think it was the first movie she ever acted in. Which disappointed me a lot because I'm such a fan, she has performed so much better in the past.<br/><br/>My next point is either positive or negative, depending on your angle, but I felt like Aurora's main purpose was to perform as many activities as possible to get Jennifer Lawrence to show some curves. Perhaps Jennifer Lawrence's most humiliating role - for loss of dignity as she is a great actress.<br/><br/>The script was totally predictable and clichéd: Jim (Pratt) would make a terrible mistake, he would make up for it by sacrificing himself in some way, causing Aurora to forgive him and they lived happily ever after.<br/><br/>We all knew he would survive his suicide mission.. at one point I even thought (hoped in fact) that he would die in the ""AutoDoc"", but lo and behold, after Aurora's awful stuttering he breathes life...<br/><br/>The AI bartender seemed to contradict himself in terms of his feelings and self awareness.<br/><br/>The science as many have mentioned was flawed, especially the scene where they ""slingshot"" around the star and Pratt surviving the blast with a ""shield""?<br/><br/>I remained hopeful when Fishburne entered the scene but his ""moving"" dialogue before his death - something about J.Law and C.Pratt having one anothers backs made me heavily cringe.

Most of the damage is not visible straight away, but will prove to be crucial later on.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for mechanic Jim Preston this incident results in his hibernation pod malfunctioning. He wakes up and soon realises that something is way off. For the next year and three weeks he lives on this spaceship all by himself amongst thousands of sleeping people. At first he keeps himself busy with various tasks around the ship and his efforts to get onto the bridge of the ship. Slowly the loneliness is getting to him though. His only companion is a bar tender android, played by Michael Sheen who is brilliant in the role. His performance quite outshines Chris Pratt, I hate to say.<br/><br/>Jim sinks into a deep depression and even contemplates suicide. He faces isolation and loneliness literally for the rest of his life. And that amongst of a sea of people. The spaceship will only arrive at the homestead in ninety years. Well after he will have died. During a particularly dark time he comes upon the pod of Aurora Lane. He is intrigued and starts reading up on her. The more he learns the more he fancies himself in love with her.<br/><br/>The next part has been called many things all over the internet from dark to selfish to downright murder. And perhaps that is all true. But I challenge anyone of those people to deny that they would not have sought a companion and done the same thing. If you faced spending the rest of your life without contact to another person ever again, surely that would makes anyone try and find a solution.<br/><br/>Anyway, after months of trying to talk himself out of it he tampers with Aurora's hibernation pod and wakes her up. In the beginning she believes that her awaking is also due to a pod failure. She is not happy about it but once she realises that there is no going back she settles into life on the ship.<br/><br/>Before too long all of Jim's dreams come true and they become an item. The bar tender has now two clients. Life is good for a while. Jim and Aurora are happy. Her travel gold member status gives them access to all kinds of perks on the ship.<br/><br/>As to be expected the truth comes out eventually and the romance comes to an abrupt stand still. At first Aurora is shocked and enraged when she finds out that she is stuck on the ship for the rest of her life. Then she blocks Christ and gives him the silent treatment. Her reaction is quite understandable considering that someone else altered the course of her life for his own selfish reasons. Jim sentences her to a life on the spaceship without her own choosing.<br/><br/>By then the technical incidents on board add up and a third person wakes up, this time one of the crew. Gus is the Chief Deck Officer of the Avalon. Together they discover that the nuclear power plant is overheating. The malfunctioning of the ship gets worse, threatening to end in disaster for all on board.<br/><br/>Gus' awakening has unexpected and deadly side effects and soon Aurora and Jim find themselves alone again, racing against time to safe the spaceship and everyone on it. They are forced to work together to survive. During the attempts to cool down the power plant, Jim leaves the ship for a dangerous spacewalk that could mean his death. Aurora realises that without him she would be in exactly the same position as he was before waking her up. She realises how she loves him and how very much she does not want to be alone either.<br/><br/>There are a few tense moments, but in the end they make it. When the crew wakes up 88 years later they find the space ship partly transformed into a giant greenhouse. Jim and Aurora learned a valuable lesson, as hopefully will have the viewer. People are always on the way somewhere, instead of living in the moment. They want to be somewhere else, instead of being happy where they are with the people in their lives.<br/><br/>In the end, was it murder to wake up Aurora? I don't think so. She and Jim lived a long and happy live. They made the best of their circumstances and grew old together. What more could you possibly want from life? Does it really matter where you are as long as you are loved and happy?<br/><br/>I found it fascinating that the entire movie was basically held by only three people. Apart from the brief cameo of Laurence Fishburne and an even briefer one by Andy Garcia at the end, the only people in the movie were Jenifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt and Michael Sheen. Jennifer Lawrence is such an amazing actress. Her characters reaction when she found out the truth was spectacular to say the least.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt played his character very well. He started out as this happy go lucky guy who sank into despair at the prospects ahead of him. It was a great performance on his part.<br/><br/>Only Michael Sheen could play a legless android in such a manner. I was once again so impressed by him. He is a wonderful actor.<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed Passengers. There was a lot more romance in the movie than I would have thought, but I quite liked that. The action scenes were great."

"spikenard222","3","6","11","1 July 2017"," This voyage goes off course and shipwrecks
","NON-SPOILER SECTION<br/><br/>I want to give this film a higher rating, but the more I think about it the lower the score gets. Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane is, not surprisingly, the bright spot, entertaining as always. The special effects are well done. The setup is intriguing: colonists on a 120 year flight to a new planet, two passengers (hence the title) wake up a tad too early (90 years too early!), and they discover something's wrong with the ship, and it's a race to fix it before everyone dies. How could Hollywood mess that up? Well, trust me, they do. In a science fiction film like this, there will be scientific inaccuracies and implausibilities, but that's forgivable. What's not forgivable are obvious and distracting plot inconsistencies and oversights and logical lapses that will occur to laymen like you and me during a first viewing, oversights and lapses that ultimately undermine my ability to suspend my disbelief. The characters offer some forced rationalizations to explain away some of the problems, but it feels more like someone realized late in production that there were major problems and attempted a band-aid or two. But more importantly, the film introduces a moral dilemma, a moral crime really, that could have a number of possible resolutions, yet takes the most insulting and unbelievable path to a 'happy ending' that I've seen in a long time. This could have been a profound journey that launched promisingly; but ultimately this movie founders.<br/><br/>SPOILERS<br/><br/>Two main issues.<br/><br/>The first main issue that undermined by suspension of disbelief was the lack of failsafe redundancy on this ship. The ship will be traveling for *120 years*, with no hope of any outside help, but the designers failed to have backup parts, plans, and procedures for the most critical components? After an asteroid collision, the computer starts to go haywire, but nothing about that awakens the crew? Seriously, the computer is not designed to awaken the crew if there is a fatal error that it cannot resolve? And really, no one ever foresaw a hibernation pod malfunction? There is no way to put someone back into hibernation if they wake up? Did all these people sign up for a potential suicide mission? If everyone is asleep and there is no chance of a hibernation malfunction, why exactly then is the crew locked away like Fort Knox? Why isn't there a backup reactor or two on the ship? And, of all things, the ship can't figure out there is a hull breach? A hull breach!? But perhaps the most grating of all: we find out there is only one Autodoc for a ship with over 5,000 people on board, with no backup parts or replacements! Seriously, these logical lapses occurred to me on a first viewing...I'd hate to see what else I missed during a second viewing. How did this film get past pre-production?<br/><br/>The second, and even worse, issue is Chris Pratt's character Jim. I think we can all follow along as he wakes up early, freaks out at his predicament, and tries everything he can think of to find a solution, and after a year gets depressed. Got it, check. But then!....in true Hollywood fashion, he 'falls in love' with Aurora and wakes her up. Of course we are hit in the gut with the moral depravity of this action, we clench our stomach as he leads her along, and we all hold our breath for when she finds out the truth. But then we start thinking about how implausible this all is. First of all, if he can figure out how to wake someone up, why doesn't he wake up a fellow mechanic? Or engineer? Or doctor? It's the most obvious thing to do, but of course in Hollywood-land, he doesn't do that. Second, hello! Once Laurence Fishburne wakes up, the bridge is now open! You know, the bridge, *where the crew is hibernating*. Even though Fishburne dies, Jim could now wake up one or more of the crew to get help. Hello!?<br/><br/>But let's talk about that ""romance."" I'm a lenient movie guy: I can play along with a lot of things. But *not* to the point that Aurora ends up truly loving this sick obsessive stalker who basically doomed her to a life of kidnapped isolation. Stop putting a happy face ending on this situation. The correct ending was for her to get back in the Autodoc and go back into hibernation. It was the only way for Jim to make up for his sin and salvage something from this shipwreck of a film."

","Romance? Stalking, kidnapping, attempted murder leavened with some romantic Stockholm Syndrome. Nice ship and a few effective exterior scenes. Otherwise essentially a silly business culminating in fancy FX footwork and a 'Perils of Pauline' resolution. ""Winter's Bone"" is still Jennifer Lawrence's high point for me and now that she has become a glamorpuss, deservedly, I keep wanting to fault her for being too pretty to be a good actress, but I can't. She hasn't proved it yet. Here, as usual, she delivers. Chris Pratt, on the other hand, has no weight, gravity or not. He delivers cotton candy. The tactic of casting 'pretty and popular' was only 50% successful.<br/><br/>Notice how good Laurence Fishburne was? Imagine if it had been he that woke her up. Yeah, creepy, I know, but it would have been much deeper. And I would have cared, instead of wishing some 'eat 'em one by one' alien would've shown up."

","If you were a lady who woke-up out of cryo-sleep early on a big starship, and found the only other person around was a creepy white dude who has read all about you. What would be your natural reaction? Well the mostly male writers at Hollywood, having clearly never met a human female in real life, seem to think a woman in this situation would immediately assume the guy has nothing to hide and start screwing him.<br/><br/>She doesn't investigate, she doesn't try to wake-up anyone else. She doesn't try to find out why the pods malfunctioned. She doesn't check the other pods systematically to see if this guy is a serial killer who is waking-up and killing off female passengers. (which would actually be a more interesting plot.) Nope, she just hooks up with him like there is nothing weird or creepy at all about his situation.<br/><br/>And then when a robot tells her that the guy woke her up intentionally, what does she do? Keep it to herself, form a plan. Nope. Hollywood thinks that all women do is throw tantrums. Because apparently in this world women are not afraid at all of being stranded alone in space with a mentally unstable impulsive man. She isn't afraid at all that if he knows, she knows, he might do something even more insane.<br/><br/>So of course while these dip-sticks have been prancing about playing with toys, instead of using their brains to investigate their problems, the ship starts to loose power. At this point, conveniently a commander who actually has some intelligence is brought out of cryo-sleep. (something the creepy-guy could have done at the start of the film if he had had even a tiny amount of perseverance to get the doors of the command deck open.) The commander is like, ""why have you guys been messing about for two years while the ship is falling apart?"". Then dies form cryo poisoning or some bull-dust.<br/><br/>At this point the creep and the dumb-blonde put their differences aside to mend the ship and save their asses. Which they somehow manage to do despite, zero technical training. I mean I'm assuming starships are a little more complex than just, switching it off and back on again right? Not in Hollywood they ain't.<br/><br/>Due to some minor tension when the guy has to open a vent, Blondie forgives him entirely for ruining her life and bounces back into his arms. They discover that a medical pod can put one of them back into cryo-sleep for the rest of the journey, thus saving them from a life of loneliness. At this point we are expected to believe that the crazy creepy guy, who just risked everything to save his own skin,(he wasn't doing it for the 5000 passengers that's for sure) gives up the pod to Blondie.<br/><br/>Now this is the only part of the film that is plausible. Blondie refuses to go into cryo-sleep, which is 100% in-line with her character of a person who makes really poor decisions based entirely on emotion. (Any other person would have vented the creep out of an airlock, and enjoyed a nice fat book deal at the end of their cryo-sleep.)"

I think they made a pretty good pair. Jennifer Lawrence is an intriguing actress.... she's not a ""bombshell"", kind of like the girl next door. I've liked her in everything I've seen her in and I like her in person as well. She's a hoot.<br/><br/>A lot of whoop-la was made about Michael Sheen's performance as Arthur (the robot). I don't think he holds a candle to Michael Fassbender's David in 'Prometheus'. He wasn't bad though.<br/><br/>Of course we get a Morphius appearance. Laurence Fishboure did fine as Gus. I was kind of waiting for a blue pill/red pill inject. lol<br/><br/>The question is posed of course.... what would you do? Would you break and awaken someone to live your life with; condemning them to a life of solitude? .... or would you tough it out and die alone? Would you commit suicide?<br/><br/>One different ending could have been for Jim not to have been rescued after opening the hatch leaving Aurora to have to make the same decision. That would have been a tough one.<br/><br/>I like the ""happy ending"" we got here.

I was expecting some kind of a plot twist that never happened. Once you found out what was going on with the ship it was a very routine and predictable story line. Bad script choice by what are normally fine actors. The ending was lame and hard to believe. Not worth your, time pass this one by.

","First, having a Cinderella story in space does not make it Sci-Fi. Second, I think Jennifer Lawrence is a fine actress, a very rich actress, and certainly did not need to make this pile of junk. I guess the film cost $110 million because of her salary and points. Good for her. Getting rich is the American Way.<br/><br/>But unless you LIKE old Disney movies fluffed up into poor CGI and hurled into space and, after stealing the bar set from the shining and making the 'prince' a futuristic plumber, well, then skip the movie.<br/><br/>If I didn't like my freedom, I would have hurled something heavy and pointed at the screen during the last thirty seconds of the film.<br/><br/>Spoiler: the end should have contained hundreds of live people besides a Disney set of trees and birds and friggin butterflies (well, hyperbole aside). If they were the only two people alive hundreds of years before their intended 'wake up' time, they would have woken up more and started making babies. The ending should have included LOTS of live people running around the ship. But Noooooo...we are to just assume the two lovers got old and watched each other croak.

"CineMuseFilms","5","9","19","7 January 2017"," What could have been a great sci-fi ends up a rom-com space opera mashup.
","The term mashup is not usually a compliment. It means mixing different genres in a way that looks interesting, gets a laugh, or makes a mess. It is unlikely the sci-fi rom-com melodrama Passengers (2016) intended to be a mashup but that is the result. If it stayed on-track as sci-fi, all the ingredients are present for an outstanding film but box-office considerations require a love story with a moral dilemma so the film ends up a mess.<br/><br/>We are aboard an intergalactic spacecraft for a 120-year voyage as part of a commercial outer- world migration venture. The ship's set and digital effects are some of the best seen on film in years, conveying an enormity of scale and futuristic design that is mesmerising. Five thousand volunteers are ensconced in hibernation pods en route to capitalism's version of eternal paradise when one traveller, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 90 years too soon. Travelling through space with every conceivable luxury at your fingertips, worry-free for the rest of your life, sounds appealing but the problem is that he gets lonely and conversation is very limited with an android bartender. After a year of flying solo he is on the verge of flushing himself into the cosmos, when suddenly he becomes obsessed with sleeping beauty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and believes he has found true love.<br/><br/>Of course true love is never that simple. He first must grapple with the moral horrors of his predicament: does let her sleep in peace for another 90 years so she can live in paradise with the 4,998 other passengers or does he do what the male species has been known to do sometimes and wake her up for some fun. The film trailers make the answer obvious, but when Aurora finds out that Jim was being selfish, she throws a galactic hissy-fit and the film turns into a domestic melodrama with more flashing stars than outer space. She refuses his every advance until the spaceship's gizmos turn wobbly. Forget feminism: a girl needs a guy when things get toughbut let's not go there.<br/><br/>All the potential evident in the early part of the film is frittered away in a silly 'romance on the rocks' space opera, where it becomes a philosophical debate on which gender is capable of the greater quantum of selfishness. Pratt and Lawrence are really quite watchable in spite of the script, the filming is very entertaining, and the whole love scenario would have been interesting in someone's earthly kitchen but not on the most advanced galactic odyssey ever undertaken. But if you enjoy turbulent romance in unusual places this is your film. <br/><br/>AUTHOR: www.cinemusefilms.com"

","Passengers is a simple story of two people stranded on a desert island who get in love because there is nobody else available nearby. That sums it up, but the official plot line is the following: in a not too near future Earth is overcrowded (surprise surprise) and a big corporation offers the opportunity (at high price) to go to live on new terraformed planets. As they don't FTL most of the travel has to be done in cryogenic stasis on the space equivalent of a transatlantic. They are supposed to stay asleep for 120 years, but the impact with an asteroid 30 years after the departure causes a lot of tiny malfunctioning, including one chamber. A mechanical engineer is awaken on the ghost ship, he doesn't have access to the bridge of the chambers of the crew, the automatic robots on the ship are of no help and the most human face is the android of the lounge bar. After one year of getting mad he decides to awake another passenger, an attractive journalist, without of course telling her he has done on purpose, as in every relation based on a lie everything goes great until she finds out the truth...in the meantime the small malfunctioning escalate until the entire ship is in danger of self destruction... I don't think it's necessary to add anything else, while a fan of sci-fi movies of the same type (in particular Pandorum, a forgotten movie from years ago deals with the same scenario in more horror way and it's way superior to passengers) I found this film disappointing at best. The entire premise of the movie, that a company will build a completely automatized ship that doesn't allow to return in stasis, is simply ludicrous for a mechanical engineer (like me) used to work with the concept of ""risk assessment"", the right solution for these scenarios are to wake up at least some members of the crew to check the ship and let them return in stasis once they are sure everything goes fine. The idea of not letting anybody to access to the vital systems of the ship is simply criminal, but it's a plot device to allow the love story to go on. The cast indeed is good, Lawrence is a great actress and fills the screen even in stupid movies like this one, his sidekick is also good, Fishburne is the best even if he has less screen time, and also, and Sheen perfect in the role of the android barman, even if I find his weasel smile quite untrustworthy and I was always thinking he would have tried to kill the protagonists sooner or later. In conclusion as a sci-fi movie is awful and disappointing, but I assume the female audience will love that. As I already written, I would recommend to watch the lesser known Pandorum, an office flop but a more satisfying movie all around."

","A spacecraft is on a 120 year voyage from Earth to an alternate planet called Homestead 2. The passengers and crew have all being put in a form of cryosleep or an extended period of hibernation for the journey and both crew and passengers are supposed to wake up a few months before they arrive at Homestead 2. However, due to a malfunction with a couple of hibernation chambers a few people on board end up waking up 90 years earlier than they should do...<br/><br/>Passengers has a fairly interesting premise and on paper it should have been a fairly thrilling and suspenseful ride. However, the way it is actually executed falls a long way short of where it needs to be in order for it to work in its entirety...<br/><br/>There were a number of issues that I with this film; the fact that the film is pretty much devoid of suspense, tension or any kind of intensity for around 2/3 of its running time means that for most of the film you'll see Chris Pratt wandering round the ship (how he manages to navigate his way round it with such ease is anyone's guess). Lawrence and Pratt making doe-eyes at each other, they'll go to the bar together - rather creepily the bar and barman reminded me of the bar and barman in The Shining - was this deliberate or was this just me that thought this?<br/><br/>The narrative is also a little weak; we don't learn much about the ship, or much about where everyone is going and their reasons for going. The romance between Lawrence and Pratt is unconvincing (this is even before she learns that he woke her up). I also couldn't get on board (no pun intended) with the idea of the ship actually needing a crew at all... I mean why were they there? The passengers that were awoken early seemed to be able to function without them and the ship was filled with high-tech computers and holograms that seemed to be able to assist the passengers anyway. For my recollection I don't recall the crew actually doing anything at the end to make themselves feel needed (although I was starting to switch off toward the end truth be told).<br/><br/>Still it isn't all bad, the film has some exciting moments in its final third, the special effects are pretty good and Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both very good in their respective roles - although I would say that their acting chemistry is much stronger than their romantic chemistry.<br/><br/>All told, Passengers lacks suspense, tension, intensity, and with underwritten characters and a rather poorly explained story you'll probably find yourself getting a very meagre return on the near 2 hours of your life that you'll spend watching this film."

Suddenly the corkscrewing vessel goes through an asteroid field shorting out his cryo-pod and waking him too early. He becomes distraught to discover he's got 90 years left of his journey. He eventually accepts his fate, but after a while he gets lonely to the brink of suicide. So after browsing through her video blogs, he decides to wake up Aurora played by Lawrence. Gradually as the film goes on they start falling for each other and by this point, it does start to feel like Titanic in space. <br/><br/>Director Morten Tyldum does his best with Prometheus' John Spaihts script (which was on Hollywoods Blacklist for 10 years) He keeps the film eerie and atmospheric with the sterile lighting of the interior, and the sometimes haunting music score by Thomas Newman. It tones down on the overused comedic acting we are so accustomed to from the two lead actors, especially Pratt. There is some good chemistry between the two leads and the visual effects look great. <br/><br/>However It does have its flaws, one being the fact that it lacks originality. It doesn't quite reach the tension levels of the films it's inspired by from Moon, The Shinning and Alien just to name a few. Martin Sheens android has a scene where he malfunctions which is very reminiscent to Alien. The obvious one of course is 2001: A Space Odyssey, from the rotating corridors and the overall set designs. The first half is great, the middle section is okay and the third act falls flat leaving you waiting for more as it wraps up too suddenly. Overall Passengers is a good way to pass 2 hours of your time."
"Mork_the_Borg","10","5","9","11 January 2017"," Finally - we're back to making proper Science Fiction movies
","Wow... wow... and again wow! Finally a movie that's so much better than expected. Not another prequel, sequel, or whatever-quel, but something new, something creative, something exciting and something very well made indeed.<br/><br/>Great actors (still hugely overpaid though), great acting, great special effects, great story, and excellent plot.<br/><br/>Okay, so I'm a huge Science Fiction fanatic, and movies including Passengers, Bring Him Home and Interstellar show that it's perfectly well possible to make great S.F. without the need for another cash- cow sequel, prequel, and yeah, horrible-quel. Please NO MORE Star Wars movies!<br/><br/>The good thing is that this movie somehow creates a believable atmosphere, and seen on the big screen, you'll often have the feeling you're travelling on the Avalon with the actors. Hahaha... I was thinking Spaceship Titanic (Douglas Adams) every now and then, especially with the various robots depicted, but that was only positive as clearly this movie reminded me of some good S.F. books.<br/><br/>Anyway, hope to see more good S.F. movies in 2017. This has been a perfect start!"
"sarah-dunleavy1","10","5","9","11 January 2017"," My New Favorite Movie
","I was most impressed with Passengers' depth of story line and plot through the use of only three characters (four if you count the Android played so elegantly by Michael Sheen.) It had all of the struggles that come with the human condition portrayed in a glamorous, yet intimidating setting. The successful characterization and use of internal and external conflicts lead to an amazing plot and well-developed themes.<br/><br/>It has loneliness, wonder, hope, lust, and fear all within a visually STUNNING setting.<br/><br/>The main character, a simple-minded mechanic named Jim was portrayed convincingly by Chris Pratt. The chemistry that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence shared, rivaled that of Jennifer Lawrence & Bradley Cooper in ""Silver Linings Playbook."" Jennifer's depth of emotion made Passengers convincing on so many levels. My new favorite movie."
"houghtonetet","9","5","9","9 January 2017"," Well acted and beautifully presented
","I went to see this film not sure of what to expect, other than the basic ""Robinson Crusoe"" concept of a man stranded on a long journey in space. I knew the critics had panned it but the visuals looked great in the trailer<br/><br/>Passengers turned out to be a simple but beautiful movie carried effortlessly by the two leads. This is not an action adventure movie, rather a study of humanity and how people react when given extreme choices. I thought the acting was first class – Jennifer Lawrence surely has to get an Oscar Nomination for this – the ship was luxurious and well-appointed, and was of an intriguing design.<br/><br/>I can see why it has been criticised – there is a surprising lack of fail-safe and emergency procedures in the event of calamity; I didn't understand why any Passenger couldn't be returned to suspended animation once awakened; and even I spotted that Arcturus couldn't be reached in 30 years if the Avalon is travelling at half the speed of light.<br/><br/>These plot-holes do not detract from the effectiveness and enjoyment of the film, though. Its 116 minutes slipped by effortlessly and I felt that my admission had been well spent.<br/><br/>Highly recommended – 9/10"
"ruggerodallasanta","8","5","9","9 January 2017"," A brave movie that presents a challenging moral dilemma without shying away from the consequences
","I watched Passengers yesterday and liked it a lot. It's not a perfect movie, but I was quite disturbed by some of the reviews I read. Some call it an ""interstellar version of social-media stalking"", or ""a creepy ode to manipulation"".<br/><br/>I don't agree at all with these views and frankly I find that these comments say a lot more about our society today, so quick to judge and point fingers, than to the movie in itself, which has many flaws but manages to present a moral dilemma very well and doesn't shy away from the gravity of it.<br/><br/>Passengers could have been a banal and controversy-free film very easily: if the two characters had just been woken up together by mistake, we would have spent the movie watching them slowly fall in love while saving the ship. Instead, the filmmakers had the courage to present an incredibly interesting choice and its consequences.<br/><br/>The key point of the criticism is the fact that Chris Pratt's character Jim decides to wake up Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora from hibernation, in order to have someone else to share a lifetime of otherwise loneliness with. On top of that, in the end, she falls in love with him and forgives what he's done.<br/><br/>Now, if I read what I just wrote, I admit there's a part of me wanting to judge this story as creepy and outright bad, but luckily I gave the filmmakers a chance and went to see the movie with an open mind. And I wasn't creeped out at all because the movie does an incredibly good job at putting us in Jim's shoes.<br/><br/>Here is exactly where I think most of those who condemn the movie fail: if I honestly imagine myself in Jim's situation (ie. condemned to a lifetime of loneliness), I do believe that eventually I would give in and wake someone up. And what's best is that we are completely part of Jim's dilemma: he knows it's wrong and he does his best not to give in. But in the end, after over a YEAR of solitude with the prospect of the rest of his life being the same, he wakes up the woman he has gotten to know through her writing and videos, and whom he thinks he loves.<br/><br/>So is this a justification for stalkers and manipulators? NO. It's not because stalkers and manipulators HAVE a real alternative, Jim doesn't. Stalkers and manipulators lack the ability to really sympathise with their victims and see them as objects, Jim doesn't.<br/><br/>He's a man that does something terrible and never once during the movie does he think what he did was right. He then tries to confess, but is so lost in the happiness he found that he can't even bring himself to do that.<br/><br/>Does this mean we should feel bad for stalkers everywhere? NO. It's a clever investigation of the human soul, of what we are capable of when pushed to the limit and of how important human interaction is to our very survival.<br/><br/>Aurora's character arc is just as engaging and Lawrence's reaction when she learns the truth is brilliantly heartbreaking, result of great acting combined with great directing, so once again we feel the whole weight of Jim's action, just as both of them do.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie is spent with Jim trying to make amends for what he did and Aurora slowly learning to understand why he did it and finally accepting it.<br/><br/>I'm the first to admit that the second half of the movie, and the whole third act in particular, would have maybe worked better without the big action sequences, and that most of what happens feels convenient in giving Jim occasions to show his heroism to Aurora. I also personally would have preferred an ending where she chooses to go back to sleep. But these are just my own ideas, the movie and the character arcs work as they are and don't feel forced.<br/><br/>So, is this a justification of manipulation, like saying 'it's okay as long as she accepts it at the end?' NO. Again, because of the extreme situation these characters find themselves into, casting a simplistic judgment on their actions and emotions is both meaningless and naive. Aurora takes over a year and goes through everything that happens in the action- packed third act to arrive at a point where she decides that she loves Jim IN SPITE of what he did.<br/><br/>Condemning Jim for waking Aurora up and Aurora for falling in love with him in spite of that means choosing to be blind to everything that happens in between those moments, and it also means being blind to the reality of human life: that even horrible things can be forgiven, though of course this is not a justification for committing horrible things in the first place.<br/><br/>If we compare Passengers with movies like the Twilight saga or Fifty Shades of Grey, it becomes evident how Passengers is light-years ahead of the other two. While Mr. Grey's clear, real-life stalking and manipulation is presented as an example of romance, Jim's weakness is human and sad as only great characters can be.<br/><br/>I think the main problem people have with this movie is the fact that it's an intelligent movie WHILE ALSO being a big crowd-pleasing sci-fi blockbuster. If the same story had been made with unknown actors, a moodier tone and half the budget, how many of those reviewers on their high horses would have instead praised it?"
"ilchenko-pravo","10","5","9","9 January 2017"," Very good romantic story in space. Also great acting and directing
","This film is very touching. But you need to take yourself to the right mood. You need to see at the opening scenes and imagine yourself into the movie. Cold. cold space. Terrible emptiness, no way to get home, no way to contact home. And than you will feel a loneliness of the main protagonist. His desperation. His action is so human, it is quite simple to understand him. And love-line... you actually wish them happiness. Two lonely souls finds happiness despite crazy situation. I must say that I really hold my breath during scenes near the end. I actually fear that there will be bitter ending. And the ending was actually sweet with a few bitter drops. Also acting is supreme and directing is quite good. Also, 3d in space-movie? Always good. So my results: pretty good romance/drama in sci-fy setting. Intimate. Sweet. Good for watching with your girlfriend. Also very fast pacing - not a single dull moment. Also show why the age of professional critics is over. They don't write truth, they don't write according to viewers standards. They write according to critics community standards. They write with political agenda, current popular trend in mind. They find politics where there is none. They watch for plot holes without understanding a concept of suspension of disbelief. People are watching movies so go read viewers reports."
"oscaralbert","9","5","9","3 January 2017"," The economics of space colonization . . .
",". . .are touted once again in PASSENGERS, as they were a few years back during AVATAR. Jennifer Lawrence, as journalist ""Aurora Lane,"" estimates during PASSENGERS that America's first colonized planet boosted our Gross National Product (GNP) by $8 quadrillion (that is, by about 8,000,000,000,000,000 bucks), which is more than enough to upgrade our nuclear weapons arsenal while also fully funding ObamaCare, not to mention fixing our infrastructure by replacing every lead water pipe with gold and repaving every mile of our Interstate Highways with Titanium. As a side benefit, most of these New Earths Colonists will be bored Rich People, according to PASSENGERS. Just think how much better off America will be when the sort of billionaire bozos making up White House Resident-Elect Rump's Cabinet are instead put into ""Hibernation"" for 249 of the next 250 years, so that they can spend the remaining 12 months touring a Planet Far Far Away.

"vinylvanilla","8","5","9","3 January 2017"," A great movie about life choices and moral dilemmas
","Critics are bashing this movie because apparently they did not understand the purpose of this movie. THIS IS NOT SCI-FI. If you're expecting a SCI-FI movie, or something similar to ""Gravity"", forget it. THIS IS NOT SCI-FI. This is not a movie about the adventure of being in space<br/><br/>Actually, this is a PSYCHOLOGICAL THRILLER/DRAMA that happens in space. And for being a psychological thriller, it's actually a wonderful movie. If you happened to enjoy ""Moon"" featuring Sam Rockwell, you'll definitely like this one. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's performances usually annoy me a little for being a little prepotent, but in ""Passengers"" she brings a leap of fresh air with her natural, unpretentious acting. You can see she matured a lot and her acting has improved by leaps and bounds, and she's no longer annoying like she used to be, she's growing into a great actress right now. <br/><br/>I was also very positively surprised by Chris Pratt's performance. I have always seen the potential he had to be a great actor apart from being mostly a action movie stud. But in this movie, his acting skills are shown, and they don't disappoint. His emotions are natural and visceral, his acting is mature and convincing, and, in my opinion, deserves an Academy Award nomination. You can see he clearly worked very hard to play this character, and he deserves recognition for that. Unfortunately, I think this movie will be ignored by the Academy, since the Academy follows a lot the rules of the critics. <br/><br/>The cinematography of the movie is superb, with beautiful love scenes between Lawrence and Pratt. Also, Michael Sheen and Laurence Fishburne surprises with their adorable, great, essential cameos, like cherries on the top of a sundae. <br/><br/>This is not a light-hearted movie, or an action movie about life in space. This is a movie about moral dilemmas, life choices, loving and being loved, and, most of all, forgiveness. The ending, which was actually unexpected in a way, made me smile and pity the characters a little at the same time, for being so innocent, such dreamers. This is a beautiful movie, that goes deep into our emotions, and if you have ever had a dream or loved someone, you'll understand its deepness and meaning."
"mathesis","7","5","9","3 January 2017"," Better than I expected.
","A somewhat underrated movie at the moment. In my opinion it offers great acting, spectacular CGI settings and costume, while the plot and some of the characters' decisions are it's greatest weaknesses. Ethical themes ranging from the corporate dictatorship the ship might represent, selfishness, self sacrifice, personal power and forgiveness are dealt with to varying degrees. I found it interesting to see some of the likely complications of privatized space travel touched on. Consumer rights facilitating class divisions (re food). Intellectual property rights (re hibernation tech). A lack of safety measures based on marketing claims of infallibility."
"ldquinn","7","5","9","2 January 2017"," Very Enjoyable SciFi Movie
","Forget some of the lackluster reviews - this is a very enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours and it worth the trip to the big screen.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are enjoyable to watch and the story is not as far fetched as it may seem to some reviewers. Traveling through space, alone, figuring out how to live life in such a lonesome environment.<br/><br/>Early on, I had the impression that Jennifer Lawrence may not have been fully involved; but, after her first scene or two, that feeling disappeared and she delivered her usual excellence.<br/><br/>Head to the theater, get a big tub of popcorn, sit back, and enjoy a couple of hours of good escapism."

","This movie's first half was fantastic. It's second half, particularly the last part, was very over the top. Let's just say that they should have made that spaceship of whatever Chris Pratt is made from in this movie and nothing would have happened to that ship. All in all, a very fun movie, with reasonably well fleshed out characters (for a Hollywood movie I mean), and a good solid story that is thought out well enough to carry the movie and keep you as a viewer interested most of the time. I would also recommend this to people who normally do not like sci-fi (like me), because of the thriller element. That keeps the movie interesting enough even if you are not into epic space ships, etc."
"tonyhaines-spp","9","5","9","2 January 2017"," This science nerd liked it!
","Some of the early reviews waved off this movie for it's lack of ""plausible science"". I beg to differ. I had way more issues with Interstellar. Passengers is a complete movie, executed perfectly. You will not hate yourself for buying a ticket. For me Passengers is a ""next-day"" movie, I'm still thinking about it the day after. The effects are perfect. The script is organic and at times funny. The story is compelling. The acting was excellent. It's a movie that has something for everyone, not just sci-fi nerds. I'm glad I saw this movie!<br/><br/>There are few Hollywood movies that depict the laws of nature perfectly. The movies that get science right tend to be stiff and pedantic. Films that abandon science tend to be goofy comic book fair. There seems to be a trade off, give up science for story. Passengers is the perfect blend for me."
"aharmas","9","5","9","1 January 2017"," A Few Years to Go
","Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, a pair made in heaven--two actors with enough chemistry and charm to burn pull this off. ""Passengers"" gives us the premise that it's possible to make it through years of solitude or spending the rest of your life with another person without causing body harm to each other, or killing your audience with a trite and boring script. The audience makes it safely to the end of the story, and it's an exciting and imaginative ride.<br/><br/>Pratt and Lawrence are the main stars here, carrying 90% of the film. Nevertheless, they get some help from two solid actors Michael Sheen and Lawrence Fishbourne. Their roles are small but key to the main twists. It's always a pleasure to see good actors do good work.<br/><br/>Because of unexpected complications, Pratt is awakened from hibernation way too early on his route to the colonization of a new planet. A consequence of this event is that he must now endure 90 years of solitude and will probably die alone on route. Being a flawed human, he reaches the point when he considers ending this problem, but he's charmed by a vision of the perfect mate, and matters become even more complicated as she awakens, too.<br/><br/>We need a complication to make the plot more dramatic, and Lawrence soon realizes that there might be more to her hibernation ending. Simultaneously, electrical and computer functions begin to be affected by some unknown failure. It soon becomes clear that the trip might be cut short for all of the people on the ship, and it's up to our heroes to make things right.<br/><br/>Much of the action is relegated to the end of the film, and it works. There are some tributes to films like ""Gravity"" and ""2001"", whether intentional or accidental, it doesn't matter. Maybe it shows just how visionary both of those films were. This genre is also benefiting from the more sophisticated special effects that can be added to create new and incredible settings for this type of story.<br/><br/>None of this would work without the fine acting by Lawrence. She doesn't disappoint at all, bringing a complex character to life. She's a dreamer, a person who has managed to see herself as successful, who knows she has the skills to do it, but she is also a human being with needs and a past that can now make all the difference. She's resourceful and self-reliant; however she knows when it's time to ask for help, and all of this is beautifully demonstrated in her acting, which demands both emotional and physical dedication.<br/><br/>Pratt is growing as an actor and hold his own against Lawrence. As I said before, their chemistry is palpable, and it doesn't hurt that both are very good looking and look amazing running around the ship or getting dressed up for a date.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" might not change the history of cinema; still it shows there's still room for many new entries in Science Fiction, as long as they are done with care and skill. There's hope for the future."
"RNMorton","9","5","9","1 January 2017"," Very very nice
","I'm not going to say anything you wouldn't know from the trailer. Lawrence and Pratt, both attractive leads, are unexpectedly awake on an interstellar colony ship where all passengers and crew are supposed to be in hibernation. And it's good they're around, because Houston there's some problems. What I like best is the beautiful scenes of space and the pacing of this movie, it takes its time letting you appreciate the strange surroundings including a wonderful Sheen as Arthur the bartender. My wife says this is combination sci-fi and chick flick, and who am I to disagree with her? That's all I care to say about this at the moment except I like the wrap up. Enjoy."
"heidilaursen","9","5","9","1 January 2017"," Fascinating storyline, great writing/acting, beautiful scenes
","I rarely watch a movie that stays in my head or that I want to watch again. But this film had all the components: engaging storyline, compelling acting, beautiful scenes. <br/><br/>The story was somewhere between a techno-future retelling of Adam and Eve and great love story. The idea of moving to a new colony planet, why a person would do that and the challenges characters face when their hybernation is interrupted, along the human struggle when met with a lifetime of solitude made the story very compelling. <br/><br/>I've never seen Chris Pratt before, but his acting was excellent in this role. It's as much a psychological/human story as it is sci-fi. I found the ethical dilemma center to the story to be believable, and the ending. It's not a simple girl chooses guy/love, if that's how you see Aurora's character, you're not paying attention. She does write the epic story with a 5,000 passenger captive audience (and everyone back on earth since it's the first time anything like this happened on a colony ship), she just doesn't get to enjoy the fame; it isn't what she planned, which is one of the themes that resonates."

","The movie Passengers directed by Morten Tyldum (liked Imitation game) is fun, fast and interesting with a very pleasant and good looking pair Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora and Chris Pratt as Jim. I enjoyed the concept of time and distance between earth and space and truly enjoyed starship Avalon and journey to planet Homestead II... it was fun to watch a dead human get into supine position and get revived when all emergency procedures are done simultaneously. It was really enjoyable to watch Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt enjoying dates in space and could actually see the love between them when isolated from all mankind without any competition or anyone around for comparison and no room to cheat on each other because they are the only humans awake and dependent on each other. Terrific romantic scenes and both Aurora and Jim had excellent chemistry between them. It is the journey and destination that makes Passengers have a great time and enjoy .

"njdaymond89","7","8","17","22 December 2016"," Ignore the overly biased reviews, this is what it is:
","CGI - 8.5/10. Acting - 7/10. Script - 6.5/10.<br/><br/>No Spoilers.<br/><br/>Well first things first, the trailer revealed far too much and was a total misrepresentation of the films pace - the action sequences are confined to the last 35 or so minutes, but this isn't a bad thing at ALL. The previous hour and 10 mins is exploration of the situation our characters find themselves in, the human condition, and decent character development. I'd describe this film as a romance action drama with undertones of suspense, set in space.<br/><br/>CGI -- The amount of money spent on the CGI almost tricks you into thinking that you're watching an action movie from start to finish, it's incredibly well done! Polished and presented beautifully, with enough detail to transport you right onto the star-ship, and keep you there. Some great external shots with two particularly awe-inspiring moments.<br/><br/>ACTING -- The acting was good throughout. I say 7/10 because I know that both actors are capable of more (aimed toward Chris Pratt more than Jennifer Lawrence). Whilst the script also held them back somewhat, there was still room for them both to shine at different points - two very specific scenes stand out, rising above the clichés that we're normally fed. But unfortunately, there were also clichés...<br/><br/>THE SCRIPT -- It ALMOST escapes that intellectually removed dark void of Hollywood influence, and is indeed buried nicely under pretty pictures, pretty actors and pretty action, but it does drip through in a few places. So we get an occasionally cheesy romance drama in space, rather than anything *truly* deep and meaningful, like Interstellar gave us. The redemption to this is an intriguing moral dilemma that most of the good scenes are attributed with, and the first 20 mins of the film which I can't describe without spoilers.<br/><br/>KNOW WHAT YOU'RE WATCHING -- It's definitely not as terrible as some reviewers are implying, you just need to understand what you're going to be watching (which, again, was misrepresented by the trailer and likely the cause for most poor reviews). It IS good for what it is. It succeeds at making you question a thing or two, laugh a few times and has enjoyable characters, but not a huge amount more. Also, it may be set in space but seen through the eyes of a true Sci-Fi aficionado, absoluteellyyyy nothing of significant grandiosity occurs. The trade off is that a Sci-Fi fan will still enjoy this film for it's CGI and futuristic setting, but it's also open for the typical girlfriend-boyfriend movie night.<br/><br/>CONCLUSION THEN... -- Overall, Passengers works, doing almost everything it seemed to try and do. You should see it at the cinema if you have the chance. The CGI alone make it worth it - the ship was like an extra character in the film, somewhat literally! Just try and understand what this film is first."

Michael Sheen adds acting class, with Lawrence Fishburne bringing his usual gravitas. Andy Garcia is in the credits but most of his role appears to have ended up on the cutting room floor.<br/><br/>The plot is a slow burner and rightly so. It also contains a genuine moral quandary which leaves you wondering what you would do in a similar situation.

","I believe that this was a good film, the performances were solid and the visuals were quite good too. The best performance probably from Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur. <br/><br/>Despite all the comments on how this film does not utilize the idea of isolation and confinement well and that the romance in this film overtakes the more important theme of this film I enjoyed it, here's why. I thought that Passengers discusses a very important and age long question, the question of sacrificing your own well being or to sacrifice another's in order to fulfill your own. It's a very deep and thought provoking question that I believe the film possess very well. <br/><br/>I thought that the themes of isolation and the romance between the characters were not overpowering each other and were well balanced by splitting it by acts. The film was suspenseful as our characters unravel the causes to the mysterious malfunctioning of the film and the empty atmosphere created by the film was really well realised as well. <br/><br/>I felt that the characters were sympathetic and they made very rational and reasonable decisions unlike what early reviews have described as, ""creepy"". <br/><br/>Of Course it lacked in some parts in terms of its rationality but this is always a thing that bugs some and doesn't at all bother others. I can be either of those people at times and I did find that certain points in this film were irrational in my opinion however are points that can be gotten over with. <br/><br/>So I recognise that there are flaws in this film but it is a solid entry and an enjoyable watch that has been trampled over by the critics."

This movie is mostly for people who want to see Jennifer Lawrence and whats his name naked. Or Jennifer Lawrence in a bathing suit. Lawrence Fishburn shows up for about 15 minutes. Just enough to move the story along but for just one second you think he could have added a different angle to the sinister part of the story, but no. All in all Id rather watch 'Fobidden Planet"" with Robbie the robot."

","""Passengers"" is not a film that you can really talk about in much depth without straying into spoiler territory: so this is the shortened non- spoiler version. (If you have seen the film and want the fuller discussion of the contentious points, go to bob-the-movie-man.com). , so <br/><br/>The backdrop for ""Passengers"" is the spaceship ""Avalon"", on a 120 year trip taking Earth colonists to the new world of ""Homestead 2"". Following an 'incident' the story finds two individuals – Jim Preston, played by Chris ""Jurassic World"" Pratt, and Jennifer ""Joy"" Lawrence – as the only passengers awake on the automated ship among 5000+ other slumbering souls. It rather goes without saying that with two attractive and bankable Hollywood stars and nothing else to do, the two 'get it on'. With things on the ship going from bad to worse, the two must work as a team to try to save the ship, crew and fellow passengers from disaster.<br/><br/>As a fan of sci-fi, I'll start with a positive that the Avalon is a gloriously rendered spacecraft, and many of the scenes of space walking present beautiful cinematography (by Rodrigo Prieto of ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Argo""). Many of the other special effects in the film – led by special effects supervisor Daniel Sudick, of the Marvel franchise – are spectacularly good, especially one which demonstrates why the lifeguards closed the pool on the International Space Station! <br/><br/>The overall premise of the film is also original and well-conceived, setting up the backdrop for some serious post-watch ethical debate (see the spoiler section on bob-the-movie-man.com).<br/><br/>Where the wheels came off for me though is with the script by Jon Spaihts (""Prometheus"", ""Doctor Strange""). Some of the dialogue is just appallingly trite, and some of the supposed capabilities of our hero, Preston, are laughable. For example, he possesses an uncanny ability as ""an engineer"" to open a cabinet of electronics, scan the circuits and say ""Nope – that all looks fine"": the next time my washing machine controller packs in, he's going to be on my speed-dial for sure! And (cue trite line – ""every component on the ship has a spare"") Preston immediately finds the required part (curiously, it's right next to the failing component and not in Bay 67 on cargo deck 327!) and knows how to plug and play it as required.<br/><br/>But, for me, there was one particularly dire point in the script where Spaihts obviously forgets which film he's writing the scene for and 'goes superhero': oh, hang on, Preston doesn't HAVE any superhero powers! For me, any goodwill the story had built up through to that point get vented into space. <br/><br/>The director is Morten Tyldum, whose ""Headhunters"" I really enjoyed but who is probably more famous for ""The Imitation Game"". Not overawed by the production's scale, he does a great job of getting good performances out of the rather wooden action hunk that is Chris Pratt and the reliable Oscar-winner Jennifer Lawrence who (apart from one dramatic and emotional scene) the script doesn't really stretch. Michael Sheen is also a great watch as the witty and dry android bar-tender.<br/><br/>In summary, this was a nice premise with great special effects and gorgeous production design, but frustratingly let down with a weak screenplay. With a better script and another 10% of tweaking, this could have been a real sci-fi classic."

","From the beginning, I had low expectations of Passengers due to the swath of bad reviews emanated from multiple sources. However, I did find that the film excelled past this barrier only to find a steep cliff of mediocrity that it dove off near the middle of the movie. Featuring an all-star cast of Chris Pratt, J.Law, and Laurence Fishburne, here I will be delving into my thoughts about the new sci-fi film Passengers. On the 5,000 person-keeping ship the Avalon, Chris Pratt or ""Jim Preston"" finds himself awake 90 years earlier than the scheduled de-hibernation as the ship travels toward a new inhabitable planet. Within minutes, he finds that he is the only woke passenger on board. Shortly, Preston finds himself enjoying the luxuries of the ship having gotten past his anguish about the malfunction. However, he succumbs to loneliness quickly, as a robotic bartender and roombas that vacuum cheerios are unable to keep a man company. A big problem I had with the following moments of the movie was the complete and utter obstruction of a major plot point from the trailers released. Preston finds himself wandering the pod bay when he spots a beautiful young women in one of the hibernation pods. As a matter of fact, Jennifer Lawrence or ""Aurora Lane"" was woken by Preston, unlike how the plot had initially told she woke up at the same time as him. This sort of detail maneuver was only another sly way for Columbia Pictures to break into the box office. As the story progresses, not only does the plot lull, but it finds a cliché-y feel that was not present in the beginning. The main issue with Passengers is its inability to find real substance. When the main characters learn the ship is soon going to self implode, they are instantly knowledgeable of how to fix the problem. This takes essence in Chris Pratt, whose character's mechanical abilities seem to be that of superhuman. Well into the film, I lost most of my feelings for the characters due to the lack of honest development and interest. The romance between Preston and Lane ascends painstakingly quick and dissolves just as fast. Most of this was due to the completely deadbeat pace of the film, which surely progresses ""slowly and steadily"" but often suddenly escalates due to something needed to be accomplished. One thing that was to the benefit of the plot, however, were the astounding visual effects and cinematography, which are very well done by the studios at hand. There are gleaming shots of space, and brilliant CGI of the Avalon progressing through the void. Towards the end of the film, there are many turns which some would say are in the wrong direction. At points, the grandeur of the issues at hand are laughable in the way they are portrayed. Overall, Passengers combines many awkward cliché notions with a sloppy plot to become a lackluster sci-fi film for the end of the year. <br/><br/>5/10"

The tree of knowledge, the flood, the apple in the form of a bouquet of RED roses and even fire from the bowls of hell are all themes of the movie ""Passengers"".

","This is a well made film with credible performances from the two leads and with mind blowing effects. It would have been useful to have known the year or years in which it was set as the whole background to the film was one which was fantastically futuristic.

It was fast moving with plenty of suspense and for me was much superior to 'Arrival' which I'm still trying to understand. The only bit I found was not credible was the fact that there was only one medical pod for a ship with over 5000 on board. But that's a small detail. Go and see this movie, it's good."

It makes the audience not to get bored during the movie screening and able to build up curiosity about what would happen next. In other point , Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence was very outstanding on the movie. The chemistry between those 2 main character was charming. I literally couldn't ask for a better duo for this movie.<br/><br/>However, even though it's sufficiently enjoyable. the edit towards the end of the movie was rough.

What right do they have to pass moral judgment on this fictional character? <br/><br/>The only criticism I have is that the last part, where Jim risks his life to save others and Aurora brings him back and heals him was unnecessarily stretched too long. I assume it was done to create more excitement. Making it tidier/shorter by 5-7 minutes would have made the movie better. Other than that, I enjoyed it and would definitely recommend it.

I do unfortunately think they spent too much money to make this and will probably be a failure based on the amount of money made as opposed to the cost of production, which is sad.

It added character to the film and was a neat way to make the two others not completely along and be able to have them vent with the stereotypical bartender. This movie was also cheesy and unrealistic in some parts, yes it is a futuristic space movie but some parts were a little cringe worthy. I did like the twist from the trailer when Jim woke Autora up- wasn't expecting that. I also liked how it flashed forward at the end and showed the crew waking up and finding the shed they built and plants they planted, but how do the plants grow that well in a spaceship!?

Star Wars is always fun too, but teenagers are the target audience. Passengers is an adult movie, with fabulous sci-fi, tons of action plus a romantic story line. My wife really liked Passengers too, and I often drag her to movies she doesn't like so much. I read several critic reviews in advance, so knew based on that I'd like it. I mean, anything Joe Morgenstern, Christopher Orr and Chris Agar don't like is bound to be entertaining. People go to movies for different reasons. Most of the time I don't want some depressing epic saga. I don't need to be reminded how difficult life can be, but instead want to escape for a couple of hours. Passengers is such a movie. Jennifer Lawrence gave her predictably amazing performance, and Chris Pratt and Michael Sheen were solid too. The special effects were awesome - imaginative, well done and believable. The premise of the movie was believable and human. Thankfully, the theater we saw it in was packed. Not an empty seat. Several people stayed in their seats to watch the credits, and a couple people clapped. Don't believe the naysayers. This movie rocks!"

","I'm sorry for being so blunt in my summary, but those that defends the science in this movie, calling it realistic, have absolutely no idea what so ever what they are talking about.<br/><br/>The makers of this film have the balls to ""keep it real"" by only traveling at half the speed of light, yet have a human survive a nuclear fusion blast which is at a minimum of thousands of degrees Celsius. I could probably list hundreds more of these examples, my point is, this movie is hypocritical.<br/><br/>If the argument was: But this is sci-fi, anything can happen.<br/><br/>Well in this case using a rotating space craft for gravity and flying at ""only"" half the speed of light, makes absolutely no sense. Why use real science and at the same time break all the rules? I do know the answer of course. It gives them the chance to show off some fancy CGI, which is exactly what they did. To bad the CGI in this film was mediocre at best, and even if it had been award winning material, the rest of the film falls flat, making it a shipwreck in space.<br/><br/>There is a saying in the movie business: A director is never better than his last film.<br/><br/>This is going to be rough on Morten Tyldum for sure. I loved his Norwegian film ""hodejegerne/headhunters"" and his next film ""The imitation game"". Both are good movies and the world opened up to Tyldum. I saw interviews of him, i read about him, and he has several times stated he wants to tell good stories, he is not going to let himself sell out for the big studios just to make blockbusters.<br/><br/>Well, he did....<br/><br/>This movie has nothing going for it, it is a boring, slow paced, stupid, bad acted, overpriced, silly meaningless film which seem to have focused on making 12 year old girls sappy instead of actually create a film that can appeal to everyone, and not treat the older audience with a brain like morons.<br/><br/>Titanic is a opposite to this, James Cameron might have just had a basic love story at it's core, but it is his attention to details, building of characters, revolutionary vision in effects and so on that makes Titanic a movie that stands out and appeals to all ages, and he does not use cheap tricks just to show off.<br/><br/>And this acting. 30 million dollars worth. You got to be kidding me.<br/><br/>Jennifer is payed 20 million + 30% of the profits. Chris is payed 10 million.<br/><br/>And this is the performances they deliver? Holy lord almighty, Hollywood is going down the drain. These actors have given so many memorable performances before, maybe not Oscar worthy, but still, pretty good performances. And when they get this amount of money, they seem to not care, it's like they don't believe in the film.<br/><br/>Which is where i'm back at. I did hear about the troubles behind the scenes, Tyldum and Pratt had a lot of problems with each other on the set. And the movie suffers from things like this.<br/><br/>I have to blame Tyldum for taking this job, he broke his promise and made a bad film. The story and scriptwriters are also to blame. I can't really blame the producers, they are suppose to make money, and they did, so good job to them. I payed to see the film as well, after reading almost only negative reviews in the press, so i guess i kinda knew what i was getting into, i just feel like warning others.<br/><br/>Well anyways, not much of a movie review I'm afraid, more like a movie bashing for it's obvious flaws.<br/><br/>3/10 - Bad"

They are joined by Michael Sheen for a number of gently comic scenes set in a bar that comes straight out of Kubrick's THE SHINING. Gradually the references to other movies start to accumulate. 2001 A SPACE ODYSSEY, ALIEN, SILENT RUNNING and GRAVITY all make appearances.

The script from Jon Spaihts expends all goodwill at an alarming rate as the unravelling plot takes us down the blandest and most uninspired rabbit hole imaginable, the biggest enigma being why in the world Pratt and Lawrence signed on for such a rote adventure. Worst of all, it gets dumb. Really, really dumb. And lazy. After emphasising over and over again how *insert machine/equipment/etc* can't possibly *insert problem/mishap/etc*, guess what? Turns out it can just because. A few gravity-loss scenes are impressive and showcase Norwegian director Morten Tyldum's capability with a big budget, however a couple of exterior sequences are strikingly similar to Gravity, which unfortunately only serves as a reminder of how inferior this film is within the genre.

","Ship, carrying 5000 colonists and over 200 crewmembers, encounters meteorite swarm while traveling to a new homeworld causing malfunctions to various operations, awakening engineer Chris Pratt from his hibernation chamber. He realizes that he was awoken way too early: there is still 90 years to go and he is all alone except for an android bartender (played by scene stealing Michael Shannon, who is lit and resembled Joe Turkell (Lloyd) from The Shining (1980) to me)! Walking past the hibernation pod of a writer (Jennifer Lawrence) during a year-long slumber where the absence of human contact is deteriorating his mental state (he nearly shoots himself into space after space-suit visits outside the ship), Pratt contemplates releasing her so he can have companionship with a fellow earthling. While the android bartender is pleasant and gentle-manly enough, it isn't quite the same as having chats and worthwhile contact with someone who feels and thinks as he does. So he rigs Lawrence's pod to make it seems that her awakening was a malfunction, and the two spend the next year getting to know each other, eventually falling in love. But will Lawrence learn of Pratt's releasing her from her hibernation which was meant to take her all the way to homeworld, condemning her to die on the ship? Meanwhile, there are system failures starting to pile up as a significant fire and damage from meteorites at the beginning of the film threaten to destroy the ship. With Laurence Fishburne as a ship officer awakened also from pod failure with a certain type of clearance ""band"" (each person on the ship has wrist bands that grant them certain privileges and accesses to areas of the ship and its luxuries) that will help Pratt and Lawrence significantly towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>While the plot is as familiar, predictable, and uninventive, the star power is undeniable and the special effects are razzle-dazzle and extraordinary. Lawrence has a fantastic piece of acting in the middle of the film when she realizes Pratt woke her up from hibernation, sentencing her to die on the ship, wrought with rage and heartbreak. Pratt shows his sensitive side with this part, and his initial loneliness is palpably presented where we totally understand why he'd do that to Lawrence even if it is wrong. Fishburne makes the most of a very small part (which wastes him because I wanted so much more time with him), where his worth is basically tied to the band around his wrist and to underlie how the pod's malfunction could seal the fate for someone prematurely released. The gravity malfunction sequences (one where Lawrence is swimming and caught in a large ""water bubble"" that nearly drowns her, also lifting Pratt and dropping him hard to the floor, is a knockout) are impressive as is the layout of the ship and the visual tours outside it. I think ""Passengers"" is a fun two hours if you want something that fills the screen of a theater and tickles your eyes with its eyepopping special effect/set design candy, but the plot is just not all that extravagant. It is funny (those ""clean-up"" robots are a hoot, and Shannon nearly brings a smile to the face every time he appears), sexy (Lawrence and Pratt have some steamy encounters testing the PG-13 rating), thrilling (although the ending is never in doubt, the near-fatal space catastrophe for Pratt when he must go outside the ship to manually open a hatch so that fire can escape, and Lawrence needing to pull a handle when the time is right as the threat of critical failure was imminent prove exciting and suspenseful), romantic (the film gives plenty of time to Lawrence and Pratt to convince us they like each other then gradually fall in love as the ship has its luxuries they take advantage of), and blockbuster big (the effects and sets are the best Hollywood money can buy). Eventually this will probably take up your Blu-ray shelf with other aesthetic sci-fi pleasures, but it doesn't really have enough meat to the bones of its plot to achieve heights beyond popcorn movie status. Pratt and Lawrence are always watchable, and their chemistry helps a great deal...they carry this film along with the sci-fi goodies that Hollywood money provides. Pratt's engineering and creative genius with parts and equipment comes in handy (plot device to make him quite the hero) when the ship goes to hell. Fishburne seems to be a walking plot device himself, just in it long enough to supply help to our heroes when without him there would be none."

Imagine being trapped all alone aboard a vessel reminiscent either of Douglas Adams' novel ""Starship Titanic"" or Grant Naylor's novel ""Red Dwarf"" cruising on auto-pilot through the icy desolation of the galaxy with nobody to turn to for relief and assistance. No matter what he does, our hero cannot get a response from anybody about his ordeal. Moreover, he won't interact with another human until the ship enters orbit around its destination in 90 years! Indeed, the only thing that he can do is share his anguish with an oblivious android that mixes alcoholic beverages behind the bar and indulge in the recreational outlets aboard the ship. ""Imitation Game"" director Morten Tyldum and ""Prometheus"" scenarist Jon Spaihts synthesize the classic films ""Sleeping Beauty"" and ""Titanic"" in this promising 'what-if' scenario, but the characters aren't as compelling as the life and death crisis with which they must contend. Chiefly, Jennifer Lawrence's highly-strung, leading lady spends more time screaming than scheming, while the Chris Pratt hero tangles with a fate so tragic that he conducts himself in an ethically compromising manner that haunts him. Some of the obstacles that they confront are genuinely exciting, but ""Passengers"" amounts to a thoroughly predictable yarn riddled with plot holes that neither Tyldum and Spaihts nor Lawrence and Pratt can triumph over in this 116-minute, PG-13 rated opus. Ultimately, when you consider everything that everybody could have done to improve this flawed film, it is really a shame that ""Passengers"" doesn't live up to its potential.<br/><br/>Basically, ""Passengers"" reminded me of those adventures that intrepid pilgrims embarked upon to enter a promised land for a better life. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt of ""Guardians of the Galaxy"") is a middle-class, mechanical engineer who cannot find his fortune on a vastly overpopulated planet Earth, so he books passage aboard the lavishly appointed corporate ferry Avalon for a faraway place designated Homestead II. There are two things that you should know from the outset about ""Passengers."" First, this sci-fi saga occurs so far into the future that all the guess work in space travel appears to have been accounted for by scientists so that nothing can possibly go wrong. Second, our hero and heroine don't contend with menacing alien creatures out to make a meal of them. Humanity is the only race that inhabits this half-baked escapade that wears out its welcome long before the Avalon reaches its destination. During the first 30 or so minutes, Jim Preston struggles to amuse himself aboard this spectacular spaceship. Some things about the craft are really cool. As it plies its way through the universe, this sophisticated, state-of-the-art spaceship has been designed to travel on auto-pilot with a huge, invisible shield deployed like a huge nose-cone to deflect anything perilous in its path. The asteroid field that it smashes its way through during the first few minutes evokes memories of ""Titanic,"" but the toll that the asteroid field takes on the Avalon doesn't create problems right away. After he awakens, Preston takes advantage of all the opportunities that the ship offers. As it turns out, the hibernation pods are scheduled to open during the last leg of the voyage, with the crew awakening months prior to the passengers so they can prepare them for disembarkation. When Jim isn't floating in alcohol, he tries to break into the bridge where the crew sleeps. Meantime, Jim browses through the passenger database and finds Aurora and admires her in her translucent hibernation pod. Eventually, about a year later, Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence of ""The Hunger Games"") joins Jim, and the fate that they are facing horrifies her. Jim has done everything that she suggests later to extricate them from their predicament. <br/><br/>Initially, like all romantic movies, time takes a toll on Jim and Aurora's relationship, especially the conditions that prompted their rendezvous in space. We learn Aurora is a writer who wants to experience life first-hand on Homestead II and then return to Earth so she can write the first book about the experience. Unlike Jim, Aurora purchased a higher priced ticket and enjoys all the features of a first-class passenger. You can see the resemblance between ""Passengers"" and the Leonardo DiCaprio & Kate Winslet ""Titanic."" Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt generate enough charisma to make a sympathetic couple. Nevertheless, they can only do so many things before ""Passengers"" exhausts its spontaneity. The closest thing to another human is friendly android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen of ""TRON: Legacy"") that polishes glasses, mixes drinks, and listens to them. You can figure out where ""Passengers"" is bound with its cliché-riddled 'boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy gets girl back' plot. Once Jim and Aurora have broken up, it doesn't take a rocket scientist to see that something bigger must happen for them to repair the damage to their relationship. They must reconcile themselves and then figure out how to repair the catastrophic damage to the Avalon as it steadily deteriorates because of the asteroid field encounter. Lawrence and Pratt are more interesting than the one-dimensional characters that they portray. The arrival of another character to straighten things out doesn't really help matters in Spaihts' by-the-numbers screenplay. For the record, Hollywood has been struggling to develop this project for about a decade. Initially, Keanu Reeves and Reese Witherspoon were cast to play the two lovers, but scheduling difficulties derailed that enterprise. You won't get carried away with ""Passengers."""

And that is achieved by making a teen romance take place in space, with lot's of special effects, a male lead character and a compelling premise of a minimalist and polished future that looks as empty as today's teen generation.<br/><br/>Absolute garbage from a decaying Hollywood, with no creativity, who's only goal is to make money, no matter what.<br/><br/>Sad part is that people still buy it."
"dmitrimohammed","4","7","16","2 January 2017"," Its not stalking if he's hot!
","Where do I start with this mess of a movie? Aside from the plot being completely predictable, you cant relate to the leads, their romance is not believable, and choices made are completely out of character. I'm just going to go ahead and spoil the movie, because there's nothing great here to talk about, and I'm sure you would've seen it coming anyway.<br/><br/>I could've totally seen Michael Sheen selling out Chris Pratt, the robot with no real sense of tact or any real emotional understanding was going to sell him out. I could've seen Lawrence Fishburne dying within 5 minutes (he is the black guy after all), and leaving Chris Pratt to save everyone. I could've even seen him surviving the ridiculous amount of postmortem procedures done on him, which I'm sure would've done more harm than good and ensure he would never even live a normal life again. I could've even seen Jennifer Lawrence choosing to stay with him at the end, despite it being out of character, all for the sake of the predictable plot.<br/><br/>The movie does a good job of hiding that Chris Pratt was a manipulative sociopath. Just imagine, a guy is alone on a ship with 5000 people. For months, he reads and digs up into the files of a woman there, reading everything about her life and making a profile of her in his head. He decides this woman is perfect, and decides to wake her up from sleep to spend the rest of her life alone with him as her only company and keep her his companion forever. Were the genders swapped, it would've probably been ""romantic"", but as it's a guy, it's the synopsis for a horror movie, especially if it was average-looking guy. Except, the movie's way of making us sympathize with him: they make him hot. We don't hate him immediately because Chris Pratt is hot. He only gets a shot at redemption because he's hot. He lies to Jennifer Lawrence for a year, and when she finds out, she freaks out and reacts like any rational person would.<br/><br/>At this stage, the movie could've worked on this new revelation showing how the characters grow and develop with each other, or even let Chris Pratt be punished for his actions, but instead they decide they're going to redeem his character, by having him be the only person who could save the ship from shutting down completely. Lawrence Fishburne awakens and promptly dies, leaving Chris Pratt as the only person to save the ship as he's conveniently a mechanic and Jennifer Lawrence is totally useless.<br/><br/>It would've been easier to defend him from dooming Jennifer and robbing her of her lifelong dream, if she was useful in saving the ship. There is nothing in her skill set that allowed her to help anyone, short of pulling a switch at the end. Had her character awoken first, everyone would be dead. Being a writer is nice and all, but she existed solely and thoroughly as a love interest for Chris Pratt, it's almost as if him choosing her was supposed to represent the people who cast her. Her entire existence in the movie is to be hot.<br/><br/>In the end, she chooses to stay with Chris Pratt and not go back to sleep, despite him dooming her to die on the ship. That was not believable in the slightest, and goes almost against her character. There are girls like her in real life, never happy with their current privileged lives, feeling the need to abandon their friends and family to compensate for being perpetually unhappy. She's the equivalent of the white girl who backpacks across Europe, except here it's another planet. She even treats it as such, with her just staying for a year. In the movie, there were videos of her friends begging her to stay, but she left them to live out her dreams.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence's character was a huge narcissist, and we see this when the Lawrence Fishburne is trying to fix the ship, but she wants him to focus on her personal problem of being woken up as opposed to saving everyone's lives. We see it again where she was willing to doom everyone on the ship over being alone. The movie tries to pass off she choosing to stay with Chris Pratt so that he won't be alone, but probably she knew that she can't be happy with a normal person, and a sociopath like Chris Pratt is better for her. That's the only way I could see her decision in the end making any sense. We cant relate to her, aside from her reactions to the news that Chris Pratt woke her up, and we are supposed to give it a pass because she's hot.<br/><br/>Their romance doesn't even work. Chris Pratt is a technical, more hands-on guy, he would've done better with a more technical woman. Or maybe the movie was glossing over that Jennifer Lawrence's only option was him, and really had no other choice. And how did they gloss it over? Oh simple, they're both hot! It would've been a decent twist if she didn't return his affection, but I suppose if he wasn't Chris Pratt that may have been likely. The romance only works because Chris Pratt is hot, especially at the end. My aunt told me that if she was left alone on a ship with Lawrence Fishburne, she would've went back to sleep immediately. The movie just expects us to accept that Chris Pratt deserved his redemption because he's hot.<br/><br/>When it really boils down to it, the movie relies almost entirely on their leads being as attractive as possible to distract us from the poor romance, sociopath male lead and narcissist female lead. It's basically a movie about hot people doing hot people things for teenage girls to get wet over and teenage guys to ogle Jennifer Lawrence."

"CriticalRaccoon","3","3","5","7 February 2020"," Script of a horror movie, filmed as a love story
","I remember checking Twitter in December 2016 and seeing the initial ""reactions"" towards Passengers; to say Passengers pissed off ""Outrage Twitter""™ would not do the single-day uproar justice.<br/><br/>Saying I was mystified is an understatement.<br/><br/>Passengers was marketed as Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt as a couple who fall in love while alone in space on a dying spacecraft. Two giant film stars in a science fiction epic, directed by Morten Tyldum who just did The Imitation Game? Sign me up please!<br/><br/>Then I saw the movie years later and understood the outrage.<br/><br/>Passengers is the type of movie that I'd have expected to be made in 1972 with Charlton Heston and a far goofier tone. To see this film made in 2016 is almost beyond comprehension.<br/><br/>To accurately convey my feelings I need to go into heavy SPOILERS.<br/><br/>First off, the marketing was a lie; Lawrence got most of the screen time in the ads and is top-billed but she's really the supporting character to Pratt who is alone for the first act of this movie. Oh, and the ads completely made it appear that Pratt and Lawrence woke up at the same time and that there was a ""reason"" they woke up early...yeah, nope. If I was an audience member I'd be pissed.<br/><br/>Passengers is at times a great idea for a science fiction classic but then it becomes almost disgusting in the way it handles a love story that when written down comes across as something out of nightmares. One slight rewrite and this could easily have been a horror movie; or at least the science fiction version of Ingrid Goes West.<br/><br/>Well, before I go too far I'll give a summary. In the space-age future mankind has decided to colonize other distant worlds. On a 120 year spaceflight to a new planet, ""I fix things"" engineer Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90 years too early when his sleep pod malfunctions as the ship goes through an asteroid field-stranding him on this giant spaceship with no way to go back to sleep. A year later, faced with spending his remaining days alone with no hope of rescue, Jim bumps into the pod of journalist Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) and instantly gets horny for the sleeping beauty; as well as cyberstalks her like a creep by going through all the files about her on the computer. Jim wakes up Aurora by sabotaging her pod and they ""fall in love"" over the course of a year until-shockingly-Aurora learns that Jim basically stalked and murdered her! Luckily for Jim the ship starts to fall apart so they are forced to work together to save it while Jim risks his life to save her...you can guess where this goes.<br/><br/>Passengers is a tale of three acts: thought provoking, nightmare stalker love story, and boring action climax.<br/><br/>On the bright side I'll say the first 25 minutes of the film are good. Before the disgusting and tone-deaf love story happens and we just see Jim wander around this massive, empty ship it is rather poetic. Jim's situation is unique compared to other ""alone"" tales as he has access to entertainment and will never starve or likely ever get sick-Jim's only destiny is dying of old age or suicide. As time passes and Jim becomes more and more disheveled we can see what he's going through and why he might jump to the action that he did. It's just too bad that the love plot was written so horribly.<br/><br/>Now, I can see what Tyldum and writer Jon Spaihts were going for here: if you were stuck alone and could wake up someone else to keep you company/fall in love with, would you? It's an interesting premise for a science fiction film to tackle that is a familiar ""what if"" scenario. The problem is it's handled so terribly. This segment just comes across like the studio or testing audiences wanted more ""drama"" and thus they revamped the second act in such a way to have more traditional romantic-comedy, liar-revealed pacing. I'll at least give Passengers a bit of credit because Aurora does get suitably angry at Jim...for 10 minutes of screen time. Had Jim at all seemed guilty for what he did outside of a couple of silent glances I think it would have helped make him less detestable. Lawrence and Pratt do their best with the material and make a nice couple but it's just impossible to overcome the scripts' failures. As presented Passengers is the tale of Jim wanting to bang a hot blonde girl he bumped into that he then stalked online...seriously.<br/><br/>The final act of the film is also extremely boring and predictable. Big budget stars means you need an out-of-nowhere fiery action climax with explosions because they have to kiss and make up for some reason, right? Nothing better to hastily get our lovers back together than an attempted heroic sacrifice! Bonus points for being featured heavily in the trailer to misrepresent the movie!<br/><br/>Passengers also suffers from being contrived to fit the plot. The idea that ""nothing ever malfunctions"" is beaten to death as the excuse to why Jim and Aurora are stuck; why would they ever need to have emergency plans when nothing ever breaks? So when Jim wakes up and the computers can't comprehend that an error occurred, as well as the fact that the company decided to stick all important people and equipment behind impenetrable doors that only crew could open, we aren't meant to question that. Oh and how come the ship is still completely active-including a Michael Sheen bartender robot-even though it won't be used for over a century? Then we have the Laurence Fishburne cameo where he plays the dude that they conveniently need to be able to open the ship up-right after they break up but just before the action climax happens. It's all just too convenient to make this story work.<br/><br/>I honestly wonder if Passengers was a much cheaper production it would have been a far better product. I read that this film was originally planned for about a $40 million budget and had more reasonably priced names attached; all of which makes way more sense for a more subdued tale of Sci-Fi morality. Passengers had a budget of $110 million or more, and while pretty to look at it doesn't feel like a movie that needed to be blockbuster sized. Maybe Sony thought that they could duplicate the success of Gravity, Interstellar and The Martian as blockbuster space based ""rescue"" films-albeit without award hype or an effective marketing campaign. I don't know for sure, but Passengers just feels like Sony throwing money at a project in hopes that bigger equals better.<br/><br/>Passengers is just disappointing. A film with ambition, Passengers shows us that Pratt and Lawrence can carry a movie by themselves but can't save a movie from its own inept plot. What little hope the opening act gave us of a truly unique film quickly dissipates under the weight of a poorly thought out love story where you end up hating the characters instead of rooting for them. Beautiful sets and effects can't hide the rotten stink of contrivance to ram these two lovebirds through trials and tribulations because that's what a chart in a production studio office said to do."
"bigfrog6","4","3","5","13 January 2020"," Could have been a dark psychological masterpiece in the hands of somebody like Kubrick...

There could have been real empathy with the protagonist's solitude and his resulting actions, followed by scenes dripping with tension combined with internal psychological battles regarding his decision and the third act should have been one of pure revulsion.

","Everyone else has said what they think of this movie, but none of the dozens of reviews I've read mention just how the idea of being perfectly healthy with nearly anything and everything you could wish more at your disposal (no idea there is a major problem with the ship yet) causes a man or had it been a woman to be in such despair the person wants to commit suicide all because he/she would have to love a life totally alone as the ship travels through the wonderess vastness of space. I can understand looking at peoples video files. I can understand being lonely as I've been thrust into a life of utter aloneness since 2013. It's now almost 2019 and although I speak to no one, go fishing in my backyard almost daily, have no one to assist me with my pain. No one to cuddle up with. No one to even speak to, etc. I've been suffering several major health issues and NO ONE IS HELPING ME OR DO I HAVE ALL I COULD EVER WANT FOR FREE FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. And my view outside is no where near as incredible as seen by just looking out a window in this movie.<br/><br/>What I find most hard to believe is anyone so weak willed, so lacking in personal fortitude, that they seriously think about suicide when they're in perfect health with all the food, water, entertainment they could want except the contact with another human being. The movie also proved... had these people met in a real life setting, she would have never given him a second thought because she is rich. Plus, let's add to my list of pathetic things...his total selfishness in deciding to condemn another person to his fate just so he won't be alone. How about this Hollywood... What would have made a REAL good story in this setting is as follows....She gets so pissed at his actions, she kills him and SHE lives out the rest of her life alone or until the ship blows up or gets to be put into the medical stasis pod?. And just one more thought. Most shows/movies when a man and woman have sex, they never use protection or contraception and nearly always the woman gets pregnant.

So with that I decided to give Passengers a ""Good"" on theVade Review Bar or a 7 out of 10. With so much going for it, I felt like what I looked forward to the most about this film (the screenplay), ultimately turned out to be what I didn't enjoy the most about this film.<br/><br/>Read more at theVade."

","I saw Passengers yesterday by myself. It stars Chirs Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence who are two people that decided to leave earth for a new planet called Homestead 2.<br/><br/>Firstly, I want to say that this movie is very beautifully shot, the special effects look amazing. For me one of the reasons why I can only say why this movie is okay is because of the characters. I thought both Jim (Pratt's character) and Aurora (Lawrence's character) are so bland. There is basically no backstory to Jim, he's just a guy who wakes up early and we get to see his journey in space alone until he decides to wake Aurora up and fall in love. <br/><br/>However, there is some good backstory to Aurora, I thought she was way more interesting, we got to know a little bit better that she was a journalist and she wants to write a book. If they added that to Jim maybe the movie would have been a bit better."

","First 20-30 minutes was good, rest of the movie was boring. Atmosphere drawn to movie in the beginning but there is no real script. If the bartender was not being in the movie I can not finish this. Because there is no real drama or romance too. Movie was not short but incidents was too fast. For example I never felt Jim spend a year alone."
"paul-allaer","6","8","20","22 December 2016"," Works (sort of) as a romance movie, but fails as a sci-fi action movie
","""Passengers"" (2016 release; 116 min.) brings the story of the Starship Avalon, ""Destination: Space Colony Homestead II"", we are reminded at the beginning of the movie. The 5,000+ passengers aboard are in hibernation for the 120 year journey. But when the spaceship run into a large meteorite, the hibernation pod of one of the passengers malfunctions, and wakes up a guy named Jim Preston. Alone on the giant spaceship (but for a robot bartender named Arthur), Jim tries to fix the pod (to no avail) and seems resigned to just wither away. Then he has an idea... At this point we are 15 min. into the movie but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the second Hollywood movie from Danish director Morten Tyldum, who brought us the brilliant ""Headhunters"" some 4-5 years ago and soon thereafter was signed to direct ""The Imitation Game"". Here he brings us a sci-fi movie in the disguise of a romance (or perhaps it's the other way around). The best part of the movie is the first 30 min. when Jim (played by Chris Pratt) adjusts to his lonesome existence on the giant spaceship. When eventually Aurora (played by Jennifer Lawrence) joins him (sorry, can't spoil how that happens exactly), the movie becomes an outright romantic affair, a courtship set in space. ""For two unlucky people, we sure got lucky"", says Aurora at some point. It isn't until the last 30 min. that the movie tries to make itself into a sci-fi action movie, but in my opinion fails to do so credibly (too many holes in the script the size of Manhattan). Michael Sheen is a pure delight as the robot bartender. The last character (played by Lawrence Fishburn) enters the plot too late to have any significant impact. On the plus side, the set and production design is top-notch, it's clear no expenses were spared (the movie sports a reported production cost of $110 million). Kudos also to Thomas Newman for the fantastic film score, which plays quasi non-stop (Imagine Dragons also contribute a new song ""Levitate"" which plays over the movie's end titles). Bottom line: if you have seen the movie's trailer and are expecting an action-packed space movie, you are sure to be disappointed, as this is not that kind of movie at all.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" opened wide on Wednesday of this week. Having seen the trailer, I couldn't wait to see it. The Wednesday evening screening where I saw this at here in Cincinnati was attended okay but not great. Given the onslaught of new releases as usual at the year-end, I'm guessing ""Passenger"" is going to have a difficult time finding an audience. If you really want to see a space action movie, stick with ""Rogue One"". If on the other hand you are in the mood for a romantic movie, this might well do the trick for you, up to a certain level."

"Zettelhead","6","5","11","28 February 2017"," A good idea ruined by Hollywood-action-stereotypes
","In the last years most SF-movies just deal with dystopies, one darker than the other. If you grew up with Buck Rogers and Star Trek and like SF-worlds that offer an alternative way of living or at least some perspective, you will like this one - until it finally turns into crap. The plot is great, the acting is fine, there are a lot of good ideas in it, a lot of good visual effects (a swimming pool during a failure of artificial gravity...) and there is even an essential ethical issue in it - actually the moments when SF really unfolds its potential.<br/><br/>But finally it turns into one of those completely implausible action flicks. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: The idea that the two main characters (passengers!) are able to save the gigantic vessel is somehow far fetched in the first instance, but it could have been written in a way that would have made it plausible. If there would have been just some minor, little damage, some insignificant computer error the story would have been working. And it would have been more SF! It would have been a comment on the naiveté of men, to put their lives in the hand of machines. <br/><br/>But, no, it has to be the impact of a meteorite! And an overload of the fusion reactor! Holes in the shell plates of the ship! And completely destroyed computer panels! And everything has to collapse right in the moment were they discover the damage! So they (a writer and a mechanic!) repair the computer within several minutes (!!!) And they know how to cool down the reactor (!!!) Find a little hatch on the outside of the gigantic ship within a few minutes and know how to open it (!!!) Then the guy is able to survive the blow-out of a fusion reactor, shielding himself with a small door (!!!) He is not even catapulted out into the vast empty space but is levitating just within reach around the ship with a cracked helmet (!!!) and she is able to get in to the space-suit so fast that she still can save him within time. Then they live happily ever after. In a paradise garden they planted on the spacecraft. With gigantic trees that had just 89 years to grow. And birds (wtf?!). Where does this bird in the last scene come from? Did it grew on a tree?<br/><br/>Conclusion: A fine SF-movie in the first half ruined by stupid blockbuster standards in the second. What a waste of money and talent."

Nothing else matters.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence is lovely to look at and that's what kept me going through this celluloid crime.

","I gave this movie 5.9. I was excited. Previews looked intense and just finished Star Wars so I had high expectations. After sitting down and making about 20 minutes into it.....meh. OK guys it's not a thriller, conspiracy-movie like I hoped-rather a love drama. There's a lot of romance and scantly clad J-law; for the girls: there's a lot of Chris Pratt's ""posterior"" end (some comedy too). There's a cool design and plot it's centered around without much in terms of fleshing it out. It gives up on being realistic and using challenging science or rational explanations to give license to more emotional tension between the two characters. The movie peaks about 3/5 through the film then finishes all down hill with fake, couldn't happen, ""impossible"" stuff occurring for plot and story sake and it's rushed. For me, way too much sexy, romance, crappy sci-fi playing out and not a lot of real life space thriller. It's an entertaining film but not something I'd go see if you had other good options. See Star Wars or if you want more J-law and Pratt rewatch Jurassic Park or Hunger games, both way better films and stories."
"alindsay-al","5","15","46","21 December 2016"," An average space survival film
","I like both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence so I had some excitement for this film but it ended up being a huge disappointment. The premise of the film sees a group of people on a ship to a new planet when one of the passengers wakes up and things start to go wrong. Chris Pratt is the main character in this film, no matter what the trailers say and he is brilliant in this film. He is easily the best part of this film and gives his usual humorous performance but adds a large amount of dramatic depth to his character that really worked for the film. Jennifer Lawrence plays aurora in this film and she does a good job in the film, I thought her and Pratt had good chemistry in the film and her character does get more interesting as the film progresses. I did find her character a little annoying at first but she grew on me as the film progressed. Michael sheen plays Arthur the android bartender and he is really good in this film providing allot of fun moments and good banter with the other two characters. But then there are some wasted characters such as Laurence fishburne and Andy Garcia who really add absolutely nothing To this film. The story both first half of the film sees Pratt's character Jim surviving on the ship by himself and I really liked seeing him survive and go through the cool parts of he ship. However, once Jennifer Lawrence character came into the film it slowed down allot and you feel like the film is really dragging with nothing that interesting. The script is incredibly bland though, there is just not enough uniqueness to it or enough for you to care about it. The style of the film has good special effects and a good thriller style towards the end of the film. But it feels like a very long film that just doesn't have enough substance in it. Overall this is an average film that doesn't have much uniqueness to it and it isn't worth a watch."

","This movie has its faults; it's predictable, cliché, and at times seems like it's a trailer for a Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt sex tape (not necessarily complaining). However, it is so much more than just that. This movie is original, witty, and beautiful. The chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is undeniable; they play off each other effortlessly. The story is also remarkably original. In an age filled with space expeditions and tales of new worlds, this movie manages to make something new and refreshing. In addition to being emotionally moving, Passengers is also visually stunning. It's possible that there were a few too many shots of the Avalon with nebulae and galaxies in the background, but who can complain when the view is as spectacular as it is. Passengers is a thoroughly enjoyable film. Both Pratt and Lawrence are near perfect fits for their roles, the entire film is beautiful, and action and drama fit seamlessly together. You might be able to predict what will happen next, but that doesn't mean this film is unenjoyable. The critics are far too harsh on this film; trust me, you'll like it."

","Touching on the idea of solitude doesn't make for an automatic romantic situation, especially when the spark was a morally irresponsible decision.

I for one, could not avail myself of that bad taste in my mouth right from the get go, no matter how persistent the music tried to make me think otherwise.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but the actors did a real good job in making it believable. The man finds himself stranded on a ship bound for a distant planet, the intent of the journey being colonization. There are other people, but they are all asleep.

","Terminator genesis into the discussion here. Because its been said that both films (and all other films) have existed in all the points in time.

But the year is 1901 and actress (Clark) is only a kid, not even a seasoned actress yet. So how is it that when she enters the house her mother holds out both terminator Genesis and passengers (dvds) to show Emilia? Of course the dvds were just drawings, sketches by a profit. Spooked Emilia then runs on all fours back into the barn, with her mother in hot pursuit. her mother says: ""please come into the house, use the bathroom and use the running water, we'll go get you a pink pillow case for your bed.""

When I first saw this movie I was impressed about how good the movie was made, It was all very realistic, original and I loved the props that they used and how the spaceship looked. The many rooms, the robots and the things you can do on the ship. If I was on that ship I would love all those robots and modern things you can do on the ship. I sometimes wonder if it is going to look like that in the future, cause I would definitely love to live on the Avalon myself because I just think it is so cool. I also loved the storyline.<br/><br/>I always loved movies that were in space so I was very excited when I heard about this movie. I also thought the acting was very good. I loved the actors! The editing was also very good. And there is always something happening, it isn't boring at all. The genres were just perfect. It was romance, sci-fi, and drama. 3 things I love and go so well together. I found the end especially exiting because everything can go wrong.

","Since the beginning of ""moving pictures"" about 150 years ago by now, there have been precious few good hard Science Fiction stories on screen. I have most of the historical masterpieces and milestones in a small (!) DVD collection. This movie is absolutely in that elusive bunch. The characters are interesting and humanly real with their flaws and strengths. The story? It starts with what the previews reveal, so no surprise there, but things go in unexpected directions from there. It is about human nature, our possible reactions in a bad situation, and intelligent behaviour instead of shootem-up, which is not possible and would be insane in the given situation. There are (wonderfully refreshing!) no slimy aliens or zombies, and yet the tale keeps you watching and rooting for the people on board a ship beyond reach of any rescue. Despite the novel and slick design, for the most part they even got the current physics right and the imaginary future solutions for some space related problems are even being worked on now. Ok, so they goofed on a few details, especially the zero-G effect failure, but which movie has not had its flaws in physics? That is why there is one star missing in the rating, but otherwise kudos! This is a believable involuntary adventure story, that is well made, with very good actors, and visually appealing in a way that will stand the test of time. Cinematography is excellent and avoids ""modern"" camera styles that only annoy and hurt my eyes (no jiggle camera, no incessant zoomie-zoom, no wanna-be documentary ""style', etc). Oh, and for special effects, they are of course there, are not obnoxiously in the foreground, but simply build the scenery. They are of a nature, where you forget about them and you just see the drama unfold instead, which is what GOOD use of FX is all about :) I totally love this masterpiece!"

Unfortunately there are no real interesting twists one might expect and the sci fi script plays more like a toned down Gravity (2013) with a relationship angle. What makes this sci fi movie a bit better than the average outer space adventure is the personal character development and moral dilemma that was given good screen time. Even so the American nature of romantic drama abounds in this movie. Entertaining, though slow at times, and could have been better.

I don't understand why people have called this movie horrible because it's really an awesome movie. The first 2/3 of the movie spends he necessary time building the plot and drawing you in as a viewer. But the last 1/3 of the movie feels rushed. I really would have rather had a large beer movie and wish they had spent more time on resolving the issue. If they had done Leo's I could've given this movie a 10. I love movies that are based around character development and this one does a great job. I found this movie totally entertaining and it took me through a full range of almost every emotions and made me feel what ""The Passengers' did. Don't pay any attention to the PAC police he thought this movie was just horrible and scandalous because it's not it's a great movie for people of all ages."

"mocaler","8","2","3","31 October 2017"," Non-violent, psychological sci-fi
","My sci-fi preference is for hard science fiction. I like as much science accuracy as possible. In that vein, I also prefer psychological realism. I can't relate if the portrayal of what people do and say are too far out of sink with how they would really act. I have gotten more selective with what I watch because of these things. I dislike being disappointed after I watch a movie or read a book. For instance, I disliked Star Wars Force Awakens. I'm even a bit forgiving toward the prequels. But I think that Force Awakens stretched coherence too far. But that deserves its own post. <br/><br/>I just watched Passengers (2016). I had reservations because multiple reviews illustrated how much of the science was wrong and about the abusive action of Pratt's character. But I liked the idea that it didn't have any intentional antagonists. So I rented it. Yes, it did get rather loose with the science. But I thought that it had a compelling story and interesting character portrayals. I thought that the positives outweighed the negatives. You see, another thing with which I've gotten bored is the antagonist / protagonist method of story telling. Some people claim that Pratt's character is the antagonist. But I think of the character as being someone who intends to be a good guy but makes a horrible mistake. <br/><br/>The end result is that I felt that Passengers had enough for me to consider it to be enjoyable science fiction. It had a good concept, generally good story progression, likable characters and no enemies. That being said, it really could have done better by the science without being detrimental to the story. But I will watch it again."

","For years I had a different picture what this film is really about. Blame it on the criticis, or the false advertising. Whatever.
So, I accidentally catch it on TV, and was too lazy to change the channel, and honestly, was sucked in the story after 20 minutes.
I gotta say, the first part of the movie is great, deep and thought provoking. Makes your mind wander as what would you do in that situation. Would you die of old age, commit suicide or do what Jim did?
BUT, after that came the whole love story plot and Im sorry, but in what universe would a person react the way the Aurora reacted? Threw her life away in the end, when given the choice. Dude literally killed her, and she was okay with it? (OK, she was mad at him for a whole 10 minutes) I mean, it's a stupid ending to an just okay movie.

","Passengers (2016) directed by Morten Tylom, written by Jon Spaihts is a very interesting concept. It looks at how space travel communication is limited and that in order to reach places there is a large amount of time that has to pass to reach far away places in space. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Prat as passengers on a spaceship where they are supposed to be asleep but they wake up. The film does a great job of showing the problems when doing deep space voyages. But the film's plot never really seemed to pick up and was very stagnant throughout the film. The acting was excellent but the execution of the plot was ok at best. There were stunning cinematic shots that showed space and the ship, this helped the film by adding an element of beauty in the harsh reality of space. The science and some of the action in the movie is nowhere near accurate but it worked in the film to have big moments and be considered a science fiction film. Overall, the film was good, interesting and worth a watch."

","This movie was really nice, with incredible designs of both interior and exterior of the ship, but some things were not very well-thought. I really can't understand why the ship made all those ship-wide announcements 90 years before everybody woke up. Example? The Red Giant scene. ""You may want to proceed to a viewing area. The Avalon will slingshot around the star Arcturus"". WHY ARE YOU SAYING IT IF EVERYBODY IS ASLEEP???

","BAIT AND SWITCH - the action (generally illegal) of advertising goods that are an apparent bargain, with the intention of substituting inferior or more expensive goods.<br/><br/>The trailer and promos for the movie Passengers definitely constitute a carefully thought-out marketing plan using bait and switch tactics.<br/><br/>First the BAIT: two of the biggest stars today - Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. The setting: a colonial spaceship traveling through space - the final frontier. The plot: The ship goes through a meteor storm causing Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) to awaken from deep hibernation 90 years too soon. After more than a year living alone he is joined (can't say how - it will spoil the movie) by Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) and Chief Deck Officer (Laurence Fishburne). The conflict: certain ethical and moral actions undertaken by Chris Pratt. The rising climax: the meteor storm has damaged the ship leading to the imminent breakdown of all systems and death to everyone on board including 5000-plus sleeping passengers. Production value: 110-million dollar production budget. Cool sci-fi doodads: swimming pool with empyreal view; ultra hi-tech food cooker and dispenser (okay, Star Trek had one too); a charismatic, artificially intelligent robot bartender named Arthur. Nice CGI and special effects: especially the anti-gravity scenes.<br/><br/>Sounds like a slick, expensive sci-fi, hi-tech, mystery, thriller, action/adventure, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>The SWITCH: a chick-flick with expensive sci-fi trappings that have nothing to do with the story. Indeed, if Jon Spaihts' screenplay was a novel, it would be categorized as women's upmarket fiction. Not that there is anything wrong with a chick flick - but do we really need the bait and switch? I wish I could go more into detail, but that would just violate our policy (my wife's) against giving out spoilers.<br/><br/>Apart from the bait and switch issue, the movie is TOTALLY derivative. Yeah, I know that there is nothing original anymore, especially in Hollywood - but still - there were so many homages, clichés, and rips that my mind became overloaded like the defunct computer, Hal, in 2001: A Space Odyssey. There were real similarities to Cast Away, Lost in Space, Gravity, 2001: A Space Odyssey, Titanic, Interstellar, 50 Shades of Grey, Groundhog Day (yes, Chris Pratt's obsession with Jennifer Lawrence in a way mirrors Bill Murry's obsession with Andie MacDowell), The Martian, Star Trek IV, Alien, The Bible, and countless others.<br/><br/>Despite all of the above, I did enjoy the movie. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence had REAL chemistry. The solid acting and direction by Morten Tyldum kept me engaged throughout; no anti-heine itch cream needed. Michael Sheen's performance as the android robot was MasterCard priceless.<br/><br/>Would I have gone if the trailer portrayed Passengers as Romeo and Juliet in Outer Space (with overtones of Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?)? Probably not. Am I glad I saw it? Yes. So I guess the bait and switch wasn't that much of a negative tactic after all."

","For a SF film, Passengers is on the calm side, yet still evocative. It's about two people together in space under far from ideal great circumstances. Its plot centers around a moral choice that is as inevitable as it is impossible, which gives this relatively romantic movie an underlying tension throughout. And that's all I can say without spoilers.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence steals the show in the acting category and Chris Pratt knows his place by giving her the limelight, which is the mark of a great actor. Others (no spoilers) compliment perfectly. The plot however is a little predictable. You can really see some story beats coming miles away. Although later, the tempo and twist become more interesting.<br/><br/>The music is quite bad and cliched but the atmosphere, filming and art direction are strong throughout. And the central premise is so good that you can't help thinking: what would I do?"

","Technology will continue its inexorable advance, but Adam will never stop desiring an Eve.<br/><br/>With an age-old plot line clothed in the flashiest of high-tech wrappings, along with excellent casting and acting, ""Passengers"" makes for one of the more satisfying space movies in memory.<br/><br/>Here we've got the story of working joe Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), who is hurtling at half the speed of light toward a colony of humans on a faraway space body. Upon awakening 90 years prematurely from what was supposed to be a 120-year hibernation, with 5,000 other passengers slumbering around him according to plan, Jim wrestles over whether to awaken fellow traveler Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) -- offering himself the hope of companionship but killing her chances of achieving intergalactic emigration.<br/><br/>I appreciated this movie's emphasis on characterization over high-tech jargon and special effects, although many scenes are visually riveting (i.e. when a sudden drop in gravity turns the spaceship's swimming pool into a life-threatening vortex).<br/><br/>I was unfamiliar with Pratt, but he turns in a nuanced performance here, bringing to mind fellow film hunks Josh Brolin and Christian Bale. I also liked the work of Ms. Lawrence, who believably goes from liking Jim, to wanting to kill him, to finally realizing that she wouldn't want to live without him. Also good are Laurence Fishburne in the small role of unflappable control-room techie Gus Mancuso and Andy Garcia in a cameo as the spaceship's captain.<br/><br/>This film poses some intriguing moral questions while poking fun at the limitations of technology. (Anyone who thinks a robot could ever replace a friend will be disabused of the notion here.) We also get some commentary on the commercialization that would inevitably follow man into the far reaches of the multiverse. For example, we learn that Jim didn't have to pay full fare for his ride to another world -- ""I'm in a desirable trade,"" he tells Aurora. That translates into cheaper, duller food than Aurora gets at the spaceship breakfast bar.<br/><br/>We also observe a tweaking of the notion that technology can be trusted. Hibernation pods on the Avalon were supposed to be fail-safe. But if they had been, there wouldn't have been any story here.<br/><br/>In the end, this is a poignant tale about the human condition. People can careen erratically between love and enmity. But in the end, all we've really got is each other. ""It ain't right,"" a world-weary Gus tells Aurora, ""but the drowning man will always try to drag someone down with him."" Ain't it the truth!"

","I have never bothered reviewing a film before, but this is a case where my experience diverged so significantly from the critics that I felt compelled to share. Judging by the IMDB user reviews, I can clearly see that I am not alone.<br/><br/>All else aside, the glitteringly beautiful set design and excellent soundtrack are reasons enough to see Passengers. The fact that this film is relatively minimalist (revolving mostly around 2-3 actors) allows the viewer to really notice the details during the sweeping scenes of the various interiors and rooms of the ""Avalon."" The sense of the ship's endless span (conveyed especially in the early scenes of the film) set against the backdrop of space are lent additional lustre by the soundtrack (excellently composed by Thomas Newman). The soundtrack shows up front and centre (again, due to the film's minimal nature), but always feels in sync with what's happening onscreen.<br/><br/>The premise of the early part of the film (""If you were stranded on a desert island, would you wish another person there with you?"") is intriguing in itself. You might struggle to convince yourself that in the same place, you'd react any differently. This premise is the reason I would hesitate to rigorously characterize this film as ""sci-fi"" in genre. As such, I think Passengers should be spared any of the nitpicks regarding scientific or physical accuracy/realism. It's simply not the point.<br/><br/>One weakness I have to point out (the reason that I rated the film 9/10 rather than 10/10) is in the pacing, which feels a bit uneven going into the third act. Throughout the film one has a faint sense of acceleration in the storyline. It felt as if the second act was chasing the third (and the ensuing climax of the story), somewhat at the expense of the more dramatically interesting elements. With a runtime of just under two hours, the director definitely had at least some wiggle-room to draw out key plot points a bit more gently and evenly. This, however, is nowhere near enough of a reason not to watch it. Overall, it's visually beautiful and emotionally satisfying, even if a little fast."
"gcsman","7","1","1","1 January 2019"," This is a deeper film than most people realized -- it's more than just a glossy sci-fi ride.
","The interstellar starship is one of the major science-fiction tropes. If, as ""Passengers"" does, you decide to go with the laws of physics and accept sub-light-speed, then it means taking decades or centuries to go between stars. So then, either you put your crew and passengers into hibernation and completely automate the ship; or else build a ship that people can live in for generations -- so that most of the passengers will live out their whole lives on it and never see the final destination. ""Passengers"" effectively invites us to see what both possibilities would be like.<br/><br/>In either case the ship has to be BIG, and the one designed for this film is a beauty. It gets lots of screen time too, and for me it was almost the star of the show. (It's fun comparing it with the nicely done interPLANETARY ships for other space movies like ""The Martian"", ""2010"", or the iconic ""2001"" -- interstellar is a whole different category of complexity.) In general, the sets for both interiors and exterior are well worked out.<br/><br/>(Caution: some spoilers ahead. My comments will make more sense if you've already seen the film.)<br/><br/>By contrast with the ship, the storyline and the cast of characters are pared down to an absolute minimum while it confronts us with some challenging moral issues. Some years into the voyage to a new colony, Something Goes Wrong -- the ship passes through a cloud of meteroids that partially damage the ship's systems. (Science detour here -- deep interstellar space isn't like an asteroid belt and it shouldn't have much more than sparse gas and dust, not big hunks of rock. They might have found another plot device to get the same result.) A single random passenger, mechanic Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is accidentally woken from hibernation. The voyage still has 88 years to go. The crew, who might be able to fix tings, are also in hibernation and inaccessible within a sealed area, so he's facing the rest of his life being completely alone (not counting the robot bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen), who's not exactly a substitute for human companionship). More than a year goes by. After agonizing with himself for a very long time, he awakens Aurora Lane, a journalist (Jennifer Lawrence), who then goes through her own cycle of denial/rage/bargaining/acceptance, and of course eventually finds out what he did. Their relationship, which up to that point was starting to go well, predictably breaks down. This is where things might stick, except that the ship's systems are getting gradually worse and clearly something needs to be done. Jumping to the end, the obligatory final action scenes lead them to the ship being restored (with some crucial and unexpected help) and bring the plot to a satisfying, though not completely expected, finish.<br/><br/>Jim's decision to awaken Aurora, which is the critical point of the plot, sparked some real controversy around this film. Is his action morally equivalent to murder? Not really. Or rape? Not exactly. Maybe something like abduction??? Yes, it was a personal violation that prevents Aurora from having the life she planned for. Is Jim's decision inexcusable, as many viewers felt? Is it inexcusable but yet understandable? Probably most people would agree that he'd have been justified in awakening some of the crew, because the lives of all the thousands of people on board are in jeopardy. But that's what he (correctly) tried first and was unable to do. What would the audience reaction have been if the tables were turned such that she awoke first and then brought him out? Are the situations equivalent? I think the film is inviting us to visualize ourselves in their places: Jim knows this step is somehow wrong, but otherwise he's facing decades of utter loneliness, maybe madness, or suicide. What would we do? It's an extraordinary situation that no one in today's world has actually had to deal with. There are echos here of the archetypal Adam and Eve story, but there's no God and no Satan, just impersonal forces represented by the ship and the universe outside.<br/><br/>However, I think that a discussion over the morality of all this must also include the ending. Almost beyond hope the chance comes to at least partially recover. With the ship back to full functionality, they find that it will be possible to use the auto-doc to restart hibernation -- but for just one of them, because the other one has to set it running. Jim offers to do it for Aurora, and now she has a free choice: shall she opt to get her original life plan back again, or to stay with him? So in a nice bit of symmetry, each of them has to confront a moral decision for which there is no completely convincing answer.<br/><br/>The ultimate message, if there is one, seems to be that if you don't get the life you planned, then live the life you get. That's not too bad.<br/><br/>What helps is that the actors do a good job of selling it. Chris Pratt is versatile and likable, and the equally versatile Jennifer Lawrence is excellent; she's got a rare screen presence. She is also not simply playing a 'victim' -- in other words, she has agency of her own. The supporting players (all two of them!) do fine as well, but it's the central pair that counts above all -- and, of course, the ship itself."

","Passengers is the story of Starship Avalon, who´s making a 120 year voyage to the Homestead Colony.One of the passengers happens to wake up 90 years early, the movie follows his life, and the life of another passenger during that period.
Passengers is a romantic sci-fi feature that has an interesting premisse for a story, however it is weighted down by a poorly written and developed script, the movie never manages to be as interesting as it could be.
Visually however the movie is great, the visual effects, the cinematography, and the production design really help to give the movie a reallistic feel.
The cast is good, Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have a chemistry that works, there are good moments to be found with these two.
The movie has also some problems with the genre, it is a times a romance, a sci-fi, a comedy, and a thriller too, but it ends up just being a mess.
Passengers has an original premisse for a movie, a good cast, and it is beautfiull to look, however it is also poorly written, developed, directed and suffers from an inconsistent tone.Wasted potential unfortunately.<br/><br/>6.4/10"

Because it is fiction. If that overly bothers anyone they just shouldn't watch the movie. <br/><br/>But it is more a human interest ""what would you do?"" theme, and after we see what they did what do we think of it? In the grand scheme of humanity, human relations, and right vs wrong in a poorly defined situation.<br/><br/>According to the filmmakers this takes place about 500 years in the future, the Earth is overcrowded, a company has started colonizing new worlds. In this story a ship of 258 crew members and 5000 passengers are placed in a hibernation mode for the totally automatic 120-year trip at about half the speed of light. To a world about 60 light years away. That makes back-and-forth communication impractical.<br/><br/>An unexpected incident occurs, one passenger, a man, is awakened after only 30 years.

She would be finished at that point. Adding gravity, and the water dropping, would not bring her to the surface alive.<br/><br/>Mistake #3: Instead of copying the movie ""The Martian"", the cord should have been long enough to reach him. The drama would be the resuscitation. No need to pull a stunt we all knew was coming, Why do the obvious? They should have surprised us, and made the cord long enough.<br/><br/>Also, one suggestion: If I wrote this screenplay, their ""kids"" and ""grand-kids"" would have greeted the awakening passengers, because the two lead characters wanted a full life.

","Passengers is a movie with a very simple concept. A spaceship is on a journey that will take 120 years to reach its destination and all of its passengers and crew are in hibernation. Along the way two people wake up far too early and have to decide how to go on with their lives.<br/><br/>When the movie sticks to this concept, it's very successful. It conveys the loneliness of being the only human(s) around at the moment, along with the knowledge that they will die prior to reaching their destination and won't make further human contact. Jennifer Lawrence and, even more-so, Christ Pratt convey the emotions their characters must be going through.<br/><br/>It's the third act which knocks a few points off for me as the movie moves outside of the realm of character study and into slightly more sci-fi areas. The script at that point gets very generic, and is less character focused. fortunately, the movie does get back to point before the end."

","Passengers falls in the category of movies,that you expected to see something else,BUT still like very much what you actually watched.The trailer is misleading,in the sense that you go watch the film,and it's totally different from what the trailer suggests the film is. 5000 people(sleeping in hibernation chambers) are in a spaceship heading for a distant colony.The trip will last 120 years but a malfunction in one of the chambers has Jim Preston(Chris Pratt)waking up after 30 years.He soon realizes what's going on and after a year living alone in the spaceship, decides deliberately to wake up Aurora Lane(Jennifer Lawrence),because he can't live alone anymore.Of course he doesn't tell her the truth, but pretends that she woke up because of a similar malfunction in her chamber. Won't tell you anymore, but the film is about the relationship that develops between those two.Pratt and Lawrence have a fine chemistry between them,and in the end they will probably be one of your favorite cinema couples(for me at least).The special effects are fine and the swimming pool scene where there is no gravity,is quite spectacular,but the film isn't about adventure or effects or action.It's a love story that you will like very much and that will make you want to watch the film again and again(I will definitely buy the Blu Ray).

"robert-temple-1","9","1","1","21 May 2017"," Fascinating and worthwhile sci fi film
","This is a truly excellent science fiction film which does not have monsters, but instead tackles serious issues in a sensible manner. The film is set quite far in the future, when humans have already colonised a few other planets and starships are travelling across the Galaxy with humans spending a century or so in hibernation during the long interstellar voyages. (In this case, the starship passes the star Arcturus one third of the way on its journey.) The entire film is set in a particular starship owned by the Homestead Company on Earth, a horribly naff commercial enterprise which sends colonisers to its own commercially owned planets for settlement. There are 5000 colonists asleep on the ship, in addition to the crew who are also asleep, and the entire ship is on autopilot when it suffers a collision with a rocky body in space which damages it. Systems malfunctions begin to occur, and there is a single 'pod malfunction', whereby one of the colonists is awoken prematurely. He is played by Chris Pratt, who does a very good job of being an unambitious young engineer in search of a new life and adventure. He wanders around the gigantic starship and wonders why he is the only person awake, since the automatic announcement he received upon being awakened was that everyone was waking up now for the final months of their journey. The interior designs for the vast starship rooms are truly spectacular, as are the special effects of holograms of stewardesses, etc. Ghost of Stanley Kubrick, eat your heart out! If only 2001 could have been like this! I have never seen such magnificent art direction for a sci fi movie. The designer deserves an Oscar. A great many satirical touches are incorporated into the film, mocking the commercialism in a way which we can all appreciate and find amusing, and which will make many a travel agent blush (if travel agents have blood in their veins, that is). Pratt is horrified to discover that there has been a systems error and he is the only person awake on board the ship, which still has 90 years left to go of its voyage time. He spends a desultory year alone in the vast ship, becoming more and more depressed. There is no possibility of him putting himself back into hibernation, so he is irreversibly condemned to his lonely fate. As he wanders around looking at the faces of the other sleeping passengers, he is struck by the sight of a beautiful girl. He is tempted to wake her up for company, because he finds her irresistible, but he agonises over this for months, as it would mean condemning her to die on the ship, since neither he nor she could ever live long enough to survive to the end of the voyage. He has had one companion during all of this time, a robot bartender who looks human from the waist up and stands behind the bar pouring his whiskies and chatting to him amiably. This bartender robot is played absolutely brilliantly by Michael Sheen. His performance is in fact so amazing that it is the highlight of the film, surpassing even the spectacular sets in appeal. It is probably not an exaggeration to say that the man must be a genius. And one reason why he is so successful is that the script by Jon Spaihts is so superb that Sheen gets such wonderful lines that even a less talented actor could have scored with them. Finally, Pratt gives way to temptation and wakes the girl, who is played by Jennifer Lawrence. I must confess that I do not find Jennifer Lawrence at all beautiful, and I find that a problem in the story, since she is supposed to be so irresistible to Pratt. But then there is no accounting for taste. She does a good job of acting, so that she retains our interest for that reason. This unlikely and very ordinary couple then essentially are the story, until disasters begin to strike as the ship starts to deteriorate in a catastrophic manner. The attempts to save the ship and themselves preoccupy the young couple, and the events which ensue are extremely dramatic and harrowing. A crew member awakens because of another pod failure, but he only lives long enough to give Pratt his ID so that he can get into the command and control cabin. He then dies and the couple 'bury' him by ejecting him into space. At no point does this film become boring, despite the small cast. This is a thoroughly worthwhile sci fi film done on a grand scale in an intelligent fashion. It is extremely well done, and is a model of serious science fiction film-making."

","On beginning the movie I thought I was in for a big bore with only two people on a ship to make the backbone of the movie. But the immersion is real.

You really feel lost in space.<br/><br/>The acting is good, I just find the actors a little dull. I would be much more insane if I was to be alone and doomed. But overall what they did afterwards was convincing. After all, why wouldn't you profit instead of lamenting, even if that makes you a bad person (you'll see). Pratt and Lawrence make a beautiful couple, perhaps too beautiful it's almost too perfect, but hey he got to choose.<br/><br/>What made me the most happy was the beautiful CGI. I love spacecrafts and space-themed sci-fi movies and they managed to make it look plausible and immersive with imaginary science elements in it. You grow worried when they show you the command center and the issues appearing. But once again I think the score made the film just much more polished than it would have been without it.

Let's just say that they live a lifetime of emotions in the space of this movie. They face controversy, deceit, lies, plus life and death choices. <br/><br/>In the end, the plot is just not strong enough to make this movie special. It's entertaining, good acting, but it just takes too long to get to the point, and moves too slowly. If I have to watch Lawrence go swimming one more time so we can see her body, I think I'll puke. <br/><br/>Passengers is a decent film, with good acting, but lacks a strong story.

","The premise of Passengers is fascinating, and it stars two of the hottest names in Hollywood, but the end result falls short of anything remotely close to what I hoped this would be when it was announced a few years ago.<br/><br/>Directed by Morten Tyldum, director of the acclaimed The Imitation Game, Passengers is about two people who mysteriously wake up 90 years early, aboard a ship headed to a new planet. Marketed as a sci-fi with a romantic angle, but it's really more of the opposite. There's a lot of good in Passengers, mostly dealing with the lead's chemistry, but the lack of focus and identity is where it fails the hardest. That, and the fact that the script feels like something thrown together at the last minute.<br/><br/>I feel like once Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence signed on, the filmmakers fast-tracked the production to take advantage of the two's widespread appeal. It's unfortunate, because there's a good film in here somewhere. The idea of living alone vs forcing someone else to live the rest of an isolated life with you is explored, but only sparingly. The sci-fi elements are surface level, and anything that needed an explanation was brushed off in some casual & paint-by-numbers way. I would have preferred one or the other. Either go cerebral like Interstellar or stay within the silliness of a sci-fi like Edge of Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Luckily, Pratt & Lawrence are great together. So much so that you forget they are spitting out painfully melodramatic dialogue. If they weren't the actors they were, this could pass as a TV movie with the script. I'm not surprised, considering Jon Spaiht's also wrote Doctor Strange this year, a film I wasn't too keen on.<br/><br/>One of the major appeals to the film was the mystery surrounding the two waking up. Because of that, I was always engaged and intrigued as to the film's direction. With that said, I can't say it's a film I would ever be inclined to watch again.

"RLTerry1","6","6","15","22 December 2016"," Great premise, but ultimately fails to pull into the station
","An intriguing journey with lots of potential but ultimately fails to pull into the space dock. The highly anticipated visually stunning science-fiction film starring Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt proves one thing: Pratt and Lawrence have excellent on screen chemistry and play off each other very well. With films like this one, it's hard to know where the fault lies. Typically, a film with such potential and a powerful cast is weakened by either the writing or directing. Since the director principally works with the cast, it can be concluded that the writing lacked the drive that this film needed. On a more positive note, this film depicts deep space travel how it could likely be in the not-so-distant future. From the centrifugal force created by the rotating space craft to simulate how artificial gravity could be generated to the onboard technology to the sickbay, this film does a fantastic job of providing audiences with a science-fiction that is almost tangible. Having such a limited cast in one location can spell disaster for cinematic storytelling; but, the film is quite interesting to watch and sufficiently keeps the audience's attention. Furthermore, the audience mostly connects with Aurora (Lawrence) and Jim (Pratt) well enough. But, the film fails to truly provide audiences with a new adventure because it amounts to a glorified Castaway set in the Disney Springs of shopping malls in outer space--just completely empty of scooters, strollers, and other park guests. Lack of surprise pretty well sums it up.<br/><br/>Welcome aboard The Avalon on the Homestead Company's routine transport to Homestead II, a new earth colony. All is going well until two passengers find themselves awakened from suspended animation about 90 years too early during a cascade of ship wide malfunctions. Faced with living the rest of their respective lives on board and only the company of an AI bartender (Michael Sheen), Jim and Aurora must cope with the challenges of living together in a world that is merely 1000 meters from stem to stern. When the ship begins to increasingly malfunction and life support at risk, Jim and Aurora much solve the mystery of what originally caused the problem that began the cascade. Just as the ship is keeping a secret, there are other dark secrets on board the ship as well. Meeting with psychological, emotional, and engineering challenges, Jim and Aurora have 5000 other passengers and crew to save while maintaining their own sanity and psycho-social health. <br/><br/>As the movie faded to black, I began discussing it with the friends who accompanied me to the cinema last night. And we shared a mutual reaction of hmm, not exactly sure what this was or how to read it but it had some interesting components. And that pretty well covers it. The film will likely keep you entertained but with few surprises, it lacks anything to make it memorable in a positive way. Forgettable is what this movie will become in the no-so-distant future. Essentially, Passengers is what you would get if Gravity and Titanic were to have a baby. Star-crossed lovers on a ship that is self-destructing in the vacuum of space. One of the most intriguing components in the plot of the film is also highly disturbing. While love and infatuation causes many to go to great lengths in order to see desire become reality, it is a double-edged sword that can cause one to behave selfishly if not displaying signs of sociopathy. While Pratt's performance is what is to be expected from one of the most bankable actors in Hollywood who is equally a dedicated family man, his performance is never quite on par with his Castaway counterpart. However, Lawrence delivers an intense performance as she plays off Pratt,the bartender, and The Avalon itself. <br/><br/>The cinematography and editing are excellent. In fact, the technical elements of the film are impressive! Not quite as groundbreaking as Gravity or Interstellar but still outstanding. There is one scene in particular that still has me puzzled as to how it was able to be achieved so flawlessly. The set design, albeit spartan, is beautifully sleek and functional. As film is a visually driven medium of storytelling, the camera often pulls in close to characters to establish intimacy but juxtaposes that against pulling back to reveal the oppressive loneliness of being alone on a massive ship in space. For a brief moment, I experienced the dread that is created in Kubrick's The Shining when Jim meets Arthur the bartender. Interestingly, the music (composed by Thomas Newman), camera direction, dialog, blocking, an set design all work together seamlessly to establish that unparalleled sense of dread, loneliness, and self-destructive despair that are so iconic to The Shining. Unfortunately, that powerful sense of dread is lost in weak writing. Had the film embraced the potential to channel The Shining, it may have played out more memorably. But, this is a love story so the horror plot devices that could have helped the film were not integrated into the plot. Although there are may significant contributors to a film's success, the success of a film often relies upon the direction, writing, and cast. As the director (Morten Tyldum) of a film principally works with the cast, it is likely the screenplay by Jon Spaihts that is responsible for the weak story.<br/><br/>Despite sharing the screen with Aurora, this truly is Jim's movie and others simply happen to appear in it when necessary. As a side note, I could easily see how this film could be translated into a stage production. Perhaps on stage, the story could evolve to leave more of an impact on the audience."

","This is what I call a lazy script from a weak screenwriter to an interesting idea. Every good science fiction movie has to have the scientific side with a minimum of consistency. Relevant explanations, which are the premises for buying the plot, are played in some dialogues quickly and unconvincingly. In fact, it is never explained why the whole crew sleeps and they do not take turns to control the progress of the trip, and why if everyone sleeps, there is no protocol to wake up some crew members in case of emergency. Why someone who wakes up cannot hibernate again if this is the basis of the trip? Why the crewman who woke up, seeing the eminence of the ship's destruction, did not wake up any more crewmen instead of leaving all the safety of the ship in the hands of two inexperienced passengers? Why make a ship so spacious and luxurious for passengers who spend 99.9% of the trip sleeping? The more mass, the more energy and the greater the cost of travel to a company that aims for profit. If the company owned the ship was for profit, they did not think that a ship traveling at 50% of the speed of light would travel thousands of years to the future (Basic Relativity Law). The problem that caused the crash in the ship is the most basic of a stellar trip and yet it was not thought of? Otherwise, they are important premises for the plot that are simply pushed aside. All could have been properly answered and integrated into the plot by a good screenwriter. Or they should be changed. In fact the film is horrible as science fiction and pathetic as a love story."

","I don't understand the good reviews here, since this movie has absolutely nothing in common with science, comedy, common sense or the art of filmmaking. Not a single part of the ""story"" does hold the water here: of all the people on board (more than 5000?) only one awakes by mistake and he can't sleep back again since the ship combines incredible AI bartender with absolutely idiotic rest of the computerized systems (""I don't understand.""). Not to mention legendary rumbling sound in open space or Arcturus (cca 40 ly away) as a ""slingshot"" star or choice of the other ""to be awakened"" person (or the third, for that matter) and so on. Besides being an eye- candy pack of SFX and a good performance by Jennifer Lawrence, this movie is a pack of bad writing, meaningless plot and insulting viewers' intelligence. And it's not even funny. Oh, yes: there is some gardening here, like in Martian, but without potatoes. This movie cannot be recommended to anyone but inmates in some mental institution. They probably would not ask questions like ""why?!"". Avoid by all means (and then avoid some more)."

","It's beautiful, yes. The two actors are great together, but ... <br/><br/>Somehow, the plot isn't that attractive, not for a two-hour long movie. Plus, I'm disappointed with Gus' death. I mean, he gets so little time on screen, and it just feels like he's only there to change the game and, finally, accelerate the pace of the movie. <br/><br/>I'd categorize this as a romance movie, so much it's centered around the couple and their relationship - how it comes to be. Also, I don't know, I guess I was also annoyed by the reference to Noe (hello, Chris Pratt's beard) and to Sleeping Beauty (in the same movie!). I guess this felt like a one-too-many just-like-the-others kind of movie."

","Surprisingly entertaining, despite what seemed to be, (even to the lead actors being interviewed on Graham Norton's show), a restricted idea, environment, basic story line and plot. It was though all kept simple and effective. What was written was used to the full and not overwhelmed by the excellent special effects. Leading actors were surprisingly good in my view, while Arthur the Android barman was in danger of stealing the show and some nice twists and turns. Ending could in my view have been developed a little more. The concept of infallible technology seemed to have some unlikely holes in it and as a result one or two parts were just a bit too fantastic. A really good family movie with a tiny amount of nudity.

After some long contemplation he decides to awaken another passenger (Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora) to help make his years more bearable. <br/><br/>This is where the real story of Passengers begins and shows the evolution of Jim and Aurora's relationship as well as the turmoils they face as passengers. <br/><br/>The visuals and score of this film are outstanding and help really reinforce the emotions of certain scenes.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a space flick with a decent story and heart, Passengers is a great choice."

","Visually stylish, quite beautiful space scenery, good acting by the leads. The critics are generally wrong in their negative reviews. Well worth seeing. Its only flaw is the somewhat abrupt and pat ending (heavens, Andy Garcia is only on screen for 3 seconds). Expanding the implications of that ending would have provided a better sense of closure. The central moral dilemma is intriguing. One character is confronted with a choice-- his own psychological survival at the cost of someone else's life. That dilemma is made moot by later plot developments, softening the darkest implications of his crime. As a literature prof, I'm a good judge of good stories, and this is one."

","...and the award for the most disappointing film of 2016 goes to Passengers! I can't tell you how long I waited for this movie to come out, it was at the top of my must see list for months, and I was more excited to see this than almost any other film this year. For those unfamiliar with the story, five thousand passengers are in suspended animation for one hundred and twenty years, as they prepare to start a new life on a brand new planet. Thirty years into the journey, there is a malfunction and two of the sleeping pods open, awakening two of the passengers ninety years early. Everything I read and saw made this look like THE film to see this year, but the truth is it was beyond boring. This malfunction that awoke them, was part of a cascade failure, meaning small failure got worse over time, years in fact, and nothing serious actually happens until the last twenty minutes of the film. Until then, it's a lot of talking, romance, sadness about how they'll waste their lives alone on this ship for nothing. This had to be why the studio paid two of the best young actors in Hollywood a ton of money to be in this thing, because they knew no matter how boring the story or bad the reviews got, people would still go to see Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. Congratulations Columbia Pictures, it worked, you made your money on this one and yes the special effect were cool, but how many people were actually entertained by this film? I for one was not, this film come in at just under two hours long and I felt like I was sitting in the theater for a week, that right there says it all."
"elboerefijn","10","4","9","7 January 2017"," Beyond expectations
","I was very impressed by this movie I wasn't expecting it to be this good! What was really good were some space mechanics that aren't really explained in detail but are amazing little details for anyone that's interested in space flight and interstellar travel, things like the water from the pool forming a sphere mid air when the ""artificial"" gravity breaks down and the ship sling shotting around a massive star presumably to save on fuel or to make the journey shorter. <br/><br/>The one thing that I felt should have either been explained or shown in the end is what is the effect of these 2 people waking up 90 years before schedule and consuming all that food, air, water. that was probably portioned out to be used by 5000+ people on board over the course of the last 4 months of the trip. Will thousands have starved because these 2 woke up too soon and ate all the food? or am I just supposed to think they packed plenty of food. I mean how much KG's of food do 2 people consume in 90 years and how much toilet paper? is there gonna be anything left at the end? And also why would they wake everyone 4 months prior to landing? wouldn't like a day before suffice?"
"muhammedelgammal_","5","4","9","5 January 2017"," The details were too far-fetched
","Where to start with this? This movie has a great story to it, but some of the details could have made for a better movie.<br/><br/>It was a great concept in this movie; humanity finds a new planet to inhabit. But the only problem is it takes 120 years of traveling to get there. So in order to successfully get there, the people would need to be put in a deep sleep (hibernation) in individual pods. There was only a capacity of 5,000 people for each journey.<br/><br/>But of course, something goes wrong to where Jim, played by Chris Pratt, was woken up 90 years too early. He had no way of going back into his hibernation, so he was left with two options- survival or suicide. It was cool to see him as he went about his day and what he would do. But it was too short lived. He was only alone for a little over a year before he decided to override the system to wake Aurora, played by Jennifer Lawrence. It seemed like way too short of a time frame for Jim to have already gone crazy.<br/><br/>The main thing that did not make sense about this movie was the 120 year trip. For a trip that takes so long, why are we only able to send 5,000 people at a time? Also, there was a scene where Jim had tried to send a distress message to the people on Earth, but it would have taken 19 years for delivery and 55 years for a response, and it would cost over $6,000. Also, the passengers themselves did not make sense. Considering that there is a limit to each trip of 5,000 people and it takes 120 years to travel, the people that were being sent were middle class people. Jim was an engineer. Aurora was a journalist. For a voyage like this, I would have thought that it would have been for only the top 1/10 percentile of the top 1/10 percentile of the upper class on Earth. Who other can afford to pay over $6,000 for a single message?<br/><br/>The ending was too short. Once Jim and Aurora find out why the ship was malfunctioning, it was a matter of about 10 minutes of the movie for it to be fixed. There was opportunity for a stronger finish here.<br/><br/>Overall the movie's story was fine, but it could have been much more concrete. For a survival type movie, there could have been much more of a challenge presented to Jim and Aurora to make the story more thrilling."
"rioplaydrum","6","4","9","1 January 2017"," Somewhat Disappointing
","My expectations were just too high with this otherwise terrific presentation.<br/><br/>Pros: Visually stunning. The CGI and spaceship design gets high fives all around. Truly a remarkable achievement here. I was in awe of the visual presentation and the enormous amount of thought that must have gone into this work.<br/><br/>Great acting. Both main characters deliver a performance with an emotional range that is very believable. How would you handle yourself all alone on a gigantic ship irreversibly hurling through space? You'll find the answers here for sure.<br/><br/>Cons: Fishburne's character seems mildly odd and out of place in the story. I find it too remarkable a coincidence a high-ranking crew member would accidentally be woken up just in time to provide much needed help as far as gaining access to secured areas of the ship. This derailed the plot for me a great deal.<br/><br/>Bad science. When you are a confirmed Sci-Fi fan, you have to get used to things like that. But there are some truly glaring anomalies here. The ship is supposed to be traveling at 93,000 miles a second, or half the speed of light. That's 335 MILLION miles an hour. You are not going to be able to view a passing star with such magnificent grandeur, but again the CGI is overwhelmingly good, so it's forgivable. <br/><br/>Unsatisfying ending. Too quick and convenient. I would have loved to know far more about how the main characters lived out the rest of their lives rather than the little bit that was shown. It simply left too many questions unanswered.<br/><br/>Overall, not a waste of money or time, but 'Passengers' falls far short of making true cinematic history and will not be considered a classic in the sci-fi genera.<br/><br/>Oh, well."
"gsanvin","7","4","9","31 December 2016"," Good film, nearly great...worth a look
","Spoilers, be forewarned.<br/><br/>I found that the film had a great premise, it was well acted and excellently filmed. <br/><br/>The basic story line being 5,000 passengers and crew are in a suspended hibernation on a 120 year voyage to a new planet. After a collision with an asteroid causes Chris Pratt's(Jim Preston) hibernation pod to malfunction and awaken him after only 30 years, the story really beings. <br/><br/>Pratt's only 'person' to speak with is an android bartender, excellently played by Michael Sheen. Although that premise borrowed more than a bit from 'The Shining' bartender, it worked, there have been far worse movie sins committed in other films.<br/><br/>Pratt, desperate for companionship awakens Jennifer Lawrence(Aurora Lane), A writer looking for the ultimate subject to write about. <br/><br/>At this point to story loses creativity,originality and falls into a cliché. The budding romance, fight, hatred, breakup, getting back together as the extreme danger to the ship forces them to work together. Pratt's 'Death' and miraculous revival to life.<br/><br/>Here, I believe we are set up of a squeal as it fast forwards through the next 88 years to show the ship arriving at it's destination and the awakened crew discovering that someone has built a 'home' in the middle of their ship. Did our two stars have a family along the way?(there was what seemed to be a foreshadowing mention of a midwife in a hibernation pod) We do not hear from the crew at all, only see their astonishment at the discovery, and the film concludes right there. <br/><br/>All in all, not a classic film, but not terrible either. I gave it a solid 7 out of 10 with a recommendation to see it no matter it's flaws."
"harry_tk_yung","Null","4","9","28 December 2016"," The most horrible tragedy imaginable.until
","""Passengers"" can be neatly divided into three acts. My summary line pertains to Act 1. We witness Jim (Chris Pratt), a mechanical engineer by profession, waking up in a 120-year hibernation-pod flight in the 5000-passenger Avalon, to colonize Homestead II, seeking a new life away from overcrowded Earth. The problem is, he wakes up at year 30 due to a system malfunction. He is now looking at the horrible fate of living alone and dying alone on this colossus space vehicle. The solitude is tragic, no matter how opulent the surroundings might be (it is intended that the passengers will be awaken four months before arrival and enjoy a luxurious life prior to commencing their new adventure on Homestead II). Yes, he can communicate with Earth back home. A message takes 19 years to get there and it would take another 55 years for responses, if any, to come back. (Be thankful, folks, for your WhatsApp). Oh yes, he has one human-like companion, a droid bartender Arthur (an amusing Michael Sheen). No wonder he contemplates opening the exit to go out into space WITHOUT wearing a space suit. He pulls his hand back from the switch in the last minute and continues his existence in Avalon for over a year, until Act 2.<br/><br/>The second act is a love story that has been compared to ""Titanic"". Jim is enchanted by the beauty and impressed by the bio (easily accessible in Avalon's electronic files) of a fellow passenger Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence). After an agonizing moral struggle, he wakes her up without telling her, of course, that he did so. She goes through the same initial confusion and struggle but also empathizes with his predicament of enduring the ordeal for over a year all by himself. Before I get to the romance part, let me explain the Titanic reference. Put it simply, Jim is in economy class while Aurora is in first class. Jim is a total stranger, at least initially. He does not hurry things and the romance comes gradually and naturally. The trigger point is when Jim takes Aurora through the wonders of experiencing the splendour of space from outside Avalon. That scene brings to mind Christopher Reeve taking Margot Kidder on her first flight in ""Superman"" (1978). I can almost hear the mesmerizing melody of ""Can you read my mind"" in my head.<br/><br/>Romance aside, there is one scene in this Act 2 which provides some meat to chew on. Aurora is a writer who, unlike everybody else, has bought a round-trip ticket, intending to stay in Homestead II for just a year. Yes, by the time she gets back to Earth, 250 years would have passed since she left. But as long as there are still human beings who can read, there is nothing to prevent her from writing the perhaps most brilliant book in human history. The scene I am referring to is where Aurora ""interviews"" Jim, asking him what drove him to embark on this adventure.<br/><br/>Act 3, unfortunately deteriorates into a banal space thriller. First, Arthur spills the beans to Aurora about Jim being responsible for waking her up. You don't need anybody to tell you her reaction. Next comes a series of malfunctions starting with doors and vending machines and on to a hibernation pod waking up another individual. This time it is a crew member, very senior in rank too, Gus, played by Laurence Fishburne. His fans however will be disappointed because Gus is not much more than a plot device, to advance the storyline. He is already seriously ill when he is awakened. After finding out and explaining to them the problem Avalon is facing, he dies. Jim and Aurora are alone again, with the unenviable task of trying to save the 5000 passengers from an imminent explosion. While they may still die of old age on board, the remaining 4998, plus some 200 crew members, can carry on after arriving safely at Homestead II.<br/><br/>There is more but I'll keep the final spoilers. <br/><br/>""Passengers"" to-date has received an IMDb user rating of 7.0, which is a pretty fair indication: a reasonably good movie but not particularly brilliant."
"mrpatent-31276","8","4","9","26 December 2016"," A very pleasant movie
","This was a very entertaining movie which would have been much less enjoyable if I had been exposed to spoilers. A number of posters have raised the moral issue of the Chris Pratt character waking up Aurora 90 years early. Clearly, this was a wrong and selfish thing to have done. Certainly not as a justification for his actions, it would appear that if he had not done so, all 5000 passengers and 238 crew members would have been lost. While Preston's actions were morally wrong and selfish, they were never what could be described as being malevolent. This wrong was an essential plot element which was necessary to eventually bring out the forgiving aspects of the Aurora character. Pratt's actions were essential for the movie. Aurora comes to see Pratt's actions as being at least understandable as she became close to the identical situation of being left alone whilst James exits the ship to save everyone at the risk of his own life. This is a moral choice that also needs to be considered, but is not as obvious as the initial moral wrong. In the end James has given her a chance for a life. For me, I would have written an ending that found them both curled up together arriving safe in the AutoDoc.<br/><br/>For me the plot of this movie is similar to a Twilight Zone episode where two people meet and fall in love just before the male's departure into space in a hibernated state for 50 years. Knowing that his love will be old when he returns he awakens himself early and spends 50 years alone in space so as to be the same age as his love when he returns. Ironically, thinking that she will be old when he returns, she has herself ""hibernated"" for 50 years. Do you see an O'Henry influence here? Female played by that wonderful actress Mariette Hartley."
"MichaelNontonMulu","8","4","9","26 December 2016"," Definitely worth to see, but do not expect this to be another ALIEN movie
","For a science fiction drama movie on space, this movie was surprisingly good. I was at first a little bit skeptical as I thought I would be bored with only 2 people playing in it. However, both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence were big enough actor/actress that they could fill the whole movie by themselves. Of course Michael Sheen as the android was also a favorable character. The movie pace was understandably a bit slow for a drama movie. But Chris Pratt was playing such a charming character that I was sure audience would root for him. His characterization was very nicely done. Jennifer Lawrence certainly got a good chemistry with Chris Pratt in this movie. Their relationship seemed quite realistic as well. <br/><br/>There was also a surprise character showing up in the last 20 minutes. Despite the scenes were not a lot, but his presence made a lot of sense and also added the much needed information/explanation to the whole story. Now whether this movie had a happy ending, or a sad tragic ending, I would let you see it for yourself.<br/><br/>If I have to categorize this movie, it would fall into the category of romantic drama with space ship as the background and some nice special effects (scenes when there was zero gravity on the ship were cool, or the breathtaking scene outside the spaceship). But please do not mistake this as a full action space adventure movie like Alien quadrology. You would be very disappointed if that was what you were expecting. In the end, this was more of a love story and quite a beautiful one if I may add. I know my wife was touched with Jim and Aurora's relationship. <br/><br/>So if you are looking for romance movie on space, with some brief suspenseful events in the last part of the movie, then this one is definitely for you. But if you are looking for action on space type of movie, then it's better to watch Rogue One: A Star Wars Movie.<br/><br/>pls have a look at my complete review in michaelnontonmulu.blogspot.co.id"
"SpoilerAlertReviews","7","4","9","25 December 2016"," Galatic romance that's a little thought provoking.
","The mysterious trailer doesn't really give too much away and is possibly a little misleading, as the unravels an intriguing twist of fate being less than what the trailer suggests but then more so in other departments. <br/><br/>The Imitation Game director, Morten Tyldum gives us quite an impressive visual of a deep space journey that goes not so horribly wrong. A couple of passengers on an auto-piloted, interstellar cruise liner awaken some ninety years before reaching their destination. <br/><br/>Chris Pratt playing mechanical engineer, Jim Preston who's real life challenge is to step out of Star-Lord and the rest of his comical characters showing a different side to his acting, however, he can't seem to lose that sarcasm he does so well. He does a fine performance but it does lack believability at certain times. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane, an aspiring journalist on quite the quest to write the novel not ever written before. She actually appears stupid or floppy, over dramatic, but that's what makes her acting so more realistic. It's precisely what one would expect in real life and not a graceful outburst that's been obviously scripted. She's an absolute natural however I can't see this giving her another Oscar let alone any nominations. That goes for Pratt as well. <br/><br/>The final character is the ship herself. Going from being benevolent to then being ominous, like something lurking however watching; reminded be of Event Horizon for some reason. There's an assortment of voices used for different elements of the ship but surprisingly no Sigourney Weaver, however there's a familiar voice I couldn't place until reading it belonged to Emma Clarke, who's voice has been used for countless things including the iconic ""Mind The Gap"" on London's underground. Michael Sheen is brilliant as Arthur the android bartender, being quite uncomfortable, polite yet not entirely helpful. He breaks a major rule of bartending proving that robots can't ever replace humans. <br/><br/>As mentioned before, there's a couple of twists that the trailer hints at, which people should figure out quite quickly enough, but it doesn't take anything away from the shock or the disappointment in the characters you might feel. It's paced well considered the time the story spans, it's does allow for elements to sink in making you question what would you do if you were either character. <br/><br/>The technology is impressive with some neat ideas that isn't so heavy it becomes unbelievable. But it feels borrowed from other movies like Prometheus, Sunshine and even WALLE. The CGI and special effect are incredibly gorgeous. It's amazing how much can someone dress space up giving it quite the glorious, powerful yet dangerous and intimidating image. But it's nothing we haven't seen before. <br/><br/>There's a few minor errors like getting the maths wrong and some really unnecessary bits which I can only assume was part of a different edit, maybe a longer or elaborate ending. One part in particular becomes nothing more than a tease and I'm not talking about JLaw. Something of note here is the hype leading up to this movie, interestingly discussing the mild sex scene between the characters. For those of you expecting to perv over the beautiful JLaw, you might be disappointed. Just tell yourself it's a 12A, how saucy can it be? But you're not going to watch it for that are you? Right? <br/><br/>Thomas Newman does a good score, not quite his usual but certainly bears the Newman style. Like the films genre mix, there's a varied sound throughout the score, never having a central theme. No two tracks are the same and differ some from each other, tracks like ""Sugarcoat the Galaxy"", ""Starlit"" and ""Cascade Failure"" as examples. <br/><br/>Is it a sci-fi? No. Is it a romance or a drama, possibly a thriller? It's dips into all of these genres without actually committing to any of them, making the film quite undecided about itself and I'm not sure if that's a good thing or not. It certainly makes you think, judge and ponder the intentions weighing in the balance of selfishness and solitude. It's like an interstellar Titanic with bits of Cast Away and Solaris. A weird romance set on board on science fiction voyage. <br/><br/>Running Time: 8 The Cast: 7 Performance: 8 Direction: 8 Story: 8 Script: 7 Creativity: 8 Soundtrack: 8 Job Description: 7 The Extra Bonus Points: 0<br/><br/>69% 7/10"

Fresh out of the success of The Imitation Game, Morten Tyldum embarrassingly helms a mammoth project evidently lacking experience or provocativeness it requires. The film never quite decides what it is or what it wants to be because evidently more time was spent on fancying up the production values rather than covering up Spaiths' plot holes. I found myself rather intrigued by the story, predictable as it is though, being a definite fan of the genre, never quite minding the clichéd lines, the almost unbearably loud and out of place score by Thomas Newman or the all around CW TV show look, because some films are just meant to be enjoyed as Sunday afternoon entertainment or a late night escape."

","I seldom write reviews but it'd be a sin not to do so for a movie thats so enjoyable and touching. I am sure of some conspiracy behind the negative critic reviews for such a great movie. The story is so fresh and the situation is so new and unexpected that you're surely going to love it. If you ever have loved someone to the extreme, am sure you won't be disappointed watching this movie and its going to remain close to your heart for long."

","It's bad science fiction, it's bad storytelling, and it's bad cinema. First of all, it's 2 hours too long so there's bad direction and editing too. Chris Pratt was not too bad but Jennifer Lawrence needs a lot of growth as an actress. And bad science too: the spinning spacecraft doesn't just stop all of a sudden when a computer is overloaded (and why should that happen) because there's a thing called ""momentum"". So the ""gravity"" would not instantaneously disappear and leave poor Jennifer drowning in her swimming pool (albeit we get to watch her swim and drown and gasp). But for plots, Jennifer pouts for 2 hours about ""you've killed me"" instead of ""you saved me from dying on this broken ship"". They could have had kids. Hey, she got to write a story. Could have been better. Bad waste of money, Sony."

Well I think she would've been afraid of him when she learned the truth, I think if I were him I would've been afraid of her after she knew the truth. <br/><br/>Then there's the food situation- there was enough food for 5000 passengers to live four months- but just the 2 of them if they lived 60 more years would've eaten ~10% of it.

"soundoflight","5","3","6","19 March 2017"," Mediocre, Cliché, Sci-fi
","This is how big Hollywood studios do science fiction. They dumb it down, water it down, add big name star power, add some explosions and action, add some cheesy romance, add a mandatory sex scene, and turn it into inoffensive pabulum for the masses. <br/><br/>In fact, I have trouble even calling this move science fiction since there is so very ""science"" involved. Grade school level astronomy students should be capable of laughing at this movie, but the real problem is that it's more of a cheesy romantic comedy than sci-fi. The bulk of the movie is dedicated to following the evolution of the romantic relationship between the two main characters. This choice means that a lot of the actually interesting things that could have explored - such as moral dilemmas, the effects of extreme isolation, the fragility of humanity in the face of space - were all shuffled to the back-burner. <br/><br/>After the movie expends itself on the romance story, a cliché filled action sequence wraps it up in a neat little package, and the ending ties it up with a bow. <br/><br/>In summary, it's a visually interesting romance story stuffed into a sci-fi package. I suppose if I was looking for a romance story involving Jennifer Lawrence, I'd be all over it. But I wanted a science fiction movie. I feel a bit duped. A generous 5/10."

"marcinsmok","5","3","6","7 March 2017"," A classic example of when a good scifi story gets butchered by Hollywood clichés
","(Taking a deep breath) Uff... Let me just start by saying I love sci-fi movies, I really do. From masterpieces (IMO) like ""Moon"", ""Interstellar"", ""Ex Machina"", ""Blade Runner"", ""Ghost in the shell ""to less ambitious but still amazing classics like the Riddick trilogy, the original ""Alien"" movies or the excellent ""Guardians of Galaxy"", I enjoy being drawn into these made up worlds of the future and presented with reality that may one day be our own. Yet sometimes, I get irritated and decide to write a review about a particular movie. It's a rare thing for me to be angry at a scifi movie and it only happens when a great premise gets butchered by the greed of Hollywood producers who do everything to lure the widest audience possible. So is the case with ""Passengers"". Without getting into much details, I had really high hopes for this movie- the story is truly intriguing and original, the star ship Avalon is really dope and the ever present feel of isolation the main protagonist experiences is very well presented. In short, the first half of the movie, the part where there is no action at all, is great. <br/><br/>Then, Aurora shows up, a big romance and sudden break-up follows and... the ship starts to malfunction. Perhaps you, like me, had similar thoughts about what triggers the ship to go haywire. A black hole bends the fabric of space, an evil corporation is behind everything, maybe the whole journey is based on a broken promise and was doomed from the beginning. You would think there is a grander theme to all of this, a universal message that reflects our own society, a sudden plot twist that takes this movie into another direction. You get none of that. Instead, it turns out the ship has some bad engineering and the main characters are the only ones that could save the rest of the passengers. Or something like that, I gave up paying attention at this point. What matters is that we could have witnessed how the director of the movie paints a portrait of a human psyche when he introduces elements of Stockholm Syndrome, the negative effects interstellar travel puts on human brain and how isolation destroys someone's will to live. As an alternative, we got a microwaved soup of classic Hollywood clichés, one after another, the next one even more predictable that the previous. It's almost as if there was a different plot with a much better ending somewhere in the beginning of making of this movie, but a group of producers had a meeting where they all agreed ""Nah, the audience is not put to it, scratch it and give me some action! With semi-naked bodies, a lot of explosions and a clock ticking"". Screw you, we deserve better. Of course, there is time and place for pure action and laser beams flying off the screen, but when you promise a psychological sci-fi thriller in extremely cool setting, you keep that promise. I am maybe overreacting, but I feel like I've been back-stabbed. This film could have been so much more, but it seems as revenues mattered more than art. The ending is, well, acceptable, but I really hoped that after an hour of explosions I will at least get recompensed with a scene where the ship reaches its destination, or lack of if that would be the director's choice. Yet once again, no, we get this illogical premise that two people imprisoned in an enormous tin can heading to a destination they will never see can live and be happy ""Adam and Eve"" style for decades without any human interaction other than each other's company. I'll give them 10 years tops and they go mad. And it wouldn't be their fault, we are just not ""programmed"" to be alone. If that wasn't enough, we are constantly being mentally stimulated to scream ""That's ridiculous"" when the plot unfolds. To me, it was: 1. There are 5000 passengers on board the Avalon, all in cryosleep, monitored by an advanced computer AI that keeps them alive as they await the end of they voyage. There is nobody awake who checks if everything's OK, no plan to take turns and wake up for a little bit to monitor the journey's progress. Most of all, there is absolutely no plan B in case one of the pods malfunctions and wakes up its host. Nothing. Your pod was a lemon and you're screwed to the end of your days. Please. 2. When our lovely duet finds out that they can use the ""ultimate human fixing machine"" to go back to sleep, it turns out there's only one such robot aboard this ship. Only one. For 5000 passengers. You can't tell me it was too expensive to buy two for a ship this size and a distance that long. It's literally like having one lifeboat on a transatlantic cruise ship. 3. I always get frustrated when I see how inadequate security features are portrayed in movies that take place in the future. It's either a magnetic card, a stupid watch like id thingy or a fingerprint scanner. Really? My laptop has better security features than that. I really wanted to like this movie and I did, for the first half of it, but after that everything went downhill and I had to force myself to stay till the end. At one point, I was laughing when Chris Pratt character floated away in space and Aurora missed the cable that held him. I really wanted him to float back to Earth and save himself from being resurrected only to die of boredom 50 years later (or however long they lived). Sorry, to disappoint you if you didn't see the Spoiler alert and read this through. You should still see this movie and decide for yourself. In my opinion, it's a missed opportunity."

","Passengers has great special effects, production design but the interesting and intriguing premise of the plot is squandered.<br/><br/>Set in the future, an intergalactic spacecraft is taking a 120 year voyage to another planet to be colonised by five thousand volunteers who are in hibernation.<br/><br/>Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) a mechanical engineer is woken up and thinks the ship has got near the planet. What he finds instead that he is alone and no one else is awake. He cannot get back to his pod and go back to hibernation. He has the ship at his disposal but as he was not a premium passenger he cannot get the premium services such as a better breakfast. His only companion is the android bartender on duty.<br/><br/>After a year, his biological needs gets the better of him and when he sees a beautiful woman in a pod he deliberately wakes her up. She is Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) a journalist and Preston tells her that like him she has woken up due to a malfunction.<br/><br/>Of course he has committed an immoral act by waking her up and she will not be able to get back to hibernation. Aurora will die in this ship before the journey ends.<br/><br/>Pretty soon both of them fall in love, well there is no one else in the ship besides the android bartender and the robo-vacuum cleaners. The film takes a turn when Aurora finds out the truth and it simply becomes a domestic drama of two people with irreconcilable differences.<br/><br/>The last act of the film concerns the pair investigating the increased glitches in the ship, what is causing it and how to fix it. The film is a mash up of different genres and it loses its way a bit.<br/><br/>It also has a strange vision of corporate space colonisation. While Preston is an economy class passenger Aurora is a premium class one. She has a better breakfast when she is awoken but there is no reason for it when the passengers are going to be in long term hibernation apart from the last few months of the journey. When Preston tries to send a distress message back to earth, the message will take years to get back to earth and he is charged a fortune for it. Who will collect the money and how?"
"rockman182","6","3","6","24 February 2017"," Passengers (2016)
","Two of Hollywood's current top stars finally come together in this sci-fi adventure from Morten Tyldum. Its not a name that rolls right off the tongue or is too familiar but I have seen his previous effort, The Imitation Game. While it was a technically well made biopic about an important man, it wasn't all that interesting. I wasn't too impressed with the trailers for Passengers as it looked like a cookie cutter sci-fi film coming in a time where these types of films are really popular.<br/><br/>The film is basically what I had feared that it would be. First, let me talk about the positives. I had no problems with the effects in the film. I thought the space scenes looked good and the set and production design was excellent. The spaceship looked sleek, modern, and alluring. The score was also nice. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence work well together and put in good performances. I think Lawrence overacts in the really emotional moments but its fine because she's good elsewhere here.<br/><br/>The film suffers from pauses and lagging for the first hour or so. Its repetitive at times ad just seems really inconsequential. Nothing goes on for a majority of the film and it drags a slight bit. I did not feel like the film really explored amazingly new ground. Films like Interstellar and Moon covered similar concepts and in a much better way. Its easy to question and scratch your head at some of the motivations of the characters (and androids). About an hour in I was really struggling to continue with the film but soldiered through.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of Pratt or J-Law you may want to check this out. If you are like me and an avid sci-fi/space film fan you may be sorely disappointed by the generic and familiar nature of a film that should have really dazzled with the stakes that the film seemed to offer. Still, I guess you could find some enjoyment out of this film despite it being pretty flawed. Not every film is going to be a masterpiece, I just expected this film to offer something better and more engaging.<br/><br/>6/10"
"FelixMH","4","3","6","23 February 2017"," What a fantastic idea combining sci-fi space survival thriller with rom-com
","Yep, Passengers is like 2 completely different films carelessly stitched together. It not only failed to add comedy to a serious space sci-fi survival premise, but also failed to even be a half-decent sci- fi movie, which is what it's supposed to be in the first place.<br/><br/>The space sci-fi portion is so formulaic that anyone who has watched a few movies or played a few video games of the genre can predict the entire plot at the very beginning without much effort, because Passengers utilized every single trope the writers could think of, from space mental illness to a few people fixing a vast spaceship to venting the reactor.<br/><br/>Moreover, Passengers blatantly copied very specific stylistic elements of movies/games of the genre. The opening is almost identical to Pandorum, the spaceship is the same as WALL-E's Axiom, the survival element is very similar to Alien and Dead Space minus the monsters, the infirmary med-pod is lifted directly from Prometheus, the sun slingshot scene reminds me of Sunshine, not to mention the bar from the Shinning. In addition, Laurence Fishburne may just be reference to Event Horizon. These were completely beyond ""paying homage"" as they are central to the movie's story, rather than a passing cameo or an innocuous Easter Egg hidden in the background.<br/><br/>All in all, Passengers packaged banal and trite spaceship sci-fi clichés with a romantic comedy and tried to pass it off as something fresh. Instead, they could have tried to bring some life into the trapped on a spaceship premise through a compelling story."

You actually felt like being in this situation on a gorgeous spaceship with actual purpose and function.<br/><br/>This is also were the story has it's strength. The movie had a classical three-part structure and i really enjoyed the feel and handling of the first part. The more romantic second and action-pact third part are more falling apart.

","WHAT'S PASSENGERS ABOUT? A man and woman wake up from cryo-sleep on a futuristic space flight decades before the other passengers.<br/><br/>IS IT ANY GOOD? (GRADE: C+) On paper, talented and attractive Hollywood stars Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt should make for an ideal on screen romance. Indeed, one reason Passengers works as well as it does it their ability to elevate the material. Their chemistry suffers, however, from a under-cooked screenplay that hinges on deus ex- machina plot conveniences, laughable dialogue, and questionable ethics that give the romance a bit of a creepy vibe. Still, the visuals are phenomenal, the impressive sets alone are worth the price of a matinée, the stars are solid (Michael Sheen nearly steals the show as an android bartender), and the ending is emotionally-satisfying. Passengers is worth seeing if you're a fan of sci-fi, romance, or the actors, but it fails to meet its potential.<br/><br/>IS IT OKAY FOR YOUR KIDS? Passengers is rated PG-13. It features one f-word and several moderate profanities. We see a man's naked rear end as he walks around a spaceship. A woman wears a revealing swimsuit. There's two sex scenes (one right after the other), one of which features obscured nudity. There are intense moments of peril.<br/><br/>ANY WORTHWHILE MESSAGES?

"Tweetienator","5","3","6","30 January 2017"," Rushed, Lack of Substance
","Passengers is okay - but be aware that it is at least 50% a kind of romance/drama and not sci-fi. Also I got the impression that everything is kinda rushed or just superficially touched (he gets lost in space, Lawrence jumps into suit and within 2 mins he is back on board, than he's dead, and 1 min later he's alive again etc. pp.) and of course you get a lot of Hollywood pathos etc.<br/><br/>First of all my main problem is the story itself - common guys, our hero is an engineer who can repair the main reactor (alone!) but after waking up he never really wonders or ask himself why his pod failed, why all the malfunctions are occurring and progressing!? Well, with that amount of time at hand and not much to do (besides dancing and basketball) he showed a tremendous lack of interest into technical stuff - at least for an engineer... Also why not wake - maybe a nice female ;) - a member of the crew to open the door to the ship- bridge!? And did he really tried to open that pressure door with a hammer and a small welding machine!? And an engineer who makes a call for help but he doesn't know that his message will take years to reach earth and years to get the answer back!? Or why there is no main-control- system to talk to!? And on this ship all systems are on although there is some serious and progressing issue with the main generator-system!? Questions raised, but no answers - with this kind of design imo this space-travel is a suicid-mission...<br/><br/>So what's left to say!? ofc Lawrence, Pratt, Sheen (Sheens performance as droid-bartender is imo the highlight of the movie and maybe a reference to Kubrick's Shining!?) and Fishburne can play, and the cgi etc. is pro, and the scenario of Passengers had potential but failed to deliver to be great - movies like Sunshine or the classic Silent Running beat Passengers easy.

","Beautiful story of people's longings for beauty, companionship, love, and meaning. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence give compelling performances. An excellent plot and realistic though heart-wrenching decisions make the story incredibly satisfying.<br/><br/>The characters' choices drive the movie. Their choices and the consequences are dealt with in a believable and entertaining way, and each decision feels weighty and pervasive. Ignore the negative reviews; the critics are way off on this one. Most of them have a knee jerk reaction to one of the plot's main decisions without weighing the unique circumstances the characters are placed in. At no point in this movie is there any compulsion or coercion, and the fateful decision of the movie, though difficult, is not so from any malicious overtone. Rather the decision hinges more on human frailty than anything else, and it is intended to make us empathize with the characters, feeling the burden of the situation. Even so, the movie makes no attempt to justify this decision, but lets the viewer weigh it and the consequences that follow with the characters. These consequences are also dealt with in a realistic and compelling manner and are resolved in a satisfactory way that respects the choices and wills of the other characters.<br/><br/>All in all, a beautiful film with a great story. It touches on transcendental themes that have affected all men and women at all times, and through its poignant moments, brilliant acting, and compelling story, it conveys a story that is both satisfying and inspiring."

"steerpike_2002","8","3","6","9 January 2017"," Strong movie that fails to fulfil its ambition
","""Passengers"" has received a very negative appraisal from many critics, scoring a paltry 31% on Rotten Tomatoes at the time of writing. After seeing the movie, I find it hard to comprehend what it is that so many critics disliked. It seems to me that a film that has attempted a very ambitious concept and not wholly succeeded has been disproportionately punished for its ambition and that had director Morten Tyldum and writer Jon Spaihts aimed lower they might have been received more positively.<br/><br/>At its heart, ""Passengers"" is a morality tale. Jim (Chris Pratt) is accidentally awoken 30 years into a 120 year space flight and, unable to put himself back to sleep, he faces spending the rest of his life alone while the other 5,000 passengers sleep out the rest of the journey. He becomes obsessed with Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), a writer also making the journey. Before long, his desire for company overwhelms him and he wakes her up, condemning her to share his fate. Jim keeps his terrible secret from Aurora and allows a romantic connection to form between them.<br/><br/>The concept is flawlessly introduced. The pacing of the first act is perfect, the film patient enough to display the desperation of Jim's position and throwing in enough humour to prevent things becoming unduly depressing. Jim's dilemma - encapsulated in his question to Arthur, the robot bartender (played wonderfully by Michael Sheen), ""If you were stuck on a desert island for the rest of your life and had the ability to wish someone there but neither of you would ever be able to leave, would you do it?"" - is a fascinating moral problem that the film at least begins to address with some depth. It is hard to imagine an audience member not asking themselves whether they think they would display the willpower to remain forever alone and spare the life of another.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film does eventually fail to maintain the serious examination of this problem and the third act of the movie descends into unnecessary action shenanigans and a woefully neat solution to the moral dilemma is forged. There are definite signs here that a room of suits decided that the audience shouldn't be forced to reflect on whether Jim should be forgiven for his actions or how human nature and endless empty time might interact with each other to produce complicated reactions that reach beyond the moral examination of a fortune cookie. For this the film does fail in its initial ambition.<br/><br/>In my view however, the first 90 minutes of this movie are worth the viewing and elevate the film beyond the average popcorn movie that it could so easily have been from the outset. The performances from Pratt, Lawrence and Sheen are all very strong, aided in no small part by grounded, relatable dialogue from Spaihts. This everyman feel to the movie, so necessary to allow us to put ourselves in the centre of the moral dilemma, should have been allowed to continue into the third act, and is shattered by the unlikely heroics at the end.<br/><br/>It does seem to me that had the creators of this film decided to begin this movie in a much simpler, more action-centred way, it would not have been so harshly treated and could easily have been received by critics in a way comparable to Marvel movies of recent years - conventional, predictable and well-trodden stories, capably rendered for the screen. By attempting something fresher and more complex, ""Passengers"" has instead been punished for reaching a little higher and coming one act short of something special."

"azanti0029","7","3","6","4 January 2017"," Beautifully shot, well made, extremely engrossing - surely a contender for Best Production Design?
","Passengers - another film that in my view seems to be getting a bit of an unfair kicking from the press, so I am pleased to see many others like myself agree this is a great film. It certainly deserves to be, stuck as it has been in development hell for several years with different actors and directors coming and going.<br/><br/>Its the future (You know, the place you want to live in yourself one day, but sadly ain't going to be around for...) and we're on board the Starship Avalon, a vessel owned by the Homestead Corporation who makes billions of dollars transporting Colonists to new worlds (Don't tell Trump it will give him ideas) around the galaxy and plan do so with the 5000 colonists on board here. The ship is automated and everyone is in hyper sleep including the crew. (A bit like flying on Ryan Air) Everyone will only awaken when the ship is one month out from the destination but unfortunately a large asteroid storm does some damage to the vessel and a pod activates early belonging to young Jim Peston (Pratt, probably his best performance yet) a lowly mechanic who can only access the cheap meals option at the breakfast canteen and has the low budget accommodations (Air BnB) options on board. When Jim realises he has woken 90 years early and cannot wake any other crew who are behind a security sealed door he knows he will die on the ship alone. A year passes before he considers an alternative way of living. His only other company is a bar serving agreeable talking Android called Arthur (Michael Sheen on perfect form as always) In time Jim comes to know the biographies of his fellow passengers and one in particular, a writer not uneasy on the eye, Aurora (Lawrence) gets his attention. Jim learns everything about her from her own diaries and discovers she plans to write a book about her journey to the new world. Jim soon learns he has the ability to wake other passengers up and is faced with a dilemma, wake the girl of his dreams so he is not cosigned to his fate alone or die lonely in space before ever reaching his destination. I guess he could have searched for someone with really good computer skills so he could find the code for that door and wake up the crew, but sadly this thought escapes him or perhaps the new world has no computers?<br/><br/>Passengers had me gripped from the word go, from its sleek production design to Pratt's restrained but charming performance there was much to enjoy here. The ship and the dilemma facing Jim seemed all too believable. It felt as though this was the sort of thing one could experience while trying to correct your mobile phone provider and eventually your forced to make a difficult decision. It would not be the first time in history man kind had paid for the choice of cost effectiveness over safety simply because nothing had gone wrong in the past (Like no staff in your cinema screen to tell that bloody girl to get off her mobile phone) but this aside it is the crux of the morale dilemma that faced Jim Preston that really made the film great. I found myself asking how would I deal with the same situation? This is what Passengers asks of you. Jennifer Lawrence is on fine form in the film as well in the role of Aurora and Sheen adds an appropriate level of humour in his role as the dumb waiter of the piece but it is Chris Pratt who really stole the film for me. An actor normally associated with comical quips and nods to camera for Parks and Recreation he really shows his emotional depths and range here.<br/><br/>As the characters deal with the additional problems facing them, other dilemmas present themselves and again I found myself asking the same questions as were asked of the characters as the story progressed. This is a sure sign of both clever writing and film making. <br/><br/>Another mention must also go to the outstanding production design. Certainly there is some use of CGI here, but the sets and the CGI design of the star ship are simply incredible and blend perfectly together. The Avalon felt like a real ship that must be out there somewhere. Everything seemed so real and the space walk scenes were as dramatically tense as one would expect the real thing to be.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and as others have stated it is suitable for those of all ages though the younger children may find it a little wanting due to lack of action but I was rarely if ever bored. <br/><br/>Lawrence Fishburne has a nice cameo in the film, but to explain who or how would be to give a spoiler away. I thought this film would benefit too from being seen on the big screen and I was right. The vastness of the empty locations of the ghostly star ship are very much enhanced by the cinema experience. <br/><br/>My compliments to the whole team on this production. The price tag for the film seemed a little on the high side but it certainly looks the part and the cast gave it there all (So they should for 50K a minute)<br/><br/>Recommended."

","I guess this is one of those films that a guy would see because it is set in space and a girl would see because of the romance. Okay, maybe I am being a little stereo-typical, but this is one of those films that seems to be trying to appeal to two types of audiences. Mind you, I would be much more inclined to see a film like Passengers as opposed to La La Land, but then again I suspect that there are a lot of women out there that are more included to see La La Land as opposed to Passengers, but once again I am just speculating.<br/><br/>The film is about a colony ship that is spending 120 years traveling from Earth to a new colony, and everybody on the ship is asleep. About a third of the way there the ship hits a massive asteroid belt and causes some systems to malfunction. At about the same time one of the passengers awakes thinking that he is almost there only to discover that he still has 90 years to go. The problem is that he cannot get back to sleep. This is were temptation arises as he can't access the crew quarters, and thus is left alone with a bartender robot, so he decides to wake a rather attractive woman up as well. Everything turns out okay until she discovers that he woke her up on purpose, and all the while the ship's systems are continuing to malfunction (and without access to the crew's quarters there is no way they can find out what the actual problem is).<br/><br/>In a way this film is pretty predictable – it is a romance anyway so it works on the principle of boy gets girl, boy loses girl, boy does something heroic and they fall in love forever. Okay, one can suggest that by waking her up he did actually save the entire ship, and I suspect that she eventually realises that. However, being stuck alone on a ship for the rest of your life may seem great, but it would push human tolerance to the absolute limit. The other thing is that while they are trying to be scientifically accurate, one does wonder what exactly exists at the end of the rainbow – we are speaking of some incredibly vast distances here, and with the rate at which history moves, by the time they arrive everything and everybody they know will be long gone.<br/><br/>The other thing is that nobody actually knows first of all if the planet is inhabitable (it would take years to get a scout ship there and then years to get any information back, if the scout ship actually arrives). However, in the end what we have is more of a science-fiction romance than anything really serious, and the practicalities of such a trek is probably not meant to get in the way. However, I simply cannot help but think that this whole process is little more than a massive con by a corporation to milk millions of dollars out of unsuspecting individuals (and the crew are basically a bunch of convicts that are placed in there to give the illusion of a legitimate enterprise)."

","Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is a mechanic on board of the Avalon spaceship, voyaging in space from Earth to Homestead II in 120 years, carrying 5000 humans looking to colonize a new planet. Everybody is in hibernation when still 90 years away from Homestead II, Jim is mistakenly awakened. Not knowing what caused this malfunction and not being able to put himself back to sleep, Jim has to face his life inside the ship and resist the urge of waking up other passengers, one in particular who he has taken an interest for: Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>Being a gigantic Sci-Fi fan you could say that it is hard to get a better packaged movie than this: two great A-list actors, a good director, a blacklist script and a fu**ing amazing premise. I was very excited for the film and as usual had not watched or read any promotional material so when I entered the theater I was surprised to get a film that I really did not expect, one that was hugely problematic, but had such a beautiful grit to it hat I could not resist it.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" is one of the most strange filmmaking efforts I have ever seen. I don't mean tonally or stylistically, I mean from the perspective of filmmaking itself: it gave me a mixture of feelings that I rarely have ever had watching a film. This film is flawed and deeply so and I mean it, it has some really, really bad stuff in it, but what really shocked me about it is just how it managed to keep me interested and attached to the narrative no matter how many left turns it took, I was always absorbed by it despite the really heavy problems that weigh it down.<br/><br/>Talking about those, the plot really has some issues. It is tonally unbalanced and switches from one scenario to the other way too quickly. Moreover, it is handled terribly, with the chain of the events spiraling way to conveniently for its own good. It manages to fill many holes by heavy exposition scenes, yet you can't help but see a flaw in the structure. I won't go in to spoilers, but there's a detail in the film that adds even more to the weak mechanics of this plot that moves forward very unconvincingly, even though I'll say that it manages to give the film a pace that no matter how strange brings it to an interesting climax and an overall exponential chain of events.<br/><br/>I mean lets look at the editing of this film now. It is truly something abysmal, I was left wordless to see such bad editing in a professional 100 million dollar Hollywood picture. I mean when they're having a conversation it is borderline fine switching from shot to reverse shot, but I was aghast seeing how they put together sequences. There are scenes that have absolutely zero continuity to them, switching form moving shot to steady and back again another two times without having any sense in it. The way it jump cuts at times actually hurt my eye as it was done so poorly. And probably worst of all is the editing on a macroscopic scale: the montages are absolutely disorientating, they switch back and forth at times with scenes for time slots of 30 seconds each and it starts giving you a headache. Moreover, how the film jumps from one location to the other is baffling to say the least, it makes cuts that are truly disgusting and have no place in a professional film like this. I was truly amazed at what I saw.<br/><br/>Still, none of the weirdly gargantuan problems above managed to overcome what is a beautiful story about two people falling in love in the most unique conditions. More and more as I review and watch films I discover the value of novelty and originality and the film's premise is just too genius for me not to be constantly interested, especially because it keeps you on your toes, I can confidently say that I was always uncertain of what was going to happen next and that made for a gratifying watch.<br/><br/>If the film partially fails on plot it does not on story. There might be different elements that scream ""Studio-Tampering"" here and bother the continuity, but the the story managers to overcome those, one again showing its power, and it never looses its charm. The characters are really interesting and their situation is even more so.<br/><br/>Pratt and Lawrence have to be really commended for portraying a romance that is so believable I got lost in it. You buy so much into their chemistry, their dynamic, their unique situation you get swallowed by a portrayal of a relationship that is raw and beautiful in smallest moments. I don't know if my romantic side is just exaggerating, but as much as I wanted to let this film go because of its continuous annoying and frustrating problems, I simply could not. I was captivated by the characters and their journey, it was never repetitive and always gave you something new to chew on. I left the theater really feeling something and being touched by the emotional relationship that was established. There is a point towards the end of the film that really made me realize how much I had actually liked it, it is a line of Aurora and it was representative of all of the character change these two people go through and really made me reflect upon themes that the film looks at.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" is a beautiful love story set in space, an original film that wastes some potential and frustrates you repeatedly because of its huge flaws, but one whose sheer power in storytelling and charm manages to overcome the problems and give you a satisfying experience."
"secretzfan","6","3","6","29 December 2016"," A interesting idea that falters a bit in execution
","Passengers is a interesting tale about a man named Jim who wakes up early on a space ship and has to live a life alone in solitude on it. Sadly though he just hates being alone and makes the worst decision of his life by waking of Jennifer Lawrence's character named Auora, and from there that is how the story continues on. <br/><br/>Passengers is a very beautiful looking movie with a lot of great visuals. The ship that they are on looking really amazing and very cool and was one of the first things that captivated me about this film. It was so interesting just to look at. Everything about it felt lived in and part of this bigger world. This was something I found that I loved about the movie from start to finish and was defiantly its best feature. <br/><br/>This is also a movie with a lot of neat concepts going on in it. From the way solitude can affect us, and the decisions that we make and how they affect others around us. Sadly though the film doesn't go as far enough in those concepts as you would wish and instead tries to take a more safer route instead making for a slightly less interesting film with a narrative that feels a bit more flat and standard. <br/><br/>This feels like a good film that has a really great film that is trying to break free from within it. There are so many parts of the film that are still good and kept me interested as I was never bored within it, but I couldn't help but feel that it was missing something too. Something that was more thought provoking. <br/><br/>As it stands I do thing Passengers is a OK film to watch, but not one you need to rush out to see unless you just really want to look at the pretty visuals."
"paulwalsh-33212","6","3","6","29 December 2016"," Fairly Forgettable
","This film is OK. For me its too polished and is essentially pretty shallow. The basketball scenes were so obvious that it was painful to watch. The two leads are also far too pretty, perfect and polished to be believable. Chris Pratt seems to be starring in a number of generic, shallow films with Jurassic Park and Magnificent 7. Pity, as he was really great in Guardians of the Galaxy. Jennifer Lawrence hasn't been in a film Iv'e liked since the first Hunger Games. She's stunningly beautiful but really quite boring in this. <br/><br/>The films sets up an interesting story and the opening 30 minutes are riveting. I liked the moral dilemma Pratt was forced to confront, aloneness or to live selfishly with a companion. Things could have got much more interesting had they gone darker, but instead it all goes a little bit too idealistic and sweet, and begins to drag as it dolefully plays out to its inevitable and obvious finale. Lawrence seems to forgive Pratt far too easily, once again underlining how shallow this film is at times. They wonder around the ship hand in hand sipping drinks and going for meals. Really?<br/><br/>Passengers isn't too bad, there are many worse blockbusters, Its just that its very forgettable. Perhaps Christmas is a good time for release. ""Nice"" films ordinarily get released around Christmas and this one unfortunately falls into that category."

","The idea of the movie is that the characters are in the future: -spaceships -advanced tech -a valet which is not human (a robot) -flying in space (close to the sun) The costumes did not say that they are in the future, and that is what creates the character, the actor ""wore"" that ""shiny"" or ""difficult"" to understand costume. And this mistake is made by thousands of movies since 2010 about ""FUTURE"" or ""SPACE Traveling"" that could make you want to be that character. Costume design, costume creators and so on, don't exist anymore and make the simple consumer to not identify with the character.<br/><br/>You go to cinema and dream about traveling in space, close to the sun (as the trailer suggests), but you only find advanced tech that eliminates the individual, the human being of still existing in this movie.<br/><br/>I don't know how good is Chris Pratt as an actor, but as a simple consumer (and long observer of these small details in any movies) I don't want to dream about being all bulky in space but something thats not me I want."
"yrwann","2","6","17","1 January 2017"," Between two stools.
","This movie falls to the ground really hard.<br/><br/>Creators of the film did set the ambitious and extremely difficult task. Making a movie with a simple plot, limited amount of characters; with romance and action elements in a modern SF shell, promising to be a piece of art.   What filmmakers had initially? - Good, professional and profitable cast - Budget - A fine director *well I did think so* -Aggressive marketing. U can not wish more.<br/><br/>Shades of genres replace each other during the movie. Adventure, Drama, Romance. What did we get after all?<br/><br/>All Random mode is real here. Random events force random people to make random actions yet the trailer promises us an interesting and captivating story. If you are here for a good screenplay - pass by. <br/><br/>There were a lot of prerequisites for huge dramatic twists. But we get nothing. All the rough edges are softened. The plot makes characters live in a disbelief world. No dramatic events at all. A $ 110000000 movie (my head hurts) denies basic laws of physics several times. It is a classic flaw of crappy SF movies: when some horrifyingly complicated engine is going crazy and all is falling apart, you already know halfway through how the problem will be solved.<br/><br/>Romance? More like bromance. While perfect acting of Chris Pratt actually is believable, Jennifer looks like a lackluster. A simple eye candy whom Chris leaves no ""blanket"". The dissonance makes acting chemistry look questionable. Typical ""Love u, hate u, ah, screw this, love u again"". You can not empathize with the female hero: even if she dies, well, good for us. Like the world needed another annoying ass selfish writer who can not even write.<br/><br/>Action and visual effects were on point. The set decorator and the production designer did a lot of work. And again we are facing the ugly truth of the modern filmmaking: graphics and world design out-weights, distracts, aims to hide ALL the flaws of the screenplay and directing.<br/><br/>Enormous amount of resources (human and financial) were invested in this just to make a beautiful picture which gives nothing new, fresh or artistically valuable. Everything is used a lot of times. Here ""Gravity"" cosplay, there some robovac and android trivia. Not one bit creativity.<br/><br/>1 star for well-crafted environment and visuals. 1 star for Chris Pratt as he carried the only exciting first minutes.<br/><br/>The rest is not worth mentioning. U can never trick a true connoisseur of movie art. No CGI can replace good old directing and screenplay, not today. Sorry 'bout that."

The ones that are trying to sell me something: gays, and now trans (50 shades of crazy), multi-culti, communism, political correctness in all its various strains, and horror get a zero. When you think about it, that's about 80-90% of today's movies. <br/><br/>The action movies are in trouble too. So many rely on tons and tons of CGI (x-men, avengers etc.) Some are all CGI (Jupiter Rising, Adventureland). The former are bad. The latter are worse. <br/><br/>Some movies that could otherwise be good, are destroyed when the star appears on screen. He or she has been so politically active (Meryl Streep, Ben Affleck) that my reaction is, There's that bitch or moron, who wants to teach me what's right and wrong. I have a priest or rabbi for that. It takes me right out of the movie. These dumb actors are supposed to entertain me, play a role and disappear. I won't go see them anymore. They are just killing their box office. How smart are they?<br/><br/>All the above is so that I could get to 10 lines of text and say something about this movie. So here goes.<br/><br/>I loved it. It was set in the future, so, sci-fi and every drop of CGI (just beautiful) added to the movie. It was a delicious love story with wonderful actors, and it raised a novel and interesting moral dilemma. It was witty and the dialogue was funny and clever.<br/><br/>In the end love conquered all (I like that.) It was the exact opposite of La La Land, which was of the opinion, that career and fame were more important than love, which may be true, but it's not how I like my movies or books. I loved La La Land until the ending, which left me with the taste of ashes in my mouth. I gave it a 7 instead of a 10, because of the ending. Of course, Hollywood loved it. It's full of people who gave up all to be in movies. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence, Emma Stone, Ryan Gosling, and Chris Pratt are our new A-list."

The characters were interesting, funny, intelligent and the chemistry between the characters felt real.<br/><br/>However the story had its weak moments. There were events which in short were not realistic but i chose to ignore. They were not big deal but it felt like it degraded the movie alittle bit. There was also the moral dilemma which i suspect is one of the reasons why it has such low rating and criticism. It's really about how each person perceived it.

","Passengers is the movie that confirmed for me that film critics are not qualified to rate movies for anyone but film critics. Throughout this movie, I kept thinking to myself, this should be a best picture nominee. I mean it was really well done. I also was astonished at how critics could pan this wonderful film. Perhaps I am overrating the movie due to some personal bias, however I generally have had a feel for Oscar worthy endeavors. First, if a movie convinces you, rather than simply makes you accept plot elements, then that is the hallmark of a well filmed movie. Passengers creates moral and emotional dilemmas and convinces you of their validity. Also, the chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence is solid. You find yourself contemplating how you would proceed given the scenarios faced by the actors in this great movie. Go and see this thoughtful, emotional, satisfying Sci fi movie. You will not be disappointed. An added plus is some terrific imagery and Sci fi moments that are the relish to the contemplative and moral sandwich that the filmmakers prepared for you to consume."

Sci-fi asks us to suspend some disbelief, but the director never gets a blank check. Once a film creates a universe with its own rules, the director is responsible for maintaining those rules. Failure to do so, drops the viewer out of suspended disbelief, insulting our intelligence along the way. This is both wrong and expensive. It's painful to the audience, it's also painful to the movie's box-office earnings. <br/><br/>Sorry about the rant, I did like the movie and do recommend it. Wish I could give it a 9 or 10."

Christ Pratt plays the main role and is continuously attempting to make jokes throughout the entire movie. The comedic relief is well not really relief I found myself laughing at the pure stupidity of the jokes. The plot follows a basic story of two falling into a seemingly unethical romance.

It is also the pent ultimate in ""heroics"" as it symbolizes human mastery over the universe that is forever expanding. It is Humanity's shining hour; it is humanity's Raison d'etre. Genro, the Captain of the pleasure and luxury liner, has erroneously met his Void Pilot in dry dock, which turns out to be his undoing, as the Void Pilots are always the unknown members of the complement.

","The trailer for this sci-fi love story put our male character (Chris Pratt) and our female character (Jennifer Lawrence) on an equal footing, as does the poster - in fact, Lawrence is ABOVE Pratt in the poster. However, any fears of this being some kind of feminist propaganda are soon alleviated by the fact that the story is mainly through the eyes of our hero - the man!<br/><br/>We see him wake up from his hibernation pod 90 years too early, while 5000 other travellers remain sleeping. The poor chap tries to make the best of it, but understandably begins to get a bit sad and maybe even a little loopy. After about a year of loneliness (perhaps about 25 minutes into the film) he decides to wake up one of the sleeping hotties, after falling madly in love with her due to her aforementioned hotness and maybe a bit because of whatever personality he could ascertain from watching videos of her on the ship computers records.<br/><br/>Now, some of you more sensitive types may think that this was somewhat naughty of him, to condemn a young woman to a life aboard the ship with only him (and, admittedly, a very charming Michael Sheen android) as company. And, I have to admit that one of the films few faults is that Pratt agonises over this decision for far too long - why wouldn't she want to spend her life with you and you alone?? You're a man and she is a woman; of course she'll do what you decide, you're a goddamn hero, man. It's as if consent is important or something - political correctness gone mad!!<br/><br/>And - obviously! - she falls in love with him. Sure, she doesn't know the circumstances of her waking up, but the merits of keeping that a secret were perfectly well proven when (about an hour in), she finds out and gets all hysterical. Like, proper crazy and angry. You love him, don't you? What does it matter that he chose the life you were going to have to lead until your death and cornered you into loving him? It's about the destination, not the journey sweetheart.<br/><br/>I saw one libtard reviewer saying that the film should have been from her POV; from when she woke up so that the audience are in the dark about him waking her, too, therefore making the twist of her finding out an unsettling and creepy reveal. But that would have been dumb, because that would have made the guy look really bad and the woman look like some kind of victim. And as if obsessive and deceitful behaviour in trying to get a woman to sleep with you is unacceptable. Plus, when they have to work together in the final third of the film, to save the ship and other passengers, it would have created a weird tension about whether the guy was actually good or not. And who wants that kind of ambiguity and social commentary in a film? Yawn. Leave that to the Frenchies.<br/><br/>It is just such a beautiful love story as it is. Our male protagonist proves time and time again that he is the intelligent one and can save the day. This proves to her that he is a real man and a provider, who can give her security. He can FIX things but also has a sensitive side. A clever way of showing this in the film, is when he plants a tree on the ship. Lovely. What normal woman wouldn't fall madly in love with him? I also liked that she had the chance to hibernate again but she chooses a life with him because he is so great. Plus, this then makes the whole thing her idea, completely absolving the man of any guilt so, social justice warriors, there's that apparent moral conundrum solved.<br/><br/>If you want to see an original sci-fi with a strong male lead and super-hot female love interest, along with some astounding visuals and action scenes, then look no further!!!"

","As soon as I saw the promotional material for ""Passengers"", I was concerned. It looked for all the world like the stereotypical, glossy flick that uses slick special effects to cover up for the fact that it is hollow both in terms of plot and character. On the other hand, this is the exact genre of film that I love, and Jennifer Lawrence's presence will never dissuade me from a film. As it turned out, I was indeed the sucker for seeing this film, which personifies the concept of ""Hollywood slick"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""Passengers"" is the story of the spacecraft Avalon, which is transporting a crew of 5,000 to a new planet that will be colonized much like Earth. A malfunction occurs, and Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up too early...about 90 years too early, to be exact. After some time of crippling loneliness, he makes the momentous decision to wake up fellow passenger Aurora (Lawrence). The duo quickly discover the reason behind the malfunctions and must work together to get the journey back on track.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" is a film completely devoid of any interesting plot devices or character development. The whole thing is just too ""convenient"". All the main beats can be predicted a mile away, there is no chemistry between Pratt & Lawrence, and what passes for ""character development"" in the movie is laughable. A high school film student could have created more interesting, in-depth characters.<br/><br/>As such, ""Passengers"" is clearly a paint-by-numbers, ""vehicle"" film in which everyone involved knew it would make X amount of dollars of profit. In that sense, it hits all the right beats: set in space, slick visuals, Pratt for the ladies, Lawrence for the gentleman, yadda yadda yadda. Creatively, however, those elements add up to absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>Perhaps I'm being a bit too harsh in giving ""Passengers"" the rock-bottom 1-star treatment (taken strictly as a film it is maybe 2-stars at best), but partially I'm just angry that Hollywood can continue to put out such lackluster efforts. This is especially true when they tantalize me with some of my ""favorite cinema things"" (sci-fi, Lawrence, etc.) and then produce such a soulless flop. I'm not completely anti-Hollywood or anything like that, but it still galls me that ""Passengers"" can: 1. Even be made; and 2. Be made so poorly with all the money behind it.<br/><br/>Simply put: ""Passengers"" was one of the most boring, predictable, asinine movies I've seen in quite some time. I can see children liking it (for the visuals and extremely simple plot), date couples flocking to it (for the mass appeal of Pratt & Lawrence), but that is about it. Creatively, the tank gauge rests fully on ""Empty""."

","The movie is simple, but profound. It's not about romantic notions of youth or sci-fi adventures, though we are treated to very enthralling action sequences, nonetheless. It's about discovering your true self and developing a rewarding connection with another sole that could be truly life saving.<br/><br/>Enveloping space sceneries pull you into the cosmic depths. The rotating space ship makes you feel like sailing though the skies rather than feeling trapped in a tin can. Superb acting, when facial expressions are all you need to feel an array of conflicting emotions, makes the movie a delight to watch. Very true to life glitches caused by the electronic brain create a creditable environment. <br/><br/>The moral dilemma Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) faces seems so outrageous to many, but don't we all pursue our desires and base our actions on what we want without giving a thought of what others need. We violate the free will of other people easily on a daily basis. <br/><br/>The movie offers an interesting concept, how it feels, when you free yourself of all social, corporate and family constraints. What remains of you, if you dissociate yourself from all imposed duties and obligations. Suffering of the people stranded without an illusory purpose and personal value is ineffable, unless they could look into themselves and find courage to trust and really know another human being. <br/><br/>Jon Spaihts encourages us to search for answers to the multiple questions. What is real happiness and how to achieve it, if you have no society to feed you egoistic mind and encourage you cravings for the things that boost your self-importance. Does your happiness depend on the place, surroundings, situations and events, or you are still the same person despite the change of scenery. Dou you really always need to be in another place and spend your life waiting for something better? <br/><br/>Many viewers find the concept of just being and living your life boring, but it's the only thing that we have."

","In the sea of action and fantasy, sci-fi and superheros this one was real refreshment. I usually don't like 3D movies because I think, for lot of them, that they would be much better in 2D. Sometimes action scenes are so blurry, they almost don't have any other point except filling time. This one made me think twice about 3D technology. Not only there were no blurry moments, but the picture was beautifully pleasant to watch throughout whole movie. J.L. is one of my favorite young actresses, and C.P. conquered my heart in GotG. No wonder I was excited to see them together in space. Ship design is something really special, really beautiful. Story is not just another love story, or just another space utopia story. Two of them might be the only ones awake on the ship, but you won't be bored for a second."
"SangamYadagiri","9","3","7","8 January 2017"," Passengers - An interstellar love story
","Passengers is by far my favorite sci-fi drama. It's on par with the previously released movies of the genre such as 2001: A Space Odyssey, Interstellar, The Martian etc. Only here, we see a nice love story on the interstellar journey. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt performed extremely well in the movie. Their chemistry on screen is what makes the audiences connect to the narration of the story. Brief but effective appearances by Lawrence Fishburne as spaceship captain and Michael Sheen as an android bartender leave their mark on the viewers. But it's the journey itself that's makes us glued to the screen till the end. <br/><br/>Coming to the storytelling, there is not much, I would say, a malfunction in the hibernation pod makes the hero awaken prematurely only to learn that there is still 90 years of journey left in the total 120 year journey to reach the earth-like planet. Then how he gets a companion and live a little for the rest of his and her lives is dramatized very well.<br/><br/>From astronomical sense, the interstellar journey is till not available yet to the human kind. But it's possible in near future that we humans may be able to find a habitable planet in our or neighborhood galaxy to colonize. It's already discovered that there is a planet that is orbiting one of the nearest triple-star system Proxima Centauri (orbiting other two stars Alpha Centauri A and B). What we are not capable of now is the means to travel with near speed of light to the nearest star which itself will take hundreds of years to reach there. As the famous astro-futurist Michio Kaku mentioned in one of his speeches, it's the engineering capability that's preventing us from travelling among stars. It's true that NASA did not yet invent other kinds of fuels such as nuclear/laser/gravitation wave riding/ hypothetical wormholes except for the current chemical propulsion which is used by rockets. It's not even confirmed that the planet orbiting Proxima Centauri, a red giant is with in the goldilocks zone with in the right distance from it's parent star making water and atmosphere possible. <br/><br/>Leaving all these theories aside, the movie simply focuses love story between two humans who are alone on the cosmic journey - hence the title ""Passengers"". It's a very engaging narration from start to finish which cannot be described in mere words. There is not too much science element that would deviate the viewer and not too much love story either, but just the right amount of both which is what makes the movie a fresh. The other movies in this genre focus either too much on science or action or aliens or philosophical aspect. <br/><br/>Though the movie is termed as a popcorn movie, I have thoroughly enjoyed watching it on the big screen. Though the movie becomes dull at times, there are some exciting sequences too such as floating in space out side the ship, gravity loss, slingshot around a red giant etc. Overall it's a very engaging movie. My rating is 9 out of 10."
"christian94","9","3","7","5 January 2017"," Effective Space Travel and Love Story
","Morten Tyldum is one of the best up and coming director in my opinion and I thoroughly enjoyed his fine Norwegian crime thriller Headhunters (2011) and even more so his multi-Oscar nominated, including for best directing, The Imitation Game (2014) which may have been the best movie of that year. I was looking forward to this science-fiction project, a genre I like when it delivers on its promises, and the trailer even though it looked commercial, seemed promising. Unfortunately, it seems the critics picked the movie apart and I hesitated and doubted before seeing it, but decided that Tyldum was worth a try even with the naysayers. <br/><br/>Firstly, Jon Spaihts'script is actually very good and shines on occasion with philosophical/psychological dilemmas and themes without losing the human factor and contact. We empathize with the characters and are afraid, lost, torn, and even in love (yes) with them. The technology, the setting, the context and the beautiful set (real and digital), including a stunning star swimming pool and luxury rooms on this passenger spaceship. One of the character is a writer and the words take on poetic and philosophical turns to trump and triviality or banality of more predictable or run-of-the-mill sci-fi films. Of course there is some plot turns that are a bit far- fetched but all in all it is well within its dangerous and wondrous world it delves into.<br/><br/>Secondly, the directing makes the two leads make nuanced performance and illicit the right emotions from viewers while also keeping the oddness, awe, tension and adventurous factor.<br/><br/>Lastly, this film is a timeless love story with secrets, sacrifices, choices and serendipity in an attempt to understand and live a potential eventual human migration to the stars and planets with its joys and perils. <br/><br/>What do we do with the place and time you leave behind and what do you have to look forward to? To paraphrase the terrific and thoughtful screenplay, we are all just passengers in life... even if we want to be the captain of our lives. What is the meaning of time, life, love, loneliness? This raises great questions and leave you wanting more at the end.<br/><br/>This is a great addition to Tylum's body of work and to science- fiction in general. Kudos and hope this will get more recognition in the future... hopefully not in 120 years like this fictional space travel..."

","Look, if you're a SciFi fan you have to suspend some belief. That's the rules. So the reviews that say this movie doesn't reflect reality are playing some weird double standard. I bet they loved Roque One or Star Trek, which are about as far fetched as you can go. Anyway, moving on... I loved the premise of this movie and appreciated the way the story line looked at some very human dilemmas around home, relationship, life and death. A lot of movies don't come close to the philosophical questions Passengers laid out, and the acting is superb. One big problem for me was the schmaltzy Hollywood ending. They took the ""return to life"" scene too far and THAT is where it lost any credibility. Then it skated to that Hollywood close that left a bit of vomit in my mouth. I can think of at least three endings that would have been more poignant and more in sync with the depth of the earlier messaging. Missed opportunity probably due to some suits that wanted more explosions and a Happy Ever After."

"edmund-marlowe","9","3","7","2 January 2017"," Genuinely imaginative sci-fi
","I am definitely not a sci-fi enthusiast, and I am inspired to write this review by its being the film of this genre that I have enjoyed the most. I realize this is not a popular view, but I am hoping that its being unusual is what makes it worth presenting. Since much of what I like so much about it bears implicitly on what I generally dislike about the genre, it might be better to skip this review if you are a devotee of the latter.<br/><br/>Jim Preston, a would-be space colonist accidentally and irrevocably brought out of hibernation only thirty years into a hundred-and-twenty year voyage, finds himself alone among the five thousand unconscious passengers, and, after a year of miserable loneliness, succumbs to the temptation to awaken Aurora Lane, a beautiful and lively young woman, to be his companion. A love affair soon blossoms, but without her realizing she has been deliberately awoken.  <br/><br/>Though the science involved is well beyond our present reach, in its effects it is readily understandable and credible, while still being dramatic and sometimes visually stunning. Too often in science fiction, far-fetched ideas and absurd aliens are offered as a pathetic substitute for the real feast of the imagination to which we are treated here, where we are confronted by how human beings might behave under extreme but imaginable circumstances which force them to ponder the point of their existence. The setting of outer space is beside the point as regards the dilemmas raised. The question, for example, of what might motivate a space traveler to abandon for ever the world and people he has known is not very different to that which has confronted colonists for the last three thousand years. Nuance too reigns in this story, not simplistic black and white morality: can any man honestly say he would have felt no temptation whatsoever to awaken Aurora? <br/><br/>The humour is rich, gentle and often ironic, never coarse or in one's face. There is easily enough of it to stop the film taking itself too seriously, while it complements rather than undermines the dramatic tension, an example being when Jim sends a desperate communication to Earth about his predicament only to learn a reply will be forthcoming in an estimated fifty-five years. The android bartender is a delightful third character, his apparent decency and humanity cleverly juxtaposed against the reality that he is not human and feels nothing.<br/><br/>There is only one other, minor character, making the film dangerously dependent on the acting of the two main characters, but the film-makers were well rewarded for the risk they took: Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence play them superbly.<br/><br/>Edmund Marlowe, author of Alexander's Choice, a novel, amazon.com/dp/1481222112"

"ithinkimdeck","5","3","7","28 December 2016"," Almost brilliant sci-fi romance
","I feel I should preface this review by saying, I enjoyed the film for what it was. 'Passengers' is, ultimately, a shallow popcorn flick with very little depth, but it doesn't necessarily start out that way.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt provides some worthy acting here as Jim Preston, a mechanic whose ""pod"" malfunctions during interstellar travel and leaves him completely alone. That is until Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence as Jennifer Lawrence) wakes up and joins him in his state of seemingly perpetual loneliness while their ship, the Avalon, travels for another 90 years to their new home planet.<br/><br/>The first two-thirds of this film explore some very interesting themes. However, this is Hollywood, so the film rushes into a final act which amounts to your standard sci-fi action thriller and quickly slaps an ending together that we can all feel (mostly) good about.<br/><br/>The two stars aren't by any means terrible. They are mostly correct, and only sometimes feel disingenuous. However, I wouldn't call their roles challenging, and all I ultimately saw was two movie stars playing dress up. That's not awful, or at least it doesn't have to be, but it doesn't help the film avoid devolving into cliché, which it does, over and over and over again.<br/><br/>Usually in film's like this one, it's a nice surprise when an actor truly stands out for their performance. The film belongs to Pratt, and Lawrence is ultimately sort of just there, but neither one of them really bring anything particularly exciting to the table. I'm always bothered when people call Lawrence a progeny and this film perfectly illustrates my feelings on her (and Pratt for that matter). She's fine, just fine. Watchable, but by no means outstanding. That said, there is enough chemistry and sweetness between them to make you believe they love one another. <br/><br/>Special effects are lacking, but there is one scene that is mildly thrilling involving water, though it is given away in the trailer.<br/><br/>If you're in the mood for a popcorn flick that will entertain you for a few hours, go see this one. Just do not expect to be blown away."
"tommihenttu","6","3","7","27 December 2016"," Interesting setting, mediocre execution
","The film's premise is very interesting. One passenger on a space ship going to a colony planet wakes up 90 years too early. **SPOILERS**<br/><br/>As he is trying to figure out what's going on and why it happened, he starts to get lonely. He spends an entire year on the space ship alone, with only a robot to keep him company. He finds a girl, that could be able to wake up, but he has an internal fight whether or not it is the right to do. Eventually he does do it, and the two of them start to spend time with each other and eventually get into a relationship. The girl is still oblivious to the fact that she was woken up, and it wasn't a malfunction. As we see their relationship growing, the ship is slowly starting to break down.<br/><br/>Positives: Visually stunning, great acting and an interesting setting<br/><br/>But I had some major issues with the movie. <br/><br/>Firstly, the pacing is poor. The plot really kicks off too late, as we spend too much time with their relationship. It felt like I was watching a romance, sci-fi, adventure, comedy hybrid. The movie really didn't know what it wanted to be, and it had a negative impact on the overall experience.<br/><br/>Secondly, the movie tries to convince the passengers and the audience that nothing on the ship EVER malfunctions. They threw the ""unbreakable"" at our faces too much, so I thought the reveal would be something really good. And when we finally find out why it happened, it was something as simple as a burnt chip. It felt really poor. And the ship was also designed to be meteor-proof. But somehow, a meteor collided with the shuttle, starting the sequence of malfunctions.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Gus' character felt like a plot device more than anything. He wakes up, gives them access to the control room and dies. And we never really find out why he has all the illnesses that he does. It was just too convenient.<br/><br/>Action sequences are fine, but lack real suspense, since it's too predictable.<br/><br/>And the ending is terrible. Vanilla, happy ending. I was hoping for something darker, that would've fit the overall theme of the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it has some good elements and great visuals but falls flat on its face because of how poor the writing is. A fun popcorn movie, nothing more <br/><br/>6/10"

Then the plot turns, and it becomes a rushed, silly Saturday morning cartoon. The final scene is so pithy, trite and forced, and does no justice to the story that you've just wasted two hours on. <br/><br/>Along the way you'll see huge imitations of Alien (petal like hibernation capsules), Prometheus (medic pod), Avatar (capsule shots of Chris Pratt that are composed, shot and colour-tinted exactly like those Worthington), Gravity (untethered in space, rescued by loose cord grabbing), Sunshine (plants on a ship, watching the sun from a viewing room), The Island (a strained relationship in a sci-fi environment that gives way to stupid action), Moon (AIs that respond with smiley faces, overall environment designs, food vending machines), The Shining (the look of the bartender, the pattern on some walls matching the carpet of the Overlook Hotel). Its SO derivative, and not just because its a spaceship movie - there are direct copies and I have no idea why. <br/><br/>A real shame of the film also is that a few very short scenes were needlessly injected purely to make the trailers look like it was some wildly inventive action film. I'm talking about the brief anti- gravity shots, particularly the swimming pool one. They're completely unnecessary in the film, last mere seconds, yet were milked like crazy in the trailer as if the last act of the film was this wild anti-gravity action thing. Its just a very, very lame film."

Pretty simple stuff.<br/><br/>The plot? If there is one ... sucks, of course. Here you have a deep space ship ... on auto pilot ... the defenses are over whelmed by space rocks and the ship tries to repair itself. One does wonder ... if the ship can repair itself (or can't)... why can't it bring the required crew members out of stasis to fix things?<br/><br/>If they cannot go back into stasis ... then how did the girl expect to get back to earth? Our hero managed to 'hack' into the deluxe suite, but couldn't 'hack' into the food synthesizer?

"hakunabear","8","2","4","8 March 2017"," Better than what the critics said (7.5/10)
","This movie currently has a 31% approval on Rotten Tomatoes and this was the reason I continued to delay watching this movie. After watching it, I completely disagree with the popular critic opinion. I felt this was a very entertaining movie with a charismatic lead pair and some good chemistry.<br/><br/>We start off with Jim (Chris Pratt) whose hibernation pod has broken and he woke up 90 years too soon before the spaceship reaches its destination, a new earthlike habitable planet. This sets up an intriguing premise and I'm a sucker for movies where the main character is stranded in one location. Things start to get more interesting when Jennifer Lawrence's character makes an entrance, (who by the way looks stunning in every shot!)<br/><br/>All in all, Passengers is a very well crafted film. The lead pair is what makes it work. The romance didn't feel forced or artificial. You actually buy that under those circumstances, both of the characters would fall in love. The third half is when things really start to come together and I was rooting for the lead pair to make it through the end. At a time when were are continuously bombarded with sequels and reboots, Passengers is a fresh change. It doesn't offer anything novel, but the premise and the lead pair make it worth a watch in my opinion."

","In this Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game, Headhunters) directed film, written by Jon Spaihts (Prometheus, Doctor Strange), Chris Pratt (Guardians of the Galaxy, The Lego Movie) stars as Jim Preston, a mechanic travelling to the Homestead Colony, who is awakened 90 years early when a malfunction happens following a meteorite connecting to the hull of the spacecraft, the Avalon. No-one else is awake, including the crew, and the only company he has apart from the interactive consoles is android bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen: Underworld, The Damned United). After a year of trying to stay sane, his isolation causes him to obsess over one of the other sleeping passengers, Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence: Silver Linings Playbook, American Hustle), a writer who is one of the gold passengers.<br/><br/>Finally worn down over his moral dilemma, he wakes her up and claims that like him, her pod malfunctioned and they slowly get to know one another and begin to fall in love. A year later Arthur lets slip that Jim deliberately woke her from her pod and Aurora is so angry that she physically attacks him, but when Deck Officer Gus Mancuso's (Laurence Fishburne: The Matrix, Apocalypse Now) pod malfunctions causing him to wake too, they find out that there are failures in several of the systems. The spacecraft is at risk of blowing up and they must work together to save the 5,258 passengers.<br/><br/>In this sci-fi romance don't expect high action even though it is set in space, it is a mix of drama, romance and human psychology. The acting was great and although there are only really four main actors, the movie did not feel empty of emotion. It felt very real in that could a person really resist temptation to wake another passenger up if that was the only way that he could get human interaction for the rest of his life? The journey left would take longer than he had to live and Jim could not just get back into the pod and go back to sleep again. But like Aurora says to Gus in the movie, waking her was essentially murder as she would never get to live the life she was supposed to because of his actions. This made the plot quite unique and although the ending let the film down, the stunning visuals and thought provoking dilemma of the main character held my attention throughout.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Lawrence and Pratt worked well and Sheen made it easy to forget that he wasn't actually a robot. For me, the main enjoyment of the film was the moral complexity and the psychological aspect of the situation they find themselves in. Would you sacrifice yourself to save another or bigger still, would you sacrifice another to save yourself? As a side note, I think it is quite funny that Disney's Sleeping Beauty is also called Aurora and I am thinking that maybe this was a deliberate reference."

While en route, a gigantic meteor cloud of meteors smash onto the ship's protective shield without greater damage... only a little bit of stone is let thru against it. Some malfunction happens and one unlucky individual is prematurely awake from his hibernation deep sleep... when he knows that the ship is 90 years short to arrive to the new planet, he realizes he's doomed for good.<br/><br/>This movie is good for a big audience followed by a debate on human emotions and choices. Selfishness or despair? The big question for the movie buff shall be this: What would YOU do? I was completely blown away by this movie. The purity and originality of the script, the gracious ideas in the spaceship, the small but cool action that will unravel as time unfolds and the sparse but vivid comedy in several moments makes this movie well above average.<br/><br/>It is a film that makes us think ""what if""?"

"fung0","7","2","4","5 March 2017"," Better than Expected, in Unexpected Ways
","After seeing many lukewarm or negative reviews, I watched Passengers with low expectations. Having seen it, I'm aware of its logical shortcomings. But overall, I liked it a lot - for reasons I really never expected.<br/><br/>At its core, this is not an adventure - it's a very unusual love story. It's about a love born of disaster, desperation and even heinous selfishness. And yet, it's a love that we come to appreciate as the story slowly unfolds. This film works remarkably well on a dramatic level. The two stars are extremely likable, and do a fine job of presenting a wide range of emotions, despite the limited scope of the story. (There are also a few smaller parts that work very well - notably the mechanized bartender.)<br/><br/>Even more surprisingly, Passengers succeeds in evoking that bona fide SF 'sense of wonder,' as we contemplate the lives of two people living alone on a huge starship, while 5,000 others remain inaccessible in hibernation. It's a fascinating vision, depicted quite powerfully.<br/><br/>On a purely mechanical level, the results are somewhat more mixed. The film does look terrific. The starship is elegant and believable. But the film's respect for real-world physics, on the other hand, hits both highs and lows.<br/><br/>On the up side, there are several maneuvers in zero gravity that are really quite clever, handled infinitely better than we've seen in such critically-acclaimed dreck as Gravity (which also lacked the powerful emotional side of Passengers). On the down side, we have a ship that loses centrifugal gravity by suddenly ceasing to spin. Not only is there no reason for it to stop spinning, we don't see the horrible carnage that inertia would create inside the ship after a sudden stop. There's also a scene with fusion plasma that's needlessly implausible, not so much because of poor physics, as because of lazy writing.<br/><br/>On balance, however, the scientific underpinnings are more than adequate to carry the film's genuinely compelling drama. Ignore the few inevitable quibbles, and Passnegers works really well as both SF and romance. It leaves you with some novel insights into human nature, and a genuinely haunting central image.<br/><br/>I have to deduct a point or two on the technical side, but even so I give the film a very strong recommendation. It's entertaining, likable and thought-provoking, and I will definitely watch it again."

Chris Pratt's contribution to the problem is solved in my house by a small, wooden wedge. The writers, not daring to have a passive female character, give Jennifer Lawrence a ridiculous task that could have been better accomplished by a well trained labrador.<br/><br/>The affects are good, the story is OK but is padded out to fill the time.

"tomgillespie2002","5","2","4","3 March 2017"," Passable, if forgettable
","Some of the greatest science-fiction films ever made are creepily prophetic, depicting a not-too-distant future in which technology has become a necessity rather than a luxury. The characters in Morten Tyldum's Passengers are in the middle of an intergalactic journey to another planet, with Earth now seemingly picked clean of all of its natural energy and resources. While this somewhat terrifying idea may seem unlikely (or maybe I'm giving humanity too much credit), the technology on board the starship Avalon, such an electronic meal dispenser and the android bartender, could very well happen tomorrow in our increasingly tech-reliant times. Passengers does well in setting up some big ideas, before descending into a tonally-uneven rom-com-cum-disaster movie.<br/><br/>Along with 5,000 others, mechanical engineer Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) is on his way to Homestead II, a newly-established colony for humans rich or skilled enough to earn their place. 30 years into a 120-year journey, the Avalon is struck by a meteor shower which causes parts of the ship to malfunction. While the ship is highly capable of repairing the damages, Jim's hibernation pod glitches and opens 80 years too early. At first, he believes that he has a month of luxury and socialising to enjoy before arriving at his destination, before he is hit with the realisation that he is the only one awake, and will die of old age long before any of the other crew members will wake up. Spending his time trying to break into the ship's control room and drinking his sorrows away with android Arthur (Michael Sheen), he spots sleeping beauty Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) and starts to fall in love with her video profile.<br/><br/>After an entire year alone, Jim makes the decision to wake her up, essentially condemning her to die with him. She is naturally devastated at first, but hits it off with the charming and handsome Jim, who has convinced her that she was awoken due to a ship malfunction also. Aurora is also a gold-star member, which means that she has access to lattes and bacon while the working-class Jim has been enduring instant coffee and porridge. A happily-ever-after space romance would not make for a very interesting movie, so the couple are torn apart when the Avalon starts to experience some serious hitches and Arthur blurts out the truth to Aurora. With the ship going haywire, Chief Deck Officer Gus (Laurence Fishburne) is also woken up prematurely, and it doesn't take him long to realise that the ship is overloaded with trying to fix the multiple problems caused by the meteor shower two years earlier, and may not last much longer.<br/><br/>While establishing itself early on as a character study asking some interesting questions and teasing us with the idea that our protagonist is in fact not the dashing charmer one has come to expect of Pratt, but a morally-conflicted creep, Passengers becomes eager to please the wider audience. Essentially turning into a formulaic love story with some generic action thrills, the film manages to get by on the strength of its two highly charismatic leads. While its clear they are pretty much playing themselves, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, and the two certainly have chemistry to burn and enough screen presence to dismiss the need for the CGI thrills that follow. It received a rather unfair roasting from the critics, but perhaps they were (understandably) expecting much more from what is an enticing set-up that ultimately chickens-out of its potential. I went in expecting mediocrity, but what I got was passable, if forgettable."
"deny-966-237037","10","2","4","3 March 2017"," Uplifting
","A successful movie, like any form of art, is one that gets an emotional response from the audience, and Passengers does that very competently.<br/><br/>Even though the long space travel time in such a distant future seems a bit romantic it's not a deal breaker for the immersion experience that a movie is supposed to be.<br/><br/>I've once read a quote from some director on what's the secret to a good movie: ""good actors"", he said. Jennifer Lawrence makes me wonder how someone so breathtakingly beautiful can be so incredibly talented, probably her best acting so far that I've seen.<br/><br/>The special effects are absolutely amazing, the swimming pool scene (that's also in the trailer) is one of the most incredible CGI scenes I've ever seen, maybe not so much for the technical part but for the idea itself.<br/><br/>Like others said, it's more of a love story than a sci-fi flick, and honestly I did not see that coming, but I thought it was brilliantly executed and there's little I could have wished for to make it better.<br/><br/>It's funny how I'm usually anticipating movie plots while watching them, often bored and disappointed.

"ahmadshah2370","9","2","4","2 March 2017"," Don't trust Critics for this movie
","Metacritic score is too low, do not let this fool you. This is an excellent sci-fi movie which really tries to explore the minds of the people who can be very alone in space. The setup of the movie was just too gorgeous, nice CGI effect, nice AI infrastructures. The writers thought about many little aspects of that universe, like how everything goes on, what is the social norm, how different technologies are in everyday use and so on. I hope these thinking will be found in other sci-fi movies. This movie has only two main characters, Chris Patt and Jeniffer Lawrance, and I think both were superb in this movie. Especially, the way Jeniffer showed different kinds of expressions, was actually praiseworthy.<br/><br/>This movie had many great moments. The buildup of the relation between Chris and Jeniffer was not hurried, where other movies use too much kissing scenes to show their love for each other (Remember Hacksaw Ridge?). I loved this movie. When you watch a sci-fi movie, you more or less can guess what gonna happen at last, but still, I found the ending as a good one. I remember Martians, Interstellar, Gravity, etc., these movies had pacing issues, had less developed characters, and so on. Comparing to those, this is an excellent movie. I don't get the critics, they praise Moonlight (which is boring like hell) but don't praise such excellent movie. You got to see this movie if you are a Sci-fi fan."

","Alright, this is a early morning review. Started watching Passengers around midnight with the thought that I will part watch it and go to sleep. I couldn't, got so hooked to the movie and the cinematic experience that it portrayed, so beautifully. It had a not so subtle moral lining to the entire script which read, ""You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are."". Evidently true, as it is the key to success and staying happy as most of our lives have events that are out of our control and all we need to do is accept and make the best of the present. Philosophical and difficult but a practice we should try and achieve to have a fulfilled life. <br/><br/>I always thought why Jennifer Lawrence was getting so much shine from the world (as an actor) ? There are better counterparts. I apologize, as I am absolutely wrong with this quick judgement and change course to the idea that she is a true talent that world cinema has been gifted. Pardon me, for this. Will you? =)<br/><br/>Chris Pratt has definitely done the part with ease with the sweet sensibility he puts into his role(s) without being too chivalrous. It is great as roles need such exhibition of character and frankly not many can pull it off, presently!<br/><br/>Overall, I want to conclude with the fact that this movie got the nominations, which it did not win at the #Oscars2017 but never got nominated in the categories that it could have won. Very well made and definitely hats off coming from the man who directed the #ImitationGame. I salute you, #MortenTyldum.<br/><br/>P.S. And #Moonlight won the best picture.. so did #LaLaLand sweep a great deal of them, #Academy - Thou is requested to see musicals with equality to other scripts and give an equal judgement. (Walt Disney! You must be happy wherever you are?)<br/><br/>I think the downside was that more could be added in terms of the story and elements but even that doesn't do the trick since ""Fantastic Beasts and Where To Find Them"" had a lot if it and still didn't cut through the best picture category.<br/><br/>Finally! Congrats on the two nominations for best score and best production design. I think it was really elaborate and well thought out. But, who made me the judge? ;)"
"aschuet3","5","2","4","23 February 2017"," Good acting and special effects but lacks in story
","The story is the main problem with this movie; the acting and effects are pretty good. Some points I'm bringing up (and are brought up by other reviews) consist of the realistic common-sense thinking when going on a 120-year hibernated space flight to another planet. It makes sense that there would be a rotating crew to be there when something unexpected occurs instead of relying solely on technology. There would also be a way to go back into hibernation hence the rotating crew system. Even if you assume there was none of those above, there should be more than one ""auto doc"" pod to service health emergencies for 5000+ passengers and crew members. So there should've been a way for Jim and Aurora to both go back to hibernation.<br/><br/>The story also feels like a story within a story. First, there's story of the ship malfunctioning and needing to be repaired and secondly, the Jim and Aurora relationship. It puts the ship repair story on pause early on in the movie after Jim gives up trying to fix his hibernation issue. Then, it goes to the Jim and Aurora story all the way until the crew member wakes up and finally the ship repair story starts up again. Once this happens, it does a good job interweaving both stories together.<br/><br/>The ending could've been a lot better. I felt like it was rushed. Ignoring the common sense thinking above, there could've been more time spent showing what Jim and Aurora left behind. Also, since there was one auto doc pod, they could have had a child and let him/her grow up a bit then go into the pod to pass on Jim and Aurora's legacy.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was a little better than what critics made it out to be but there are definite problems with the movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt did the best they could given the script. The special effects were done very well. I was most disappointed in the ending as I felt it was rushed and things could have been done differently to give a more satisfying ending."

It's exquisitely filmed, beautifully set, and believably acted though it is, at its heart, a love story. See it for the visual beauty that it is and enjoy."

The honourable thing to do would be to make the best it, not let yourself go to pieces then wake up a random female you like the look of.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie more than most of the ""critically acclaimed"" films I've watched this year. The movie is worth your time. Firstly, 10/10 for realism. I would absolutely have done all those things if I were in their shoes. The movie is cherished and loved. The movie is so great.<br/><br/>The starship Avalon is transporting over 5,000 colonists to the planet Homestead II, a journey that takes 120 years. The colonists and the entire crew are in hibernation pods, but as the ship passes through a large asteroid field, the ship's shield is heavily strained causing a malfunction that awakens one passenger, mechanical engineer Jim Preston, 90 years early.<br/><br/>After a year of isolation, with no company except Arthur, an android bartender, Jim contemplates suicide. One day he notices beautiful Aurora Lane in her pod. He read about her profile who was a writer with a humorous personality. After so much about struggle within inside, he awakens her, claiming her pod malfunctioned like his. Aurora, devastated she may grow old and die before the ship reaches Homestead II, attempts a fruitless effort at re-entering hibernation, just as Jim had tried. Eventually, she accepts her situation and begins writing a book about her experiences. Jim and Aurora grow closer, becoming lovers.<br/><br/>A year later, Jim inadvertently allows Arthur to reveal the truth to Aurora. After Aurora knew about the truth which Jim awakens her, she mad at Jim and beat him, leave him, do not want to see him again. Soon after, however, another pod failure awakens Gus, a Chief Deck Officer. The three discover multiple failures in the ship's systems. Gus attempts repairs with Jim and Aurora's help, while Aurora still blames Jim for stealing her life. Gus' body begins failing; medical tests in the Autodoc, an automated medical diagnostics and treatment pod, show that his hibernation pod's malfunction has physically damaged his body, and he has hours left to live. Before dying, Gus gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge to access crew areas and repair the ship.<br/><br/>The two find and trace a colliding asteroid's path through the ship's hull from two years earlier that damaged the computer administering the reactor. Attempts to repair the computer lead to further reactor damage. Jim realizes a fusion reactor must be vented by opening an outer vent hatch. Aurora assists while admitting she is terrified of losing Jim and living on the ship alone. Aurora, from inside the ship, and Jim, outside, successfully vent the reactor. However, Jim's tether snaps and his damaged spacesuit is losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves and resuscitates Jim in the Autodoc, relieved that he is alive and seemingly forgiving him for his decision; the two share a moment of embrace. Jim later learns that the Autodoc can act as a makeshift hibernation pod for Aurora. However, she realizes this would mean never seeing Jim again. <br/><br/>After 88 years, the ship's passengers and crew awaken shortly before arrival on Homestead II. They discover a small house amid lush vegetation on the ship's concourse area. Aurora's book reveals that she chose to stay awake with Jim and finish writing her story."

","My title sums it up nicely.<br/><br/>If you are expecting a science fiction film you are in for a disappointment. There's a spaceship setting with plenty of decent effects but the story is all about a relationship between two people alone on a ship of thousands of people who are in suspended animation. Any scifi going on is utterly accidental and of no importance to the story.<br/><br/>The love story is the standard one. Boy gets girl, boy looses girl and finally boy gets girl back. It's been done a million times. It's been done well here though if you are hoping for originality you ought to look elsewhere. If you were hoping for a good scifi film, forget it. If you want a love story it's worth a watch. I've given it a 6 as a love story. If I were to score it purely as a scifi film it'd be lower."
"masonmorgan-92917","6","2","4","19 February 2017"," Flawed beyond repair
","Simply put, Morten Tyldum's Passengers is flawed beyond repair. Featuring two of Hollywood's most beloved stars and an interesting sci-fi concept and setting, the hopes for an entertaining and thought-provoking experience were relatively high. Sadly, when Passengers attempted to be any more than a disposable sci-fi romance flick, it became startlingly clear that the overall messages are not only morally askew, but downright disturbing. <br/><br/>Political and philosophical themes of morality are explored throughout the generally linear story, and while the principles surrounding the overall situation can be fun to discuss afterwards, it seems the film didn't know what to do with it's moral dilemmas as they come up in the narrative. The overall themes and messages that the film portrays are quite disturbing. Moments of sadistically disregarding human life are brushed aside to make way for lovey-dovey scenes of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. It's not the overall wrong message that this film portrays that I find sloppy, but the way that the film stumbles over itself attempting to display it's philosophies. <br/><br/>Despite this rather glaring issue, there is some enjoyment to be found here. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence do share some interesting chemistry and, while they weren't given much to work with emotionally, each of their performances generated some character. And while the aspects of romance were, quite literally, forced, the interactions and tension between Pratt's and Lawrence's characters were easily the most enjoyable parts of the film. Its not until the film's action and thrill sequences where the lack of substance is most noticeable. These scenes lack any essence of a punch and the laughably poor dramatic acting from Pratt only helps accentuate the goofiness of the situation. The special effects are decent and the set design is luscious and clean, but none of these qualities help to repair the overall empty feel of the throwaway story or the equally awful ending.<br/><br/>To be fair, Passengers is harmless. It's dumb throwaway entertainment that I could find some enjoyment in. There are some interesting uses of special effects and some fun interactions between the film's leads, but when Passengers makes attempts at a philosophical and morality-questioning experience, it only comes off as amateurish. I'm not quite sure what the intentions of Passengers' messages were, but it was painfully obvious when the film was banking on the star-power of Pratt and Lawrence to excuse it's own bumbling narrative."

"CharlieWalkerJr","7","2","4","13 February 2017"," Solid Movie
","Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are probably the two most in demand personalities right now in Hollywood. They are so likable, all their promotional interviews were an absolute blast to watch and never a dull moment too. So you can imagine my shock to hear how badly this movie was being reviewed. Ten minutes later I realised these are the snobby critic reviews who love hipster garbage and just swing towards controversial nonsense that has a political theme to them. A sci-fi Romance is not their thing. So I withheld judgement until I watched it for myself. This movie is....solid! I admit it did not blow me away but neither was it bad in the slightest. Reminiscent of the classic Titanic in space theme but without leaving you with your mouth open in aw. Whilst ""Epic"" in its scale, set design and in plot. For some reason this film to me missed its mark in making me feel terrified for these characters. I believe part of my problem personally was that I watched too many interviews with Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence together. Their chemistry off screen seemed so genuine and funny, like they were truly good friends. When i saw them together on screen I couldn't imagine them together romantically anymore and the writing for these characters were no where near as good as their dialogue together in real life. In a weird way i felt more intensity between them off screen then on screen. In the build up to this movie they advertised it suggesting there is an ultimate reason they woke up from their hibernation pods, that their is a plot twist or cliff hanger we are waiting on throughout the movie. Are they all going to die? is there really a planet on the other side of this mission? What could the reason be? However in the first scene of the movie you see what happens for Jims pod to malfunction and him to wake up. It was not a dramatic opening, you watch it thinking ""Yeh i guess that's what happens in space, should have built a better ship"". From then you can guess how Aroura's pod opens for her to wake up. It came about without shock but with ease. So by the end of the movie you look back and there is no moment that stands out as ""wow! I can't believe that"". It is all very typical. The pacing of this movie is strange too, in about 20 minutes of the movie you watch a year pass by. Then in the middle of the movie you watch another year pass by. In the final act you watch it as if it is real time, like a ticking time bomb that needs defusing in 10 minutes. Yet when you watch the movie, I don't really buy into it. I just think how they stuck a fake beard on Jims face and how they say the key words here and there to represent natural romantic progression. <br/><br/>Having said all this the plot is good. Ultimately you know whats happening but you like it none the less because it is charming, it is romantic, it is funny and it takes place on a beautiful set. Yes the set design is phenomenal. Which brings me on to the action scenes. There is one scene that makes this film from dropping down to a 6/10. That's the pool scene. I wont give away what happens but when you watch it you empathise right away with the situation and you feel the panic as to what is happening. It is executed perfectly and is a great feet in stunt design. The performance by Michael Sheen is probably the best in the film. Not to take away from the lead pair, but I felt he had the most to work with, playing a robot that is their at human disposal. to remain neutral to all things yet offer a sense of calmness/creepiness and charm all at once. A great job by him. I also enjoyed the ending to this movie. Although there is nothing here to make you stand up and applause. You leave with a smile on your face feeling good. Which is a lot more than most films can offer. <br/><br/>Overall this movie was Solid. It could have been so much more and equally could have become absolute rubbish."
"ReelLifeReviews","7","2","4","12 February 2017"," A great surprise
","Having seen the reviews ahead of time I was fully prepared for disappointment. This most likely factored in my score as I was pleasantly surprised. I'm also a sucker for isolation movies and books so I was an easy target. I thought the pacing was just right. Whenever I felt like a chapter had run its course, another one would pick right up. Chris Pratt was much more reserved in this role compared to others, making it easier to get invested. Jennifer Lawrence didn't quite hit with me right away, but grew on me as the movie progressed. There are some glaring points of absolute convenience, a couple inconsistencies, and a little cheesiness, but it was a fun ride nonetheless."
"Riley-H","8","2","4","12 February 2017"," Passengers of Life
","Previously, it seems strange to me that a well-made picture like Passengers has an average rating of only 7.0. Later, however, it comes to me that maybe many people who went to the cinema were expecting a marvelous science fiction film but eventually come to find a typical romance instead. In passengers, though high-tech future elements can be seen anywhere, they are mainly used to support the love story the movie wants to convey, not to provoke dramatic intensity and visual effects as normal sci-fi movies do. And so if you are looking for something rather tense and incredible, the film might not satisfy you enough, for the story is told in a slow pace and the highlight around the end is a little roughly-arranged. But on the other hand, Passengers has reached high in telling a romantic story and has also brought out thinking and arguments about humanity and attitudes towards life.<br/><br/>Space movies are sci-fi films set in a particular environment: outer space, which always provides the films with potential advantages. They include: infinity in setting the background's scale, great convenience in testing humanity under extreme circumstances such as facing the unknown, and sometimes, expense saving by hiring only a few actors and actresses. Generally speaking, Passengers has made full use of many of these potentials to make itself worth viewing and thinking. It has had its background set on a lonely spaceship traveling in the void, providing a single concentrated scene, to tell clear and straight a fascinating story about no more than two main characters. Such a genius idea that supports the film has also enabled some thinking on the two characters' different attitudes and decisions towards their fate and destiny.<br/><br/>Apart from a brilliant idea, there are, of course, other contributing factors that has made the movie come to life. Firstly, I must say the acting of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence is really great. Pratt expressed strongly the character's sense of loneliness at particular scenes, while Lawrence stroke me hard in acting extreme emotions such as hatred, despair and eagerness (I actually recall seeing similar vivid acting in other films with Lawrence playing a role such as The Hunger Games series as well). Besides, the visual effects of the film is beautiful, which has definitely added more flavor to the already beautiful story. The music written for the picture is also worth praising too, although I'm a little surprised it is so great as to get the Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>As mentioned above, Passengers may not have done so well as a science fiction film. But I think it truly has achieved something in telling a love story. We have already seen countless romance films which consists little more than a boy and a girl come to a kiss after a series of things happen. If such plain and simple love stories with few details and never-changing happy endings were once popular, they can hardly surprise us any more nowadays. Because with the development of modern movies, we are asking something more besides two good-looking people come together. We are asking questions like: What happened next? How their individuality affected their relationship? What's their understanding of love?<br/><br/>Good romance films are seeking the answers, and trying to give complete new angles of telling romantic stories. One way of doing so, some find, is to extend the perspective of love from the traditional honeymoon period to the entire life of the ones in love. Passengers, among some others like The Titanic (1997) , Up (2009) and About Time (2013) have looked into this method of story- telling, and many of them reached tremendous effect. They carry the theme that love consists not only a rush, a glance, a touch, a dance. Love is Life. (Please allow me to quote from the song 'City of Stars' without thinking it lower than any others) In Passengers, by illustrating opinions of life from the characters' view, it has shared its unique perspective of love with accuracy.<br/><br/>*** Some friends may consider the lines below spoilers ***<br/><br/>In the end, I would like to add another quote from Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's master piece 'The Little Prince', which I think suits the main idea of the film pretty well: <br/><br/>People on the train are pursuing nothing at all. They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning. Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes.<br/><br/>We are all passengers of life. Besides chasing a destination, there are so many wonders on the way for us to stop by. If the ultimate goal is so far to reach, we can still make a meaningful path by enjoying every bit of the day."

"dromasca","7","2","4","11 February 2017"," an inter-stellar love story
","Spacecraft undertaking long journeys between the stars have become one of the sets favorite movies and television series about the second half of the 60s, with the entry in production of serials like 'Star Trek' and some major big screen movies as '2001: a Space Oddissey' directed by Stanley Kubrick. Smaller and larger studios added to their sets to apartments in Manhattan, wild west villages and saloons or columns of the Roman forums, the corridors and cabins passenger space travel as scenery and props were used and reused. While these sets were diversified, specialized and differentiated by gender, some of them represented true artistic creations, an example being the series 'Alien' with sets drawn by Swiss surrealist artist Hans Rudolph (HR) Giger.<br/><br/>'Passengers' directed by Norwegian Morten Tyldum on a screenplay by Jon Spaihts is happening on such a spacecraft called Avalon. (The name comes from the Celtic mythology and Arthurian story exactly, is the name of the island where the legendary sword Excalibur was created). It is a huge shuttle carrying 5000 passengers toward the settlement Homestead II located far away from Earth. What is different from post-apocalyptic movies, we are warned from the beginning that this settlement is the result of a decision taken in an orderly manner and that everything is OK on Earth. In fact, it seems to be a peaceful period in human evolution, without internal conflicts and external threats. So there is room for romance. And in fact, this is what 'Passengers' is - a love story that happens in interstellar space.<br/><br/>The journey should last 120 years, and is performed at a cruising speed which is half the speed of light. That means that those who embark on this adventure forever leave their home world, friends and family. Even if taking a return voyage the day after arrival at Homestead II would find upon returning to Earth a humanity oldest 240 years plus time 'compressed' due to travel at speeds comparable to the speed of light (this Conformity theory of relativity) . Achieving such speeds is currently beyond the capabilities of the technology, although known theoretically at least two types of engines (photon propulsion and antimatter) that can be used in the future. Inside the spacecraft imagined by filmmakers combine utilitarianism technical (individual cryogenic cells, a bridge where access is allowed only to the authorized crew, an engine room similar to the engine room ocean liners) and shared space with different sections with comfort differentiated according to social classes . Kind of like a giant Titanic, with a better service and menu afforded only by passengers who have paid the tickets more expensive. That mankind may not have acute internal problems or external conflicts, but the differences between social classes they were not erased this future described by writer 'Passengers'. As a consolation, the bar is still free for all passengers and serviced by an android (played by Michael Sheen) who is a good conversationalist (sometimes a little too chatty) and a gentleman. The exterior of the spacecraft is equipped with a protective shield which should defend the ship, of any meteorological nuisance such as star storms or meteor populated areas. All is well until a problem occurs, and among its consequences, a passenger, a mechanical engineer from Colorado named Jim Preston (actor Chris Pratt is called) is awakened too early. Specifically after ""only"" 30 years, 90 years before arriving at their destination, which means in practice that he will never reach there.<br/><br/>The love story between the mechanical engineer played by Chriss Pratt and the New York journalist played the beautiful actress Jennifer Lawrence is the centerpiece of the story. It's a story about guilt, because the heroine was actually awakened intentionally by the hero after more than a year and loneliness, which triggers the romantic story but kills the possibility that she ever reaches their destination. I will not reveal more than that and I will not say the connection seemed to me not too convincing despite some scenes filmed very well, and that the last part of the story slips in spatial action drama with not too many original features.<br/><br/>I loved in this movie some of the cinematographic images. I saw the movie in 3D, but it should be quite spectacular in 2D as well. Splendid are the scenes inside where a couple of young heroes have at hand a whole (not sinking) Titanic where they are the only ones awake with other 4998 passengers plunged into a deep sleep. Sensational scenes are mostly the one outside the spaceship, where heroes - if we continue the parallel - observe from the deck liner the entire interstellar universe.<br/><br/>In conclusion - a more than reasonable science fiction film, a romantic story that takes place in special circumstances and surroundings which may not be that convincing at the end of the day as romance, but the moments of great beauty reward those who undertake the viewing experience."

","So movie could be separated in three different categories as it moves along. Firstly visually movie looks superb, it really shines all the way around and it looks really futuristic and advanced.

So year has passed and now he fell in love with a Aurora and there is idea of waking her up, so he did that and now movie instantly become a romance. As they slowly fall in love with each other and they are doing everything together and year has passed Jim decides to propose to Aurora but after he leaves things go down. Android that is bartender told Aurora she has been woken and now they continue to live their lives separately. There are some hints that ship is failing slowly and this is third genre that kicks in. Thriller that now moves along is quite not interesting and it just wants to be more dramatic, more visually better but it was not even smart.

"Snootz","7","2","4","5 February 2017"," Attention-catching and unique, but a bit droll
","Passengers has a good story line, acceptable acting, decent direction, and absolutely incredible sets and CGI. The movie is both slow paced and fast paced in just the right amounts, with the pace fitting the context of the script. It is entertaining, exciting and draws the viewer quickly into the plot and holds us there.<br/><br/>The downside is an anticlimactic plot element. Neither the director nor the actors make the resolution of the film believable. At the end I found myself wondering about different ways they could have ended it better... and that's never good.<br/><br/>Mind you, how they ended it was okay, just kind of... lacking that certain something that makes a person say ""Wow, that was a great film."" It's an interesting film. But if not for the spectacular sets there isn't much here that would set it apart from class-B scifi with good CGI.<br/><br/>The sets are incredible. THIS is a generation ship in all its glory. The only thing that could have made them better would have been 3 or 4 more sets just as grandiose. The set design was unique, creative, and fine. The bar-- a central area to both ship and plot-- is a great bar, with a very pleasant android (no spoiler there... shown in the commercials) that is both well-acted and essential to the plot.<br/><br/>Neither actor really brought out the emotion one would expect in the situations presented. Whether this was poor casting or poor directing is difficult to tell, but imo neither part is pulled off well. They came across like actors playing a part; this is one film in which unknowns might have been better cast as the leads. The characters are almost static, expected and predictable all the way through. In truth, there's only one scene in the film that one might consider unexpected, and it's at the very end. The rest of it, although brilliantly presented and filmed, is somewhat cliché.<br/><br/>One of the biggest problems of the film was a plot device. When one of the characters does something morally and ethically questionable, the film just never seems to succeed in overcoming that. Nothing that happens thereafter succeeds in overcoming that major hurdle. It tries, and provides a particularly good ""illustration"" in attempt to resolve the matter (no spoilers!)... but in whole it just falls flat by creating a non-sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Overall this show is well worth seeing. There are good moments in it. It's just that at the end one feels that the spaceship was the real star of the film."

","Right off the bat I think I can safely say that Passengers is not a groundbreaking sci fi movie. There are no new horizons being explored in this venture, rather a lot of things have been borrowed from various movies based in space and jumbled up to create Passengers. Lonely passenger stranded on space station - check, falling in love - check, betrayed by the one you love - check, disaster in space - check, lead pair saves the day - check, rogue AI - check. It's as if somebody saw a lot of sci fi movies over the ages and came up with a checklist of things to cover in Passenger. What's going for this movie then? 1. Good performances by our lead pair, esp. Chris Pratt who is getting better with each movie. 2. Visual effects And that's about it. It definitely does not qualify as a blockbuster movie and there is nothing to set it apart. It may work as a love story but not enough time was given for the lead pair to grow on you. the ending is kind off abrupt and I felt that they could have done away with the whole disaster angle and instead concentrated on the relationship issues one might face in isolation. That would have worked. 6 stars from me only for the acting."

Considering the recent competition (Matt Damon, Sandra Bullock) the first 30 minutes of Passengers is right in there, a contender, fighting for the hearts and minds of the viewer.<br/><br/>The accidental awakening, the obvious commerciality of the ship, the fact that Pratt's character cannot access anything more than coffee on the breakfast computer, the constant reassurances from the 'bots that ""all is well"" (reminds you of what happens when you call your cable company) ... all the seemed the perfect setup for a really great LOST IN SPACE film.<br/><br/>But. Alas, such was not to be. Instead the film takes a sharp right turn into rom-com town, and gives us perhaps the most elaborate date rape saga in the history of the human race.<br/><br/>Pity.<br/><br/>Closing comments: Pratt sells his character.

","Passengers, starring Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora Lane and Chris Pratt as James Preston, is a pleasing blend of genres that, while perhaps no threat to the throne of the king of science fiction movies, is yet an entertaining tale that does everything a good story needs to do and even a little bit more. I have not seen a better movie this year and recommend the reader visit the theaters to properly appreciate it on the big screen.<br/><br/>James Preston, a lowly and impecunious mechanic, is a passenger on an interstellar journey along with 5,000 other passengers, bound for a colony on a world dozens of light years from Earth. The ship will take 120 years to reach its destination, so everyone has been put into suspended animation from which they will awaken when they are four months out.<br/><br/>James is awakened and comes to realize he is the only one. His rising panic is only momentarily relieved when he runs into a bartender, but the bartender turns out to be a robot with less than perfect artificial intelligence. Preston is alone, and when the delights of the luxury liner become old hat, he grows lonely and increasingly desperate.<br/><br/>He turns to the bio of a fellow passenger, author Aurora Lane, and gets to know her. He reads her work and listens to her interviews while he sits by her hibernation pod. His fixation grows until temptation wins and he wakes her up from her suspended animation.<br/><br/>The moral dilemma which Preston faces is nothing any human has ever had to face before. No younger sibling, terrified by a nightmare and wondering how much big brother would mind being woken up to give comfort, ever faced the millionth part of the moral quandary James Preston finds himself in.<br/><br/>The scenario draws us into the story as well: a man on an interstellar luxury liner with all its accommodations to himself and later with a bit of company for which many men might be willing to forsake society to have to themselves. The ultimate sign of a movie having engaged its audience is that audience imagining themselves as part of the story. I was definitely on that ship with Mr. Pratt. Furthermore, the characters are appealing. While the storytellers do not delve into them quite like Shakespeare explored Hamlet, they nevertheless gain our sympathy, mostly due to the charismatic actors who portray them.<br/><br/>It more than piques my curiosity, then, to discover that this movie with its captivating scenario, compelling actors and perfectly competent craftsmanship is getting the cold shoulder by movie critics. A movie like Vertigo can understandably fail to connect with an audience who, years later, will come to adore it, but Passengers is filmed in a pretty standard fashion. A brief investigation as to why such a fine movie should be so under- appreciated revealed the stench of feminism.<br/><br/>Many of the complaints flying around the Internet characterize Pratt as a sexual predator. Lawrence's Aurora Lane also comes under fire for the way she responds to him.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS*** IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE, READING THE NEXT SECTION WILL RUIN IT. RESIST THE TEMPTATION AND SKIP AHEAD TO THE END.<br/><br/>The charge that Preston is a sexual predator is a product of the hysterical times in which Passengers was released. When feminists are convinced one in four girls are raped in college, that a single drop of alcohol renders a woman incapable of giving consent – though not the man, because, you know, equality – that saying hello to a woman on the street constitutes harassment, we should not be surprised that James Preston stands accused of sexual predation in a feminist Star Chamber. The stupidity of this should be easy for any non-feminist to see.<br/><br/>A sexual predator would not have waited over a year to wake a beautiful young woman from suspended animation, would not have agonized over the decision, and would not have stopped at just one. If I were a conscienceless man on board such a ship and found myself awake, you can bet I would have myself a harem of beautiful women. James Preston awakens only one woman, and that only after becoming suicidal at the prospect of a life of absolute loneliness.<br/><br/>The complaints about Aurora Lane are just as silly. When she finds out the truth, she is angry with Preston, and understandably so. She breaks off their relationship and refuses to speak to him. But when things go wrong with the ship and Preston must put himself in danger to save them all, Aurora tells him to come back to her, because she cannot face the ship alone for the rest of her life.<br/><br/>To understand is to forgive, and in that moment Aurora understands what Preston did and forgives him. It would take the cold heart of a feminist not to. Perhaps a feminist will be disappointed at the reaction the heroine has, but a regular person will see the shades of gray which zealots can never seem to recognize.<br/><br/>***END OF SPOILERS***<br/><br/>The sympathetic characters and interesting scenario are bolstered by wonderful sets and special effects that make many frames tiny works of art. Everything works together to imbue that sense of wonder that comes from science fiction at its best, and that magic which comes from our favorite works of film. There is very little to complain about. I went happily along for the ride with characters I plan to visit again, and at the end a song by Imagine Dragons ushers one out the door with a spring in one's step, music which perfectly captures the feel of the bitter sweetness of the film. Even now, as I type these words, the vapors of that movie's enchantment swirl in my head to that same tune. I think I shall not listen to another song until they finally, inevitably fade away."
"rikalonius","7","2","4","17 January 2017"," Good Movie - I think it could have been slightly better
","I think it was much better than critics give it credit for. That being said, I can understand, i think, why some didn't like it. We all bring our own biases into films. It was clear to me, from reading some of the professional critical reviews that they would have rated it higher if the events had transpired closer to their personal expectations. I cannot articulate why that is without spoilers, so here goes.<br/><br/>**Spoilers**<br/><br/>Much of the controversy revolves around Jim's decision to short- circuit Aurora's (Jennifer Lawrence) pod. In the film, Jim has been woken up by a subtle malfunction, caused by a tiny fragment of meteor getting past the ships deflection technology. Jim (Chris Pratt) is awake and finds he was woken up 90 years prior to the arrival at their destination, which means he is trapped on the ship, alone, for the remainder of his life.<br/><br/>Jim goes through a series of stages, similar to the film Groundhog Day. He tries to wake the crew, but cannot get through the protective firewall that guards their sleeping compartment. He tries to engineer his pod to put him back to sleep, but that does work, and through research, realizes he can't go back to sleep. So Jim, after meeting a robot bartender, goes through these psychological milestones. Grief, acceptance, etc. After a year, however, he is in complete despair. He considers suicide, but talks himself out of it. Then he sees one of the other passengers in her pod. Aurora (Yes, as in Disney's Aurora). <br/><br/>At first Aurora's unconscious form plays the part of Wilson in the film Castaway. Someone for Jim to talk to. She's a novelist, and a writer for a New York magazine back on Earth. Through exposure to her books and her interviews, he starts to feel an attraction to her. For months he convinces himself that he cannot wake her up, rationalizing his feelings away over and over until he can't any longer. So then does, what to many, is the unthinkable. <br/><br/>From that point we go through a romance subplot built on a lie. For some critics, they would have rather this had played out as a psychological thriller, wherein Jim is becomes the antagonist. It could have easily have been made this way. Instead the romance goes on for a while until the Robot bartender, due to a mistake by Jim, gives away the secret that Jim woke her up. She is, naturally, enraged. <br/><br/>The next act is spent with Jim trying to apologize to her. We can understand why she would be reluctant, and to keep her distance, which she does. But then the ship starts to break down due to a chain reaction that started two years earlier, and what had triggered Jim's pod to malfunction. The malfunctions begin to cascade and wake up a member of the crew, Gus. Gus figures out what Jim did, but there is too much work to do to fix the ship for moral condemnation. Later Aurora looks to commiserate with Gus about what a horrible thing Jim did. Gus agrees, but says it was an understandable human reaction to his situation. <br/><br/>Unfortunately Gus wasn't woken up as safely as Jim had been, and his abrupt discharge from hyper-sleep has severally damaged his internal organs. As he begins his death throws he gives his ID badge to Jim and tells the couple to take care of each other, and to fix the ship. Reluctantly Aurora helps Jim find the major problem with the gravity drive, and the movie turns into a Titanic style disaster film. This seemed to be another sore subject with critics, in that movie abruptly shifted gears. <br/><br/>In the end Jim offers to sacrifice himself to save the ship, but Aurora begins to realize that finality of that. It isn't articulated, but maybe she suddenly had the inkling that she would be desperately alone. It is one thing to refuse to forgive someone who is right there, and you can always forgive at your leisure, it is another to realize you'll be facing the same desperate decision Jim did. In the end Aurora performs a heroic act to save him.<br/><br/>Afterwards Jim finds a way to put Aurora back to sleep using a medical machine, but he would have to activate it from the outside. He offers her the life he stole from her, and in return, she chooses to stay by his side. I thought it was a nice ending, but many others were not satisfied with the happily ever after concept.<br/><br/>Overall I think the execution could have been better in some places, and that is a valid criticism. Still I think it is well worth the watch."

But unfortunately the focus was on the romantic development instead of psychology.<br/><br/>Special effects were great. A bonus point for introducing the concept of space-vertigo! If you are pedantic you could argue about some plot holes/illogical events in the movie, but hey it's a movie. If everything made sense, it would have been even more boring.

Some interesting ideas are raised but not truly explored and some of the characters didn't get a lot of build up or background, just kind of came and went. The special effects were top notch, some good exploration of Zero-G. Overall it was a visually stunning movie that sits well within the Sci-Fi genre, a good performance from Jennifer Lawrence, would of been nice to see more of Lawrence Fishburne though. I'm no scientist myself but the science seemed to be pretty solid in most parts of the film. While watching it quickly became apparent that the film was made with a small cast and a big special effects budget."
"jtindahouse","7","2","4","12 January 2017"," Good, but doesn't take enough risks
","I have to say I liked 'Passengers'. I wasn't too sure what to expect going in. I like the two leads enough (I don't love Chris Pratt but I can tolerate him and appreciate his charm at times), but I wasn't sure how much this was going to be about them, or how much it was going to be about a sci-fi story that just happened to feature them. I think they got the balance about right. There's actually a real character study in the story. There are some (one in particular) very complex decisions that the characters have to deal with and sort through and the ramifications of those are fascinating to watch. While at the same time I really enjoyed the sci-fi side of things. The concept was an interesting one and the complications that arose made for interesting viewing. There's some terrifically balanced writing featured in this film.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is that it didn't dare to be great. There was an ending which I actually expected to happen, that would have made this movie great in my opinion. If Chris Pratt's character 'Jim' had in fact died and then Jennifer Lawrence's character 'Aurora' had been faced with the same decision he had been faced with earlier in the film, I think this film could have gone down as something very special. The fact that I suspected this ending might be the case during the film, and was still willing to accept it as great if it did turn out that way, shows just how strong of a piece of writing it would have been. Unfortunatey though it was not be. And while this film is well made and a fun watch I fear it will fall into the forgettable category for not having the guts to do something more than a cliché Hollywood ending."
"imdb3-3","6","2","4","11 January 2017"," Frustrating. Great premise, many well done parts, laziest script ever
","The film look great. Lots of excellent special effects to make it convincing. Excellent cast. Compelling story. Very funny parody of what life may be like in the future. But boy does it ever fall flat as a board towards the end. And the ending is rushed, lame, pitiful and quite unbelievable. <br/><br/>The first hour is set up in a little quickly but it works, in spite of some stilted dialogue and scenes that should have been redone so that they didn't feel as if they were scripted and unnatural. But that's a minor quibble given how much I liked the premise and much of where the story was going. Pratt plays a man on a 120 year or so trip to another colony in space to live in luxury. This premise is completely absurd for many reasons (such as what you'll see in the movie.) During the journey he awakens very early after an asteroid strikes the ship and causes a malfunction. And he can't go back into hibernation (why... good question. Perhaps they thought the ship would never suffer the problem.) And he finds himself alone... very alone. And as a result he must make some difficult choices.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence obviously appears in the film. She does a great job with what she's been handed. Michael Sheen as the bartender is perfectly cast although very little is done with him. The real problems are contrivance that begin to work their way into being positively annoying and dumb when ""the twist"" happens during the film that changes the course of everything. It's the kind of mistake that shouldn't have been made because the character wouldn't make such a mistake. And from there the film ends up traveling at light speed towards phony. It never recovers from that fatal misstep.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that a film with the potential for so many great directions falls so flat in the second half. And for this reason I've given the film a very generous 6. You may really enjoy the atmosphere and the premise. But when it fails you may feel cheated by a very lazy effort. It's disappointing. Could have been a top film of the year."
"TheMovieDiorama","7","2","4","9 January 2017"," I wish there was a real driving force for this sci-fi romance.
","An attempt to get two of Hollywood's biggest actors together, Passengers is a romantic sci-fi where a colonisation ship is traveling to its destination when a hibernation pod fails and wakes someone up...90 years before it reaches Homestead II. But is this destiny? Is there a greater meaning to this? Or are these questions actually pointless as the film does not explore them at all? I can tell you the last question is correct. Whilst this does boast an impressive cast and director, the script and story lets it down. I shall start off by saying that Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are perfect in this film. They both have charisma, charm and plenty of humour and the chemistry between them is believable. Michael Sheen plays an android bartender and is the comic relief, his British wit was much needed. Laurence Fishburne is also in the film, but I shan't spoil his character...though what I will say is that when he appears, the film turns around and says ""I bring you...plot conveniences!"". Honestly, the storyline was just filled with so many conveniences that it infuriated me, not to mention the last act of the film that was just ridiculous. Chris Pratt's character is a convenience, the ship malfunctioning is a convenience...I would even say the conveniences have convenience. There could've been so much purpose to this, a far more poignant ending and the critics would've loved this. In fairness though, I did enjoy this somewhat. Morten Tyldum did a great job directing with plenty of wide camera shots and nice still panning shots, it made the Avalon (the colonisation ship) look majestic. This brings me onto production, the design of the Avalon and the computers, holograms...heck even the robots, it all looked fantastic! Some great creativity was used, it's just unfortunate that the film will only be remembered for that. Thomas Newman composing though, euphoric! Possibly one of the best soundtracks for a 2016 film, I loved it. I mean don't get me wrong, this film is enjoyable. The romance is what people want to see and I became invested in them, I believed that they would make a good couple and even with a heart breaking revelation, I still wanted them to be together. The script even dabbled into themes of loneliness and solitude, it just wasn't explored thoroughly enough. Overall, Passengers has two great actors and great production, but the flawed story that's full of plot conveniences makes this rather boring at times. The soundtrack however, I would give full marks!<br/><br/><ul><li>Review at: http://www.themoviediorama.com</li></ul>"

","In Kyrgyzstan, they have the not-so-delightful custom of kidnapping fiances to save on dowry money. The old caveman trope has heavy-jawed caveman in fur toga, club in hand, dragging cave-woman by the hair. Etc etc. This film is for me a loose remake of 1966 film 'The Trap' which has Oliver Reed as a fur trapper dragging wife hairwiseinto his Alaskan wilderness 'cave'. As per trope, she gets used to it and even becomes attached to him. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence seems like a pretty with-it modern woman. I'm wondering how she was persuaded to play this politically retrograde role. Did she think the developed world is free enough of the last thousands of years of female subjugation that this story won't be a representative example of same? You can't escape context, and this film's context screams 'made by cavemen to serve their agenda', unfortunately. I'm giving it two extra stars for the moderate degree of that specialised quality of wonder sci fi films bring. 4 extra stars for Michael Sheen, who is great as the resident android. Any that would have been given for entertainment value are cancelled out by political dodginess."

"josefsloan-64696","6","0","0","24 May 2020"," Great film - Weird Ending
","I'm going to start this by saying this is the first film review I've ever done and I created an account just to express my frustration towards the ending of this film.<br/><br/>Personally, I loved the film, the film had amazing suspense and plot twists like with Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) having to hold the doors open for the reactor to vent the heat in order to save the ship although I feel like Sony had spent way too much in the start and middle of the film and ran out of money three quarters of the way through because I feel there was so much missing, we never got to see any sort of dispute or argument when they realize the AutoDoc could put one person back into hibernation, there was not even a mention of Aurora's (Jennifer Lawrence) decision (I do realize this wouldn't add a lot to the film in terms of time but it was a massive find that I feel should have been drawn out a little bit and would have added to the story.)<br/><br/>Another thing that frustrated me was how the film just got cut off with Aurora and Jim sat at the bar and Jim hands Aurora the ring and BANG we're now looking at a scene 88 years later and the crew has woken up with no mention of what Aurora and Jim did. I know that it does kind of tell you with the crew walking out of the door to see the main lobby had been turned into a jungle with chickens and a little wooden house but, and I know I've already said this a lot, I just feel there was so much missing to the end of the story.<br/><br/>I just feel there was such a massive hole in the story that it needs a prequel but I don't see how you could make a prequel out of what was missing, all the film needed was an extra 30 minutes to solidify it all.<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE
(Not apart of the review but an opinion on peoples feelings towards Jim waking Aurora)<br/><br/>I don't think Jim did the right thing in waking up Aurora although I personally can see why he did it, think about it, if you've spent a whole year in a big spaceship being the only person awake with the only thing on your mind is that no one else is going to wake up because it's been a year and no one else has, wouldn't you? I think I would."

","Just watched it in 4K and I have to say my impression of the film now is a lot better than the first time I watched it in 1080p. The scene and setup is just stunning, every angle you discover something new with details and that makes their love story more believable if they're to stuck on that ship for so long, you feel what they feel through the details of the scenes, very good job here.<br/><br/>During the ending part of the movie where she was trying to resuscitate him was one of the best acting by Lawrence I've seen, and it couldn't have done it without good editing, really felt the suspense.<br/><br/>What I didn't like about the film the first time I saw it was there seems to be too much focus/attention built towards selling the two main actors. The movie poster says it a lot, what would people think if you put two of the hottest most popular actors of the era together and lock them in a confined space, what would happen. The problem is if viewers don't like these 2 then they have no urge to watch the movie, and it's a loss because the movie isn't really about them.<br/><br/>Now to the stuff I think it's ridiculous:
1. Hibernation for 120yrs without stops in between, at least design a protocol to check on everybody every 10-20yrs, as in wake up, make sure everybody is okay, then go back to hibernation. The passengers don't need to wake up, but the crew does. And they should have a pod to do the hibernation, consider they have spare parts for everything on the ship but they don't have the one most important thing.
2. Civilians can't know how to fix the damn ship.
3. What a coincidence that the only crew member who's useful to fix the ship dies. His whole purpose I guess is to give Jim his wristband.
4. To leave earth and abandon all your families friends behind you'd be pronounced DEAD. Why not just clone some people and send them over on the long journey, awfully expensive too.
5. Last, the whole point of migration is because Earth is too crowded, but it's not explained what would happen once they have established the new colony with just 5000 people, does it mean they plan to ship more and more volunteers to the new planet so Earth can somehow resolve the population crisis? Wouldn't that take a million years? By that time I think mars would already be inhabitable, why travel so far.<br/><br/>Overall entertaining movie, do not take it seriously."

","The critics gave this movie fairly low ratings, but there were some regular people I've seen that say that this was good, it looked and sounded like something worthwhile, so I decided I'd make my own mind up, directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game). Basically, The Avalon is a sleeper spaceship, transporting 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members in hibernation pods, designed to keep those onboard asleep for 120 years. The ship is on autopilot on a journey going across the universe to a new star system to the planet Homestead II, and the ship has so far travelled for 30 years. The ship travels through a meteor storm, power is diverted into the forward shield, and a collision with a large asteroid causes a power blink. The fault causes the computer to awaken one passenger, mechanical engineer James ""Jim"" Preston (Chris Pratt), from his induced hibernation. 90 years too early. He is told that it is normal to feel confused and weak after being asleep for so long, but he is concerned being the only person attending an orientation session. Jim goes around the various computer help systems for information of what is going on, and he is shocked to discover the truth. He tries various things to find a way to reactivate his hibernation pod, or get into the flight control room, but with no success. He sends a message asking for help but finds out it will be fifteen years before anyone on Earth receives it. He is on his own. For some time, he feels depressed, and only has the android barman Arthur (Michael Sheen) for company. Arthur encourages him to make the most of the time he has being alone, to do whatever he wants, so Jim find some entertainment on the ship, such as sneaking into the higher quality suite bedrooms, the many choices of food and drink, the swimming pool, sports equipment, virtual reality games, and much more. However, after a year of being alone, Jim once again becomes despondent, his only moment of some positivity is getting a spacesuit and stepping outside to see the stars. Jim contemplates committing suicide, remaining inside the chamber and opening the door to launch him into the vacuum of space, but he cannot bring himself to do it. Then, when exploring the various pods, Jim notices the beautiful passengers Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), he studies her profile, she is a journalist travelling for adventure. He thinks she is perfect and is smitten; he wrestles with himself about waking her up, knowing that it will doom her to die on the ship, but he cannot stand the isolation and loneliness. He finally decides to awaken her, letting her believe that her pod also malfunctioned. Jim asks Arthur to keep the secret that he woke her up until Jim himself has told her. Aurora also makes various attempts to re-enter hibernation or contact the crew. Resigned to the situation, Aurora begins writing a book about her experience. Over the next year, Jim and Aurora become friends and partake in activities together. They eventually growing closer, go on a proper date together, and falling in love. Jim intends to propose to Aurora, but Aurora says to Arthur there are ""no secrets"" between her and Jim, and the android inadvertently reveals the truth to her. Aurora is shocked, anguished and enraged at Jim, she berates and for some time shuns Jim, also physically attacking him. She furiously rejects Jim's pleas for forgiveness, and she avoids any contact with him. Soon after, there is another fault in the system, another pod is damaged and Chief Deck Officer Gus Mancuso (Laurence Fishburne) is awakened from hibernation. Accessing the ship's mainframe, he discovers multiple failures have taken place throughout the ship's systems over some time. If not repaired, the ship will continue suffering critical system failures and the mission may fail. Gus tries to repair the ship, with help from Jim and Aurora, but he soon falls critically ill, having been physically weakened by his malfunctioning pod. The Autodoc, the ship's automated medical diagnostics and treatment pod, reveals that Gus has a prognosis of only hours to live. Gus gives Jim and Aurora his ID badge to access crew-only areas and to repair the ship before he dies. Jim and Aurora discover a series of hull breaches from the asteroid collision two years earlier. The computer module administering the fusion reactor powering the ship has been critically damaged, causing the cascading malfunctions across the ship as all other systems divert power towards the reactor. Jim and Aurora replace the damaged module. But Jim must vent the reactor to extinguish a massive reactor fire after the computer fails, he must open the vent hatch from the ship's exterior while Aurora assists from inside. Aurora admits being terrified of losing Jim and being left alone. After venting the reactor and the fire swarming his spacesuit, Jim's tether snaps, and his damaged suit starts losing oxygen. Aurora retrieves Jim from outer space, but must resuscitate him in the Autodoc, and eventually he is revived. Afterwards, Jim learns that the Autodoc can function as a makeshift hibernation pod for one person. He gives Aurora the chance to go back into hibernation for the remainder of the voyage. She realises she will never see Jim again, and chooses to remain awake with him. Jim presents her with the ring he had made, which she accepts. 88 years later, the ship's crew is awakened on schedule, a few months before the ship is due to arrive at Homestead II. Captain Norris (Andy Garcia) and the other passengers discover a huge tree, a forest of plants and vegetables, and birds flying. Aurora's voice, left in a recording, describes the wonderful life she and Jim lived together on the Avalon. Also starring Aurora Perrineau as Celeste, Aurora's best friend, with the voices of Emma Clarke, Chris Edgerly, Matt Corboy, Fred Melamed and Jon Spaihts (screenwriter) as the various voices of the Avalon computers. Lawrence and Pratt are both terrific actors, alone for some time Pratt is likeable, Lawrence is gorgeous and charming, and they do have great chemistry together, there is good short support from Sheen and Fishburne as well, but I don't understand the point of casting Garcia (who only appears for 10 seconds!). There are arguments that can be made about the moral aspects, perhaps the romance between the strangers is questionable, and it gets a little formulaic towards the end when it becomes a matter of life and death. But personally, I ignored any flaws there may or may not have been, and I just settled back and went with it, I think the critics are rather unfair with their opinions. It is a very compelling story with interesting ideas, splendid acting, a well-rounded script and concept, great set design, the special effects are fantastic, and I can see no reason to be disappointed, a pretty good science-fiction romantic drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Music, Original Score for Thomas Newman, and Best Production Design. Worth watching!"
"senor_spielbergo123","Null","0","0","11 April 2020"," Mindless movie for date-nights, solely saved by its casting choices
","This movie is going to be picked for many date movie nights and I can see it doing its job of entertaining couples very well. I attribute this mostly to Chris Pratt's and Jennifer Lawrence's on-screen chemistry and less to the script. It offers a bit of charming romcom, lots of over-the-top action and a bit of drama. Sadly, the movie didn't do more with its interesting premise: If you were stranded somewhere, would you want to have somebody with you? Even if that person would have to suffer the same fate as you? Pratt woke up Lawrence because he couldn't live alone for the rest of his live. It is both emotionally understandable and morally wrong. In terms of the movie, the consequences were predictable and the timing was anti-climatic, leading to the low-point in the story arc before the movie resolves in action-schlock."

The two leads were cast perfectly in their roles and gave good performances, the special affects were great also. The last 20 mins was a bit lame but ultimately I really enjoyed it.

"GiraffeDoor","6","0","0","15 March 2020"," If it had sucked I could have said something like ""want to go to sleep for 90 years? Just watch this movie!"" But it's actually pretty passable. So...yeah.
","The problem with high-concept stories is that they have a tendency to coast on their concept. But the thing about a great concept is that you can coast on them for quite a while and this movie has a good concept.<br/><br/>Plotwise at least, this sort of writes itself; Act 1: the solitude, Act 2: the courtship, Act 3: well, I think I'll let you find out.<br/><br/>I knew the basic premise going in but I still feel they missed a trick really establishing the main problem. our guy doesn't have that much in terms of personality but I liked him and enjoyed following on this emotional journey into the bowels of loneliness with only the automatons for company (and trust me, they're bad company).<br/><br/>The design and sets will satisfy your technophilic cravings. The ship has a distinctive design I thought was pretty original and the chic, futuristic (but not cartoonishly futurist) insides made a wonderful backdrop as one man's gilded cage (I like that term, I'm not sure where I first read it...). At times it reminded me of a videogame in how you just wonder round and discover this three dimensional labyrinth where it neatly recycles some ideas that were wasted on Space Oddyssey.<br/><br/>Watching this movie you just have to accept that there was no failsafe to early awakening because ""the pods don't malfunction"". When you think how much Health and Safety effects our lives right now, it's hard for me to accept that that would stop them hedging their bets. I can suspend disbelief for everything else no problem but this annoys me.<br/><br/>So finally our deuteragonist becomes part of this. When I was reviewing ""Mother!"" I said that every role that went to Lawrence should have gone to Kristen Stewart (yeah, I know, bring on the dislikes), but this character was actually quite perfect for her, which is a discredit to the character. Rarely in fiction does one encounter someone as smug, self-satisfied and hoity-toity as this mademoiselle. I get the impression that I am just supposed to buy that she's the perfect that is out of any mechanic's league, but it's an informed attribute. Like how apparently they are an unlikely pair though personally I think he would dump her before she dumped him. We was a cool, sexy guy and a lot less self absorbed. When he asks her out she actually says ""I thought you'd never ask"". You coulda asked him out, you can either be a *girl* or help smash patriarchy, not both.<br/><br/>The story actually has a lot of punch as it shows not only an initially desperate situation but also the extent this compels us to do something embarrassing to the one we really want to like us and the aftermath. So yeah, he's in the doghouse for a bit.<br/><br/>That's another thing that bugged me: I wouldn't have thought about this a few years ago but it seems to always be the male character that the pursuer, the one that pines for the female and is the one that has to live with the idea that they messed up in their pursuit of the female. Why can't it be a male character that gets pursued this way, or a female character that is shown to pine and pursue a male? It could be homosexual or just inverted straightness, but it would be so easy to do...so that's my rant.<br/><br/>Our final act is pretty intense and the suspense is really there. It's a pity that it's wasted hear since I was never sufficiently invested in this romance for it to have much of an emotional impact and the timing is frequently off. Suspense is like a joke, each part can't be too slow or too quick, it's a delicate operation but it looks stunning with a lot of inventive moments convincingly realized.<br/><br/>Ultimately, passengers is a sweet piece of high budget science fiction with a perfectly workable plot that is fine for a Monday night, only really marred by a bland (but likeable enough) character and one really annoying character. The script isn't exactly tight either; a lot of the cutsiness just falls flat. But there's a good chuckle or two in the mix."
"gilleliath","7","0","0","8 March 2020"," a lot better than I was expecting
","I was expecting the same old space opera stuff here, and sure enough it opens with a raft of visual clichés from the likes of 2001, Alien and (more surprisingly) The Shining. For me, coming from the same pen as the daft Prometheus was no recommendation. And so it was nice to find that the story developed into something quite new and interesting; not only that, it's told with a rare humour (in space, usually, no one can hear you laugh). I especially enjoyed Michael Sheen's performance as a slightly dorky android.<br/><br/>However once Laurence Fishburne has come, set up the finale, and gone again, the moral dilemmas are shelved and the film lurches into much more familiar (that is, stale) disaster movie territory. I suppose the film's beautiful looks had to be paid for this way - as we know, all Hollywood movies have to end with a Big Explosion - but it's a shame as the story didn't need it; nor did the film's wise if obvious message need to be underlined by a reprise at the end."
"popadopalous","10","0","0","23 February 2020"," Amazing Scifi Movie - An Emotional Roller Coaster of Desperation, Love, & Guilt
","I'm normally quite critical of movies and hard to please. But WOW. This movie was amazing! It fits into categories of sci-fi, drama, mystery, and romance (that's not cheesy)--all in a great balance. Although the base sci-fi plot itself is quite unoriginal, but they did a fantastic job of executing it in their own way with a great story. I felt very invested into the believable characters: the ironic situations that saddened them, angered them, sparked love, handling guilt, etc. The movie is heart-wrenching, intense, and intriguing. The movie is truly an emotional roller coaster exploring some deep social aspects of life, loneliness, companionship, love, selfishness, and bitterness.<br/><br/>My favorite part about the movie is that it wonderfully explores an intense philosophical moral dilemma: if you were all alone to the point of misery and desperation, but could summon someone to you, would you do it at the cost of stealing away their life for your selfish gain? Man, I have not felt this emotionally touched by a movie in a very long time and I think it just because one of my favorite movies ever. Of course, like all movies, it had flaws. But I was willing to overlook those flaws because the movie had so many elements that appealed to me: science fiction, exploring a philosophical/moral dilemma, believable characters you empathize with, nostalgic sentimentality, mystery and intensity, and a non-cheesy romance. A must watch!"

","The film is very aesthetic. It's just a space version of Titanic. It's absolutely romantic for Jim and Aurora to go out of the spaceship and swim in space. In a sense, science fiction is also the embodiment of romance and loneliness in space that makes them love each other. Love and loneliness promote each other and make the story reach an unprecedented level. To be honest, there was a moment when I wanted to have this experience."

","A sci fi and romance movie can be hard to create but it was done pretty well in this movie. The movie is based in the future, specifically on the Avalon, a futuristic passenger spaceship on its way to a new planet for resettlement. After a seemingly small system failure, protagonist, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt), wakes up from hibernation only to find that he's the only one awake. A year later and on the brink of insanity, Jim falls in love with a woman still in hibernation. After waking Aurora up and lying about his part in, essentially, ruining her life, Jim and Aurora fall for each other. As small malfunctions around the ship become larger, Jim and Aurora's problems expand beyond their relationship as they find themselves responsible for the safety of the 5,000 lives onboard. A controversial movie with some good special effects and some great tension, Passengers is worth watching."

","Since Star Wars, science fiction films have been compelled to wow us visually with special effects, each topping the previous with its display of grand things outside our current experience. (Unfortunately often at the neglect of plor, characterization, etc., but that's a different rant.) Passengers is a success here.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both highly talented actors, and they both did good jobs here. Quite believable, both of them.<br/><br/>I found pacing of the movie unsatisfying, too much time spent on build up - scene setting and buildup of the budding romance - until finally getting into the drama of danger and its resolution.<br/><br/>The background story of a company making sesquigazillions in money off colonizing planets that take hundreds of years for trips leaves me skeptical, but I'm willing to give that a bit of a break because its just backstory to set the scene.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint though is the idea of this one man being able to able to pull off saving the ship as he did. The idea is, well, he's a mechanic so he can fix stuff. The earlier part where he finds and reads a manual to figure out how to do things, OK, but coming into the climax where he has to figure out what is wrong with the ship and how to fix it, what are they going to do? I kid you not, ""Look for something that's broken."" Open a cabinet of electronics and look at it and say, ""That looks OK"". And then when they finally find the source of the problem (I'm trying very hard not to do spoilers here), under intense time pressure (so no time to read maintenance manuals) he instantly knows what has to be done and how and where.<br/><br/>Kinda spoiled it for me. Not sorry I watched it on TV, but if I had paid for it in a movie theater I would have been disappointed."

The capturing of the human stages of loneliness pain is flawless, and regardless whether you watch The Passenger as a psychology-class or a moral lesson, if you watch this and don't end up pondering about something hard to chew about the human psychology and loneliness, you are probably watching with half your brain.

","This movie is enjoyable enough if you ignore the massive plot holes and bad science.<br/><br/>On that note, it's disappointing that many commentators and reviewers (and the ""goofs"" section) can't get their science right either!<br/><br/>50% light speed does NOT produce massive time dilation effects. A 120 year journey time on the ship would be 139 years on Earth (and that's assuming 50% LS for the entire trip and ignores the acceleration and deceleration at the start and end which would lower the Earth duration further to about 125 years). You can calculate this yourself - there are plenty of on-line calculators for time dilation effects.<br/><br/>A sling-shot maneuver would not work to any great extent for 50% c.. One assumes this would be for a course correction, but why bother? You can just go straight to the destination which would be a shorter and quicker path. If it's for energy transfer (a la Voyager/Pioneer spacecraft) then that too would be minute and pointless.<br/><br/>However, these are minor quibbles because so much other science is wrong in this movie.

I have never in history seen a sci-fi movie that actually manages to follow laws of physic, nor even simple matters, because of the simple fact that it would get boring.<br/><br/>2. The acting in this movie is okay, but what's real good is the feeling it gives you of being alone. The angst, the fear and how much social contact matters to us.<br/><br/>3. Alot of people say ""he should've waken up a crew member from the beginning"". What these people don't get is that this guy has spent a year searching for a way to get back into hybernation. He has tried everything in his power to do so and has reached to the conclusion that nothing can be done. Now if someone had the choice of waking up 1 person under these conditions: why not choose someone you could see yourself spending the rest of your life with?<br/><br/>So if you're okay with not everything being realistic, watch this movie.<br/><br/>If not, don't watch sci-fi."

","I love anything with Chris Pratt and I enjoy Jennifer Lawrence as well. But I took issue with a lot of the logic behind the movie. Maybe it's my analytical, logic driven side, but there's no way that the ship would have no crew awake to check on passengers and problems with the ship. Every machine has its kinks. It makes no sense that there would be no one awake to monitor the ship. The setting is in a time where people can be in a hibernation, comatose state for 120 years and yet it takes 19 years and $6,012 to send a message and 36 yeas to hear back. Maybe it's just me, but if you can look past all the logical errors the writers and directors missed out on, and enjoy a movie like a normal person, then it's a pretty decent movie. I don't wish I had the $8.59 back I paid to see the movie if that tells you anything."

","SPOILER-WARNING!!! When I first read of the movie Passengers, I was thrilled. Yet another exciting film about colonization and traveling to another planet. After seeing the trailer my hopes were up! <br/><br/>I have quite a high standard for when it comes to sci-fi movies. Even if my favorite series as child was Star-Trek. The most desirable features in a movie for me are: a great plot that is carried all the way throughout the film, great characters, authenticity, attention to detail and hi-def quality. I have great respect for movies that have been recorded using high quality-cameras so that every move is captured thus creating more believable and beautiful-looking scenes by showing the whole movement-series. The more I find out that thought has been put to every single detail, the more pleased I become.<br/><br/>To get to my point I have to start by saying that my favorite disappointments (interstellar, gravity) have a few things in common: they leave my questions unanswered, they make great promises, have huge build-ups and end up letting me down. Usually with and ending that isn't satisfying or For some reason seems to be different from rest of the film. <br/><br/>And this one wasn't any different. Movie that could've been great. But didn't live up to it's possibilities and therefore didn't deliver, couldn't get to the finish-line. <br/><br/>So why was I so frustrated? For numerous reasons, first one being that only a few of the big questions were answered. Too many questions were left unanswered: for example why didn't the man wake up any technicians? Why didn't the man try to do everything in his power to figure out why he woke up? (And if he did - the movie did a poor job explaining) Why didn't the girl go back to sleep? What happened when they got to their destination? How was life in the colony? The ending scene lasted approximately 10 seconds and left everything hanging. I was so disappointed that I wanted to scream. Why???? Why?? Why???<br/><br/>So I'm left to ponder: did the time to process the film run out, did their money run out or were they just so insecure that they left a whole movie without a decent ending to please a crowd that thinks a movie which is longer than 2 hours isn't their idea of time and money well-spent?"

","Passengers is a very entertaining film that should captivate its viewer from start to finish. Its novel approach, direction and acting makes it a memorable movie that could still be enjoyed in years in to come.<br/><br/>Passengers is a well made futuristic film that takes place entirely in space. 5000 people are on a very long journey journey to another planet in a sophisticated spaceship. A malfunction results in Chris Pratt's character being awoken with 90 years left, his pod is the only one. After a year he cannot bear the loneliness and decides to wake up and stop the hibernation of the most beautiful girl he's seen and read about. I have never been a fan of romantic stories in film as often they are unrealistic, ridiculous and plain unnecessary. Rarely do they make a well paced and believable romance that adds value to the film as a whole. Passengers is one of these exceptions. Not only is it well paced, it is believable and realistic these two would start a romance. Things become very complicated when Jennifer Lawrence's character finds out that he purposely woke her up and they're the only two awake aboard.<br/><br/>Passengers is more than a love story. It's unique nature and challenges are bound to keep viewers on their toes. This film delivers some great moments. As the ship gradually declines it becomes a great fight for survival in a complicated ship in the middle of space. We see chilling scenes when almost all is lost for all passengers. The two passengers put their lives at risk and sacrifice themselves to fix the space ship. <br/><br/>Passengers exceeds expectations and is in many ways ahead of its time. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence give stellar performances in this space film. Sadly it was overlooked by critics and the Award ceremonies. Its quality has been downplayed even on this site which is a shame. It has similarities to the futuristic film, Gattaca, which was also unique, ahead of its time and overlooked. I feel in years viewers might discover this gem and give it the praise it deserves. It is definitely recommended."

","I found the movie to be relatable. I could see myself taking advantage of the entire ship if I was the only one around with no apparent consequences. His choice to awaken another passenger due to loneliness is understandable as someone who has gone backpacking for weeks at a time alone. However I was not impressed by the ending. If they sacrificed and alternated in the med pod they could have reached the planet and still be in their 50-60's. If they took time being together every third year they could still be in their 80's or 90's when they reached the planet. The other question to ask is why did they not have any kids. If they died, like it was assumed, then their children could have done the voice over about what their parents did. Another question is if technology was so advanced would people not live longer then their 80's?"

She presents a truly believable character who seems whole, like a real person who is alive.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt's role, for the most part, requires a more subtle performance, which provides a solid foundation for his co-actor to build her performance on.

Other reviews have pointed to examples where we are asked to suspend disbelief where it is impossible to do so. <br/><br/>For me, it is the basic premise that is hard to believe. Would a ship on 120 year journey really not have any type of fail-safe for passengers who woke up early? Would there be absolutely no way to wake up a crew member? It would have been so easy to solve this by having the ""on call"" crew member killed by the same incident that woke up Chris Pratt's character. <br/><br/>The acting make this worth watching."

But as far as sci fi romance end, which is a pretty small group, I put it in the top 4 all time The big question among reviewers on this site, is why the bad reviews by the main critics? The answer is quite simple. You are putting in a formulaic sci fi plot,of early hibernation wake-up, plus equally formulaic ""we were thrown together"" love story. Then add in the hot actors and slick production and suspense, and you are reaching for a blockbuster. Critics don't like to be reached for. For me, however, its about well rounded characters, human motivation, and production quality, before I even want to go into the science end. This delivers all that, and does it by combining the plot values I mention above in a successful attempt to make something new. Lets face it folks, this isn't rocket science, or even star-ship science. Its entertainment on a high quality level on all fronts. Is it great? No. Is it very good? Heck yes. Very worth the watch. To me, the movies are about entertainment, and if you learn something, that's a bonus.

","I saw this as a feature on a plane and due to a glitch in the entertainment system I missed the last half hour.

Pratt was okay other than being a creeper by figuring out which other passenger he wanted to bang. Lawrence was unlikable and useless, they could have put in any no name actress and saved a fortune, I highly doubt she drew anyone to see this semi trainwreck of a movie,certainly not on her looks. Sheen as a robot was outstanding yet somehow I think the robot had an agenda. Fishburn was great for the 5 minutes you see of him before he goes from fine to dead in about 2 hours (in movie time of course). His stated role on the ship should have been more impressive and it would have made his knowledge base credible. Yes it is science fiction but it doesn't mean it has to be stupid or presume the audience is stupid. It is as dumb as the Martian and really it is the same story. It also can dig into desperate situations without being so shallow and it can be visually great without doing the typical crap they do in almost all movies now is making the movie a vehicle for computer generated special affects which take next to no talent to create. They also cheaped-out in the ending, just as they could have redeemed themselves, everyone else wakes up and it is over.

"Screen_Blitz","6","0","0","19 April 2017"," This extravagant science-fiction adventure strives for visual compulsion, but suffers from a blemished execution
","Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are easily some of the most likable actors in the Hollywood roster, so placing these two together in a fun cinematic adventure wouldn't be a bad idea. But a duo of charismatic entities and a eye-feasting visual style only have the muscle to make of half the equation for this science- fiction adventure. This movie, which introduces a thought-provoking idea supplemented with themes of moral dilemmas, has a fair sense of potential shining through its cracks. But what happens when your concept is plagued by a problematic execution that involves places a huge twist in the arguably the most inconvenient time? In other words, that is my way of explaining how the ethical dilemma that was greatly obscured in the advertising. So in an effort to discuss the highs and lows of this science-fiction piece, this review will require me to discuss some aspects that may contain spoilers. Set in the near-future, this film is set on a spaceship known as the Starship Avalon which carries thousands of passengers each in a hibernation chamber on a 120-year voyage to another planet. When a malfunction in the ship causes Jim (played by Chris Pratt) to wake up from his hibernation chamber 90 years early, he finds himself stranded alone on the ship with no one to talk to but an humanoid bartender (played by Michael Sheen). He is later joined by a hot blondie named Aurora (played by Jennifer Lawrence) who's sleep chamber is also deactivated. Together, the two form a bond that is greatly interrupted when the ship begins to malfunction. <br/><br/>The filmmaker behind this vehicle is Morten Tyldum, who last spawned the World War II thriller 'The Imitation Game'. This director proves to have a ingenuity in the visual department. The spaceship design is firmly original, and the visual effects which play a major role in the second half serve a nice treat for the eyes, while owing principles to entities like '2001: A Space Odyssey' and 'Interstellar'. While the film not only sets stone to an intriguing premise but also feeds clear evidence that director Tyldum has strong ambition for thoughtful ideas, his way of handling the cerebral concept leads a lot to be questioned. The story kicks off on a friendly start with Chris Pratt exploring the ship while struggling to figure out the solution behind his dilemma. These first minutes are executed with great effort to establish the thought-provoking nature of his character. But it's not long before the film makes the fatal decision of taking the cat out of the bag and reveal a shocking twist that unravels an morally depraved nature of Chris Pratt's character before the story even reaches its halfway point. In return, when the revelation is discovered by Jennifer Lawrence, the result lacks impact and therefore kills the element of surprise. Although the story handles his morally dubious act is an sympathetic manner regardless of whether or not viewers will commiserate his actions, it sadly falls shallow of surprises, especially when it inexplicably tosses the idea out the window in the final act. On the bright side, the film has its exciting moments, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence share a sweet chemistry as well as some humorous moments that lighten the weight of the morbid premise. Michael Sheen on the other hand, is given little to do other than provide a stoic portrayal of a humanoid bartender who shares a few clever conversations with Pratt.<br/><br/>Passengers is flawed science-fiction extravaganza that spares some clever moments and thoughtful themes of morality, while undergoing a problematic execution. While there is no doubt Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt will the the major draw, the film stumbles in its potential to reel out a masterfully intriguing concept. Nonetheless, it can still make for a fun ride."

However, in light of 'equal opportunity' efforts now and in the future I do think that Jennifer's rear end should have been shown too. Also, I'm not sure about the movie's science being always being valid, for example: humans being able to be tethered outside the ship going half the speed of light, and not being fried while so close to the out of control reactor. Also, the much older awakened crewman seemed out of sync for his short useful life span at the final destination."

","It's been a long time that i have given up on Hollywood blockbusters. Being more often than not very much the same, that is to say full to an unbearable extend of clichés, stereotypes, paper characters and arbitrary hence too predictable scripts, i find them too boring to watch in spite of their spectacular visual effects which i used to find impressive when i was a child but not anymore. This is the rule but as many rules this one too has its exceptions. Well, this rule does not apply to this film. What originally attracted my interest in the ""passengers"" was the beginning of the story: ""One out of five thousand hibernated passengers of a spaceship traveling to a far distant planet wakes up because of a system malfunction ninety years before the arrival to a new interstellar colony, doomed to live, age and die in the ship before it reaches its destination"". I found this idea very intriguing and though i have often in the past left in the lurch by interesting Hollywood script beginnings i decided to give this one a try. Well, i was not disappointed, not at all. Some clichés and stereotypes were of course there too, yet fully understandable given a mainstream adventure movie and not enough to prevent me from really enjoying the story -which was not just thrilling and intriguing, it was moving as well thanks to its combination of a survival drama and its very touching human feelings approach given the circumstances- from the beginning to its very end. Last but not least: Chris and Jeniffer - both beautiful and talented -in the leading roles is one of the film's assets."

","""We were woken too soon... Ninety years too soon. We have too go back to sleep. We Can't !"" <br/><br/>At first, I just tried to ignore this movie and I was hoping I would come across it someday on some television channel during a quiet Saturday night. First of all because I'm not dying to see a movie with Jennifer Lawrence acting in it. Even if the antagonist is played by the charming Chris Pratt. And also because there were a lot of indications that this would be a typical romantic space story. I thought this would be the galactic version of ""Titanic"". Only that the spacecraft won't hit a banal iceberg and those two turtledoves won't be standing on the bow of the ship while embracing each other intimately with a cosmic wind rustles through their hair. Or maybe a modern version of ""Loveboat"" (only the dwarf dressed up in a futuristic garb is missing). All in all the romantic drool section wasn't such a big of a deal. And to my surprise it was more a visual SciFi spectacle than a love story about two remaining passengers spending the rest of their days on a luxurious spacecraft.<br/><br/>To be honest, the first part was both fascinating and wonderfully humorous. The spaceship looked impressive. The first images of the huge dormitory where all pods are standing in which thousands of passengers are sleeping an artificial sleep, were mind blowing. They are on their way, along with a few hundred crew members, to a better place to found a new colony. When a comet storm throws a spanner in the works, it's Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) who first wakes up. Unfortunately for him it'll still take 90 years before they reach their final destination. That's the beginning of the more humorous part. Not high quality humor, but still good enough for a few chuckle moments. The way Jim spends his free time and his entertaining conversations with Arthur (Michael Sheen), a robotic bartender, provide some funny moments. And all this takes place in beautifully constructed sets and breathtaking interiors. One thing is certain, they spared no expense when designing this gigantic spaceship.<br/><br/>Of course, gradually the excitement disappears and is replaced by a more profound atmosphere, wherein feelings of loneliness surface and doubts arise about the meaning of a further solitary existence. Time to provide Jim with a feminine counterbalance. That's when Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) enters the scene. In terms of good looks, both of them belong together Tinder-wise. Them having beautiful children is written in the stars. Well, this is the beginning of the romantic chapter in which both start to scan each other meticulously and carefully, start to know each other better and finally in terms of intimacy are a perfect match. Despite my fear, the romance part remained fairly limited. The only thing I noticed is that Jennifer Lawrence hasn't only grown what acting concerns. Either there were some hormonal changes or there has been a medical intervention. Something I noticed immediately. However, her acting part was rather limited. It seemed as if they gave Jim the most sensual female toy from the entire crew. Of course an obligated pool scene had to be included I guess. Although, it looked extremely spectacular (and no I'm not talking about the feminine curves of J. Lawrence) due to a malfunctioning artificial gravity.<br/><br/>And then it's time to start the action-packed part with also a short performance by Laurence Fishburne and some impressive CGI sequences. Sometimes it made me think of ""Gravity"" and ""The Martian"", but that didn't really bother me. You see, it's kind of a mixture of different genres. The most vulnerable part of the film is the limited cast (ultimately it's only Jim and Aurora you'll see). To be honest, nothing wrong can be said about their performances and indeed there's a chemistry between the two protagonists. The only thing I was disappointed about is the way the moral issue is swept under the table in a cheap and easy way. The moment this became a problematic and delicate subject, they increased the action and it disappeared into the background. What a shame because this moral issue was more interesting than the clichéd action section. Would he have done this to me, I would have kicked his ass into infinite space for sure. But despite this chapter full of moderate, predictable action and a romanticized ending, this movie appealed to me. I'm glad I didn't wait to see it on the small screen, but now I could enjoy its greatness in the cinema. And no, I'm not talking about J. Lawrence again!<br/><br/>More reviews here : http://bit.ly/1KIdQMT"

","Have you ever wondered what would happen if you were in cryogenic hibernation on a space ship on a 120-year trip to another planet and you woke up 90-years too early? Well this movie may have the answer.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" has two appealing stars in Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as Jim Preston and Aurora Lane (what a great name), plus pretty good special effects and an unusual story. <br/><br/>The movie was a little lighter than I thought it would be. People have woken up on these kinds of trips before and it's usually not a good thing – remember what happened to Ripley and the crew of the Nostromo when they got an early wake-up call in ""Alien"".<br/><br/>""Passengers"" manages to remain entertaining from beginning to end without the intrusion of any kind of mutant life form.<br/><br/>My one reservation is actually with the costuming. Not all of it, just Jim Preston's outfit. A boring old shirt and pants? We could have expected something more futuristic than items that look like they were bought off the rack in the local menswear department. Aurora fares better with her podwear; it's understated, but looks a lot more timeless. Laurence Fishburne as Chief Mancuso nails it in a collarless jacket that would have passed muster on the bridge in any episode of ""Star Trek"" – amazing how epaulets look futuristic. <br/><br/>The space ship Aurora has a nice sense of size with a huge bar that is a little reminiscent of the one in ""The Shining"" where Jack Nicholson was the solitary patron in the empty hotel. <br/><br/>I must admit I do like my sci-fi films to lean towards the cerebral. I don't mind the odd death ray or a chest burster now and then, but I love the kind of sci-fi film that plays tricks with your head: ""Interstellar"", ""Contact"", ""Moon"" and of course the daddy of them all ""2001: A Spacy Odyssey"". <br/><br/>Although ""Passengers"" has a touch of ""2001"" with two space travellers conversing with a master computer, it doesn't delve as deeply into the psyche as those other trips into inner and outer space. <br/><br/>However it does raise ethical questions within the context of the story. ""Passengers"" may get a little predictable towards the end, but saves a surprise for the final scene; it's a voyage worth taking."

That is original and that is who this movie is intended for. You really do not know what anyone will do until the end. My daughter who hates science fiction loved it. My husband who hated love stories hated it. I liked too. It is a good love story and that is the point."

","If you're a SF fan, it's easy to see why some critics panned this.<br/><br/>It's quite derivative (although what isn't?) with nods to Robinson Crusoe, Robinson Crusoe on Mars and a host of Star Trek Episodes. The first 3/4 is fine although as the plot gets wound up there are really far too many overly 'dramatic' moments which simply lurch from one how-they-gonna-get-out-of-this situation to another so after a few of these you know they will. Probably. Sorry, realistic plausibility doesn't come into it.<br/><br/>So poor plot points apart, the movie is actually a romantic sort-of feel-good movie with some superb special effects - the zero gravity scene towards the end is brilliant! The actors are good (but if you're looking for Andy Garcia - blink and you'll miss him!) and the sets/CGI terrific.<br/><br/>So although it's set in a SF universe, it's more about people and ain't that why we watch movies?

","In the bonus segment of the DVD version of ""Passengers,"" we learn that the visual concept of the space ship Avalon was inspired by the Titanic. Both the outer and inner world of the Avalon have the look and feel of a luxury cruise ship. But the grand sets and special effects are not the most memorable part of ""Passengers,"" a film that focuses on a fascinating ethical dilemma.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora and Chris Pratt as Jim are two rather ordinary humans who have sought adventure in a futuristic world by undergoing a 100-year period of ""hibernation"" aboard the spaceship Avalon en route to a new world. Jim wants to build a new home of the faraway planet; Aurora is a journalist who wants to return with a first-hand account of the adventure.<br/><br/>The plan of these young people is disrupted when a meteor damages the spaceship resulting in the malfunction of the hibernation pod of Jim. When he is released from his capsule, he now must endure eighty years of travel to his new home. After a year of desperation and loneliness, he breaks open Aurora's pod in order to have a companion. The moral question that is raised in the film is whether or not he committed ""murder"" by consciously opening the pod.<br/><br/>One of most fascinating moments of the film is when a crew technician, whose pod has also malfunctioned, learns that Jim had tampered with another passenger's life. The reaction of Gus (Laurence Fishburne) is both priceless and humane.<br/><br/>The fourth character in this drama is the robotic bartender played with deadpan British humor by Michael Sheen. It is remarkable that so much interest was sustained in a two-hour film by only four actors. In the end, the human drama, as opposed to the fancy sets, is what made ""Passengers"" a special film."

"dave-mcclain","8","3","8","29 December 2016"," part science fiction action-adventure, part romance, part morality play – and all engrossing
","""Passengers"" (PG-13, 1:56) is indeed a sci-fi adventure movie, but it is not, as you might assume from its theatrical trailer, an action movie. There is action in it, but its entertainment value and the meaning of its story both come from places much deeper than your typical sci-fi actioner – and have the symbolism to match. The film's premise concerns a futuristic business arrangement in which an earth-based company sells tickets to people who are passengers on the company's spaceship which will take them to a distant planet which they will then colonize. The destination planet in this story is called Homestead II, which could be seen to represent the self-sufficient lifestyle known as homesteading and/or the Homestead Act of 1862 in which the U.S. government gave qualifying citizens uninhabited lands out west. The spaceship that's taking this story's passengers to their new home is named Avalon, which hearkens back to a fabled island paradise that's part of the legend of King Arthur. One of this film's titular passengers is named Aurora, the same name used for the title character in Disney's ""Sleeping Beauty"", which is very appropriate for a main character who is one of 5,000 people who are supposed to hibernate aboard the Avalon for 120 years until they are about to arrive at Homestead II. Supposed to. For one last bit of symbolism, check out the movie's poster. The dots and dashes below the title ominously represent the Morse code message ""S.O.S."", which is said to stand for ""Save Our Ship"".<br/><br/>The trouble starts when all of the passengers and crew are 30 years into their hibernation and a small meteor passes through the Avalon, beginning a slowly unfolding chain reaction of malfunctions. One of the first mechanical glitches results in Avalon passenger Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) waking up from his scientifically induced sleep and then discovering that he is the only one awake. Realizing that waking up 90 years early dooms him to spend the rest of his life on the Avalon and almost certainly die before it reaches its destination, Jim (who happens to be a mechanical engineer by trade) desperately tries to figure out how to return to hypersleep to no avail. After trying everything he can think of and eventually running out of ideas about how to fix his predicament, and with only an android bartender (Michael Sheen) for company, a beautiful woman named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) also rises too early.<br/><br/>Jim and Aurora are now the only two people awake on the Avalon – and are completely unaware that the ship is malfunctioning. Aurora is a writer who gave up her life on earth for the adventure of traveling to another world, while the appeal of Homestead II from Jim's point of view is one of using his talents in a fresh way and building something new. These two passengers are very different, but turn out to be a great match. They spend a lot of time together, take advantage of the ship's futuristic amenities and form an undeniable emotional attachment. But is it love or a lack of options? And what will happen when the ship's barely noticeable glitches become serious problems? Those are just a couple of the questions that this story raises – along with several intense and thought-provoking ethical dilemmas.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" is an intimate, but complex and very entertaining film. Written by Jon Spaihts (who gave us similarly deep, imaginative and entertaining scripts for 2012's ""Prometheus"" and 2016's ""Doctor Strange"") uses the sci-fi genre to tell a story that is part science fiction action-adventure, part romance, part morality play – and all engrossing. Director Morten Tyldum (who also directed the 2014 Best Picture Oscar nominee ""The Imitation Game"") makes the film in turns dramatic, suspenseful, sweet and heart-breaking and makes sure we have great visuals on which to feast our eyes. This film is a combination of ""Cast Away"", ""Titanic"", ""Gravity"" and ""When Harry Met Sally"", but has an impact all its own, an impact that's difficult to convey to someone who hasn't experienced it – and impossible to communicate without resorting to major spoilers. The film touches on genre tropes and suffers from minor plot holes, but avoids cheap twists and unearned emotional moments and will leave you loving the journey it takes you on – and thinking deep thoughts long after the credits roll. With a great writer-director combination, wondrous sights, and layered, heartfelt, sympathetic performances from its stars, ""Passengers"" is a head and heart trip you should definitely take.

"burlesonjesse5","7","3","8","27 December 2016"," VIEWS ON FILM review of Passengers
","Jennifer Lawrence is a big movie star. Chris Pratt is a newly appointed movie star. With the exception of Michael Sheen playing an android and Laurence Fishburne making a brief appearance as a Chief Deck Officer, they are the only two players featured in Passengers (my latest review).<br/><br/>Morten Tyldum directs Passengers which is sort of like Cast Away in outer space. Just imagine Tom Hanks but with a friend to play with (not a volleyball), unlimited resources of food and water, and freedom from inclement weather. Tyldum was nominated for an Oscar two years ago with 2014's The Imitation Game. Who would've thought he'd be the perfect choice to reinvent the sci-fi wheel. In Passengers, he provides something fresh with his technical efficiency and resplendent attention to detail. There are plenty of nifty space-age gadgets, glossy special effects, and perpetual motion here. The budget of $110 million is well spent for this is a great looking film.<br/><br/>Notice that I haven't mentioned Lawrence and Pratt for a whole paragraph. Sorry about that. I mean, they do have decent chemistry as co-stars. JLaw is indeed a solid actress. For most of Passengers, she's sexy and smoldering, appealing and pinpointed. Then comes the climatic moments in the film when she has to emote via actual peril and distress. Lawrence's tone feels out of place in these moments. She may be the wrong ingredient for a science fiction thriller (I've never seen The Hunger Games so I could be wrong). As for Chris Pratt, well he's a big thing now, an almost A-lister. He can just go through the motions and get the job done. His screen presence is ample enough to carry Passengers (ha ha). I'll just call his performance the veritable, Harrison Ford approach.<br/><br/>Now why am I saying all this? Well for good reason. The actors/actresses almost take a back seat to Tyldum's vision. He makes sci-fi coldness and sci-fi gimmickry relevant for this year. His Passengers is Kubrickian. His Passengers is darkened infinitude. In the end, everything pretty much works itself out. Critics in general have been hard on Passengers for various rationales. Once you see it you'll agree that they need to lighten up.<br/><br/>Containing bartender scenes straight from the annals of The Shining, harboring a little humor, and distributed by Columbia Pictures, Passengers chronicles mechanical engineer, Jim Preston (Pratt). Preston is on a spaceship called Avalon. Avalon recently left Earth and is now on course to go to a planet called Homestead II. This journey is going to take 120 years and said ship is carrying over 5000 people. Everyone is sleeping in hibernation pods but here's the problem: Jim's pod malfunctions and he awakes 90 years too early. Oops. Preston spends many days keeping himself busy and realizing that he may die on Avalon before it gets to its destination. He gets lonely and against his conscience, decides to wake up another passenger in Aurora Lane (Lawrence). The two of them connect, have some sexy time, and continue to figure out ways to fall back to sleep in their pods. Jim initially doesn't tell Aurora he sabotaged her life. He selfishly falls for her. First, by reading Aurora's bio and then by having a face to face meeting with her.<br/><br/>Essentially, Passengers is a love story with an ending that I wouldn't have wanted. Hey, whatever. If you are willing to spend the next nine decades with just the guy you dig and a robotic barkeep (spoiler), then more power to ya. A critic on Rotten Tomatoes mentioned that this film had something to do with Stockholm syndrome. Yup, he'd be right on that one.<br/><br/>All in all, Passengers is a flick cut from original cloth. It has been rumored to be based on a book but hey, that's just a rumor. It promotes a sterile facade, an upmarket look, and a dreaded feel. Ultimately, this vehicle will keep you interested and on the edge of yearning for hope. Granted, Passengers is not as deep as say Interstellar (another sci- fi film about the passage of time) nor is it strong in terms of its final act. However, you could do a lot worse when it comes to the aspect of holiday viewing. My rating: 3 stars."
"CANpatbuck3664","7","3","8","26 December 2016"," Passengers Enlists the Right People to Create Something Great but They Handicap Themselves With a Heavy Twist and a Formulaic Ending
","Passengers got a very different reception than what I was expecting. If you were to wind the clock back a year, I remember they previewed some footage and people were talking about this as an Oscar contender. I wasn't on pins and needles waiting for this but with Pratt and Lawrence co-starring and Morten Tyldum (the director of The Imitation Game, an excellent film), the right people were there to make something awesome. Then the reviews came in and wow, they were pretty bad. I still wanted to see this though and on a very rainy Boxing Day I got that chance. I have to warn you, although I liked this movie, you may have a very different viewing experience.<br/><br/>*Minor Spoilers Ahead* The movie takes place entirely on the Starship Avalon. They're on a 120 year voyage to colonize a new planet named Homestead II. The population of the ship is approx. 5000, around 250 crew and the rest are passengers. The ship is on auto-pilot and the entire population of the ship is in hyper-sleep except for a android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen). On it's journey. the Avalon is pelted by asteroids. The ship remains relatively unscathed but one giant asteroid triggers several alerts in the ship and one hibernation pod opens unexpectedly. Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) wakes up and assumes this is all routine. The passengers on the Avalon were scheduled to wake up 4 months before their arrival to meet each other and socialize. The passengers were separated into classes, Jim is a mechanic by trade so he obviously was in the coach section. All seems well until Jim realizes he's the only person awake on the ship. He's unable to awake the crew, they're in a separate sealed compartment. The computerized systems on the ship aren't any help, they've only been programmed for a certain number of questions, Jim's aren't among them. Jim's finally able to figure out that they're only 30 years into voyage with another 90 left to go. Jim is seemingly trapped on the Avalon, having to face the reality that he'll die during the trip rather than making it to Homestead II.<br/><br/>The initial premise of Passengers is actually pretty deep. What do you do if you're in Jim's situation? You can't go back to sleep and you're all alone on this vast ship, how do you wrap your mind around that? It's pretty interesting and I think they do a decent job portraying what that kind of loneliness can do to you. But that's only half of it. What Jim decides to do to combat that isolation is the big moral quandary of the piece. Some people have really rallied against Passengers because of it, calling it murder essentially. I don't know about that (it's definitely morally wrong and it could be interpreted that way) but what Jim does is wrong and they way he goes about doing it is even more questionable. It borders on creepy but I understood it. I'm not defending it because it wasn't the right thing to do but that kind of isolation does things to your mind. To the movie's credit, he struggles a lot with the decision and they do address the fallout of that choice. So it's up to you whether you can move past this or not, I did my best to put it aside and take the movie as it was.<br/><br/>So now that the philosophical quandary is out of the way, this movie looks great. I don't know how much of it was CGI or practical but it was really well done and it helped you immerse yourself in the atmosphere. It's not hard to get lost in the vastness of space but it adds to the feeling of sterility and emptiness on the Avalon. They obviously spent a lot of money and unlike some other big budget movies I've seen this year, they spent and used it well. <br/><br/>Passengers is really more centred on the romance between Jim and Aurora then on the journey to Homestead II. This can be hard to take, it's only going to appeal to a certain demographic. They got the right 2 actors to play those parts. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are on top of the acting world for a reason. They're great together in this, they're beautiful people (the movie has no problem showing that, they have lingering and loving shots of both) but they're also great apart. They carry this movie and bring gravity to Aurora and Jim's problems. I also liked Michael Sheen as Arthur, he's in the movie just the right amount. <br/><br/>Passengers has a lot going for it, more than it probably deserves. They have some really cool special effects and environments to play with. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are 2 of the top stars working today and they work so well together that they can sell this romance, even though there are much larger moral implications surrounding it. I even liked the characters they created in both Jim and Aurora. I would have liked this movie that much more if it delved even further into the big plot twist and unfortunately it does fall into predictability and sentimentality at the end. I still liked this movie more than I expected to. It took a pretty severe critical beating and I won't condemn the critics for complaining. The central issue that this movie has isn't easily explained or reasoned away. It's complicated and if you see this with your significant other or a group of friends, I guarantee you'll walk away discussing it after. I was still largely charmed by this movie and if you're looking for a romantic film with a sci-fi twist, this should scratch that itch. Be warned though, they were a little misleading when they advertised this. It's definitely more romantic drama than science fiction."

","Passengers was written by Jon Spaihts (Prometheus) and directed by Morten Tyldum (The Imitation Game) and I know for some reason there is a lot of hate for this film I don't see why its not prefect but out of everything I have seen this year it was oddly satisfying and very enjoyable. The movie follows Chris Pratt who plays Jim Preston waking up on the Avalon before he should and finding out they still got ninety years left till they reach the planet of Homestead II. This movie does have problems because I swear for the first forty minutes its just Chris Pratt doing things then the plot starts to develop and move forward when he is left with the decision to wake up Aurora Lane played by Jennifer Lawrence (Winters Bone) which I liked the decision he was left with it felt challenging to whether I would actually do it or not. The romance between Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt felt very well developed but it was unfortunately very predictable with Aurora finding out. Micheal Sheen (Underworld) is also in this film and he plays Arthur the most entertaining character in the film as the bartender he felt like the right comedic relief for the film and there was a surprise appearance by Laurence Fishburne (The Matrix) who played Gus Mancuso who also woke up early. One thing I wish they did other then Chris Pratt messing around for forty minutes was maybe build the world around it they can't have been going for a serious tone like Alien where it would have been a huge mistake if they explored Weyland in the first film but with this a lot of scene were played off very comedic which was fine but I felt the world was underdeveloped even by explaining why there going to this planet. Overall I would recommend this film to watch if your a fan of science fiction and of course Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence."

","Visually the film is quite stunning, which is expected when crafting a film totally set out in space. The plot was quite lazy put together and in parts quite hard to buy into. Did everyone have the same introduction to being woken up from hibernation at the same time? Did everyone's door light up from them when they woke up so they could find their room? Neither would really make sense. Did Gus not know his card could put him back into hibernation (which would have saved his life??)? On that point did I misread the narrative codes or is the film saying that a white man can wake up from hibernation totally fine & healthy, under the same circumstances as a black man who had 612 ailments and died within 10 minutes of the film? Did Gus not even have a wake up medical even though the pod's failed over the same circumstances? Are black people not affected by gravity in the same way white people, inanimate objects and water is/are? Were Gus' black bones so dense that only his arms could be lifted??? This was really a sad satire of diversifying film for me as Gus was just a thoughtless inanimate device in the film for Jim to fix the ship & then be brought back to life.<br/><br/>All in all the film did have some good moments but was quite lazily thought out which was really evident from the ending."

","This movie had an interesting premise, and it started well, but got off course towards the middle and barely got back on track by the end.
The idea is essentially that two people spend their lives together in blissful isolation in a technological paradise, but they're trapped there. The problem with the movie is that it misses out all the good stuff that happens between them, growing a forest, raising kids and growing old, and opts instead for 45 mins of explosions and magically fixing things.
It's the sort of movie which makes you cry to begin with, and then stunningly destroys all your expectations by resorting to a bunch of Hollywood standard narrative devices that are supposed to make the film 'exciting' but actually just ruin the whole thing. Whoever chose the music for the ending credits should be shot too.<br/><br/>It's frustrating when Hollywood mangles a good movie, which is exactly what they did here.

Problems arise when he decides to wake up a fellow passenger, as played by Jennifer Lawrence. The issue is that he essentially signs her death sentence by doing so. So you have a film where a guy in essence murders a woman, who proceeds to fall in love with him. Please! It's as cheesy as it sounds, and some half-hearted outer-space peril feels like leftovers from GRAVITY rather than anything interesting.

Unless he wakes up another passenger, he will live the rest of his life without any company, like a prisoner in solitary confinement.<br/><br/>After some soul searching, he decides to wake up a passenger, Jennifer Lawrence. While he is poor, and in third class, she's in first class. She took the trip to write a book about the experience. He took it as an opportunity for a new life, much like many of the poor Irish passengers on the Titanic in steerage.<br/><br/>Although they hit it off after a rocky start, she eventually learns her pod did not open due to a malfunction; he woke her up. In effect, he has robbed her of her life, at least the life she wanted on the distant planet, where she'd write a book on her travels.<br/><br/>Their feud is interrupted by more malfunctions all over the ship. That's all I will reveal. Best you see the remainder yourself.<br/><br/>What's good about the film? Not to be cavalier and flippant, but really everything. Besides being excellent actors, Pratt and Lawrence have good chemistry in the movie; we buy into their romance. Unlike a ""heavy mental"" over-the-top movie like Interplanetary, Passengers is a romping good time, full of action, thrills, and suspense. It doesn't try to impress us with cutting edge ideas such as Arrival.<br/><br/>Unlike Arrival or Interplanetary, Passengers is a movie I could easily watch a second or third time. It's a great movie experience. I found very little I could fault with the movie; it was a clever, tension-packed plot, well scripted, well acted, and the pace didn't lag. While some people invariably complain about the middle of movies going too slow, this one kept our attention throughout. After all, we know something.... something, is wrong aboard the ship, but at first our two protagonists are able to shrug it off. They are minor inconveniences.<br/><br/>Passengers is an example of sci-fi done right. Do we really want science fiction that does its best to confound us with a plot so overly complicated and full of physics quandaries that we can't make heads or tails of some scenes? I know they were trying to out-do 2001: A Space Odyssey, but thanks, no thanks. Arrival was similarly irritating in the sense that I just didn't buy into the plot.<br/><br/>Passengers has a rock solid plot, easy to grasp, and entertaining to watch unfold."

The ending was super ridiculous and the fact that a journalist and a mechanic are fixing everything while they don't even have the slightest idea is just stupid.

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" (2016) has to be one of the best guilty pleasure movies I've ever seen. I can understand why it got so many negative reviews from critics and viewers, and you kinda have to leave your believes behind the door when you will watch this movie, because there are some ""how can that be?"" moments in this movie, but they are far and in between for a what beautiful, original (!) are simply great this movie is. The premise is original, and kinda fresh (and this goes from a Sci-Fi movie buff). Acting was very good by all (i won't spoil how many faces) involved. Script as well directing was very involving - at running time almost 2 hours i was engaged into this story more that i could have possibly imagined at the beginning. <br/><br/>Overall, ""Passengers"" is a terrific Sci-Fi entertainment. Its not a very deep on its core (aka Interstellar), but it delivers on a most important thing - to like a movie very much do to its involvement in a story. This one truly delivers a great, great guilty pleasure."
"Electron-Libre","7","2","5","24 February 2017"," Amazing movie, wrong director
","This movie is absolutely breath taking as far as the spaceship design is concerned. I mean, how on earth do they manage to create such environment? It is magical! The acting is great. It is never a bad thing to have Fishburne in a movie anyway. The story is in itself very interesting but the way it is treated is a turn down. The action scenes are summarized and you don't get the tension, the suspense of it. It goes from one scene in total danger to another scene where everything is fine again in one second. This movie would have been much better with another director. This director is clearly out after fame, trying to make something commercial/international to prove that his country (Norway) can have a great director. Well, nice try but one advice, be yourself! Seek art, not fame! But anyway, in spite of this, the movie is one more time breath taking visually. Till the end when a super cheesy and really horrible credit music makes a big anti-climax and takes away all the atmosphere and the experience of the movie. Another attempt to seek commercialism."

"jatin-ganhotra","5","2","5","8 February 2017"," Not recommended
","The movie seemed far below the Hollywood standards that you expect from a decent fiction film.<br/><br/>At some point, it became over-dramatic and unwarranted romance.<br/><br/>There were some glimpses here and there, which showed that the plot had potential, but it digressed a lot and strayed away from the fiction and turned into a romantic flick.<br/><br/>It completely failed to build up the technical details behind various events and it sort of just made things happen as needed<br/><br/>Not recommended to watch unless a movie with nice cinematography is all what it takes to excite you to watch one."
"wl-989-553912","6","2","5","5 February 2017"," Lazy and underwhelming
","I would say this is a bad movie. Its beautifully made and the cast is strong. But the plot is entirely predictable after the first 15 minutes. The script is set up in a way that entirely telegraphs what is going to happen once the initial plot device is set up. That may be OK if you don't value plot twists and surprises, but if you do you will not get any here. But that still leaves the question that if the entire audience can see it coming that Michael Sheen's android is the one who will tell Aurora how she was awoken why can't Jim? After all, as is demonstrated later, all he would have to do is remove one circuit board from the the android to shut it up forever. Duh!<br/><br/>Also the movie is full of holes and implausibilities that obstruct any form of suspension of disbelief. For example, it is utterly implausible that the ship would not have emergency protocols to awaken crew in the event of trouble. How on earth does the ship's sophisticated computer systems not know that passengers have awoken too early? And why do the passengers not awaken say a medic once they do have access to all areas.<br/><br/>Its unfortunately its the typical lazy screen writing we have come to expect from Hollywood. But having said that, some of the zero gravity scenes are stunning."

Do you go to cinema to enjoy a movie or to destroy it with your bad bile? * Speed of the ship wasn't ""near to light speed"", it was HALF of light speed (less than 148.000 KM/s), the speed is not a problem to walk outside the ship or float around it, because inertially the characters have exactly the same speed on vacuum of space. * Why there was announcements when passing by close to the star? For the same reason there was announcements when they pass to a room or office, or they could take breakfast or dinner; everything gone active when ""they"" detected humans walking through the ship. * The ship has stores, restaurants, bars, and everything else because the people should awake four months before arrive to destination; and have a crew because they should start the trip and finish it. OK, there was some failings, but all movies have them, because they are stories created by humans. Just enjoy this very good movie.. :)"

","I really enjoyed this movie. Having heard the bad reviews I decided to give it a shot since I love space and sci-fi movies. The last one (star trek) was a huge disappointment for me. I loved this movie, and yes it's a love story, but also very beautifully shot with a wonderful story that will keep your interest throughout, and of course the acting was great. Jennifer Lawrence makes everything better and she and her co-star sizzle. Yes, I agree with some that the ending could have been done better but they decided to send you away with a Hollywood happy ending instead. That being said definitely worth the watch. Guys take your girlfriends, husbands take you wife's, My son's wife was sick so he took me and we both loved it. I wish the DVD would come out with an alternative ending maybe where Jim dies saving the ship and Jennifer's character struggles with the same loneliness Jim did until she is compelled to make the same choices he made.

","Is this a good sci-fi film? Sure, it's good. Is it good enough to pay to watch? Noooooo way in hello operator it is not. Basically this movie is about Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt making kissy faces at each other in space for two hours. The beginning of the film is interesting, seeing Chris Pratt's character deal with space isolation. However the rest of the film seems like a by the numbers type of deal and the ending plays like thrown in chaos just for the point of having a climax. Whatever. Like I said before, it is an okay film. I'll say this about the film, it didn't seem as repetitive as it could have been. If Pratt had a more capable actress to work with, the film could have been a bit better."

","Hadn't heard of this film, went along on a last minute invite. So glad I did. The film is spectacular visually and the time flew by (a sure sign of a film enjoyed). Lot of discussion afterwards, some picking the story apart, some not too keen on the actors.<br/><br/>We all know the story and my bug bear was it was too predictable - will film makers ever give us a surprise ending? The only reason for the awakening of the second passenger was for sex scenes and shots of JL's body (which I'm sure most men are not complaining about). The scene with the wedding ring was sick bag enducing and what did the waking up of a third passenger bring to the story other than to fill some time.<br/><br/>One poor reviewer questions why the ship was so well stocked and had sports and leisure facilities etc. They obviously hadn't heard us being told that the crew would wake up so many months prior to landing, and the passengers sometime after them.<br/><br/>On the whole a visually stunning and great film to watch. Point taken off for the predictable storyline. Michael Sheen gave a usual understated, brilliant performance."

Right from the start, the spaceship itself is visually stunning as it is futuristic, simplistic yet stylish. The interior design of the spaceship is exactly my taste as well, and I am in awe of the nice cabin where there is this super stylish staircase.

"katitheil","9","2","5","7 January 2017"," A film about ethic and moral, including awesome views
","The film is fun and exactly like i imagined it before. In my opinion its the perfect mixture between action movie, drama and love story. <br/><br/>There is no point where i thought that it gets slow or boring. <br/><br/>Jennifer and especially Chris did an awesome job! In the beginning, when Jim is alone, you see how desperate it is. You understand why he is able to take and change a life. There is the big question included if he is allowed to do this. The bis moral question if he is the one who can decide to change a life. In my opinion there are just two opinions and I myself would do the same: Kill myself or wake someone. Yes its morally wrong but no one can ask to survive this alone. <br/><br/>I loved how there is no word about the earth. What is up on earth, how is it, why do you go, how does it look. We have so many movies including this question. This one excludes it. AWESOME<br/><br/>And did you took a look on the ship. The idea, the design of the ship is so awesome. I think i would enter this one too. The swimming pool!<br/><br/>Its an awesome movie and i will watch it a second time. Jennifer and Chris are a perfect cast. <br/><br/>I think the question you have for yourself at the end is as follows: How can you make the best out of your life?<br/><br/>I would love to see the planet or both of them when they are old, but yes, this wouldn't fit into the style of the movie. Awesome job!"
"bilbobrick","7","2","5","5 January 2017"," Decent Popcorn Flick
","Yet another polarizing movie from the year 2016, Passengers is neither as horrible as the critics say it is, nor as wonderful as Pratt/Lawrence fanboys/fangirls will go around telling their teenage friends.<br/><br/>The movie does have a lot of pros, actually. The visual effects and set design are both wonderful, particularly the spaceship's exterior, and a beautiful swimming pool featured in several scenes (made all the more beautiful with Jennifer Lawrence's presence). The acting is pretty good overall, however Lawrence can be as bland as she is hot at times. Pratt plays the same character he always does, the likable every-man, but I can't say I've tired of it yet. The end credits song, by Imagine Dragons, is reliably good, even if it's not their best by a long shot. Finally, I can't say I was ever bored by the film... irritated and disappointed, yes, but never bored.<br/><br/>The cons are more extensive than I wish they were. The movie borrows from so many other films, including Cast Away, Titanic, Gravity, and The Shining, just to name a few. And there are so many missed opportunities to make really great, original twists that are never utilized. There's also a certain actor that makes an appearance that doesn't really have much purpose... The second act drags a bit, and is less interesting than the other two acts, particularly the first one. Oh, and I can't forget to mention that Pratt makes a decision in the movie that will throw half of the film's viewers into a state of rebellion...<br/><br/>Overall, Passengers was a decent use of $6.00 and an afternoon with friends, but not one you need to rush out and see, particularly when compared with other space films of late, such as Rogue One and Star Trek: Beyond. However, fans of sci-fi, such as myself, will probably be moderately entertained for a couple hours."
"zumo-16908","8","2","5","4 January 2017"," Better than expected
","I was expecting, or rather fearing, another Jupiter Ascending when I saw who the two lead actors were, but this movie is more than just two hot celebrities teaming up for a cash-in. I have seen a trailer that sells this as an action movie, but people wanting space action will probably go home disappointed. This is more of an adventure drama, and thank goodness for that. <br/><br/>The good part: This movie may not become a classic in the genre, but it does capture ones attention, with a good premise and beautiful space scenery in almost every scene. It gives a good sense of what it could be like to be isolated aboard a massive space ship cruising through the galaxy, with the scales of space contrasting our our tiny lives. The good special effects and scenery combined with the character ""Arthur"" carries this one home. Jennifer Lawrence does a decent job as well. <br/><br/>The bad part: Im not a big fan of Criss Pratt's acting style as it does not fit this kind of movie very well. When ever he has a chance to add some depth and credibility to his character, it mostly ends up in some sort of silly (like in all his movies, which makes me wonder if he plays the same character in all of them?). The movie also has its share of corny Hollywood-esque jokes, but thankfully its kept on an almost acceptable level. The story of this movie could easily have been made into a thriller, or even a horror, but the aforementioned silly acting and cheesy jokes keeps the atmosphere jolly - but a bit too much so, and this is what drags it down.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that Passengers is worth watching."
"FelipeCarrillo","7","2","5","4 January 2017"," ""Passengers"" Is Diminished By Misguided Attempts of Jon Spaihts
","Worthy of the third place among the best unproduced scripts in Hollywood (Black List); nine years ago (2007), ""Passengers"" sign was just a basic preliminary version predisposing to find a studio to financing its making with $35 million initial cost and possibly starring multi-nominated Keanu Reeves and Emily Blunt. Eventually, Sony Pictures got IP rights and fortunately signed Morten Tyldum up in the direction to materialize it with $110 million extraordinary production budget with the fabulous signing of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as leaders of the ambitious project. Today, they present us an already assembled film, aesthetically superb, with unimaginable argumentative potentials and a harmonious chemistry between its main leads, however, its biggest point break is specifically in the screenplay, which diverges tirelessly from that original version established it among the best unrealized projects.<br/><br/>In the adjacent future, mankind is able to emigrate from overpopulated and ruined Earth for leaving and seek for habitable spaces abroad. The starship Avalon is transporting 5,000 passengers and over 200 crew members in a cryogenic sleep for a journey that takes 120 years in order to arrive in Homestead II, the new planet Earth. Although everything seems to indicate that the cyclopean experiment will be satisfactory, the spaceship collides hardly against a meteorite, which stirs up the breakdown of one sleep chamber, Jim Paterson's, our protagonist. Each person in the ship has a unique and substantial occupation around the population of the new colony: doctors, microbiologists, nurses, machinists, law specialists, etc. Jim is a young mechanical engineer, who quickly becomes aware that he has awakened 90 years early the official advent, contemplating ethical and moral dilemmas as intrinsic as outer space where the story runs. After one year of being in a techno-transitory paradise, he finally concludes to awaken to one traveler and keeping in mind that it would practically be to immolate her, male protagonist's elections are deeply objectionable. The sudden new member of the spaceship is named Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), a writer from New York who aims to write a book about her personal experience in the new world and return to the planet Earth with the most amazing story. Nevertheless, failure accumulation of the huge ship and different narrative confidences push them to the edge of space, literally.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Rodrigo Prieto is incredibly absorbent, it's imposing accompanied by dazzling production design, where prevails snowy and dreary tones which divinely adapt to prelude in order to connect with main character's isolation. As it progresses, induced the arrival of the new human being attracts slightly more grace with immaculate pools, high-quality restaurants and a journey as cynical as captivating around the selfsame outer space. Moreover, visual effects are at the height of many Hollywood products, it's equivalent and even superior to some of the most outstanding sci-fi works in recent times. Some twists in the script allow for acclaiming it spectacularly, such as the scenes of gravity loss, the final stretch or external shots of the Avalon flowing by the great Milky Way, wonderful. The key new technologies for the development of the story are visually provocative and somewhat so realistic that make us aspire one gold class breakfast through our bracelet.<br/><br/>The film's cardinal mission is spectators must put oneself in Jim's shoes, it suggests them convoluted dilemmas of the character and deleterious corollaries drive by the silence demon. Chris Patt's charisma in the first few minutes as survivor into a technological spaceship is enough to keep it afloat, he wanders naked with a— superfluously—long beard, formulating himself moral matters such as suicide, a death foretold and unbearable solitude. Although many people didn't realize, The decision of Jim must be worthy of debate and more worthy must be its subsequent actions. In the middle of the film, when love starts to flow between lovers, Stockholm syndrome is patent and the protagonist can be stealthily described as a harasser. However, this scene is covered with Tyldum's direction, who focused on other banalities.With the arrival of Aurora, the fascinating concepts raised in the first hour of the sci-fi movie take their place at the end of the list, since it opts for conceiving a bland affair, a romance as sporadic as tedious. Go from there, the movie breaks down and loses the land he was harvested beside ""Gravity"", ""Interstellar"" or the more recent ""Arrival"". Although it works excellently as a romantic film, it is the third act which affects decisively its prestige. Its unsatisfactory ending, although we haven't lately seen a drastic end in commercial cinema, it wasn't the most pertinent for concluding this futuristic story which began by clouds and terminated with fewer forces. Even though, it isn't a blunder of the acclaimed director who had to stick to the default settings of the story, story re-written by Jon Spaihts, who deplorably decided to distance from the original ending.<br/><br/>Frustrating, a missed opportunity. For those who attend to a movie theater without having depths and inconsistencies in mind, ""Passengers"" is the favorite candy for mass audiences. For us who inherently love films and we're as severe as objectives, ""Passengers"" is an irregular movie, but essentially spoiled. This one is a true sign that the nature of the seventh art is to narrate a story, a tightly structured story, not mere visual beauty. With a first part which puts in manifest our deepest human questions; the exciting and controversial issues are imperceptibly mitigated into a surplus drama-romance and a typical Hollywood final sequence, which could be circumstantially sublime hugging the original one. It makes us think that it's another corporate product, but inside us, we know that Sony dropped a film which be aiming for the top between its hands."

No weird twists or surprises really but still satisfying.<br/><br/>It's a nice journey with some inventive ideas shown for what the future will be like. The romance is well done.

What crept me most was why the crew who woke up had to die. There was no real reason for that person to wake up. There was no particular idea what his part was except to fill the gaps.

You may agree or disagree with how the moral issue is resolved, but the process through all that is fairly interesting, and set in a fantastical and beautiful futuristic backdrop. The film is not complicated, yet it keeps you thinking for a bit.<br/><br/>The tone and pacing feels more similar to The Martian rather than Interstellar, if it helps you compare.<br/><br/>I would say a solid 7.5. Not quite an 8 due to the simplicity of its plot elements, but a solid watch."

","Despite all the negative reviews from 'professional critics', I looked forward to watch this movie and was prepared to relax watching the visually stunning sets, and maybe have a snooze if it got boring. I was not bored and enjoyed the movie inspire of all the plot holes, the movie could have been better, if they put in more medical pods and there should be hundreds of bots and androids. However there is only one android bartender, no maintenance droids to check and monitor the hibernation pods for malfunction. Moreover, what happens when the 5000 passengers are revived? For a ship larger than a cruise ship with no crew is absurd, also there should be medical droids on duty as well as spare hibernation pod so that the two awake passengers can be put back on stasis again after the ship is repaired and finally revived with all the others with a happy ending that would definitely make movie goers feel good, instead, I left feeling dissatisfied."
"abouhelier-r","7","2","5","29 December 2016"," Passengers
","Two passengers on a spaceship heading to a distant colony are woken up 90 years before they should be. Now they are stranded together but alone. They have to figure out a way to survive. That is the way the trailer makes it seem at least. And I will be honest, that is a movie I'd like to see. But that is not what you get. Actually, it is not even close. Chris Pratt character, Jim, wakes up Aurora. For the filmmakers it is a minor obstacle on the route to romance; for the audience, it's a deal-breaker. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have a spicy chemistry. They work well together as literal star-crossed lovers. The setting is unorthodox but the blossoming romance is entirely familiar. Though, Chris Pratt ultimately carries the whole movie. His character is far more interesting than hers, he has more layers than she has. Plus, Michael Sheen injects a welcome third perspective, laying bare their flaws.<br/><br/>Passengers is not just short on surprises, it is also like a castaway love story set in the world largest and emptiest Apple Store in space. This movie has opportunities to be great, there are some scenes when I think they could have made something a lot more interesting and challenging than what they settled for. However, the CGI, and particularly a zero-gravity swimming pool sequence, is impressive. Believe it or not, there are more twists and turns half a movie left after all this, but none of it is very interesting either. <br/><br/>Finally, the movie keeps jerking from tone to tone until you end up feeling like you are weightlessly drifting in zero-gravity. In fact, the film can't make up its mind if it wants to stick to Pratt's comic instincts or go someplace more serious or existential. Moreover, the Titanic parallels are left throughout sometimes in explicit nods as a cheesy space walk stands in for 'flying' on the prow; and elsewhere in the film's broader structure. Much like Cameron's nautical disaster, Passengers' early love story gives way to a latter disaster flick.<br/><br/>Overall, Passengers is misleading at first sight and as surprisingly as it is undeniably effective. A timeless romance stranded in a space-age. A heartfelt tale of loss and love for the Gravity generation."
"OlieRendch","6","2","5","29 December 2016"," It wasn't terrible, it wasn't amazing. It just...was.
","Passengers stars Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as two passengers who have woken up from hibernation on a ship traveling across space to a new planet, they are the only two who have woken up, however, with about nine decades to go before the ship reaches the destination. I've been looking forward to this for a while; I'd heard about the popularity of the unmade script and the synopsis got me interested, I resisted reading the script but as bits of news trickled in, I kept interested, especially when Pratt and Lawrence were attached as I enjoy their work. <br/><br/>I'll start, as always, with what I enjoy and number one for me with that is the visuals. The design of the ship, both exterior and interior are amazing. It's a place I would love to visit, from the information interfaces to the architecture, I really enjoyed seeing that. The CGI is top-notch, I don't remember seeing any iffy effects so on that front it's great; they blended it well with real things as well, especially in a sequence (which was in the trailer) concerning a swimming pool and gravity, I thought it was a tense and well-done sequence. So all together I'd say that Passengers was, in general, a good-looking film. <br/><br/>What adds to that, of course, are its main leads. Chris Pratt doesn't do dramatic often but here he had to pull off some emotional scenes and I can't say he managed all of them successfully but he gave them a good shot and delivered some quite unexpected compelling series of events in the first act of the movie. Jennifer Lawrence appears alongside and she does just as you'd expect, she's a great actor, looks great, she did just fine in her role. She and Pratt had good chemistry, I thought and enjoyed seeing them together. An extra cast member includes Michael Sheen as the android, Arthur, and he was one of the best parts of the film for me. He was the source of the majority of humor and his constant positive personality was very entertaining.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, I felt there were three defined parts to it. The first act, was my favorite, it gave off a cast-away vibe and you could feel the isolation, perhaps if they'd have stuck with that a bit longer it would've been a bit more impactful but it was certainly the best part of the film for me. The second act slowed down a little, it was exactly what I expected from the film, going in; Pratt and Lawrence being a couple on screen and all that entails from flirting to getting-to-know-each-other and all that. Some plot developments did occur, though, and it started to get going again and I was genuinely surprised at one point and enjoyed a certain aspect which I won't spoil here. The third act though happened so suddenly, it was actually quite jarring. There was nothing wrong with it itself, just quite quick and almost predictable. <br/><br/>And that's the thing with Passengers, it's not a bad movie by any stretch, but it isn't mind-blowing either. We've seen almost every element before. It felt clean, it felt safe. It was innocuous. There were some twists and turns but you realize the trailer spoils a lot when you're watching the film. All-in-all, Passengers was just OK, and that's it."
"joshbarton15","6","3","10","23 December 2016"," Runs out of steam with a daft and very predictable finale
","Putting two of the biggest stars in the world right now together in a film about two people stranded on a spaceship might be a recipe for box-office success in the mind of a studio however, the real interest I had in Passengers was whether it could deliver a good enough story for the two stars to tackle. A lot of the personal success this film would have for me would come down to that.<br/><br/>Thirty years into the Starship Avalon's one hundred and twenty year journey, carrying 5,000 passengers and 250 crew members, to colonise Homestead II, a malfunction awakens two of the passengers, Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) and Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence). With ninety years left of the Avalon's journey, Jim and Aurora try to figure out what exactly made them wake up so early.<br/><br/>Now, I only saw the first trailer for Passengers so I was very surprised the way this film actually ended up going. When you look at it, it's almost as if Sony have been marketing a completely different film because when you see Passengers, you will get that there is no twist as to why they woke up, it's just that Jim wakes up first before deciding to wake Aurora up.<br/><br/>This is where the film treads a very thin line in the story it tells. To have Jim wake up and spend a year on the ship by himself, all while growing an almost stalkerish fixation on Aurora before deciding to wake her up explores an idea I never thought this film would even entertain. I would be lying if I said that I didn't enjoy Passengers for its first two acts, but then comes the final act.<br/><br/>It comes dangerously close to completely ruining the film, going for the full blown ridiculous finale that just feels totally out of place. Looking back on it, from the moment Laurence Fishburne briefly turns up as Chief Gus Mancuso, I felt the film lost its way totally. A lot of what they set up was hindered by a predictable and rather tame finale that should have been a lot braver, my preference being that they killed Pratt's character off while he was floating into space. <br/><br/>Visually the film is top of the range, strong special effects and detailed production design really settling the audience into the setting of this ship desolate ship with only two people awake on it. I also found Thomas Newman's score to aid the film perfectly, suitably accompanying Jim on his lonely beginnings on the Avalon and then crescendoing magnificently alongside the fast-paced finale, even if it is a little daft.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Passengers shows quite a new side to the cheeky and lovable Chris Pratt with his turn as Jim Preston, going from lovable to utterly creepy in half a film. It's a decision that could have backfired but Pratt handles the switch rather well. I was worried about Jennifer Lawrence phoning it in for Passengers however, I'm glad to say she actually looks like she gives a damn in this film. <br/><br/>Overall, Passengers isn't the stunning piece of sci-fi that we wanted, almost bottling it and going for the easy way out instead. It's quite generic stuff made to be entertaining by a strong start and middle, and two leads who do work quite well together."

","Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) awakens from hibernation 30 years into a 120 year interstellar journey. Lonely, he decides to awaken Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) over whom he has begun to obsess. After some angst, the two of them enjoy life in their starship Hilton until a cascade of ever-worsening glitches starts to impact their idyllic existence. Ignore the apologists who are 'correcting' goofs, this film is so full of plot holes that it might as well be an adolescent's 'hot chick and a star ship' fantasy. The entire plot hangs on a series of convenient but implausible situations: no one is supposed to be awake, but every passenger service in the ship is up and running when Preston's pod fails: the ship carries all the necessary spare parts (at least those needed to advance the plot), but despite damage and failing systems, doesn't awaken a repair team; there are 5000 passengers but only one 'autodoc' (and one bar tender), etc. The entire story revolves around Jim and Aurora, but neither the actors nor their characters are very engaging or interesting, the script is trite, and the 'race against time' climax is formulaic, predictable, and entirely unconvincing. The special effects and 'sets' are spectacular (even if the physics is a bit shaky) but they're wasted buttressing up an insipid story. The film has been likened to ""Titanic"" (1997) and will likely be enjoyed by people who preferred the 'Rose and Jack' story to the 'sinking ship' story."

"Spondonman","7","2","6","27 February 2017"," Get a life
","As a sharp and slick work of fantasy fiction this film entertained me. It reminded me of 2001, Silent Running, Mission To Mars and even The Shining, but with its own gravitational spin. It covered 90 years in less than 2 hours and successfully kept me from looking at the clock.<br/><br/>One of the 5000 hibernating passengers (has suspended animation been put into cold storage?) on an interstellar starship is inadvertently woken up on the journey with 90 years left to go to arrival – if you couldn't re-hibernate what would you do? Would you calmly walk about a gargantuan ship populated with a handful of robots drinking and playing with your yo-yo for the rest of your life or try to get someone to talk to? Love the place you're in or Love the one you're with. With this moral dilemma eating his vitals Chris Pratt is suitably chiselled and wooden as usual, however Jennifer Lawrence steals the show with her intensely believable performance as usual. On believability - whether someone could survive being so close to a nuclear reactor as was Pratt, protected only by an oven door is a moot point and a bit of a comedy moment too, but I thought the well thought of Gravity was similarly daft and not so weighty as this either. For the bar room scenes with Arthur The Android a bit of Al Bowlly crooning in the echoey background wouldn't have been amiss, but thankfully science fiction films and mankind have gone far beyond Joan Baez warbling end credits even if the message is similar.<br/><br/>Whether the film is guilty of Sexism or not it's certainly guilty of Corn, and nothing wrong with that at all. Excellent hokum, superb cgi cartoonery, and a central performance well worth watching."

","A Lost-in-Space love story that lacks any science fiction or romantic drama bona fides. Little is expected from either Lawrence or Pratt, and they deliver in kind. Characters lack credibility, (except for maybe Arthur the android), which is the only thing saving the plot from being utterly predictable. You know you're in trouble when Laurence Fishburne shows up to save the day and can't. Visually stunning big screen production design does not translate to the small screen. Visually stunning actors are about the only thing that might make this turkey appealing. And both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt can be seen in numerous other projects where their talent is showcased as least as much as their looks."

A quick Google seemed to confirm this.<br/><br/>After thinking about it all night I concluded that regardless of my genitalia or sexuality, in reality I would far prefer to be woken up and discover what that entails than to either be in Jims position in the first place, or almost as bad wake up in never never land finding that another human being died alone whilst I was asleep because they were too worried about my feelings to wake me.

","When I first saw the trailer for this film, I was very excited. For a good reason, the CGI looked amazing and it has Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt in it. And a HUGE budget.<br/><br/>Now to the film.<br/><br/>The first part of the film before Aurora(Jennifer Lawrence) was introduced was pretty boring. It felt a bit rushed. <br/><br/>I feel like the main character Jim(Chris Pratt) should have been more interesting, although Chris Pratt does a great job in making a feel to this character.<br/><br/>When Aurora is introduced, this film becomes more of a romance movie. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt have great chemistry with each other and make the characters very enjoyable and real. <br/><br/>When we get to know that there are problems with the spaceship, the film gets more intense, but the last part also feels rushed. We don't get to feel for the characters that much. The film gets unoriginal. It just feels like some action film I have watched before. <br/><br/>I must say that the visuals in this film are BEAUTIFUL. The ship design and the technology looks amazing.<br/><br/>Michael Sheen does great as a robot in this film, and portraits the mind of a robot very well.<br/><br/>The first part is a good introduction to the characters, but feels a little slow. The pacing was too fast at the end, but makes it intense.<br/><br/>Overall this is an enjoyable film with great chemistry and great acting from Jennifer Lawrence, Chris Pratt and Michael Sheen. It also has a good romance, and the dialogue feels real.<br/><br/>Rating 7/10"
"Lewis_Heather787","6","2","6","28 December 2016"," Completely different film from the trailers!
","Before watching this film my advice would be not to watch any of the trailers for the film because the trailers show a completely different film to what it actually is. This film is no huge sprawling sci-fi epic it is an intimate film about two strangers together in an extraordinary circumstance with the backdrop of space. <br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt are good in the film, although I believe that the film has to much of a hope that the actors names will draw people into seeing this film, those times are over and even actor such as Tom Cruise maybe loosing there star power. However back to Lawrence and Pratt, as mentioned were good and the emotional heart of the film considering that this about there journey. The audience can definitely resonate with both of them through the film and both of them show good chemistry together on the screen. Even though we have an emotional connection to both of them you never feel overly concerned for them in anyway situation that they get themselves into, which is unfortunate but that falls on the script and director. Neither of their performances were out of this world.......pun intended.....but I think that this film was crying out for one of them to just stand out a little. <br/><br/>The other main positive of the film are the special effects in the film. The effect are good in this film but yet again nothing that we haven't seen before or groundbreaking and that ultimately is what this films crying out for. Just one aspect of the film had to be that extra special and it would had much more of an impact on the viewing experience. However the effects of the ship are really cool and an interesting design too, the production design of the film is very minimalistic only showing was is needed there is nothing overboard. <br/><br/>The negatives of the film are mainly story based and unfortunately the story of the film is actually rather ordinary. The idea of two complete strangers stuck on a empty space ship heading for a new planet has the potential of being really interesting and that's what the trailers of the film showed. Without spoiling the main reveal of the film, which happens about 20 minutes into the film, there are specific reasons why Jennifer Lawrence's character wakes up. I believe that the film could of handled this much better by not telling us and making it the big mystery of the film, leading towards a big reveal which would made this film ten times more interesting. However due to the fact that we find out the ""twist"" early there are no other twist or big dramas that happen in the rest of the film. In the end the film just slowly grinds to a halt as if the film tried to leave us on this big huge emotional ending that never payed off or happened. If the character twist had not be revealed until the end the actual proper ending to the film it would have been much more of an emotional punch. <br/><br/>In the end this film has good performances and good special effects, however the weak and uneventful story is just unfortunately ordinary. If this film had been like it was portrayed in the trailers this film could have been so much better, you don't believe me watch one of the trailers after you've seen the film and you may see what I mean. 60 % out of 100 I think that the performances and effects just about keep this film interesting and enjoyable watch at times. Unfortunately this film banks on people seeing it for its two main leads when actually it should be more focused on the story of the film itself. Average/Good however it could have been great!"
"sandiplogin","9","1","2","2 June 2020"," Best science fiction movie
","I wish I understood why the professional critics of various publications rate this movie so terribly. In a world where Star Wars commands an unprecedented fan base and the subsequent financial windfall, Passengers is a wonderful Romantic Sci Fi film that not only presents a series of life paradigms in an elegant and entertaining manner, but also entertains and lets the imagination fly free of the clutter of over marketization.
Passengers is a carnival of what ifs. It allows one to turn to the one we love and ask the question... ""what would you do if I stranded you in paradise with me for eternity?"" and this conundrum is very well elaborated in this movie. The principal question is, you get to live with no need to work ever again, with all the food, shelter and resources that you will ever need, but you get to be with just one person for the rest of your life, and within the confines of a demarcation.
If you ask me, I would love to be woken in such a situation, even if it meant to lose everything that today I hold dear and near, the only requirement for me is to be woken by someone that will love me more than I love myself.
The effects are what is expected of a big budget modern movie, they are simply superb, the acting is more than I would have expected from Chris Pratt, in fact this movie makes me respect him as a serious actor, and of course Jennifer Lawrence is a delight in every respect of the word. But to me the top acting was that of Michael Sheen, his personification of the most excellent Bartender one could ever hope to find invites you to revisit those days where men were proud to be gentlemen. In a word, invites the common person to be better. Less we all learn to be as great listeners and friends as this portrayed android is, wouldn't the world be a far better place?
By the time of my review, this movie is ""old"" but worry not about investing the time to enjoy it. It forms part of my private collection, a movie that I will enjoy with my daughters when they turn the appropriate age, and then... I will issue the question...what do you think? What would you do?"

Ms. Lawrence's work is always superb but in this film what she does is beyond the capacity for words to express. A simply shattering performance. The set design and direction are fine, so is Pratt, and the story haunting. But it is Jennifer Lawrence the finest actor of our lifetime who makes this film unforgettable."

","When I read the script on the blacklist years ago it played much like a chunky little B-movie, but with some star power and some budget it turned into something else, something I really didn't like on first watch, but here and now I really enjoyed for the pulpy, glossy sci-fi drama it is. Strangely I found this one of Chris Pratt's best performances, gentle and subdued and emotional.
The plot contains some difficult morals but a castaway film always would and human nature and loneliness is a strange beast and I think is examined perfectly fine here and anyone's issues with it seem a little bandwagony instead of taking it as a film on its merits and it's genre.
The 3D wasn't powerful at first, however once it settled, the deep close ups were powerful and added a lot to the movie, crisp, weighty shots against the commercial gloss of the set design.
Overall it's a film that could have done more with its ideas but chose to settle with some Hollywood gloss, but as it goes, it's pretty solid, consistent stuff."

The acting by the tiny cast is exemplary; understated and underplayed, the script is sparse and wonderful and, of course, the special effects are brilliant - never overwhelming the story.

","Guys
Whatever negative reviews you are reading, are doing a great disservice to this timeless space adventure. When they say there is no plot, think back for moment. The narrative, the character exploration, psychological feeling of lonliness and the resultant action taken by mind, all seem perfectly possible when you watch Chris Pratt. Now comes Jennifer and her terrific acting, body language and dialogues. All make her character come live on screen and you almost feel part of it and who wouldn't want to be with her alone in a spaceship full of Luxury. And there's a twist in their relationship which is shown very convincingly. You can't blame the script so far and the visually stunning screenplay too.<br/><br/>Then comes the bigger twist, the very reason one would think why Chris Pratt was woken up from hibernation in the first place. Even if you choose to believe it was not the central computer who did it intentionally to save the ship, but it was pure malfunction, it still makes sense since there are plenty of scenes in the movie to show that PODs can malfunction, which is shown with another surprise character - Lawrence as the captain.
And there is this usual climactic scenes when the real heroes save the ship. In fact, it was a real climax and not an anti-climax as many critiques wrote.<br/><br/>So go ahead and enjoy this movie and let's make it a cult one (in Space Adventure category)"

","This movie was better than I thought it would be. I thought it would be just another throw away sci fi film. But it was much more than that. The cast is small with only two main characters which are played by both Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt who both do phenomenal acting in this movie. With such a small cast this film very much relies on character development and we get a lot of that. If you are expecting a fast past survival sci fi space movie than look somewhere else because this is a ""slow"" movie which some people might not like but I thoroughly enjoyed it. Getting to learn more and more about the characters and what their reasons are for being on this ship in space was great. It slowly grows on you and so do these characters in what I call a dramatic sci fi romance story. The movie explores themes of fulfillment, and what exactly living happily where you are means. Over all great movie with great cinematography, acting, score, story, and character development."
"neil-476","7","1","2","16 May 2018"," Not bad, but a bit glib
","The trailer for this film tells us that a man and a woman have been woken from suspended animation 30 years into a 120-year journey to a colony planet. With no prospect of returning to deep sleep, they appear to be doomed to spend the rest of their lives together (apart from a robot bartender). But maybe they will fall in love. And maybe they were woken for a reason... <br/><br/>...and the trailer is perfectly fair as far as it goes. But this film does something I love: it introduces something in its early stages which isn't in the trailer, and I can't say what because that really would be a spoiler. Suffice it to say that it is a major unforeseen - though not unforeseeable - influence on the dramatic dynamics of the story, and I loved it, even though I felt that it wasn't fully developed within the confines of the movie.<br/><br/>It is fair to say that the hints in the trailer all develop during the movie, some as expected, some not, and they do so satisfyingly. Lawrence and Pratt are both very good, as are the underused Laurence Fishburne and Michael Sheen in a prize of a part as robot barman Arthur, programmed with a small amount of artificial intelligence, a slick line in bartender smalltalk, and a lamentable absence of discretion. I can imagine him jumping for joy when the script arrived.<br/><br/>The special effects are excellent and the ""hardware"" side of the movie is good, with the spaceship itself well designed, both outside and - especially - within: the sets are hugely impressive. Science purists will be a little irritated to discover that the ship has a ""Gravity on/off"" switch, but this does result in one of the film's most effective action set pieces.<br/><br/>But this is essentially a dramatic two-hander, and works very well as such for the most part, although I did find the ending to be a bit of an easy option in order to provide the audience with a happy ending which I didn't believe for a second, for a variety of reasons.<br/><br/>Should I mention that Jennifer Lawrence in a swimming costume adds what was, for me, a further reason for seeing the film? I think I should."

","Passengers has a brilliant sci-fi premise, solid sci-fi special effects, and brainless sci-fi writing. The hibernation pods preserve a person in suspended animation for decades upon decades but once they turn off you can't turn them on again. It's impossible for them to malfunction accept for the fact that, oh wait, they just did so now I'm awake and stuck all by my lonesome left to die on a spaceship traveling on autopilot to some distant planet in 90 years that I won't see with no crew or captain around because their asleep and nobody else around, except, oh, there is somebody else around, there's actually a bunch of people around so I don't have to be all alone at all because I would just wake a bunch of people up starting with the sleeping beauty Aurora, tell her I did it, and live my life happily ever after with Jennifer Lawrence by my side and the rest of our colony of cool looking passengers. There's absolutely no controversy and zero conflict in doing that, especially if the ship that's in control is going so haywire and I can't fix anything or get back in my hibernation pod or weld through the escape pod doors and it takes 50 years to communicate a message back to earth plus I can't get a decent breakfast or coffee because I'm not a gold pass passenger and the only fun things to do are walk around on the outside of the ship in magnetic space boots and float around in space in space suits and jump on my bed and play dance party video games with no partner and basketball by myself and watch movies with no one and eat sushi and drink liquor by myself and my only buddy is an android bartender that looks and talks exactly like Michael Sheen. I'd be a pretty good free throw shooter but in a heartbeat I could be playing basketball 1 on 1 with Jennifer Lawrence.....yes, pretty sure I'm waking up Jennifer, dude. The passengers all took a risk. Passengers is almost sexy. Jennifer lets her butt out but I can't see it. Jenn's naked body looks like the dark side of the moon. Is a solar eclipse happening? The light on Jenn's butt is dimmer than a dying star. The shadow on Jennifer's glutes is darker than deep space. Lawrence's back is blacker than a black hole. Jennifer Lawrence's booty has less light on it than.....than a sunless galaxy. Ok, look, I love Jennifer Lawrence, and I'm definitely going to buy Passengers on Blu-Ray, but can I please see Jennifer, the hottest girl in the universe's side butt in natural light without all the dark shadowy effects? Gooooosh! Isn't there a sun nearby? I got to see Chris Pratt's butt full on, sexy for the ladies, but not so much for me. I would have given Passengers a 6 if not for all of the awfully cut Lawrence hot scenes, like when she goes swimming in the gravitational pool too, because it would have been way better. It actually would have been awesome."

"tetrahex","Null","1","2","12 March 2018"," Half baked science fiction so thoughtlessly conceived people understood something was wrong even if they couldn't articulate it.
","Nothing about this film makes sense and that undermines any story they were trying to tell. A 120 year one way journey brings up all sorts of questions, and instead they fixate on the dumbest one. The conceit is that the main character of the mechanic is paying his way to a new colony through his indentured servitude. His skills 120 years out of date by the time he arrives, what corporate waits 120 years for a return, let alone 240 years for their ship to return home with what exactly to pay for this? Space taxes? A 240 year old ship would be obsolete scrap making the round trip pointless. Every crew member on that ship may as well exist outside of normal time, returning home to everyone they know being dead for 240 years at a time, their skills also being 240 years out of date, how are they to continue in their careers. They further dig the hole into self defeating absurdity by demonstrating they have AI on the level of having moral concerns, able to deceive when necessary, and this is what they install on a nothing bot, this level of tech renders the entire crew obsolete, and makes the empty ship unable to interact or help him all the more absurd. Nothing about this world they constructed makes sense, people may have not been able to articulate it, but they felt it. It deserves the low rating it got. I mean seriously, why would anyone build a luxury cruise liner level ship for vacations where if you ever got home everyone you know would be long dead. It was a goodbye forever ship, and they turned it into a silly Jennifer Lawrence vehicle.
It kind of says everything that the mainstream media reviewers fixated on the silly politics of ""wage gaps"" rather than the massive holes in the plot and just overall botched conception of the future when discussing this film. It could have been fixed so easily, just make them space Mormons, now they have a motivation which makes sense, and a moral and spiritual conflict to explore. Instead they took the easy route and explored nothing."

"liambean","9","1","2","11 March 2018"," Beautifully realized technology
","Cons: I'll get this out of the way. One, a single autodoc for 5,258 is unreasonably stupid. No way in hell would the designers of such a vehicle think one autodoc was enough for this many people. BUT, it was required for the story so of course, it can be forgiven. Two, the design of the ship leans more toward esthetics and less toward practical considerations. After all, it could very well have been a tube shape and held more passengers in the process. Three, artificial gravity induced by centrifugal spin, would not ""turn off"" and ""turn on"" quite so quickly or easily. Nor would such a spin, or spin-stop, be executed without any outside force such as thrusters. None are in evidence. This can be forgiven.<br/><br/>Pros: First, this film is visually stunning. I am simply gobsmacked at the production design and how much thought went into this starship and systems design. It's not ""The Enterprise"" and it's not ""Millennium Falcon,"" but it most certainly is beautiful. Of course, I know this runs counter to con number two above, but there's no reason why practical design cannot be visually pleasing too. This film is an excellent example of that.<br/><br/>Suspension of disbelief is quite easy with this film. Many of the automated systems are just ""stupid"" enough to be convincing. Yes, they can change how they address you as a person, but they can also be wholly unaware of things that would concern a life-form with a limited lifespan. <br/><br/>Two, we know that the gravity experienced on the ship is due to its spin. Some of the effects took advantage this simple fact. <br/><br/>Three, there were some surprises. This is really hard to pull off with science fiction because just about every possible scenario has been presented. Still, a potential savior is there just long enough to gain sympathy and our couple is left to fend for themselves again. This is just good story telling. <br/><br/>I was very satisfied with this film. It has gain a place amongst my favorites ""Blade Runner,"" ""Her,"" ""Ex Machina,"" ""Oblivion,"" and others.<br/><br/>This is the new golden age of science fiction friends. Enjoy it while it lasts."

"feelingmoorish","4","1","2","8 November 2017"," A Poor Caricature of Science-Fiction
","Passengers fundamentally failure is it seems to bear no attempt to intrigue, interest or engage its audience. Just like Jim (Chris Pratt) and Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence) we are trapped aboard the Starship Avalon in a never-ending circuit of time and space. However, they are aware that death is waiting for them. Watching these film makes one wish for death. <br/><br/>The main issue lies within the setting; Avalon is seemingly influenced by early iPods. It is white and pristine, yet offers very little in terms of personality. Almost like an iPod fresh out of a box, no music or memories and therefore no character or depth. The narrative is tied to the ship and as such it should serve as a tertiary character. But it does not, rather is serves as a characterisation of the film in its lack of distinctive features. <br/><br/>Narratively Passengers offers a conundrum. It desperately wants us to like Jim, it wants us to buy into him as another extension of brand Pratt - a lovable doofus with human intentions. However, he comes across as slimy and creepy. Whereas Aurora's character is in the most simple terms annoying. The film insists on reminding us every 5 minutes that she is a writer, just in case we forget. Her role in the film is to fall in and out of love with Jim. Beyond that, she lacks depth.<br/><br/>A more interesting premise would be if the film was shot from the perspective of Aurora. Therefore Jim's character would be represented as more nefarious. The story lacks a big central dilemma that actually engages the audience. We are meant to root for our heroes to find a way to fix the ship, but I spent a good portion of the filming hoping for critical engine failure.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a fun space romp with a likable front man look elsewhere. Buy Chris Pratt's Guardians of the Galaxy Lego figure and trap him in an egg box for 2 hours."
"rogun-35750","10","1","2","2 November 2017"," Sci-Fi at it's best!
","This is a movie that almost has it all. Those who didn't like it were probably disappointed by the lack of earthling fighting alien scenes, because there were none. It's more like Gravity, except much better.<br/><br/>I've always been disappointed by the lack of good science fiction movies. While it's fun to see alien/earthling battles, science offers fiction so many other possibilities, although we mostly just concentrate on those that are the most outlandish. But it's actually quite fun to dream about what may be realistically possible and isn't out of the realm of reality.<br/><br/>That's where Passengers exceeded greatly, despite the liberties taken with some scientific truths. The movie presented a futuristic, realistic situation and explored it to the hilt, while throwing in some drama and romance along the way. The romantic subplot was also done very well, even though it was only a subplot. The futuristic gadgets were interesting and provided intrigue, as well.<br/><br/>The movie explores a future world that's quite believable and possible, so I think this must have been what it was like to read Asimov, Clarke or Verne in their time. This is coming from a viewer who hated the last 3 Star Wars movies, but considers Bicentennial Man one of the better Sci-Fi movies in recent times, so take my opinion for what it's worth to you."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","1","2","24 October 2017"," Romance and sci-fi in outer space
","Although 'Passengers' had one of the most unique concepts of any film in recent years, had talented actors on board and the production values looked wonderful from the advertising, the critical reception (not just from critics but also from those who dislike Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence and immediately saying the film would be terrible, not being ignorant this actually happened) was a turn off.<br/><br/>Seeing it with my flatmate last night, who had seen the film before, really liked it and had recommended it to me, 'Passengers' turned out to be a much better film than expected. It's not perfect and can see where some of the criticisms are coming from, but it was to me a beautiful and thought-provoking film that raised some interesting questions and thoughts. Unlike a lot of people on the internet and particularly on IMDb, critics get a lot of respect from me and often we are on the same page. There have been a fair share of times where our opinions have been different, when a praised film didn't do much for me and a panned one surprised me in a good way. 'Passengers' is one of the latter examples and a lot of the problem with its less than enthusiastic critical response is to do with advertising which didn't indicate that it would be as unconventional as it was.<br/><br/>For one thing 'Passengers' looks wonderful, the advertising didn't lie in this regard. It's beautifully shot and crisply edited while the lighting and sets have a lot of atmosphere and are imaginative in their scope, showing the beauty, wonder and mysteriousness of outer space. It is easy to see why the production design garnered an Oscar nomination The special effects at their best make the jaw drop.<br/><br/>Don't think that Thomas Newman's score has been talked about enough despite being nominated for an Oscar (losing out to 'La La Land'), it's understated and hauntingly beautiful in a distinctive Newman. 'La La Land' deserved the win but of the other Best Original Score nominees (which included 'Jackie', which should never have been nominated) 'Passengers' for me was one of the better ones.<br/><br/>There are many moments where 'Passengers' provokes a lot of thought and is intriguing, raising some very interesting questions and ideas. The story on the most part didn't lose me, while it is not your conventional thrilling sci-fi film with lots of special effects and action it has its fair share of poignancy and intrigue. The initial fiery animosity turning into a beautiful love story was convincing thanks to the chemistry between Pratt and Lawrence. The direction isn't mind-blowing but is competent before not knowing what to do with itself in the final quarter or so.<br/><br/>Pratt is more understated than usual, in a cast against type dramatic role for an actor better known for comedy. He handles it very well and commands the screen. Lawrence gets a lot of hate here, but to me she is one of the better actresses today under 30 (her acting actually has a beyond her years feel to it). Here she is luminous and touching. Believed these two as lovers and found myself caring for their love story due to their success in keeping it alive. It's not just them though, Michael Sheen is amusing as Arthur and while his screen time is short (too short) Laurence Fishburne gives his characters pathos and dignity.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'Passengers' doesn't live up to full potential. Its biggest flaw is the last 30 minutes, it would have worked better as something more suspense or action-oriented but instead felt like a tacked on logic-free anti-climax where too many things felt unresolved and it was too over-the-top and ridiculous.<br/><br/>While the writing did intrigue and provoked a lot of thought, it didn't always work. Some of it did get confusingly over-complicated, with things needing to be made clearer and less vague, and other parts were forced. Pacing also could have tightened in places, the beginning while interesting in what was explored takes a little long to get going but the film really gets going properly once Lawrence's character wakes up.<br/><br/>In conclusion, was not sure what to expect but got a well above-average, to me it was good despite a few problems. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

Even worse: we love Chris as a great family man and husband, watching the character he played to fall in love with another woman on screen in detailed process, is so awkward. The other huge weakness of this movie is the lack of suspense and surprise. Right, one man and one woman are trapped on an isolated island/spaceship and then they fall in love, period. Really? Blue lagoon worked only because Brooke Shields was young and hot in bikini. Also, why someone would freeze themselves for so many years to go to another planet? Leaving everyone you know on earth and will not meet again. Why all these passengers bought their one way tickets? I am just not convinced people would do such a thing.

No jarring moments where you think ""That's not right...""<br/><br/>Quite engaging too.

","What really annoys me about this movie is that it could have been truly amazing. The first 30 minutes introduce a very intriguing world with lots of interesting ideas about colonizing other planets, space travel, habitation pods and the social aspect of it. The visuals are amazing, the design of the space ship is compelling and then we have a fantastic moral dilemma: Our protagonist can either destroy other lives to save his own or die a martyr death. What will he do? How will it turn out? Will he just wake up one person he or will he trigger a chain reaction and therefore kill the entire project? Will those people even get along with each other or will there be some Shining/Lord of the Flies-esque situation in space. Oh man, this could have been so good..<br/><br/>But then Hollywood hammers this movie into their mold of convention. First of all we know exactly he will wake her up because Jennifer Lawrence is on every stupid movie poster. That whole montage of him contemplating whether to do it or not is such a waste of time - it's only purpose is to show that he is actually a really good character who only acts out of desperation and not because he is evil. But it is Hollywood after all and there has to be a love story whether you like it or not. So how can we make him good again in the eyes of the audience and his love interest? <br/><br/>Well easy, after his morally reprehensible decision he just goes through the whole shebang of rectifying his character: He willingly accepts punishment from her, suffers in silence, literally burns in a cleansing fire and in the end selflessly offers his own life in order to first save others and then to undo his mistake. It's the ultimate price and that is why we all including Aurora can forgive him and their happy end makes perfect sense. Her character has nothing to it, is extremely predictable and only exists as a counterpart to his persona.<br/><br/>I'm sure Pratt and Lawrence did what they could with the material they were given, but the writing is unfortunate and I really wish this would have been an Indie movie with unknown actors and a story that we haven't already seen a gazillion times before."

","*Contains Spoilers*<br/><br/>This is a really difficult review to write actually. I watched the first half of Passengers the other day and was absolutely hooked. Couldn't stop thinking about it for the next two days and couldn't wait to get the chance to watch the rest, which I did with my partner, and I was so disappointed by the second half, it felt almost like a completely different film to me. <br/><br/>So regarding to the first half, I absolutely loved the idea and the personal dilemma the main character is going through. It's a plausible issue as well, and it's very well acted by Chris Pratt. I thought this film had a lot of potential and could potentially have gone into a very interesting direction. Instead, it then does a little bit of a U-turn and went about as mainstream as it gets. And I'm not saying this because I hate mainstream films and need twists and turns every second, or because I only watch super arty films which I don't, but because it got so utterly predictable and cheesy that I found it hard to watch after a while. <br/><br/>Overall Passengers was definitely not a waste of time and very entertaining in parts, but being a filmmaker myself I just couldn't stop thinking about the immense potential this film had and all the ways they could have gone with it, apart from choosing a very very stereotypical, Hollywood romance route. <br/><br/>Bonus points though for acting on both sides, for stunning cinematography and effects and for the bar scenes which really reminded me of ""The Shining""."

","Passengers is a highly enjoyable film to watch, however, it feels like it was one thing, that meant to be another, or, it was one thing, made to be another. The angle Passengers took makes me dismiss all its science, not because it may be wrong, like, really wrong, but rather, because science seems almost moot in this particular Science Fiction.<br/><br/>Passengers almost feels like a wasted premise... This movie, though again I'll repeat - very enjoyable, needed a more accomplished director at the helm, like the director of The Imitation Game for instance. Yes, I know it's Morten Tyldum too, but this film didn't quite have that edge.<br/><br/>The romance conundrum was pretty great, and what would've made it completely marvelous is how Jim would fix it all... Sadly, I'm not sure Jim did fix it. A happy ending for an unforgivable act was imposed, at the cost of intense emotional depth. What Jim did was wrong, and though his situation wasn't his fault, it wasn't Aurora's either, and Aurora being afraid of being alone, doesn't make it right.<br/><br/>Sure, had Jim not woken Aurora, everybody would've died... But, at the point of his decision, Jim didn't know this, but, if the argument is fate, then...<br/><br/>This film should've never been advertised as a Sci-Fi, but rather, a Romance Drama Adventure, and needed that edge, that depth, that quality acting ability that Jennifer Lawrence can harness.<br/><br/>Passengers meant to be a 7+/10, but accidentally became a 6.4/10."

","I find it ironic that the premise of this saga Involves a couple of space travelers who are awakened from their long distance suspended animation chambers to pursue date night melodramatic action when it made me yawn like I was at an insurance seminar on subrogation ... see you're already getting drowsy. The screenplay appears to have been jotted down during a morning metro ride into the city and I'm talking a short commute here. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt ( Tom Brady doppelgänger ) engage in kozmic romance and stuff until Lawrence realizes she had a few more decades of nap time coming thus setting off an intergalactic spat. I suppose you could call it a severe case of premature evacuation. The domestic quarrel simmered for a quite a while until I felt like I was ready for a spaceship sleep chamber. The genre of this flick may be characterized as existential light with a heavy dollop of astromance or, alternatively, a version of an interplanetary Sleeping Beauty where the Prince shoulda backed off. Robotic servants abound throughout the ship so that the idea of Pratt's loneliness leading to an irresponsible action in order to sate his pathetic plight seems ridiculous considering any number of sexbots or love cyborgs could have been made available and no, there aren't any space limitations on board because the interior looks titanic. Plus eventually both leads are going to get old and saggy ... along with nowhere to go and nothing to do so I only see this ending in alcohol dependence or worse. Also, what's with the bar re-creation from "" The Shining "" that implies a macabre setting which is antithetical to the essence of our wacky lovebirds or is it trying to tie into the alleged Apollo space mission symbolism by Kubrick? I was too tired to care. I magnanimously gave it a 3 because Lawrence is generally charismatic and I didn't watch it all the way to the end which may be slightly unfair. However, unless some gruesome aliens attack the ship at some point, I don't foresee any potential increase in entertainment value. I figure these two bored narcissists will eventually unplug all the passengers from their techno-coma and then all hell will break loose as the passageways are overflowing with diarrhea like a celestial cruise line disaster. Viewing this one will put you in a deep sleep state, earthling."

"rmax304823","6","1","2","9 July 2017"," Hal Goes Ape!
","There is this titanic space ship carrying 5,000 hibernating passengers and crew on a 99-year journey from earth to a new planetary paradise. The nuclear-powered ship is run by a series of computers. Everyone is peacefully asleep, traveling through space at half the speed of light. So far, so good. Then -- well, think of it this way. Sometimes your computer develops idiopathic quirks and sometimes even crashes, doesn't it? Chris Pratt is waked up prematurely by a faulty chip or something, climbs out of his hibernation pod and finds himself all alone on a magnificently appointed but Listerianlly sterile space ship. Robots swirl around and serve him but the only robot he can speak to (and who can understand and reply) is the very human looking bartender, Arthur, who has the smooth, non-committal delivery of all good bartenders in first-class settings.<br/><br/>Pratt, a mechanic, explores the ship but there's nothing he can do to get back to sleep, nor can he discover what went wrong and woke him up. A year of debauchery sensibly follows. When he's not playing basketball and working out, he's drunk in the Mexican cantina moaning for ""un autro cerveza."" Arthur sympathizes but after all he's just a robot with a fluid line of reassurance. Pratt winds up unkempt -- dressed in sweaty rags, bearded, and with long hair, he resembles Robinson Crusoe. Who can blame him? Arthur is the only other sentient being aboard and he certainly doesn't give a damn what Pratt looks like.<br/><br/>Instead of shooting himself naked into outer space, Pratt learns how to wake up his fellow passenger, Jennifer Lawrence. It's a sound idea, except for the fact that now TWO of them will be stuck for 90 years aboard an otherwise empty vessel in space. Both will be dead long before the ship reaches its destination. What follows next is predictable. The romance has its ups and downs. The romance takes up about a third of the screen time and is followed by scenes in which the central computer, if there is one, goes ape. Frankly, some of the exposition lost me. The ""gravity center"" shuts down and everything floats into the air, and comes perilously close to drowning Lawrence. But inasmuch as the ship is spinning, centrifugal force should keep everyone's feet firmly planted anyway, shouldn't it? In any case, the last third of the movie raises the tempo to agitato with sirens going off, alarm bells ringing, instruments whose shivering needles are climbing towards the red zones, and all that sort of thing. Not to worry though. This ship is titanic but not THE ""Titanic."" The nuclear neurosis is only an excuse for an extravaganza of special effects.<br/><br/>The direction is unspectacular and for that, I think, we can all be grateful. The cameraman wasn't drunk. The production values are impressive even if the result lacks any poetry whatever. Pratt bears about as much resemblance to Patrick Swayze as Lawrence does to Reneé Zellwigger. As an actor, Pratt himself is neither here nor there, but Lawrence, her crossed eyes, and the throaty squeak in her voice, are endearing. Also her bosom, of which the director deprives us of even a glimpse. No wonder the world is going to hell in a handbasket.<br/><br/>I wish them well in their 60 or 70 years together. I hope their marriage doesn't turn into the hellish experiences my six or seven did. And I hope they practice safe sex and use condoms because, should Lawrence become preggers, they have no way of waking up the docs or even the midwife. And I hope boredom doesn't overwhelm them because, after all, Arthur is nothing more than a pair of metallic legs beneath his bartender's jacket."

","This one is really bad, It gets a 3 for Chris Pratt, who at least seems to be trying. So, it is set basically a number of years in the future and Ryanair has taken over space travel. A cheap ass space ship smacks into meteorites because ... reasons and a passenger wakes up. Only he cannot get to sleep or get any help. Going nuts, he wakes up the first attractive female he sees who is the most dependent female in the world and then they proceed to have a space romance in a dying decrepit Ryanair spaceship. He is a (lovable) idiot and she is an annoying dependent personality moron. Eventually the star-ship totally breaks and they decide to fix it themselves without any proper training. And they succeed! He almost dies but doesn't (WHAT A TWIST!) and they save Ryanair from thousands of dollars in reparations.

","I gave this movie a try because while the critics gave it a harsh score, there seems to be quite a bit of positive user reviews - it currently has a 7/10 - well, the critics were right this time. I can't understand the positive reviews by the regular users... The movie is so predictable, cheesy, and dull. No real smart thrills or twists. Just plain point A to point B. <br/><br/>It must be the kids of this generation that haven't seen many films enjoy this movie, while critics and avid movie watchers have seen this movie before. <br/><br/>It's many ideas stolen from Wall-E (2008), Gravity (2013), Interstellar (2014), The Martian (2015)... but done on the IQ level of the movie Transformers; it seems like a grade school student wrote this film. The story is generic and uninspiring. The pacing is awful. <br/><br/>It's just so cheesy and predictable (""Oh Mr Robot, please keep this a secret.... I'm positive you won't tell anyone but I feel like telling you anyway just to get some twists going"") - there is no shock value or real thrill to the film. <br/><br/>The plot seems more like a short story TV episode where they dragged it out with pointless scenes like virtual dancing, basketball, and swimming. The movie probably would have worked as a 30 minute short film story, but it's dragged out to 2 hours of unexciting bad pacing fill-ins. <br/><br/>I saw this film in 3D (being a big 3D fan), and you'd think even the most mundane scenes would still be more enjoyable because of the 3D advantage, but it wasn't. I know the movie ""Gravity"" actually has a pretty dull ""story"" as well, but at least the 3D for that film was spectacular and thrilling. <br/><br/>The script was bad enough, but the casting is probably worse; Chris Patt and Jennifer Lawrence is like the most superficial horribly balanced combination ever. You just can't sympathize with them. <br/><br/>There's also nothing romantic about with the chemistry/setup with the characters, especially from the script - both have done creepy actions. While Chris's action may be unforgivable, how could one fall in love with someone who goes complete psycho ape sh*t kicking your face and everything? <br/><br/>It would have been more interesting to have Chris react differently towards the Bartender after the ""incident"", but a wasted opportunity yet again because the movie always likes to play it safe. <br/><br/>This is one of those rental movies where watching it once is enough and is pretty forgettable."
"davidarcher","8","1","2","14 May 2017"," Great sci-fi movie - if you ignore the creepy premise of how they meet...
","Very good movie!<br/><br/>Overall, the movie owes quite a bit to 2001: A Space Odyssey, which set the bar for the visual design of movies set in spaceships. And, oh what a spaceship. It's kind of the ultimate cruise ship, with bars, restaurants, a shopping mall, movie theater, infinity pool, and much much more. (Sign me up.)<br/><br/>I can't say much about the plot without giving it away, but it provides an opportunity for Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Platt to fall in love, and for Platt to fix stuff. (Lawrence is a writer by trade, while Platt is a mechanic and is therefore the person to be the movie's hero. Just as it should be.)<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning that the circumstances of how Lawrence and Platt's characters meet has generated some controversy, along with the moral implications of such a relationship.<br/><br/>Platt and Lawrence are excellent, and Michael Sheen is wonderful as Arthur the robot bartender. (Wearing – seriously – the same exact outfit that Ted Lange wore on ""The Love Boat."")<br/><br/>The bad news about the movie is the huge number of glaring plot holes. (Warning: Here be spoilers.)<br/><br/> The plot is driven by a chance encounter with meteors. The Avalon spaceship is the most sophisticated creation in the universe, yet it can't avoid some meteors?<br/><br/> Every one of the passengers and crew is hibernating, and as problems occur, there's no way for the ship's computer – or anyone on the ship – to awaken the crew members who might be able to fix the problems. Really? (HAL apparently wasn't available.)<br/><br/>And then there's the little things: The ship is designed to entertain 5,300 people for four months but only has one bar and one bartender. Most cruise ships today hold about 3,000 people and have a dozen bars and dozens of bartenders. And, Jennifer Lawrence has an endless supply of casual and workout clothes and even cocktail dresses, but only one bathing suit.<br/><br/>Bit o' trivia: Emma Clarke voices the ship's computer, while in real life, she's one of the voices on the London Underground who warns you to ""Mind the Gap.""<br/><br/>See it now if you like sci-fi or the cast."

","Plot; During an interstellar flight to a new colony world, one of the ship's five thousand passengers is accidentally awakened early from sleep hibernation.<br/><br/>Most of the criticism surrounding Passengers centers around taking it to task for what it isn't, or for not being all that it could have been, and ultimately I agree. Instead of focusing on the moral and ethical dilemma of the choice made by Chris Pratt's character and its consequences, or acting as an exploration of loneliness and the human need for companionship, it instead grafts those themes onto a boilerplate romance. Pratt and co-star Jennifer Lawrence lift the material with strong performances and good chemistry and help to make Passengers a reasonably entertaining sci-fi/romantic/drama, but I can't help but feel that hidden deep within is a much better film."

","Passengers isn't categorized in the science fiction genre and I wonder why because it's clearly a sci-fi. There is a bit of romance as well but the focal point is science fiction to me. The story is very easy to follow but also very pleasant. Even though there aren't much actors in about ninety percent of the movie you never get the feeling it's going to be boring. Chris Pratt that is normally not one of my favorite actors is doing a good job, as well as Jennifer Lawrence. The dilemma Chris Pratt has at one point makes you think if we would do the same thing to solve his problem. And I'm pretty sure almost everybody would do the same. The filming is wonderful and the scenes are very futuristic. All the kind of things I like in a good sci-fi."

"wilsr","8","1","2","12 April 2017"," Pretty good if you just accept the many scientific goofs
","This is definitely one of the better SciFi movies, on several counts. Firstly, the CGI is spectacularly good even by today's high standards. I watched the movie on a (clear and sharp) inflight video screen and the effects were excellent: I must see it again on a big screen. Secondly, although there are a few wham bang scenes, they are thankfully few and far between: far too many movies now rely on destroying things in massive explosions rather than good plotting and dialogue. Thirdly - and most importantly, the script gives the audience something to think about: the ethical dilemma of Jim, the sole awakened passenger on an interstellar ship as he agonises whether to cut short the hibernation of the beautiful Aurora. He longs for company and, hopefully, ""company"" - Arthur the bartender isn't quite the same. Despite the scientific advisors the producers must have employed there are many goofs plainly visible (the ""Goofs"" section here brings up a large number) but IMO they don't spoil the movie to a great extent except towards the end. At about the halfway point the movie seems to stray away from thoughtful analysis of Jim's dilemma and comes close to being wham bang (See above.) One of the most notable scenes is where gravity disappears: it is a stunning mix of live action and CGI - and also one containing a large number of scientific goofs, not that this spoils the effect. The ending is, I think, the worst part of this movie. Hollywood likes a happy ending so, despite Jim's death in space (a pretty unequivocal passing, given the extent of his exposure to heat, radiation, anoxia and cryogenic temperatures!) he is miraculously resurrected in a truly biblical fashion. Shortly afterwards - in movie terms, if not relativistic - the film ends rather as if the editors had been given a deadline. A continuation of the more thoughtful first half would have had him die and stay dead: the final scene might have shown Aurora herself facing the same dilemma about waking a good looking guy to provide company - and ""company"". Fade to black/credits....... 8/10 but still a good watch."
"barosanescu","Null","1","2","11 April 2017"," $110 million to make this movie? Better not ignore the bad reviews!
","For a movie that has to do with ""humanity"", I do not understand why it cost $110 million to produce this. How much does CGI cost these days? It has been around for a few decades now. Hell, my 8 core home computer can do what they do.<br/><br/>Hollywood, please put your money into better crap, seriously. How many people could've been fed with the amount of money you spent on this?<br/><br/>As another reviewer said, some of us do know some facts, and no CGI in the world would change the fact that a spaceship traveling at 149.5 km/sec (half the speed of light), would take some 1240 years to reach Antares (and they were not going there, they were going beyond that). <br/><br/>In 1977, I smiled when Han Solo said he made the Kessel run in 12 parsecs. Parsecs is distance, not time. After all these years, Holywooooo' still doesn't get it right. <br/><br/>And the acting? What acting? At the very end, watch out for Andy Garcia (anyone remembers him?)"
"virek213","9","1","2","10 April 2017"," In The Cosmos With Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt
","Even with Hollywood's decades-long infatuation with CGI, which has caused the cost of such films to escalate into the $100-200 million range, there are moments of levity when such visual effects are put to solid use in the service of a story and not to the salaries of the effects men generating them, nor even necessarily to what studios think the audience might want. During the second decade of the 21st century, we have had at least three films that fit such a bill: 2013's GRAVITY (with George Clooney and Sandra Bullock); 2014's INTERSTELLAR (with Matthew McConaughey and Anne Hathaway); and 2015's THE MARTIAN (with Matt Damon). And in 2016, there was a fourth film to join this illustrious group: PASSENGERS, a combination of intergalactic romance and science fiction.<br/><br/>The setting is aboard the starship Avalon, on a 120-year journey across the galaxy to a place called Homestead II, a new interstellar colony. The crew number 258, and the total number of civilian passengers five thousand—all of whom are in a deep state of hibernation, to be awakened within four months of reaching Homestead II, which Avalon is traveling to at half the speed of light. But something on the ship has gone haywire, and one of the hibernation pods has allowed a deep-space engineer (Chris Pratt) to awaken a mere thirty years into the journey, meaning that he will almost certainly die before anyone else awakens. In spending a full year in trying to find the cause of the hibernation malfunction, he also awakens a female journalist (Jennifer Lawrence); and they work at figuring out what has actually gone wrong. In the course of exploring the ship, and despite Lawrence's extreme rancor at Pratt having awakened her way too soon, they not only try to find a solution to an incredibly complex practical issue, but also find the chance to fall in love with whatever time they have left. A third person (Laurence Fishburne), a member of the crew (all of whom are still somehow in hibernation), assists them in finding the cause of Avalon's malfunction; and unfortunately it is actually hundreds of little problems morphing into one huge intergalactic nightmare.<br/><br/>Morton Tyldum, a Norwegian director whose previous credits included the highly acclaimed 2014 World War II docudrama THE IMITATION GAME, manages to make what could have been a potentially sticky and sentimental deep space film, courtesy of screenwriter Joe Spaihts (who co-wrote the screenplay for director Ridley Scott's 2012 sci-fi/horror opus PROMETHEUS), into something far more substantial and thought-provoking than a lot of critics, and even some audiences, have given it credit for. Certainly Pratt and Lawrence make for an appealing pair; and the potential for them having passionate lovemaking is there at certain points of the film. In the end, though, the focus is on survival and the inherent dangers of both interstellar travel and technology that doesn't always work the way we might want it to. Much like both GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR, PASSENGERS has a few distinct homages to director Stanley Kubrick's 1968 sci-fi masterpiece 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY, as well as to Steven Spielberg's A.I.: ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE and MINORITY REPORT, and the 2008 Disney film WALL-E. But just for good measure, in the early parts of the film, there is an android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen), who looks like a dead ringer for Lloyd, the supernatural bartender portrayed by Joe Turkel in Kubrick's 1980 horror classic THE SHINING; and even the expansive set of the lounge has the look (albeit in the height of high tech) of the Gold Room in that film.<br/><br/>The scattered action sequences keep PASSENGERS from seeming too cerebral and slow (a criticism still lodged against ""2001"" by critics who really should know better), but the spacious production design and the CGI depictions of deep space keep the film from being a testosterone fest, and grounded in a certain amount of reality, again much like GRAVITY and INTERSTELLAR. Lawrence, known for her roles in the Hunger Games franchise and JOY, and Pratt, who starred in the 2015 box office smash JURASSIC WORLD, anchor the film's human element; and Newman, whose many scores include WALL-E and BRIDGE OF SPIES, among many others, provides a great music score of a very neo-futuristic kind. At a time when really good filmmaking that involves special effects work is hard to find, and total suspension of disbelief is all too easy to find, PASSENGERS illustrates just how well a certain sense of cosmic wonder, realism, and humanity can come off in 21st century Hollywood."

","On the surface Passengers was brutally slayed by critics calling it all sort of bad things but actually it's GREAT. I really don't understand , how critics ignored it. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt , two of the biggest name in our industry right now comes together to serve this brilliant science fiction romantic drama. First of all , the very first thing that comes in my mind is the AMAZING Production design, it's some of the best I have seen in years for a sci-fi. As an Epic Romance based in space , it has the perfect story with a little amount of twist and suspense. It has it's own charisma and romantic factor plays well too without any loss in pace which too is smooth. The very best thing about the movie is both the leads portrays their character effortlessly and the fact that it is not exactly clichéd but has its own ground. Especially the last half hour is the best part of the movie. I don't know what the critics were looking for , it's a good entertaining film which does not deserves such low ratings.

"russell8425","Null","1","2","7 April 2017"," Factual errors
","OK we know its a movie and it does not necessarily have to be 100 percent factually accurate but when the whole concept is around a 100 year journey the writers should at least do some basic research. The spaceship slingshots around Antares which is around 620 light years from earth. We are told that the spaceship is travelling at half light speed which would mean it would take at least 1240 years to get to Antares. As if that is not bad enough the idea of flying past a red super giant star and having a casual gaze down on it is simply ridiculous. I don't think any spacecraft could withstand the gravitational forces and immense heat and radiation it would be subjected to. I don't mind that these movies don't really care about these things but please treat the audience with a bit more respect when it comes to their intelligence."

The wife wanted a suspense movie after all the March Madness basketball. It was certainly worth the time investment and the nominal rental fee.<br/><br/>To be honest, I wasn't expecting too much; was just anticipating an ultra-saccharine (to the point of goo-goo), explosion-filled, mindless violence, dumb-plotted space flick. I actually planned on snoozing halfway through it (had to get up early the next morning). Boy were we pleasantly surprised. However, I would have added these lines of dialogue between the main characters: <br/><br/>A: Wow! So, this is it. This will be our life - just me and you on this spaceship - from now until our in-transit deaths. <br/><br/>J: I promise to stay interesting for you. <br/><br/>A: For another forty to fifty years? Don't put so much pressure on yourself.<br/><br/>J: We can make this an epic, one of a kind, novel-worthy experience - for posterity. You'll become even more famous. <br/><br/>A: Hard to cash those royalty checks with stiff fingers.<br/><br/>OK, just my two cents. My suggested screenplay revisions always end up catching dust.<br/><br/>As for the ending, well, yes, we could see it coming. That's where I knocked off a couple of stars. A great opportunity wanked.<br/><br/>Disclosure: I'm not the biggest sci-fi fan, but I can truly appreciate a well-crafted, plausible, smart, sometime-in-the-future story ... and Passengers is one of them.

","So I finally saw this movie after missing it in the theaters a few months back, and I'm a little disappointed.<br/><br/>The concept's pretty good, but the plot just fell way too predictable and cheesy half way. They fall in love, OK he didn't even have to try much. But I guess if you wake up stranded with one other human being and he's Chris Pratt, why not. Aurora finds out and goes nuts, sure. A crew member wakes up for the sole purpose of giving them the keys to the operating room and dies immediately, wow that's lazy. Jim has to sacrifice himself to save the ship and he magically survives, oh come on even Disney doesn't do this anymore. Aurora forgives him and there's that magical resurrection, just spell cheesy. Jim figures out there is a way for Aurora to go back to hibernation but she chooses to live with him instead. Oh really, she forgives him for ""murder"" just like that?<br/><br/>The visuals were good, and the acting was fine, but this is a film that should have had much more potential.

","This is a pretty rotten film. On the positive side, the special fx are very good and the cinematography is excellent. Chris Pratt gives a very good performance, but someone needs to tell Jennifer Lawrence that she is not Betty Davis. She is a fine actress probably better than Chris Pratt, but Chris seems to know his limits; Jennifer is so over the top, she is completely unbelievable. But the script...who in the world read this and said, ""This is compelling.""? From the first 5 minutes of the movie, you know the rest of the film. You are constantly saying, could we just fast forward through the next 10 minutes. I'm thinking, I've seen this movie so many times that there is going to be a massive twist at the end.

The pseudo technology was better than good, and the special effects were quite entertaining and ""realistic"".

"Muhammad_Nd","9","1","2","26 March 2017"," A Few Years to Go
","Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, a pair made in heaven--two actors with enough chemistry and charm to burn pull this off. ""Passengers"" gives us the premise that it's possible to make it through years of solitude or spending the rest of your life with another person without causing body harm to each other, or killing your audience with a trite and boring script. The audience makes it safely to the end of the story, and it's an exciting and imaginative ride.<br/><br/>Pratt and Lawrence are the main stars here, carrying 90% of the film. Nevertheless, they get some help from two solid actors Michael Sheen and Lawrence Fishbourne. Their roles are small but key to the main twists. It's always a pleasure to see good actors do good work.<br/><br/>Because of unexpected complications, Pratt is awakened from hibernation way too early on his route to the colonization of a new planet. A consequence of this event is that he must now endure 90 years of solitude and will probably die alone on route. Being a flawed human, he reaches the point when he considers ending this problem, but he's charmed by a vision of the perfect mate, and matters become even more complicated as she awakens, too.<br/><br/>We need a complication to make the plot more dramatic, and Lawrence soon realizes that there might be more to her hibernation ending. Simultaneously, electrical and computer functions begin to be affected by some unknown failure. It soon becomes clear that the trip might be cut short for all of the people on the ship, and it's up to our heroes to make things right.<br/><br/>Much of the action is relegated to the end of the film, and it works. There are some tributes to films like ""Gravity"" and ""2001"", whether intentional or accidental, it doesn't matter. Maybe it shows just how visionary both of those films were. This genre is also benefiting from the more sophisticated special effects that can be added to create new and incredible settings for this type of story.<br/><br/>None of this would work without the fine acting by Lawrence. She doesn't disappoint at all, bringing a complex character to life. She's a dreamer, a person who has managed to see herself as successful, who knows she has the skills to do it, but she is also a human being with needs and a past that can now make all the difference. She's resourceful and self-reliant; however she knows when it's time to ask for help, and all of this is beautifully demonstrated in her acting, which demands both emotional and physical dedication.<br/><br/>Pratt is growing as an actor and hold his own against Lawrence. As I said before, their chemistry is palpable, and it doesn't hurt that both are very good looking and look amazing running around the ship or getting dressed up for a date.<br/><br/>""Passengers"" might not change the history of cinema; still it shows there's still room for many new entries in Science Fiction, as long as they are done with care and skill. There's hope for the future."

"TheDevilsNotetaker","8","1","2","25 March 2017"," Almost Hard SF! And just plain terrific! Forget the critics- Just Watch It!
","After reading all the bad reviews before I thought this was gonna be crap so i was expecting zero going in. But from the very first moments this felt like true hard science fiction movie- the giant sleeper ship with the protective shield that preceded it felt like something straight out of Tau Zero or The Songs of Distant Earth, and everything that came after felt just plain Right. The events, decisions, mistakes and most of the physics felt plausible and realistic unlike any other SF movie I've seen of late.<br/><br/>The only things that bother me after rewatching this a few times (scientifically) is how the constant thrust ion drive along with the ship will need to be flipped around mid-way through the journey to go from acceleration to deceleration. AT the end the ship is shown close to the planet but still in the same nose-front attitude. <br/><br/>Also wouldn't the very slight iod drive thrust create a very slight gravity within the spinning section of the ship that is perpendicular to the centripetal gravity from the spin? But since its very very slight thrust it might be negligible.<br/><br/>The slingshot around a red giant at 50% light was probably tacked on cos it looked good. Not even sure you can do a slingshot at such velocity. And was it to increase speed even further or as a course correction or both? Not sure. And at such high speed that type gravitational encounter might have actually ripped the ship apart. And definitely would not be visible at all to anyone watching cos of its approach speeds. It would be over almost instantly. Plus the red giant will be blue shifted to appear a blue color in the approach phase? Anyway this is all trivial nitpicking. The producers never said that this was a scientifically accurate- but the accuracy far outweigh the BS.<br/><br/>The acting and story and all the decisions are just simply perfect for this type of endeavor. Never a moment did I think wow that was utterly stupid and unrealistic on his or her part. If I was stuck on a dead ship all alone and saw this beautiful woman I would definitely wrestle with myself whether to wake her or not. Who wants to die alone?<br/><br/>So all in all this IS perfect Science Fiction. To HEll with the critics. They've been soul-sucked by the crap that was Gravity and Interstellar and The Farce Awakens and the Star Trek reboots that they don't know a GOOD THING when they see it. Simple as that.<br/><br/>I just wished they had stretched out the ending a bit more and revealed that the couple had children and grandchildren and those kids would be waiting when the sleepers finally awoke."
"jacobs-greenwood","7","1","2","23 March 2017"," Yet another reason not to trust the Tomatometer, this one's worth seeing
","This is a very creative science fiction movie about a spacecraft come automated cruise ship that's headed for a distant planet with 5000 passengers and 258 crew members aboard in hibernation. The plan is for the travelers to be awakened once the ship is within 4 months of its destination Homestead II, where each will be given the opportunity to ""begin again"" as ""pioneers"" in the less crowded environs of a new world. The film deservedly received an Academy Award nomination for its Production Design; its Original Score was also Oscar nominated.<br/><br/>The ship, its design, exterior and interior are a visual feast to behold, and its operations are beautifully imagined. The concept of transporting human beings a great distance from Earth by having them sleep - kept from aging during a decades-long journey in some sort of chamber - is not a new one, but the idea that the vehicle of transport could be a dream machine of this caliber is a new one, at least to this reviewer. The result is a magnificently realized luxury liner - complete with class distinctions - in space.<br/><br/>The problem is that barely 30 years into its 120-year trip the computer controlled ship encounters a larger asteroid field than its shields were designed to withstand. The resulting damage, which for the most part is automatically 'healed' by the ship's systems, causes one passenger - Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston, a tradesman aka mechanic in (essentially) the steerage class - to be awakened.<br/><br/>Preston is surprised to find he's the only one awake, and it's through him that we see all of the ship's features including instant food and a plethora of entertainment options. He's thrilled to finally find someone to talk to, even if it's just an android bartender named Arthur (Michael Sheen plays an integral role in the story). But Preston is despaired because there isn't any way for him to get into the ship's control room or restart his sleep chamber, so he's destined to die alone long before the destination.<br/><br/>So lonely is he that even after deciding to ""live a little"" by breaking in to the ship's first class amenities (like suite accommodations), Preston contemplates waking up another passenger - a beautiful writer he discovers in one of his low moments - to join him. After a year on the ship with only Arthur to share his time with - and months of wrestling with this ethical dilemma, Preston does in fact awake Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence).<br/><br/>What follows is another year on the ship during which Aurora, unaware that Preston had awakened her, finally accepts that her planned life is lost such that she allows herself to fall in love with him. They have a fairytale romance until she learns the truth, and Aurora's passion is turned to rage against Preston. She nearly kills him before realizing that he'd allow her to do it. The two then coexist on the ship, not talking with each other while agreeing to split time with Arthur as their only companion.<br/><br/>But the failing ship soon becomes the most pressing issue, and the latest emergency finally awakens a crew member. But Laurence Fishburne's character - who lives for only a few hours - is really just a plot device that provides information and a few other necessary elements in order that Aurora and Preston have to pull together to save themselves, the ship and its asleep crew and passengers. That's not to say that this part of the story comes off as too obviously contrived, until perhaps in retrospect (which might lead one to other troubling questions).<br/><br/>There's one more semi-suspenseful moment at the very end, which will probably satisfy most, even though Aurora never acknowledges that she was fated not to live the life she'd planned whether Preston had awakened her or not."
"talos_valcon","7","1","2","22 March 2017"," Depends on your Mindset, *Spoiler*
","I'm a hard core Sci Fi fan and avid reader. With that said, this movie had some serious intellectual errors, design flaws, and common sense issues. However, I've yet to find a really good sci fi movie that covers all of that. Something to do with Hollywood I think. Putting that all aside, it had awesome visual effects and it followed a fairly standard romantic comedy theme with a little drama thrown in. I'd give it a 7, maybe 7.5 out of 10. <br/><br/>BUT, if you are a student or follower of all things hateful, then you will become very upset over the Helsinki type behavior and overall evil story line of a man tricking a poor helpless woman into falling in love with him, the ""Ultimate Crime"". I personally think they should have reversed the roles of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence, thereby bypassing their 'outrage'."
"timstark","6","1","2","19 March 2017"," Enjoyable Mindless Fantasy
","First off this review may contain spoilers.<br/><br/>Went into this film with an open mind on a day where focusing on an intelligent film was out of the question. Just wanted to relax and watch something entertaining. Passengers is this type of film. One you can just sit back and watch--leave the room and come back to without missing too much (during the first half to three quarters). <br/><br/>The special effects are outstanding even though the science behind the ship and space is unrealistic and in many cases flat out wrong. That's OK for this type of fantasy romance where the plot revolves around the characters and no so much in the science. Still, some of the errors are so blatant that anyone can point them out--which I will not do as many others have done well in this regard.<br/><br/>Lawrence and Pratt are entertaining and have good chemistry. If this were not the case, I'd probably have turned it off. Sheen does an admirable job and carries a good part of the film particularly before Aurora's awakening. I especially enjoyed the 'Lloyd' type character he portrays as a tribute to the Shining. Sure it's been done--but there had to be someone or something for Jim to talk with otherwise any sane person would last only a few months before losing their mind.<br/><br/>The main plot could be a real life issue sometime in the future. It's hard to say how many years in the future the story takes place--but it must be centuries as there are many colonies and thus many of these vessels successfully fulfilling their missions. This is where reality ends--as the ship contains little in the way of redundancy--and where many viewers are turned off by the lack of realism. Chill--just remember what you're watching. This is not Asimov. <br/><br/>I would've preferred Aurora finding out in a different manner. She's an intelligent journalist and yet couldn't piece together that Jim had awakened her? Especially knowing he's a mechanic by trade? Having Aurora linking the clues together while falling in love, would've added more tension to the film.<br/><br/>Those that say, why didn't they wake the crew up? Well, the crew was not in the pods in the main area--they were behind high security doors. And thus impossible to reach. Which, both tried and failed. Realistic? No. Some security override would be in place to ensure in the unlikely event someone did wake up, they'd be able to seek some type of help. Perhaps another android. Like I said, this is fantasy so just enjoy it.<br/><br/>The ending could have made the movie more palatable for the critics, had Jim died. Then Aurora would be faced with making the same decision he made--and leaving the door open for a gut wrenching open ending. <br/><br/>All in all--a watchable, enjoyable film. Would I watch it again? Probably not in a sit down watch. But playing it in the background would be fine. There's enough substance and beauty in the effects to make it a 2 hour screen saver while you're doing housework or visiting with friends."

","Over 5000 people in hibernation pods on the starship Avalon are heading to the planet Homestead II, which is 120 years away. Something happens and Jim (Chris Pratt) wakes up 90-years before the ship is to land. After a year alone, he wakes up a very pretty Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence) from her pod. He admits to the Android bartender, Arthur (Michael Sheen), that he feels guilty about waking her up. Later when the very pretty Aurora finds out what Jim did there is hell to pay and the relationship is now on shaky ground. <br/><br/>I saw this as a love story, sort of, and although this is a slow- going I am held by the banter between Jim and the very pretty Aurora and the set design of the ship and these scenes are fantastic. The stunts and computer special effects are exceptional. Kudos.<br/><br/>We see Gus (Laurence Fishburne) - a deck crew chief – appear as his pod also malfunctions. His appearance is crucial to the story because he knows something is wrong with the ship and he tells the pretty Aurora and Jim to find the main cause of the ship malfunctioning. <br/><br/>Then a hole appears in the ship and the very pretty Aurora and Jim must find a way to work together to save the ship and themselves. Can a very pretty Aurora find a way to use Gus's wristband to override medical commands in the infirmary to save a life? Inquiring Minds are watching closely. <br/><br/>Later Jim finds a way to allow a very pretty Aurora to go back into a hibernation pod to continue her journey to Homestead II.<br/><br/>All in all this is quite enjoyable and we stay engaged because we are not sure what will happen next and will Jim and the pretty Aurora get back together? Inquiring minds are on the job. <br/><br/>Then we see a note on the screen that says: 88 years later. (What? This is over already?)<br/><br/>Then we see the formerly hibernated people open a door to the rest of the ship and we are allowed to see what they see. This is a really good ending. Sad, but good.

","The plot of this film will keep you on the edge of the seat, and the depiction of how interstellar travel might happen at some point in the future is very entertaining. However I didn't feel like the movie contained any well developed theme or any message. The most interesting theme was the notion that we have very little control over our lives. The two passengers have their own hopes and dreams about the future, but ultimately they have little control over making these dreams a reality, instead they are just ""passengers"", and must simply make the best of what they have. I think this theme gets drowned out by the exploration of the ship's luxurious facilities, and the romance between Lawrence and Pratt. <br/><br/>As a sucker for anything to do with sci-fi and space travel, I did enjoy it. However, I think it had more potential."

","The movie was better than I thought. At first I was expecting some kind of a cliché movie that has a cookie cutter plot, this is probably the first movie where the whole idea of a generational ship is fleshed out.<br/><br/>The movie does contain numerous plot holes, artistic licenses, and inaccuracies but I guess all movies have them. For example, why would they fly a colony ship with only one auto doc (considering that the ship has 5000 passengers), with a rather mediocre computer repair subroutine, and no way to wake a crew member should something go wrong. The way the ship's computer assuming that no failure or errors could happen just seems to suggest to me that they treat those colony ships as expendable. They could just wake a handful of crew members every year for a couple of weeks to check things and make sure everything work the way they should. In fact it seems irresponsible that there's no way to put someone in stasis again (more auto docs anyone??) Despite that, I still think the movie is better than what their box office performance suggests, namely the whole colony ship idea and how things could possibly go wrong, so if humanity were to do anything like this in the future they'd know to plan ahead...<br/><br/>I somehow think that they could have very easily said that Earth was destroyed in some disaster (giant asteroid impacts or something) and that Avalon is one of the many colony ships sent out in order to preserve humanity... it would certainly make the plot far more dire because now instead of saving just a few thousand lives, they are saving mankind."

Many people seem to focus on the ""creepiness"" of Pratt's character, how his actions were unethical and criminal (this is true), and the general ridiculousness of how Pratt originally arrived at his initial situation (e.g., a spaceship with no contingency capabilities for hibernation, a ship for over 5,000 people with only one Auto Doc, no alarms which would wake crew members, no rotating shift of engineering and crew members to keep constant watch on a ship carrying that many passengers while navigating through the deep vacuum of space, etc.). I agree with most of this, but I think many people miss the point that the story was trying to tell. This wasn't a movie about the theoretical accuracy of space travel, or that gave much thought to the principles of engineering design or safety during space travel (especially for a 120 year trip), and it wasn't intended to. <br/><br/>My view is that this story was centrally about a moral dilemma, and the human condition. If you were on a journey like the one Pratt's character experienced, and to your horror, you woke up with 90 years left to go knowing that there was nothing you could do to go back to sleep, nothing you could to do escape, and you would die alone without any possibility of human contact or connection for the rest of your life, what would you do? One of the things stories do is force us to confront the human condition. Good stories force us to think about what we would do. If you were in Pratt's character's situation, what would you do? Would you be able to live for 50-60 years without another human being to talk to or experience your life with? Would you be able to survive the rest of your life trapped on a spaceship, repeating the same unfulfilling and meaningless activities over and over again without anyone else to keep you company or share your day with? Would you be able to resist the temptation of waking up another human being so that you would be able to escape your loneliness? Would you be able to take the moral high ground and be brave enough to end your life and escape your misery instead of giving into the temptation of rousing another human being but, at the same time, knowing you are condemning them to your same fate? We all would like to think we would take the moral and ethical high ground, but none of us will ever know until we are faced with that situation. <br/><br/>To me, this is a movie about the human desire for love and companionship (not sex as some people are ridiculously making this out to be), and sometimes that may lead desperate and lonely people to do unethical things. I feel like most people are missing that message. Exploring the fragility of someone's morals when tested in an extreme circumstance is an interesting theme. People vastly overestimate their ability to deal with traumatic events. Self preservation is a powerful thing, and so is loneliness. We can see Pratt's character going through the trauma of contemplating suicide. We can see Pratt's character going through the moral and ethical dilemma of whether or not he should wake Lawrence's character up, and once he does, he panics and feels the wrong in that action in his gut; he feels guilty and ashamed, and this is apparent with his character for many of his interactions with Lawrence's character. While I would have preferred that the story explored the potential acceptance, healing, reconciliation, and forgiveness process that Lawrence's character may have gone through instead of an imminent disaster bringing about an almost forced reconciliation, I still think the direction the film took worked, even though it felt slightly rushed. I did feel that in the moments when Pratt's character was about to face an almost certain death, that is when Lawrence's character came to the realization that if he DID die, she would then be faced with the same situation that Pratt's character was faced with at the beginning of the film, and that terrified her. Maybe at that moment, she realized how and why he was able to do what he did, as Lawrence's character professes that if he dies, she dies. In the end, Pratt's character, to me, redeemed himself. He found additional capability under a higher security access level of the Auto Doc that would allow someone to be put back to sleep; but since there was only one Auto Doc, only one of them could go back to sleep. The other, as in the beginning of the film, would be forced to live the rest of their life alone on the ship. If he hadn't learned his lesson, he could have hid this from Lawrence's character again, but instead he chooses to share it with her, and offers it to her to allow her the opportunity to live the life she wanted in recompense for waking her to fulfill his needs knowing that he would be alone again with only memories of her. He does a complete 180, and instead of doing the selfish thing, he does the honorable thing; and after this experience, I honestly think that if Lawrence's character did choose to go back to sleep, Pratt's character wouldn't have attempted to wake another passenger again. It is this sequence of events, I think, that allow Lawrence's character to forgive him and choose to spend her life on the ship with him. <br/><br/>All in all, I liked this movie a lot because it did make me ask what I would do in that situation, and really try to contemplate the fragile and emotional perspectives of both characters. What Pratt's character did was wrong, and what Lawrence's character experienced as a result of Pratt's action was wrong, but given the situation, which path would you take?"

","Well to start we have our male who is awakened. Mind you seeing the pod with the LAWRENCE lying in state should waken any one. There have been a few other tales out there with early waking of our heroes. The one that first comes to mind is the early sequences of ALIEN. Still hard to better those opening minutes considering how long ago that was.<br/><br/>This the usual tale of a sleeping journey to a colony and answered a question that I always have regarding space travel. Just how much damage can anything earth built take on such a journey when the smaller debris that is undoubtedly out there in some quantity is not charted and by its constant movement can hardly ever be. These things must surely collide and create further problems. an attempt to tell us how they might get protected was on display but in truth that idea looks like a no go in reality.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes within the bounds of future plausibility it all seems possible. Like a modern day liner at sea the unexpected can happen and here it did. The story that unfolded told us that the male wanted a mate and picked one that was desirable. Had Aurora been a transgender or Lesbian would another pod have to be opened. If our male had indeed been similar would there have been a need to open two pods one male and one to breed?.<br/><br/>Tale was for the most part normal dialogue drama with some minor excitement and humour but the ending cannot be really faulted for its life threatening moments and that the attempted sacrifice was reversible gives the audience a feel good ending. Well we cant have Jennifer being on her own for 88 years. Note that time spent in the hunger games came in handy. It must also noted that the moment where she assaulted out hero was a good piece of anger despair acting. I enjoyed this more so than Gravity and Arrival even though it had Amy Adams Jennifer played her part well. As per usual and not Bradley in sight unless he occupied one of the pods. My only problem was with the sudden increase of knowledge both acquired towards the end."

","There's just some movies out there that you die to find, it has amazing acting, a plot that's worth exploring as it actually has potential to be true to life and an amazing love story. <br/><br/>Perhaps I've watched to much ""Masters of Sex"" but i cannot get over the robot bartender. the concept is brilliant. Jennifer L. Is just gorgeous as always and my wife thought Chris was his usual amazingly handsome guy. <br/><br/>This show did it right with graphics, less is more. spend the money to make the scenes needing the wow factor and make up the rest with story. Passengers did this very well. <br/><br/>As for the current star status obviously a 7 out of 10 is great, but i think it deserves more. As a photographer i have to look at these movies more critically and they really did a great job pulling in the viewers to a romantic atmospsphere that personally stuck my wife and I to the couch the entire time in suspense. <br/><br/>Also another thingi have to give this movie props for is the previews. They were informative of what the movie was about, but not at all to revealing which made it all that much more pleasurable to learn subtle but very relevant details in the film.<br/><br/>Glad this movie was nominated for some awards this Oscar season as it means that it was generally conceived by most as a good flick."
"davispittman","10","1","2","12 March 2017"," Not at all the kind of film I expected
","When I first saw the first trailer for Passengers, I thought that there would be bad guys and an evil maniacal plot against the main characters, I thought it would be a sci-fi mystery thriller. But that is not at all what it is. Don't go into this film expecting all that, because you will be disappointed if you do, well you'll be disappointed if that's what you want. This ultimately is a tragic romance set in space with sci-fi elements. And given that that's what it is, the movie succeeds, it knows what it is and it plays along with that plot well. Pratt and Lawrence have good romantic on screen chemistry and the love scenes between them work well because you can clearly see the feelings they share. The visual effects are absolutely STUNNING! I really loved seeing the spectacular imagery, whether it was seeing out the windows into space, or seeing humongous stars as the starship passed by, it was all designed so well, and it deserves the two academy award nominations it received. If you know what this movie is and you embrace it for that, then I think you'll really enjoy it. I know I did. 10/10 for Passengers!"

"karlsaville","4","1","2","12 March 2017"," Lawrence gets her shirt off.
","Not being a Social Justice Brownshirt forced to run in screaming outrage from any film, play or book which contains a plot element I find knee-jerkingly offensive, I was perfectly able to settle in to enjoy Passenger's traditionally uninspiring tale of ""girl meets slightly rapey boy, jumps boys bones, falls out with boy, gets rescued by boy and lives with boy happily ever after"" in space.<br/><br/>Well, I say ""enjoy"", actually the plot is laughably thin and one- dimensional, the obviously thorny issue of the boy awakening the chick he has the hots for to her irredeemable doom is disappointingly briefly addressed and the otherwise bland fairy tale romance is tedious to say the least. It's a pity, actually, because the issues raised by the space- prisoner's dilemma of who, if anyone, to wake from the vessel's choice of thousands and condemn to his fate, either to stave off loneliness, start a family, or to help extricate himself from this sentence of a lifetime alone was an intriguing one, and could have made for a deeply interesting and thoughtful film. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the writers decided not to go that route. It's possible they toyed briefly with the notion of turning their work into a space-parody since the comedy robot bartender, played by Michael Sheen was by far the most human of the on-board characters, and certainly the fortuitous appearance and immediate demise of the token black dude is well within ironic boundaries.<br/><br/>I must admit that despite not really rating Jennifer Lawrence as an actress - given that her range of facial expressions only barely exceeds that of Noomi Rapace, who, as we can all tell, has had her musculi faciei surgically disconnected - I was really quite impressed by her emotive performance. She genuinely managed to look both upset and slightly worried on occasion. Well I was convinced.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, despite the lush, if somewhat scientifically unlikely, design of the ship and its on-board technologies I found the film simply boring. When it got to the (inevitable) point at which Jennifer Lawrence was forced to strip off due to the intense heat of the ship's exploding engines I couldn't help barking with laughter thinking of that brilliant moment in Galaxy Quest's Star Trek parody when Alan Rickman snidely comments to Tim Allen ""I see you managed to get your shirt off!""<br/><br/>So at that point I turned off Passengers and re-watched Galaxy Quest instead. I recommend you do the same. I give Passengers a 4 for ""pretty, but not worth finishing""."

","I didn't see the trailer of the movie up until writing this review. So I decided to look the movie based on reading the story line. So I didn't know it will turn into a semi-disaster movie.<br/><br/>The premise is very good. It's quite original and sets a stage for inquiries into ethics, relations, meaning of life, happiness and loneliness. Enveloped in science fiction combines good special effects and some really cool ideas (like the pool with a view to the stars).<br/><br/>I liked the choice of the leads. Especially the female lead, since she had to be sexy. Generally, a very good job of portraying the emotions.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, things started to take the wrong turn with the appearance of Laurence Fishburne's character. When philosophical questions were replaced by technical malfunctions that made little sense and that I just didn't care about. And questions of ethics and the perception of happiness were substituted by the usual hero type of actions that introduce stupidity and deteriorate the whole experience.<br/><br/>Eventually 'Passengers' stayed very shallow on its initial premise and didn't explore any of the vast number of interesting possibilities it could have been. Seems to be the usual case of Hollywood compromising good story for special effects to draw the audience. Considering the lead actors involved, its' quite a shame they needed that. When it comes to numbers, the studios may be right. But I fail to see it wins lots of hearts."

","It isn't for the first time, and will surely happen again, that one truly valuable film story stays shadowed in order to highlight profit-making blockbusters.<br/><br/>So, Passengers is a beautiful story about human life and its destiny. It is projected through the lens not compliant with the perceptions typical of so-called ""critics"". An enormous visual scenery is fully backed up with the acting abilities of just a few people. You will find everything you need to experience one meditation journey while watching this movie: A new life's beginning (unexpected just as it does happen), finding someone to be with, all the struggle to survive, and the final words.<br/><br/>I invite you to trust your feelings and your heart should be your best critic - and not only while watching Passengers.

","This movie is worth looking for the scenery, for the original story (It starts of simply as a journey through space but the twists in the story: you never see them coming) and for the main characters, especially Jennifer Lawrence, Laurence Fishburn and android bartender Michael Sheen convert real characters. The characters show how you can make an interesting movie about caring characters that with only few means can entertain you if you want to look at an original love story in a spacial futuristic setting."

","Three things about how I review...<br/><br/>1) I'm okay with fantasy. I'll be lenient on a movie if it lacks realism. After all, it is a movie.<br/><br/>2) I'm a sucker for romance.<br/><br/>3) Storyline, dialog, and editing are key for me. They are the backbone for any movie.<br/><br/>I'm not a hater. I'm not criticizing this movie, but I'm also not praising it either.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like this movie, because it has a lot of potential on the surface - Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence, Sci-Fi, and Romance.<br/><br/>But... I realize what it is... We weren't given enough to support the story line, and as much as I wanted Jennifer to deliver, her dialog and direction was just... off.<br/><br/>There were a few zingers that in some cases exposed her slight tendency to overact. This, is not entirely her fault. Directors are responsible for getting the actor to sell the scene, but in some instances, you can almost see where Jennifer is almost forcing her lines and emotions. I know she is capable of not doing this, as you can see in Silver Lining. The hard thing is that we don't see the directors directing in a scene. When you see what she has done in the past, versus in Passengers, you can tell the difference in how she was being directed.<br/><br/>I think this affected Chris as well. I'm one of his biggest fans, especially in Parks and Recreation. But, there are some subtle moments where he appears to have delivered a line multiple times (aka takes).<br/><br/>This definitely had all the right ingredients. It's just the cook (director), didn't make his best dish with what he had to work with."

","...and existential questions. The idea for this movie is really intriguing. You can't help but ask yourself ""what would you do in such a situation"". The end was quite horrible to watch, as it was absurdly cheesy: our main hero being the Hollywood hero- all Armageddon style, the unnecessary black guy, who's there to give them the magical key, die and be there just for racial diversity. But there are some really important messages here. First, it shows us a typical marriage, that on earth would end up in divorce, but in space you have no other choice. After Aurora realizes, that Jim is the one who woke her up, she yells at him how he ruined her life. That's not love and that just sounds like a typical divorce story, where one partner thinks he gave up his ambitions and dreams just to be stuck with one person for the rest of his life and feels like he can't change anything about it. It's actually beautiful how realistic this part of the story was. Also, in the end Aurora didn't finally realize, that she really loves Jim, she just realized, that she doesn't want to be alone! She's scared, like anybody else and would rather try to live some sort of compromised life with that person, than to be all alone. Sadly, the writers took it here in a different direction and went all birds and trees and sacrificing hero stories. This movie isn't as stupid and shallow as it seems. Also, there's the problem, that most of the people nowadays have- thinking that they will finally be happy when they reach some specific goal, but when they do it, they're still not happy. And also the universal saying about the green grass in other people's yards (other planets). Aurora is that kind of person. All ambition and no satisfaction. And on this ship she learned to just go along with what life gives to you and make the best of it. It would have been more interesting, if they woke up some more people. Maybe a doctor, with the hope that he could put them to hibernation or something. Or just some other playmates. So what would you do in Jim's situation? ;) I would probably try to meditate and then wake up about 5 people, start a space civilization and stuff :D"

","Although Passengers contain a few plot holes, the visuals, acting and especially the atmosphere (or lack thereof) made for a very sympathetic movie experience.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence's Aurora and Chris Pratt's Jim was strong so when the inevitable happened, the viewers could do nothing except to sympathize for the both of them. Using this idea, I was very hooked onto their relationship and the somewhat unconvincing plot.<br/><br/>Overall, Passengers is a film with good visuals and chemistry between the protagonists but offer little in the way of plot."
"gtylerpayne","9","1","2","2 March 2017"," Amazing production design that captivates the imagination
","Ill start out with the negative, because I can sort of understand why it didn't get great reviews. Critics tend to look more at story than anything else, followed by acting. I think this movie has a great story at it's core, but It's a simple story, and not terribly original. It also gets very cheesy cliché Hollywood toward the end. It's very predictable and there are really no surprises. That is a shame, because the movie really is amazing and it would be cool if it had a more creative story to match.<br/><br/>The pace starts slow, and stays slow throughout most of the movie. It feels very reminiscent of 2001: A Space Odyssey in many ways. If the story ventured into more creative territory instead of going for the cliché Hollywood ending, it would be very comparable to Kubrick's masterpiece in many ways.<br/><br/>While I like a lot about this movie, the thing that stood out the most to me is the production design. The spaceship is SOOO COOL looking. There is a lot of attention to detail and it all feels very realistic. For a lover of Sci-Fi like me, it really captivates my imagination and stuck with me. The ship has a very cool design and seems well thought through. We get to really explore every part of the ship and get to know it like its a character of the film. This alone makes this movie great in my opinion. <br/><br/>Next thing to applaud is the CGI. Everything looks so good, so clean, and very real to me. Visually, this film really nailed it in my opinion. The anti-gravity scenes are very cool and the space-suit scenes are very cool also. It's a film that can appeal to a person of any age for this reason. It doesn't really need to rely on an amazing story to be great because the concept and design of the ship is so fun to watch and explore. <br/><br/>The cinematography was very beautiful also. There are some very iconic looking shots and the camera work and lighting is wonderful, reminding me again of Stanley Kubrick's films. I will have to watch it again to comment on the sound design, film score, and editing, but I would say that all the technical work on this film seemed really great.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt is always fun to watch and full of charisma. A good portion of the film it is just him alone on the ship, so with a boring actor, it could be very painfully at times, but he keeps it fun and entertaining. I didn't really think that Pratt and Lawrence had all that much chemistry, but it works okay. Her character didn't seem very well developed, and I wasn't really sure if I even liked her character.<br/><br/>Overall, I really loved this movie, despite it's flaws. It's the type of film that I will want to own on Blu-ray and put on frequently just to admire the cool shots and concept of the film. I have been day-dreaming about this movie since I saw it, as it provokes other thoughts of space travel and the future. <br/><br/>If you love Sci-Fi, I would think that you will really love this movie."

It just doesn't deliver that intriguing and dark vibe that science fiction lovers such as myself really need. <br/><br/>Knowing this will not be watched only by die hard science fiction fans, it will probably entertain most people. The visuals are good (although a bit too polished for my personal taste) the acting is good enough and the story makes sense, there are no obvious plot holes or anything.

","In the end you would end up thinking this was a movie with simple story, but all the elements of storytelling come together so brilliantly in this movie that it leaves you spellbound. <br/><br/>I read some reviews wherein folks are bashing this movie for being a pseudo sci-fi movie, and I agree it is not that at all except that it takes place on a space ship. But its a love story at its core. If you want to watch a good romantic flick, go for it.<br/><br/>The beginning is a tad bit slow, but then it picks up pace and takes the audience on a journey which is dreamy yet real. Chris Pratt is stranded on a spaceship which is scheduled to land on a new world in 90 years, but he is somehow woken up due to some malfunction and faces a reality of dying before reaching the destination planet.<br/><br/>In his despair he decides to wake up Jenifer Lawrence, who is lovable as always, and the chemistry between the two of them is simply brilliant from the time these two meet. You see these two fall in love like in a fairytale but then there is the secret of Chris waking up Lawrence which threatens to break the bond these two have formed living alone on the spaceship.<br/><br/>In the end this movie leaves you with a message that You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are.<br/><br/>The soundtrack by Thomas Newman is dreamy, with some bits reminding you of Interstellar. The chemistry between Chris Pratt and Jenifer Lawrence is effortlessly natural. The screenplay does justice to the story nicely.<br/><br/>Jenifer Lawrence moves between all emotions with equal panache and Chris Pratt delivers in this romantic drama as well as he did in GotG.<br/><br/>Definitely an 8/10 for me."

","I have seen this movie cast and decided not to watch it, than a week later in boredom I watched the trailer, and confirmed that it is not good enough to spend 2 hours on. Another 2 weeks later I opened user ratings here on IMDb and saw 3 full pages of glittering reviews and I buckled. I should have listened to myself. It was not worth my time. I found myself hovering my mouse over the forward button deliberating fast forwarding in some barely digestible parts of this experience.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. I love sci-fi. Even mediocre sci-fi amuses me tremendously. But this was just a cheap melodrama in a sci-fi suit.<br/><br/>Interesting story premise, with some science in there. Toss it in an unimaginative future where society seems mostly like today and send someone a century into the future in the future to another planet leaving his life behind, and don't explore that crazy concept in the movie at all but focus on a melodramatic cheap love story with bad acting and you have The Passengers.<br/><br/>While effects and camera work are good acting is just bellow par. Especially by Jeniffer Lawrence. I'm sorry to any fans but she is just a bad actress. I never saw a good roll of hers. Yes, Hollywood had some good movies with bad actors but they were at least actors with strong or interesting character. She has absolutely no personality and seem that therefor she can't assume one either. I could for instance imagine Gwyneth Paltrow in her younger days just giving amazing performance in this roll, though.<br/><br/>But focus on the melodrama here, and having science and interesting story just like background stage is just bad choice and makes the whole movie pretty unbelievable and cringe worthy.<br/><br/>Toss in some melodramatic music over some scenes and you just might get sick of your pop-corn."

","Must be seen big screen - or at least a really big screen in your man cave. Great sci-fi and sets. More plot holes than Swiss cheese. People have pointed out the science nonsense, so I won't, but there is lots. Just suspend (everything) and enjoy. I read that Jennifer Lawrence made almost twice as much as Chris Pratt. She earned that percentage. When he sticks to action, like Jurassic World, it works. Here, he has to act and justify his emotional reactions... nope. Odd staring passes for acting I guess. To me he came off more as a stalker or just creepy than as a hero. It doesn't matter that his selfish choices turned out to be irrelevant in the end.<br/><br/>Plot: 5200 people on a 120 year suspended animation flight to colonize a new planet. Two wake up. They spent money on the CG and salaries. It could have been a 10 page short story. Still great fun to watch, but I had to keep shutting down synapses that objected to the implausibilities.

The sci-fi genre has taken a toll over the past few years and I had my reservations moving onto this one. If memory serves me right the last movie of this genre that had me glued to my seat was PROMETHEUS which is nearly half a decade ago. <br/><br/>Directed by Morten Tyldum (THE IMITATION GAME) and written by Jon Spaights (PROMETHEUS), for the more experienced viewer PASSENGERS already is a must see. If this doesn't sell it, then the following name drop may? Academy Award winner Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt (Jurassic World) concocts an amicable performance as the Avalon (aka large spaceship) carries 5000 passengers and is en- route to a new planet, Homestead II. Possibly because the earth became too crowded or entirely unlivable (I wouldn't know). A journey of some 120-ish years between them. The entire crew and passengers are in hibernation and is supposed to woken up automatically approximately 4a months before arrival at Homestead II. An unexpected disturbance in the flight path results a sleep-pod to malfunction and awakens Jim Preston (Chris Pratt) 90 years in advance. Now if this does not make you want to watch this, I am not too sure what else about this movie will.<br/><br/>All by your self, in an unknown environment where the only option for survival is falling back into sleep. This is the best part of the movie. PASSENGERS takes off so well and displays bizarre potential from the get-go. Every minutes of the CASTAWAY experience of Jim is intriguing and then it spirals. Everything else here on-down is a slow demise of beautifully introduced movie. <br/><br/>His heart unquestionably is in the right place as Spaights makes the effort to capture the essence of the plot in the script. Just like the Avalon, the plot is lost in an abyss. The plot explored too many avenues that the worthy acting and the above average CGI could not keep the seams stitched together (Should have stuck to one storyline). There is beauty at first, firing the right cylinders in our minds and then swiftly deviates from situation to situation leaving everything behind half baked and eventually losing its potential of being something major. <br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>Its good, it almost became great but it doesn't quite get there.<br/><br/>TITLE: PASSENGERS DIRECTED BY: MORTEN TYLDUM STARRING: JENNIFER LAWRENCE AND CHRIS PRATT RATED: PG13 RATING: 05/10 RUNTIME: 120 MINUTES"

When the real plot can be put into one sentence: ""During a 120 year journey to another planet a ship gets damaged by a meteorite and wakes up 1 unlucky guy because of a malfunction (who luckily is a mechanic) to repair the ship and prevent the destruction of the ship containing over 5000 people on board - the End."" Yeah well of course there is this romantic component with Jlaw and it is fun to watch, but I would have liked to know up in front that this movie is a romantic drama. A good one yes, but still why create false hopes with the trailer? And you burn Andy Garcia for 5 seconds screen time?? Is this a joke? There was so much more potential, and so much more interesting things that could've been told. But instead this movie wants to make us think about the questions: What is a good life? What is so important about other people? What happens if we are truly lonely? Would we make ourselves feel better, by destroying other peoples lives?

Male head artist is not so shiny but Lawrence is magnificent. Especially space defined beautifully and you want to be there. Film gives the idea that you are all alone in a border less space. Graphics is good, music is the soft side of the film. it can be much more atmospheric and maybe the rating is much more higher than now. the concept is genius although it is not emotionally deep enough. It is a fantastic creepy start, and while Lawrence and he undeniably possess the magic spark of screen chemistry, the basic creepiness of this cute extinguishes what the producers presumably are hoping is a warm fuzzy glow of sparky interaction. Stalking tactics bolstering romantic comedies are by no means new, and over the decades, Producers have proved adept at somehow planing down world nastiness, but here it's gruesomely inescapable."

"anysuggestionsblog","7","1","2","10 February 2017"," Passengers - A Re-imagined Sleeping Beauty
","This film was certainly different to anything I'd ever seen before. Set in space - brilliant. Good looking guy doing some heavy lifting - why not. Beautiful girl lying down, unmoving - isn't that how we all like our women? A threat to thousands of unsuspecting, very unhelpful people - if you don't have that, do you even have a movie? As you can see all very unique and completely new aspects of film-making, really pushing the film industry in a new direction. Opening minds. Broadening horizons.<br/><br/>You may have heard of some of our main mans films, Bride Wars, Jennifer's Body, Five-Year Engagement, and his most famous part to date, a little television series, that I believe picked up quite a following, known simply as Parks and Recreation. Christ Pratt may seem a like a foreign name to you now, but mark my words young children, this man could be something, if only some movie director would give him a chance, in say a Marvel superhero movie. But hey, that's just my uneducated opinion.<br/><br/>The unmoving girl referred to earlier, is played by that chick who, I want to say, was in that movie where everyone had to kill each other? The one with all the weapons. You know which one I'm talking about. It was directed by Quentin Tarentino? No? Then she was definitely in that film with the guy who was in The Godfather and that other guy who was in those stupid Hangover movies. (Speaking of the Hangover movies, if you haven't seen Obama on Between Two Ferns pop onto The Youtube and educate yourself.) You know the one I'm talking about. He's always in all those Jennifer Lawrence films. Argh, for the life of me, I just can't seem to think of her name.<br/><br/>Moving right along then. I'm surprised more people haven't caught on that Passengers is basically a re-imagined Sleeping Beauty. Aurora (Lawrence) is woken up by Jim (Pratt), and they are hurtling through space at horrific speeds upon the spaceship, Avalon, a name for a Disney kingdom if ever I heard one, and a kingdom they sure do make. The catalyst that sends them on their journey to save the entire unsuspecting, still sleeping, inhabitants of the ship should've been named Maleficent. Even though it's portrayal of the evil fairy wasn't nearly as good as Angelina Jolie's, at least it gave it the good old college try.<br/><br/>The character development throughout the film was a bit so-so, even though the whole time Pratt and Lawrence's characters were playing out their love story I couldn't help thinking; 'But he's with Anna Farris! That makes him unqualified to be with her.' (See what I did there? Do you see it?)<br/><br/>You do however, get to see the motive behind their reasoning for being on the ship, and the film does introduce some interesting prospects of the future for the human race. And even though the differences and struggles between classes is played in a humorous light, it does however, suggest that perhaps we, as a species, will always struggle with class hierarchy and the implications that money brings into the conversation of class structure and entitlements. Or perhaps, like a high-school English teacher, I'm reading too much into it and the references to differences in class is simply to make it more relatable to the intended audience.<br/><br/>The supporting acts were played brilliantly, especially the robot barman, Arthur, whose brilliant conversation drove the film when it could very easily have been quite boring. The question left to ask is: where do I get myself one of those?<br/><br/>The film was throwing the popcorn in the general direction of your mouth and missing good. The suspense really had you on the edge of your seat, and the love story and following conflict between such a small central cast was displayed brilliantly and certainly showed off each actors ability to lie to large audiences. And don't even get me started on the cinematography. It was vastly, brilliantly and universally wonderful. Pun most definitely intended."
"pjonline66","5","1","2","7 February 2017"," Passengers
","As I have probably mentioned on this blog previously I am always sceptical of a new release that has been marketed very heavily in the media. Heavy marketing campaigns can create an audience for a title that does not have a clear target market when produced. Such campaigns can also be used to cover up inevitable critical disdain towards the title. As I had found myself bombarded with Passengers posters and adverts throughout London tube stations and bus stops I assumed the latter was soon to unfold when I sat down in the cinema last week. <br/><br/>Admittedly Passengers is a marketers dream as it stars Chris (he's so hot right now) Pratt & Jennifer (she's so hot right now) Lawrence. They are both playing characters stranded aboard the ""Avalon""; a space ship travelling to a new world that the human race intend to colonise. Something goes wrong aboard the ship and both stars are woken up from their hyper sleep 100 years too early. <br/><br/>The title starts out promisingly as we first follow Chris Pratt's character Jim Preston; an engineer who wakes from hyper sleep over a year before Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora. The first half of the title is more or less a one-man show as we follow Jim wandering the ship alone struggling to survive. This first act of the film manages to hit the highs of other sci-fi isolation titles such as I Am Legend & Moon. I was beginning to think my initial impressions of the title were going to be proved wrong. This first act is a funny, heart-warming and heart-breaking depiction of how a man would react in such a situation and Chris Pratt wonderfully encapsulates all of the emotions an individual would go through. <br/><br/>Unfortunately this film begins to descend into mediocrity as soon as Jennifer Lawrence enters the scene. This is not the strong, independent woman that she has become know for in Silver Linings Playbook or even the Hunger Games. Her character Aurora is supposedly and journalist back on earth but her profession does not have any bearing on the way she behaves. What is most damaging is that her character is integral to the 'twist' of the movie but due to her nondescript and undeveloped motives the entire concept of this title simply doesn't work. Admittedly this is a fault of the writer not the actress herself but I was left very disappointed that they were unable to utilise the talents of one of the most sought after actresses in the industry.<br/><br/>This is certainly not the disaster I was expecting when I walked into the cinema and it does have its merits. It does enough to satisfy but ultimately falls short of leaving a lasting impression. Having seen this title I have come to the conclusion that it was heavily marketed as a 'safe' box office hit based on the star power it boasted. Maybe I need to stop being such a smart arse and try to watch films without judging them based on the way they are marketed.....<br/><br/>see more here:<br/><br/>http://thereeltruth1.blogspot.co.uk/"

This part of the movie I liked best. Thats the dilemma part.<br/><br/>Romantic part - he meets she, and how this evoles when no other options in horizon.

"alfiemachin","6","1","2","28 January 2017"," Enjoyable yet not too special.
","Passengers is a sci-fi film about two passengers who wake up from hibernation 90 years early. The film includes large fractions of romance and action due to malfunctions aboard the ship. Chris Pratt who plays an engineer from his previous life on Earth begins the film with a great feeling of fearing being stranded that was very shocking through his tremendous acting on how he starts to lose grip of humanity. It gave a slight similarity to the film Castaway starring Tom Hanks which i thought was great. Jennifer Lawrence later appears as a higher class passenger and creates great acting chemistry with Chris Pratt. I would certainly like to see these two in another film. <br/><br/>This film did have a fair share negativity to it such as lacking originality as it felt like a big mash up of films we've seen in the past. Some scenes seemed a little unrealistic particularly to do with the romance side yet this didn't effect the main plot in the film. Michael Sheen who played a robotic bartender was my favorite addition to this movie as he lifted humor into scenes that were becoming very dark and depressing and generally seemed to fill gaps in this movie. To conclude this i would say passengers was an enjoyable film to watch once but not again and didn't show anything ridiculously amazing."

The ending, although good, was nothing too special, parts we had definitely seen before in other films, but the overall ending was satisfying.

","When my teen daughter asked me to go watch this flick i agreed on therms that it wasn't going to be a love story which is for me the kind of thing I don't want to see. Have seen the trailer it looked okay so I gave it a try.<br/><br/>And in the beginning I did like it a lot, pure sci-fi which I thought was okay. But I was afraid once Jennifer Lawrence (Aurora) would come into this pure sci-fi it would quickly turn into a love story, which finally did. But did it bother me, not at all, because there were jokes mixed into the story which made me forget about the love between Aurora and Jim (Chris Pratt). And of course I did know that the bartender Arthur (Michael Sheen) did have a naughty side. <br/><br/>Luckily the love came on the second side because the space ship needed to be rescued. Naturally this kind of flicks don't have blood or real action going on but there are a few moments that makes you want to see what will happen. <br/><br/>On part of the effects used they are really stunning. The gravitation being removed in the spaceship does things with aurora in a swimming pool and that is really a must see. So having extreme good effects, a bit of jokes here and there and a good story made it all watchable even for an old fart as me. <br/><br/>I hated 'The 5th Wave (2016)' for so man reasons but Passengers, well, I did like it. <br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 5/5 Story 3/5 Comedy 0,5/5"

The latter part of the film is about a different problem faced by the protagonists, and is more blockbuster-like and less interesting. It's not bad, it's still a good movie, but it feels like the cop out on a cool idea (the moral dilemma) because they feel obliged to have lots of action and peril.<br/><br/>I liked the setting and the scenario, and I would not feel bad recommending this movie as a light scifi-watch, but in it there's a much more interesting movie in the moral dilemma."
"Turfseer","5","3","12","25 December 2016"," Clever sci-fi horror premise devolves into weak ""love conquers all"" denouement
","Do you remember how they said the Titanic was unsinkable? That its water tight compartments would never give way, even if the ship hit an iceberg? The same kind of hubris is cleverly worked into the plot of Morten Tyldum's new sci-fi horror show, Passengers. We're 30 years into the 120 year journey of the Starship Avalon, where over 5,000 passengers are in suspended animation, sleeping in hibernation pods, headed for colonization on the distant planet, Homestead II. And just like the Titanic, it's posited that the sleek Avalon is impenetrable, that nothing can go wrong with the pods, with none of its passengers waking up early and trapped on the giant ship, doomed to grow old before arriving at the scheduled destination light years away.<br/><br/>But indeed that's exactly what happens to Jim (Chris Pratt), when his pod malfunctions during some kind of massive intergalactic electrical storm that the Avalon is passing through. The extremely clever Twilight-Zone like premise is downright spooky, and we end up riveted as we watch Jim soon discover the terrible predicament he's in.<br/><br/>It begins with an automated greetings message Jim watches as his pod opens and he slowly regains the use of his muscles. The message presumes that everyone on the ship has woken up and passengers and crew are now only four months away from the target planet. But as Jim roams the cavernous ship, he realizes no one is awake and he's all alone.<br/><br/>Soon Jim discovers that he does have a companion in the form of an android bartender named Arthur who becomes a friend of sorts. Jim explores all that the ship has to offer but can't even get a meal with all the trimmings since he's not a ""gold star"" passenger. As a mechanic in his former life on earth, Jim attempts to get his hibernation pod to work again, but to no avail. He's also locked out from the pilot's room and can't wake anyone up to reprogram the ship's computers and head back to earth.<br/><br/>Jim attempts to divert himself by working out in the gym and dancing with a pair of holographic projections but after a year he's thinking of killing himself as he's now dying of loneliness. At this point, Jim becomes obsessed with Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), an aspiring writer hibernating in one of the pods, and after some tortured deliberation, decides to wake her up.<br/><br/>Oddly enough, a coterie of film critics on the internet view Jim's actions as sexist; others go further by arguing that he ""murdered"" her. It's all nonsense since Jim's decision adds to the very cool Twilight Zone-like atmosphere of the story. In addition, while his actions can be construed as wholly selfish, anyone in his position would probably have done the same (after all, who wants to live the rest of their life on a spaceship with no one to talk to?). <br/><br/>The story moves forward as Aurora is led to believe that she too woke up due to a malfunctioning hibernation pod. Leave it to Arthur who spills the beans that indeed it was Jim who intentionally woke her up. Aurora is now so mad at Jim that she almost kills him with a hammer. <br/><br/>At this point I'm wondering where the story is going and suddenly the plot moves in a new, welcome direction. A third character, Gus--a chief deck officer--wakes up from another pod malfunction. He only has a short time to live as his internal organs were compromised when he woke up early. Gus lives long enough to explain to Jim that the ship's systems are failing and gives them his ID code for access to critical parts of the ship. <br/><br/>With a nod to the film ""Gravity,"" Jim is thrust out into space after repairing a damaged fusion reactor and Aurora saves him by donning a spacesuit and going outside the ship and rescuing him after he loses consciousness. Once it becomes apparent that Jim was willing to sacrifice his own life to save the rest of the crew and passengers, Aurora realizes he's really a good guy after all and forgives him for waking her up.<br/><br/>Now here's where the story goes all wrong. It's only a short coda at the end--but it's deemed that Jim and Aurora live out their days on the ship, finding contentment in their love for one another. When the passengers and crew finally awake, they find vegetation growing everywhere and also discover Aurora's journal, explaining how she decided to grow old with Jim, despite having the opportunity to go back into hibernation through the ship's only first aid pod.<br/><br/>It's a fanciful idea that ignores the reality of the story's powerful premise--that the two passengers are still trapped and doomed for all eternity in a place they can never escape from.<br/><br/>The ending is a failure because it jettisons the horror component of the story for a far-fetched ""love conquers all"" scenario. A much better ending would have reduced the time of the ship's journey from 120 years to say 70 years. The denouement would need no additional dialogue with a montage inserted instead, chronicling how the couple eventually settled into a dull routine after the initial rekindling of their romance. By the time the passengers and crew awake, they find Jim and Aurora still alive but withered and old in separate rooms, suggesting that the thrill of life has left them after being trapped on the spaceship for so long."

","What a year 2016 was for cinema and particularly fans of Sci-Fi and not for the better! Indeed, Passengers was just the last in line of a list of proclaimed sci-fi films which were nothing of the sort.<br/><br/>You see, Passengers is not a sci-fi film, it is a romantic comedy set on a spaceship. If that doesn't make sense, consider this: does a film about relationships along with some comedy necessarily make a romantic comedy? I think not. Romantic Comedy is a well defined genre along the lines of boy meets girl, love at first sight, boy does stupid, breakup, both suffer, boy does grandstanding, get her back, live happily ever after.<br/><br/>That's Passengers. Literally.<br/><br/>What do you put in a review about a sci-fi film which is really a romantic comedy? I am not sure, do you judge it as a romantic comedy? As a sci-fi? Passengers is not alone in this regard, Hollywood seems to recently believe that genre-bending sci-fi is some great idea. Perhaps they think that they can drop clues to both Mr. and Mrs. in the trailers and get both to go to the cinema instead of just one of them. If so, it doesn't work when you make a trailer which signals sci-fi but is really rom-com. That old salesman tactic is called Bait and Switch and we don't like it.<br/><br/>It looks good. First 10-15 minutes is OK. That's it. Why I gave 4 stars as it is not completely boring. Actually I take it back, I give it 3 stars, because Jennifer Lawrence (who got paid twice co-lead) has a horrible vocal fry and that is just awful, vocal fry is awful, girls better to go with Valley Speak if you want an annoying way of speaking.<br/><br/>In addition the violent attack Jlaw does on Pratt, including punches to the face is just unacceptable. In addition, if you wanted to make a smart movie perhaps let JLaw wake up and be faced with the difficult question Pratt has in this movie. Instead we get boy bad, girl good.<br/><br/>Hollywood seemingly for profit ideas or feminist ideology seems to want to ruin Sci-Fi. Don't let them. Don't watch this movie."

","From the first few moments of the movie Passengers, make sure to fasten your seat belt as this will seem like a journey into the future you'll love to take.<br/><br/>What's appealing about Morten Tyldum latest outerspace drama, besides the bona fide original story, is the huge practical sets. These are real sets with 8 miles of LED lighting built into the ship and not some green screen work. You can sense the aim of the director being achieved through the performances of the actors and their interaction with the world surrounding them.<br/><br/>Now for those who're going into theater hoping for an extended look at how the future of space travel will be, Passengers will unfortunately have few answers. The movie is based on an idea which is actually feasible from a scientific perspective, but one thing you should keep in mind while watching the dramatic adventure Sci-Fi is that it's a Starshipboard Romance. There is more concentration on Pratt and Lawrence's characters experiencing emotions of desperation, solitude, love, and hope.<br/><br/>Passenger's script was one of the major flaws which didn't much help both actors. There were reports that its story was still being edited as late as last couple of months, so perhaps its release should have been postponed. For it is a good film that could have been better with more attention to its science. But like Aurora Lane, I suppose, we should settle for what fate provides us.<br/><br/>7/10."

","This is not a great movie. This is even not ""One to watch"", but this movie is an enjoyable way to spend a couple of hours on a Saturday night.<br/><br/>The movie start with a death sentence. Computer error wakes Jim up 30 years into a 120 year hibernation and condemns him to die before reaching his destination. A year later, he has explored the whole ship and tried everything to get himself back into hibernation and reach his new home. Then he sees Aurora and falls in love with her after researching her life and watching her personal videos. After much debate he finally falls victim to his loneliness and wakes her up in the need for human contact and the love he has developed.<br/><br/>The accusations of date rape are absurd. Aurora falls in love with Jim. She makes a conscious choice for this. She doesn't sleep with him or fall in love with him through pity, or fear, she does so through personal choice. I want to make this clear and also to make the point that most of the junk being thrown at this movie is because Jim woke up first. If it was Aurora who had woke up Jim then the movie would probably have won 17 Oscars and been held as a rallying cry for women in Space!<br/><br/>The movie has a lot going for it. The characters are deep, well meaning and best of all, flawed. Jim has a lot of difficulties being alone and Aurora has intimacy issues illustrated by her videos from her old friends. Humans are not perfect and neither of the protagonists are painted as such. The physics are just the right side of believable (even using the gravity of a star to create kinetic energy) and although this is just a love story, there is more about it than a standard Hollywood movie.<br/><br/>The ending is written to give the viewer the idea of just how much can be achieved in a lifetime. The logistics of this are arguable, but as this is set in an unknown time in the future, how can you disagree?<br/><br/>All in all, a well spent couple of hours dreaming of Space."

Which is pretty much was.<br/><br/>People stuck on a space ship, and things go wrong. Ooooooo watch out Isaac Asimov, you are about to be outshone.

OHI BUT Wait, there's stars and its kinda romantic *spits*. This movie was like a space age version of Cloverfield Lane, except John Goodman's character was not trying to manipulate a female into making it with him. As far as we know.<br/><br/>The Passengers predictability, coupled with cheaply placed star roles and the allusions to elitists plans to escape our dying world for another place to trash was a ceaseless thorn. Any other genre, and this movie would have been a sexual, racey thriller with deviant overtones. <br/><br/>For those of you whom were paying attention, the stupidest thing was the fact that the main character was a full fledged engineer able to rig a device to put his preyed upon female companion back into stasis, yet he could not construct another console with the multitudes of spare parts he constantly stated were present aboard ship. He could have gone back into stasis too. He could have brushed up on so many fields of science and learned how to rig any number of tools to suit his needs. BUt there's a reason the actor playing him has the last name of Pratt( cue UK English speakers recognition of this word). Stream it if you must.

","Having seen him in a few films as well as the TV series ""Parks and Recreation"" it's obvious to me that Chris Pratt is the ""new Clark Gable"". He has drop dead good looks, reasonably good acting skills, and can do comedy, drama, and action equally well. We really haven't had anyone with this combination at this level, and it's good to see.<br/><br/>That being said, the current film certainly isn't a test of Pratt's skills, through no fault of his own. The script has few surprises and nothing really to recommend itself. Pratt and Lawrence do the requisite friends -> lovers scenes, but the film tends to be a little boring. That's peculiar because the film's director did ""The Imitation Game"" (2014) and made a film about discovering computers exciting. The screenwriter, Jon Spaihts, penned the ultra boring ""Promotheus"" (2012), so perhaps the blame goes to him.<br/><br/>Wait for it on video. It's OK but hardly worth the price of a ticket nowadays"
"szweda-18555","3","1","3","17 April 2019"," Glossy Twaddle
","Chris Pratt is always watchable but I can't think of him without thinking of Parks and Rec. What is Andy doing in space? Where are April and Ron? This movie just about gets by without them but the supporting cast is pretty, pretty slight that is, just two and a half really. In fact the ""half"" is half the fun...
Maybe the best way to engage with this film is to not think too hard and just play a game of spotting the movie allusions like The Shining and Silent Running maybe TV too like Red Dwarf.
Hate to think how they expected us to swallow the plot such as it is tho. In fact Andy sorry, Jim, is the monster stalking the lonely corridors of a deluxe space ark with his steerage class wristband. No wonder he feels aggrieved and yearns for a friend. He finds one but he is just another serving appliance, a glorified drinks machine...
Maybe he is not a monster. After all what would any of us do in this extremely unlikely situation of having the pick of your next mate? Why, we would pick the cutest we could find of course... On a tangential thought, what would we make of this plot were the roles swopped, Lawrence the first passenger to be woken up...?
Anyway, there was enough here to suggest it for a rainy Sunday afternoon but while it entertains it also irritates hence my low score. It was too long too. And why the title? Kind of simplistic and unhelpful... Iggy Pop's song is not heard in this movie so don't worry. Whether you liked the ending is down to you but I thought it was a bit inevitable and flat... it could only ever end in tears so think twice when you sign up for that ""colony world"" exit from manky Planet Earth!"

","When I saw ""Passengers"" for a lark, two things occurred to me. The special effects inside and outside of the spaceship look amazing, such as the interiors of the shape-ship, the internal machinery, the robots equipped with artificial intelligence, and the breathtaking pictures of space. The film also has two good-looking and likeable actors: Chris Pratt as Jim Prentice and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora. It even has Laurence Fishburne to bring some gravitas and show up just in time to explain what is wrong with the spaceship.<br/><br/>As the film developed, however, I kept asking myself, ""Where is the story?"" $150 million was spent to create a whole new world and pay the salaries of some highly talented actors. Yet more than an hour into the movie, I developed this sinking feeling that there was not going to be any story beyond the dull plot formula used in rom-com movies. The formula (for those unfamiliar with romantic comedies) is boy meets girl, boy develops a hot and heavy romance with girl, boy almost loses girl over a secret, and boy gets back with girl by doing something heroic. That's basically the plot of this movie dressed up with some colourful special effects.<br/><br/>The frustrating thing about ""Passengers"" is that film director Morten Tyldum and screenwriter Jon Spaihts did not try to make a film that could been superior to a run-of-the-mill rom com formula. They had the resources to make a great film: $100+ million. They also had great actors: Academy-awarding winner Jennifer Lawrence, Laurence Fishburne (who delivered a brilliant performance in Boyz n' the Hood), and Chris Pratt. Yet this winning combination did not produce a winning movie, because no effort was made the develop a good screenplay to make the most of these actors' talents and the great special effects."

","The star-ship Avalon has a crew of two hundred and fifty eight along with five thousand passengers; all of them asleep. They are thirty years into a hundred and twenty year journey to the colony world; Homestead II. Then something goes wrong; a meteor strikes the ship leading to a malfunction in one of the sleeping pods; passenger Jim Preston is awakened and finds himself on an empty ship. At first he thinks the journey is almost over then he learns the terrible truth; he will die of old age long before the Avalon reaches its destination. Inevitably the loneliness gets to him and he starts contemplating waking another passenger; eventually he wakes Aurora Lane but doesn't tell her that that he is responsible for putting her in that position. He is concerned what might happen if she were to find out; that isn't the only thing to worry about though.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this sci-fi drama; it started well as it introduced us to Jim and his situation. This wasn't rushed so the viewer can feel his growing desperation and be more sympathetic when he makes the morally questionably choice of waking Aurora. Similarly their growing relationship isn't too rushed. Towards the end the tension rises as it is far from clear if both of our protagonists will survive the growing technical threat. These two lead characters are believable and well-acted by Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence. I also enjoyed Michael Sheen's performance as the ship's android barman, a delightful nod to the bar in 'The Shining'. The ship's design is impressive and the special effects are superlative. Overall I'd definitely recommend this to fans of character led science fiction without aliens or antagonists."

They did a good job of it but a few extra minutes could have been well spent to create the feeling of loneliness first of just Jim and then both Jim and Aurora. I did feel the chemistry between Chris Pratt as Jim and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora was extremely convincing. Both actors put forth very convincing and enjoyable performances, not to mention an excellent however brief appearance by Laurence Fishburne. The tension was well played throughout the film both between the characters and with external events. However some of the emotion seemed to be cut short where I felt it needed to linger just a little longer in several scenes and series of scenes particularly later in the film. They also needed to spend just a little more time with the two of them at the end. It felt like they just ran out of time filming and had to end it right away.

This isn't because any one part of the film really stood out or because the story line is some sort of groundbreaking new idea that the world has ever seen, it's because, it's the first time in a very long time I not only don't seem to get sick of watching, but ever time im just browsing through my options of what to watch that night nearly every time I see passengers (if I don't watch it) I really find it hard not to pop it on, yet another time. Though nothing in this film could reinvent the wheel, everything is done right, the visuals and production are stunning, without over powering everything else. The story line, though not the greatest ever, does everything a good story line needs too, keeps you wanting more. All topped of with quality acting, not Oscar winning but really there's nothing to fault at all. <br/><br/>In summary 'Passengers' won't change your reality on film, in my opinion, is just one of those films I think everyone should watch at least once on a quiet Friday night snuggled on the sofa with some good company on hand.

"gavinp9","7","1","3","2 January 2018"," Not quite a sci-fi classic, but good fun
","'Passengers' is an interesting sci-fi film, in that it doesn't involve aliens in any way! It has more in common with 'WALL-E', than it does with 'Alien' or 'Event Horizon', as it follows the spaceship Avalon (cool helix design, basically a giant cruise ship) on its way to Homestead II, starting a new colony 120 years from Earth. It's approximately 30min of 'Cast Away' (man trapped alone), 45min of love story and then 40min of 'Deepwater Horizon' (survival film)! No time period is given, but I assume it's ~100 years in the future.<br/><br/>What works well is the casting - two boring people could not sustain this film, but by casting Hollywood's two best & brightest, it works wonders. Jim (Pratt) is accidentally awoken from his hibernation 90 years early and tries everything to get back to sleep and/or find a solution. Because he's a passenger and not crew, his options are limited. Eventually, Jim wakes up Aurora (Lawrence), which is handled well, and the two of them falling in love is as interesting as the shots of the galaxy outside the windows. Arthur (Sheen) as the android bartender is also a nice touch. The only other person to get some screen time near the end is Gus (Fishburne), who finally figures out what's wrong and kick-starts the final stanza.<br/><br/>It's not hard to watch when you have Jennifer Lawrence is a pool - but as well as being extremely attractive, it helps that both her and Pratt are very charismatic and able to carry out the tender moments and the exciting ones. The shots of the ship in motion and the galaxy in the background are fantastic, and while a bit of it is predictable, it's a decent ride. Solid ending too."
"Dannyboi94","8","1","3","16 October 2017"," Highly underrated
","When I first seen the reviews of Passengers I held off watching it until it came out on DVD, and after I finished watching it, I was very surprised at the bad reviews. This is not a bad movie, but also not a great one either.<br/><br/>The movie starts off very, very well with some absolutely spectacular set pieces, visuals and sound. I haven't seen set pieces this good since the Empire Strikes Back. They truly are a work of art. In the opening we are introduced to Chris Pratt's character, Jim. And in this first act of the film, Chris gives without question his best acting ever. Not only because of how good he is here, but how he breaks out of his usual typecasting funny, clumsy loon, who makes a fool of himself, here he is an isolated mess, with a very Jesus like look. This in my opinion was the best part of this movie, as it deals with what we all fear most, being alone. <br/><br/>The second act changes from a drama to a romance movie, when Jennifer Lawrence's character Aurora is introduced. I really believed Jennifer in this role, her character was well thought out and I wanted to know more about her background. The chemistry between Chris and Jennifer was flawless, they truly worked well on screen, which I was glad for. If not this movie would have fell flat on its face. This is however, where the movie slows down a lot, and may turn a lot of people off. It gets bogged down in very corny romance, and I must say, very steamy sex scenes for the rating it has. It's not a bad section of the movie, but I really did think it got very slow and predictable.<br/><br/>The third act changes into a thriller, and is handled very well. While I'm no science expert, I think some of the space scenes were a little far fetched and during this section we are introduced to Laurence Fishburne's character, who was pretty much just there, he doesn't do much at all and his underdeveloped character didn't have anything interesting to do at all. <br/><br/>Passengers is a very underrated movie, and it irritated me greatly about its reviews, even more so when the piece of trash Ghostbusters 2016 got more positive reactions by idiotic critics. <br/><br/>This movie won't be for everyone, some will hate the slow paced romance, but if you like that, this movie will please you.<br/><br/>8.3/10"
"marbl-1","3","1","3","26 September 2017"," In space, your rope is never long enough.
","*A one big spoiler, although it is not easy to spoil something like this film. The work is already done. If you are older than 7 and/or your IQ>70, do not watch or you'll suffer greatly. There is no S in that movie, just F. Unless S stands for ""stupid"", not ""science"" anymore, which is quite possible, seeing the last 10 years in SF genre. I rated it ""3"", it is a real rating, not a lowered one to bring a balance. <br/><br/>A spaceship is sent for a 120-years long journey, with no human supervision. There are backup systems for everything, but cannot be used: no awake humans on board to make repairs. There is a 300-persons crew, but hibernated, doing nothing during all the flight (what are they for?). The empty ship is well lit, all the monitors are on, the temperature and atmosphere are controlled. Just in case, somebody can always drop in. A meteor hit causes a very strange malfunction which makes a man wake up (we can compare it to the Titanic hitting an iceberg which causes turning on one of passengers' radio. Possible, but surprising). <br/><br/>It turns out a ""Help"" function in a spaceship's OS is designed by a MicroSoft employee, so the passenger learns nothing useful. He tries to contact the tech support, but that, in turn, is as easy as contact with Adobe's tech support. He travels in economy class, so he gets only a junk food (millions watts of energy can be thrown into the mud every second - heating, light, computers etc., the space journey itself must cost millions for one person, but a decent coffee (worth a quarter) can not be spent). When you travel one way 100 years to build a colony, the money from the home land has absolutely no sense, only a real value counts (imagine Robinson Crusoe on his island with a box of dollars). But Jim is charged for a call to Earth (with payment in several centuries). <br/><br/>When our anti-hero starts to be bored, he decides to take somebody down with him. Because why not? Does he wake up somebody who can help him? No. He chooses carefully somebody he can... well, you know what. A blonde chick. She must be stupid enough to believe him, so he goes for a journalist. Bingo. The girl wants to go and see the first year of colonization and than go back to Earth. How? She forgot it was not possible to get hibernated again, so her return was not possible. Nobody told her? Moreover, how did she intend to go back? On foot? I don't think they were going to let her take the gigantic colonization spaceship back to Earth, they probably were going to use it to build a colony. So, our cruel, selfish hero sees he has chosen right. They plant a tree in hall. Why? How? The seed? The dirt? Watering? Fertilization? <br/><br/>Then, the malfunction grows. Some pots fall down from the ceiling. Another man awakes, pure coincidence that he is a member of ship's crew. So he tells how to repair the ship and dies. He knows he cannot live, nor wake up another crewman who can repair the ship, because it would break a harmony of our love-birds (or rather a horny deviant and his brainless victim). A gravity fails. Newton's laws fail (e.g. swimming in a water bubble, a sudden stop of spaceship's spinning after power failure). Everything fails. But they survive passing very close to the star (the ship at 1/2 c would crash, hitting the particles emitted from the star, and/or the star's gravity would tear it to pieces), survive staring into opened reactor, etc. <br/><br/>And of course, there has to be a most funny moment with a rope. In space, your rope is never long enough. If you don't know the distance, cut a piece of rope and measure it. If it is 321 yards long, the distance is about 323, for sure. In every SF film lately there is a scene with too short a rope (From ""Gravity"" to ""The Martian""). People! If you ever go to space, prepare a rope that is 3 yards longer than you think it will be needed! <br/><br/>Bad acting (J. Lawrence was especially wooden, but both lead characters lacked any depth). Stupid screenplay. No scientific consultation. The SF movies can totally omit science and logic if they don't pretend to be serious, e.g. Star Wars. But if the movie tries to be deep, serious, SCIENCE-fiction, the screenplay shouldn't contain gigantic errors and gaps, too big for a 10-years schoolboy. Now I am waiting for a sequel: a girl gets old, so Jim - our hero - throws her to the reactor and wakes up a second girl. Why not? Or five of them."

It picks up in the second half and there are a few a moments where the film feels like its going somewhere, but it never really does. For the most part, it's flat. The suspense is limited to only a few scenes and there just isn't enough going on to maintain your interest until the end. 'Passengers' isn't a bad film, but it's a disappointing one, especially when you consider its potential."

At what do you know, for those of you heartless people who are still unmoved due to the questionable actions of our hero. Would you believe he gets to save the day with acts of incredible heroism. He saves the ship, he saves the lives of the crew and passengers. What a guy.<br/><br/>And would you believe at the end, what does he find ?. A hibernation pod, whatever so our heroine can go back into deep sleep and reawaken to achieve her dreams. Unfortunately there is only one so this presents our hero with the opportunity to atone for his actions. And there the film ends, but no, that's where you're wrong. True love triumphs in the end and she stays with him. This is so lovely, Who could fail to be moved."

","Oh dear, a sci-fi film my wife might enjoy. And that just about sums it up! <br/><br/>This is a 'heart warming' story about a man who selfishly selects and wakes up the prettiest hibernating female passenger on a 120 year journey to a space colony. Your response will differentiate on your gender type. If you are male then it will satisfy an adolescent daydream of being stranded on a desert island with a Sony PS12 and the most beautiful girl you've ever met. No competition from other males, Call of Duty 38 and endless appreciative sex. If you are female, and lean towards feminism, then this film will infuriate you. By waking her up he gives Lawrence's character to a life-sentence on a city-sized inter-stellar caravan rather than doing the honourable thing of drinking himself to death with the assistance of a compliant robot. Was there no access to virtualised 3D porn to fill the gaps between Tequila shots? My sympathies this time lie with the feminists.<br/><br/>A smarter man would have realised he could put Lawrence 'back under' then 'dipped in' again and again on different female pods (say every 18 months) until he was no longer able to perform or care. Each woman would get a guilt-free 18 months of illicit sex with Chris Pratt then re-hibernate to continue the journey with no one the wiser. <br/><br/>Now that's what I call a male and female fantasy!"

Admittedly there are many many great movies but this is the 1st movie in a long time that just sticks with me. A powerful romance with a heart wrenching decision made by Pratt's character. There are no villains to root against, just awful and extremely unfortunate circumstances. By the end of the movie you cant help but come to the conclusion that the life they lived (and all the lives they saved) was in fact their true destiny. Obviously Pratt's decision is unfortunate, but definitely understood due to his diminished mental capacity."

","This movie is very well put together. The premise has been panned by critics, unfairly in my opinion, because the movie does not dodge the issue. It's the central point of conflict that the movie builds around. Moving past that we have a sci-fi version of Sleeping Beauty, only this is a modern fairytale, so there's no guarantee we'll see a happy ending. The acting is solid, particularly by Jennifer Lawrence. And the film makes good use of the few actors that are part of the story. There aren't many extras in the film but that only helps build the sense of loneliness that is a central part of the story. The bartender character is very well done by Michael Sheen and not overplayed like his Tron character. The set is magnificent and CGI is well done. The only part I didn't like was the slightly overplayed sense of urgency the film tries to inject into the final moments leading up to the climax. It feels a bit too contrived and could have been overcome with better direction."

","If you are thinking about watching this movie there are at least two things you should keep in mind. <br/><br/>1) This is not an action movie. There is some action in it, but most of the movie is entirely devoid of suspense.<br/><br/>2) The thing that was advertised as a huge twist in the trailers turns out to not be much of a twist at all and is instead a pretty logical progression of the plot which you will no doubt predict before it happens.<br/><br/>(In other words: the trailer kind of sucked. Or maybe it was a great trailer, since studios seem to care more about getting your respective butt in their seats than having you actually enjoy their content)<br/><br/>In any case, I still found it very enjoyable. It wasn't the most inventive story ever, but it was a sweet tale about humanity's need for companionship with a robot (always a plus),some fun futuristic ship design, some action, some drama, some beautiful visuals of space and some enjoyably questionable gravitational shenanigans. <br/><br/>Jennifer Laurence is pretty great (as is the norm) and Chris Pratt's performance is good (I think), although it is kind of a different type of role from what he's known for being cast as (it's almost a bit strange seeing him this reserved).<br/><br/>The movie definitely exceeded my expectation, but keep in mind that I personally adore sci-fi and that I put a lot of weight on visuals."

Cris Prat woke up during a space travel where it was supposed sleeping for 90 years..and since it's the only one awake it's trying to survive in solitude. I don't want to spoiler too much let's say that this movie could be considered a romantic sci fi story with some action linked to the spaceship problems and in some cases it's reminded me a bit Dawson Creek series where the two fiancé arguing..that's the part i enjoyed less i have to say. The movie it's well directed and in some cases there are shots that reminded my the film Moon. Great vfx and a great and really believable cast if you consider that all the movie it's based on less than five actors.

The craft looks real inside and out. The ship design doesn't really make sense but the filmmakers don't bother explaining anything anyway. So this isn't really science fiction, it is just fiction which happens to occur in space.<br/><br/>As for spoilers, if you saw the trailer or the actors doing the rounds of the talk shows you knew that more than one person appears in this film. The protagonists, played by Pratt and Lawrence are on a ship with 5000 others heading to a distant planet. They are meant to hibernate for 120 odd years for the journey, but something goes wrong and they wake up. <br/><br/>What happens next is where the hint of originality evaporates from this film. Basically from the moment Lawrence appears on screen, you can predict almost every event that is to come. The only exception is the appearance of Laurence Fishburne, but oh dear the protagonists forget to ask him how to wake up the crew and are left on their own to deal with the ""drama"" in the most clichéd ways the scriptwriters could imagine. This is Hollywood at its most self indulgent, the manufactured drama being so predictable it is just boring. The final act is supposed to be suspenseful but we have seen this kind of paint by numbers cinema before.<br/><br/>So, if you are like the protagonists and have just spent 120 years in hibernation, this film will be a thrilling experience filled with exciting twists and suspenseful turns. For anybody with the desire to not have their intelligence insulted this is just another big budget low effort mountain of crap that you can avoid and miss out on nothing."

She acted well with what she had but I don't like the character. She literally was an empty shell. She was so supposed to be a writer, but had never written anything and didn't know what she wanted top write. She really had no personality and was this kind of bland foil that of course would just into the dashing protagonists arms. Try to imagine nicole kidman or sigourney weaver playing this character. I think they'd laugh at the offer. Basically there's no tit a tat or clash between the characters until the twist which kind of resolves itself within a span of minutes on film.

","I decided to give a shot to Passengers, due to its delicious trailer. The movie starts pretty well: 5 minutes that will leave stuck to the screen. Well done special effects and a feeling of 'suspense' in the air of what might happen next. I was constantly wondering when Jennifer was going to show up - and that was my first disappointment. Jim talking with his ""Robot-bartender-friend"" about the dilemma of waking her up or not. This really upset me. He just read a few things about the woman (and by the way, those things showed a girl with dreams, goals and purposes) and he ""decided"" that he was in love. I know, maybe this isn't what the author meant, but it was what I saw. It would have been better if Jim couldn't bear the pressure of being alone for so long and decided to wake up someone to help him out, instead of just looking at her face in a completely forced scene. The author could have picked a number of passengers and showed us their motivations to embark on a journey of hundreds of years to a completely different space and life. And for deeper reasons, Jim would chosen Aurora. It'd have been more interesting. The ending is a disaster. They decided to stay together and live that life to which they were basically forced. I finished this movie with a knot in my stomach when I saw the others passengers waking up and the Aurora's messenger. It broke my heart. Alternative ending? Maybe she could have go back to where she was taken from. They've could say goodbye with all those clichés that the author obviously likes and she could wake up 88 years later with a unique experience to tell to the other travelers. I feel like this movie was meant to talk about love, life and solitude. But it was so predictable and obvious all the time. The key-messages are given by the bartender: ''when one is drowning, has to take someone else with him"" and also ""you can't wait for what happens next. you have to live with what you have and make the most of it"". I got them, but one more time, this was barely showed in this movie. Positive words for the movie pictures and the actors. I'm not a fan of Jennifer but I have to admit that she and Chris Patt make an attractive couple. For me this movie is like a bad cooked chocolate cake. It had all the ingredients to be wonderful, but someone didn't know how to prepare it."
"gloriahur","6","1","3","5 February 2017"," Desolation in Space
","This movie is mostly focused on the emotional status of the two main characters. Although I expected the movie to have more sci-fi and action elements when I watched the trailer, the actual storyline of the movie was about how the loneliness of Jim lead to a tragedy for Aurora but eventually saved lives of thousands of people. The action that I expected was only shown in the middle part of the movie when there was no gravity for a moment. But the problem that caused it was less exciting than I thought, and the development of story after they solved the problem was too quick and couldn't make the movie dramatic until the end.<br/><br/>The only part about the movie that I found interesting was that Jim had to choose to wake Aurora up in order for him to live, even though he knew that it will destroy her life. The resemblance of the emptiness and the vastness of space and Jim's heart, and the nature of humans, longing to be with other humans, was clearly depicted through this kind of a situation, although I wish it could've been done more thoroughly to show the emotional status of both characters."

Thus, to accelerate or move those objects into the ship - for a reference outside the ship - will request much more energy! But inside the ship, you are not moving in relation to that ship. Thus, no more energy are need to you to move inside the ship! This, looks like a paradox into the Relativistic Theory for me!

","Passengers is a sci-fi romance starring Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as the two protagonists embarking on a ninety year journey across the universe,this movie is a self contained movie taking place entirely on the ship homestead and gives a unique story telling experience for the director to show the isolation of space travel if you were completely alone on an absolutely massive space ship,although i extremely enjoyed this film and i had a lot of entertainment watching it some things bothered me but ultimately didn't effect my overall enjoyment of the film and one of the best movies I've seen this year.<br/><br/>Characters Although there are only four prominent characters in this movie each character gets motivation,a unique personality and great character development that has a pay off and makes the viewer get invested in these great cast of characters,in my opinion a smaller cast allows for more development and gives more time to flesh out the characters as human beings and not just props,this type of self contained story telling is personally my favourite and investing me into the movie,the character personalities are portrayed fantastically by the lead roles of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence who are great actors,the chemistry between their characters through the movie expands and gives an organic and sweet romance that surprised me it mixed well into a sci-fi movie based around isolation.<br/><br/>Plot Seeing the trailers, i knew almost nothing about the plot and was fascinated to see the kind of ideas they would address having an entire space ship as their playground,the topic of isolation was the idea i wanted them to emphasize throughout the film and the utter loneliness you would experience completely isolated from everyone else,although they did show moments of loneliness during the film and were the highlights of the film in my opinion but saying that it doesn't emphasis the characters isolation in full which i would have liked to see and would have immersed my experience in this film by a whole lot having such a great actor that can fully pull this off. another aspect of this film that really confused me was the time span of this film and over how long a time it shows these characters lives on this ship,although it is explained in this film that the movie takes place over a long time span it does not show that time in the movie and really confused me during the viewing of this movie,in my personal opinion this aspect is not a big problem and will not take away from the overall experience.<br/><br/>This movie was a very unique experience for me and had a lot of fun watching this film,i would highly recommend this film to regular movie-goers and sci-fi lovers because it offers a very rich and unique twist on space travel and the idea of isolation in this massive ship along with a very organically played out chemistry between the two leads of this movie. 8 out of 10"

Anyway, ""Passengers"" was not a bad movie. I felt really bad for Chris Pratt & prayed Jennifer Lawrence wouldn't find out why she ""woke up"" ahead of schedule. You can't blame her for being furious! This was a good movie, though, and I only wish I had waited until it came to the cheap theater.

","The critics have been a tad underwhelmed by this space opera, but I liked it. It's a love story with a few echoes of 2013's GRAVITY, including seriously stunning CGI, but there is better chemistry between Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt than there was between Sandra Bullock and George Clooney.<br/><br/>There's not a lot of plot: Chris and Jennifer wake from hibernation 80 years earlier than they should do on their universe-crossing starship and then have to cope with mechanical problems that threaten the vessel's survival. The pace is a bit slow until things start to go wrong with the nuclear reactor and with Michael Sheen, an android barman whom I found more than a little tiresome. The 'epilogue' is cringe-making but kinda charming.<br/><br/>A part of me kept hoping for something out of the ALIEN franchise to bust in and liven things up, but no, this is just a slightly soppy story about a pair of galaxy-crossed lovers and – I'll say it again – I liked it."

","I read a lot of reviews before going to see this. I was pleasantly surprised. However it is not Science Fiction but Space Opera. I was caught out by the play for laughs but it did that well. It also dealt well with the moral issues faced and the acting, directing and photography were all good, but the whole 'willing suspension of disbelief' part was difficult. The treatment of hard SF - the time taken for a message to be received when travelling at relativistic speed - and fantasy - a spinning ship does not require artificial gravity - was haphazard, and the truly unbelievable part was that the whole enterprise was funded by a for profit corporation. No company would wait 250 years for a return on investment, there would be no point, and no way to enforce the contract. A more probable explanation for the system failures would be that it was intended never to make land fall and the whole thing was a scam. With all of the passengers singletons whose entire families would be gone by the time they woke up, no one would care if they never actually did. I am not going to go into how you really would do a colony ship, suffice to say that it was a pleasant way to spend a couple of hours, although If I had been in the chair the final scene would have involved the crew waking up not to find the ship changed, but a couple wrapped in each others arms in stasis in the auto doc pod."

","Loved this film, good old fashioned love story, set in a believable outer space setting created with wonderful special effects. Best part of script for me is the way, a modern young woman, played by Jennifer Lawrence (very good in the role, stole the show) realises, just how, important connecting with your newly found soul-mate is, for at the end of the day,that is all that really matters. Like a lot of young women these days,used to being in control and having and doing things their way with no compromise, the circumstance Aurora finds herself in puts all that is important, to all of us, into clear perspective. Chris Pratt is very believable and well cast as her love interest and protector and an engineer/mechanic ""good with his hands"". As the film states, two people who on earth would probably have never crossed paths, but love finds them anyway. Michael Sheen rounds out the cast, as the perfect ""english gentleman"" bartender and the perfect foil and confidant for both Lawrence and Pratt to bounce their inner most secrets, thoughts and feelings off. With enough suspenseful moments to keep the movie flowing at a balanced pace. May I suggest forget the film critics and go see it!"
"ashu-akshat","7","1","3","9 January 2017"," Good for a one time watch
","When you see Pratt and Lawrence name in a upcoming movie, you have to go and watch that movie. I was one of those people who did. Somehow I feel that Lawrence has the same voice modulation and reaction to similar set of situations which keep recycling after 'The Hunger Games Trilogy' and 'Silver Linings Playbook' where they were seen for the first time. I can link every reaction that she has to some point from the Hunger Games.<br/><br/>Anyway, this movie is a good watch unless you have preconceived notion of a meticulous plot free of obvious plot-holes. If you are going to the theater/movie hall to see Pratt and Lawrence, you will have a good time. This film has all the necessary ingredients for a good film and in 8 out of 10 cases won't be felt as money wasted.<br/><br/>The ending is what I felt was the weakest, just because one friend (more than 30 years back) that it's not necessary to be famous or remembered to count the life as well lived you don't have to let go of everything and live your entire life with one person and NOBODY around. Then one of the goofs mentioned in IMDb said and I quote<br/><br/>""It's hard to reconcile the following two aspects of the plot: a) Jim states authoritatively that there is no way to induce a hibernation - that there is no machinery in storage that could do it; b) Aurora has bought a round-trip ticket and planned to be placed in hibernation for the return trip. If a return trip was planned, then there must have been machines in storage capable of inducing hibernation""<br/><br/>Unquote.<br/><br/>Thus they could have both started their lives on a new planet with lots of people around. Overall a good watch with a light snack."
"jadepietro","8","1","3","7 January 2017"," Less Than Stellar
","(RATING: ☆☆☆☆ out of 5)<br/><br/>THIS FILM IS RECOMMENDED. <br/><br/>IN BRIEF: An entertaining but superficial love story set in space.<br/><br/>GRADE: B<br/><br/>SYNOPSIS: Two space travelers are accidentally awakened on their journey to the stars.<br/><br/>JIM'S REVIEW: Love is in the air (or possibly in the stratosphere) on an intergalactic mission to another world in Morten Tyldum's space romance fantasy, Passengers. Aboard the spaceship Avalon are our space travelers (and their other 498 passengers). Chris Pratt's Jim Preston is a mechanical engineer and also the space prince to his sleeping princess, Aurora Lane, a journalist played by Jennifer Lawrence. It does sound like a post-modern day Disney fairy tale, but that's about as far as it goes. <br/><br/>￼On a 120 year mission to colonize another planet and start life anew. Jim is unexpectedly awakened from his hibernation pod 90 years too soon and must now come to terms with his own survival and that of all of his fellow passengers. Trouble arises as the spaceship begins to malfunction and his need for companionship and assistance is handled by his waking female partner. Their attraction builds slowly but it is inevitable...and highly predictable as the film follows its basic boy-meet-girl-in-space formula. Besides, it's nice company having Mr. Pratt and Ms. Lawrence cast as the misfit lovers is a no-brainer, isn't it?<br/><br/>The lead actors have the prerequisite amount of charm and attractiveness to carry the film. They bring authenticity to the roles while also oozing the necessary sex appeal. It is their relationship that is the core of the movie and both actors share the right chemistry. The small cast also includes the scene-stealing Michael Sheen as their faithful bartender and sounding board, Arthur, and Laurence Fishburne as Gus, an officer from the crew.<br/><br/>￼The production design by Guy Hendrix Dyas and CGI effects by Erik Nordby and his talented artisans are quite impressive. Visually, the film is stunning, even if script-wise, it all seems like an outer space soap opera dressed to the nines. The screenplay by Jon Spaihts does try to stray from the conventional aspects of a love story, but doesn't always succeed due to a central moral dilemma set-up that complicates our lovers' relationship. That aspect never resolves itself clearly. Still, Mr. Tyldum keeps the action moving and the melodramatics at a minimum, that is, until the climactic third act when the plot and action become so far-fetched and strain credibility.<br/><br/>The film does carry some excess baggage in its desperate yearning to keep its romantic story-line afloat, and although Rodrigo Prieto's photography does have a graceful hypnotic fluidity with its rolling camera angles, Passengers is still a rather bumpy ride."

Miss Lawrence is insanely beautiful. Effects, music, sound, and video are well suited with film substance. The Bad: Laurence Fishburne is talented, but was not fit for this role, he simply did not blend well.

"ayoreinf","9","1","3","8 January 2017"," A perfect blend of Sci-Fi and romance
","Seeing this movie now is a great fit for me, a week after Rogue One, a movie I also liked, but I find its classification as Sci Fi to be mistaken, for the simple reason that science as is, doesn't really play a role in the story, it's just being used for gadgets and weapons for a story about Good v Evil about corrupting Power against the power of Hope.<br/><br/>While Passengers is driven by the science fiction idea of colonizing space and even more by the idea of people traveling in a fully automated ship hibernating all the way through their voyage. Without these two elements there's no story here. That's the reason this movie is first and foremost sci-fi. This sci-fi story drives a romantic adventure, or in other words, a love story about how two people can be an entire world among themselves if they do love each other. <br/><br/>It's much deeper than the cliché itself, because the story is well written. The characters are superbly written, and the actors are next to flawless, only four roles but each one performed as close to perfection as I've seen in a long while, and three of these four roles called for the highest quality of acting. <br/><br/>One last remark and a dual one regarding some comments I've read here. Regarding some scientific goofs in the script - these are plain nonsense. It doesn't matter at what real speed the meteor storm would look like, cinematically it made sense to show them at slow motion. It doesn't matter if the artificial gravity would malfunction under such conditions, this is one of the best visual ways of demonstrating that a space ship is falling apart. Another claim I feel I must refer to is that this is a rom-com. The fact that humor is used during the story telling doesn't make it a romantic comedy, there are funny moments because that's the way good relationship develop, but there's no comedy here. Just a very good sci-fi romance worth seeing."

The trip take an inverted turn when the characters are woken from there sleep and end up being the only ones on the ship.<br/><br/>Point I want to make with this movie is what annoyed me is a lot of reviewers for this movie are saying 'this movie is not what it seems, the trailer doesn't tell you enough' or 'it misconstrued the plot'. I am not going to give away what this is, but IT DOES NOT, repeat DOES NOT misconstrued, confuse or lead you in to a movie that is not what you are going to get. The trailer did something a trailer hasn't done in years....it doesn't reveal the entire movie. It gives you enough to know that this movie is beautiful, the set designs, the CGI is all amazingly beautiful as it should be and in that it peaks your interest... outside of solely peaking your interest this movie delivers the end product and does so very well.<br/><br/>I will say that two thirds way through the movie I did find one minor detail just convenient and probably is a bit of a plot hole that is just brushed over, but in saying that it wasn't a ridiculous hole that doesn't have some possible logic, but could of been cleared with a simple 1 line sentence. <br/><br/>This movie was a great opener for my 2017 and recommend everyone does that same to.<br/><br/>If you want to continue this conversation you can hit me up on Twitter; @ohitsjustadamh"

Chris Pratt as Jim and Jennifer Lawrence as Aurora have portrayed a wonderful chemistry. The acting of both the leads has been the high of the movie. Especially the no-gravity scene was the top notch.<br/><br/>But once the story has been set the dragging begins. Like Avalon (The spaceship) the story does search for a way to move along. At times the story derails from the Sci-fi genre, in simple words a romantic movie in space. The dialogues too have less impact and don't stay in our mind. The last 30 minutes of the movie is the savior, it manages to keep the audience engaged.<br/><br/>The movie is worth a watch for the lead pair and the last 30 minutes. But sci-fi feel not guaranteed."
"Randy_Dreammaker","8","1","3","6 January 2017"," A Spiritually and Emotionally Complex, yet Incredible Movie
","Passengers is an amazing Sci-Fi movie in many ways based on the current dream of placing humans on another planet. The destination in Passengers is to an unknown universe and system that requires 180 years of suspended space travel through the outer regions.<br/><br/>This movie introduces some very complex ideas about the meaning of life, purpose and ""What-If"" scenarios. What if you're traveling through space and things go wrong? What makes a person happy? Can love grow and develop between two strangers based entirely on need and circumstances?<br/><br/>In one way, Passengers is a retelling of the Adam and Eve story from the Bible in the book of Genesis when God say's, ""It's not good for man to be alone"" and ""There was no suitable partner for the man"". Which in the bible led to God putting Adam to sleep, pulling out a rib, and molding it into a woman name Eve. In Passengers the Man gets lonely, finds and researches one woman out of the millions sleeping in their pods, and awakens her.<br/><br/>As the story progresses, there are some typical moments you already know what is coming next, then the movie forces what seems like a no win scenario which ultimately requires a single question to be answered.<br/><br/>The ultimate question is, ""Is there any gift, greater than sacrificing oneself for someone you love, or even strangers you will never know, who will never know what you did, or know your name?""<br/><br/>Passengers is about love, companionship, friendship, lust, selfishness, desperation, loneliness, sacrifice, redemption and realizing that true happiness does not depend entirely on your environment or circumstances. It presents the idea that love is a decision.<br/><br/>While I greatly enjoyed this movie, I was disappointed with the ending, perhaps I just didn't understand or relate to its metaphor, or perhaps it just didn't go far enough.<br/><br/>The movie ends with passengers awakening long from a long deep sleep. They step out into the cavernous space of the ships interior and glance in bewilderment at the trees, bushes and plants covering the inside of the ship.<br/><br/>This eludes to a theme presented mid-movie about the main male character planting and growing a tree. It also eludes to the male and female characters finding happiness with each other within the context of their situation. Ultimately, making the best out of being stuck on a ride which still needed 80 mores years. In response, they adapted the ship by turning it into their own paradise, or garden of Eden.<br/><br/>What I feel would have been a more fitting and perhaps interesting ending, would of been a whole new culture and several generations of families born and raised as a result of this single man and woman. It really seemed like the whole concept of pregnancy in space was skipped. Regardless, it seems that in addition to massive overgrowth of vegetation, the newly awakened passengers could of been greeted or been introduced to an entirely knew population of people born during the last eighty years of travel.<br/><br/>The couple was young and highly sexually involved, no birth control available most likely, it just seemed logical that a child or several children would of been born, the ship was more than suited and capable of being able to sustain them.<br/><br/>Other things I both enjoyed and hated about this movie:<br/><br/>Several different events force the potential of dying in the vacuum of space, or drowning. Those scenes really captured my imagination and made me ponder the ""What If"" questions about death by suffocation.<br/><br/>The introduction of a third person traveling with them through space, posed an interesting question as well. Would they share the woman? Would he awaken someone of his liking? <br/><br/>Also interesting are the discussions regarding the costs of building the ship, the travel, and the cost to make an emergency phone call back home.<br/><br/>Somewhat unsettling was the concept of being on a ship, where every living person is asleep with only technology to help in a crisis.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts, at times its a little slow, other times wildly intense. From a filmmaker perspective, I think this movie is brilliant! It's the ultimate concept that many filmmakers, especially low-budget filmmakers grapple with. Is it possible to make a full feature movie with four or less characters all within a very limited amount of space. Passengers, pulls this off like a champion, with only three (Possibly, four if you count the android) characters throughout the entire movie, all within the confines of a single ship traveling through deep space."

Truly this is one of the best Sci-fi movies I've seen in years. The movie provides a strong emotional rapport with its viewer. Once locked into the emotional aspect, you are stuck.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence once again was stunning. She truly showed me that her in a sci-fi movie isn't a bad idea.

","Jim is a technical engineer aboard the spaceship Avalon, which is on its way to colony planet Homestead II. A journey that will take roughly 120 years. About 30 years in, Jim wakes up from his hibernation, due to a technical failure. With 90 years to go, and no way to get back into hibernation, Jim is condemned to spend the remainder of his life alone, traveling, but never arriving. Depressed Jim discovers a fellow passenger, the beautiful Aurora, who is an inspired writer and journalist. Jim falls in love and decides to wake her up. From here on, many more things go wrong with the ship and Jim and Aurora must find a way to rescue themselves and the 5,000 other passengers aboard the Avalon, while juggling their own unfortunate fate.<br/><br/>Going into this movie, I was somewhat on the fence, because I had high hopes for it, but the reviews were pretty terrible. Having seen the movie, I can understand why the reviews are so bad, but I am glad to report the movie isn't as bad as the experts make us believe. There is just one very big issue that's hard to overcome. But I will get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>First the good stuff. The movie starts out really well. It contains critique on the over-commercializing that's been taking over nearly everything (in the movie even space travel). Ironic, really, coming from a big budget Hollywood flick, but interesting nonetheless. Jim's tough decision whether to wake up Aurora, condemning her to the same fate as his, or leaving her in hibernation and facing loneliness for the rest of his days was also well done. Pratt does well to show the emotional depth of the character (much to my surprise, because apart from being funny, Pratt's acting had never been all that impressive). He can't compete with Lawrence, though. She dominates every scene she's in. Sheen plays the android Arthur very well, too. Finally, as you would expect from a movie with such a large budget, the visuals are absolutely stunning.<br/><br/>So far, so good, I thought, but towards the end, the movie makers unfortunately decided that fast pacing was more important than emotional investment. The last third of the movie felt very rushed, and I just wasn't as invested when the finale came along. The decisions of the characters made little sense because they weren't foreshadowed well enough, and the parts that should have made me go wild actually didn't feel all that exciting anymore. This is sad, since they had done so well to take their time in the first bit of the movie, and then somehow forgot how important that was later on. Basically, they took a good idea, started out well, and then messed it up by going all Hollywood in the end. Oops.<br/><br/>Should you watch it? If you like Hollywood-boom-boom turbo flicks, then no. The first bit is quite slow and character-driven. If you like Sci-Fi and don't mind slower movies, then yes, but do keep in mind the ending will not be as good as you want it to be. Just enjoy the first and second act, and of course the visuals. And Jennifer Lawrence is good. Very good.<br/><br/>Verdict: 6.0 - Could have been great, but a rushed Hollywood ending spoils the experience."

","""You can't get so hung up on where you'd rather be, that you forget to make the most of where you are."" Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence)<br/><br/>Where they are in Passengers is almost to the end of years of suspended animation getting to a planet that will receive a second settlement of 5,000 travelers. The real interest of this pleasant and interesting sci-fi is in the romance of two travelers awakening too soon from their animation (Aurora, played by Jennifer Lawrence, and Jim by Chris Pratt).<br/><br/>After the audience struggles with his arguably unethical decision to awaken her, the usual sci-fi tropes kick in about the strategies to avoid boredom, to avoid damage to the ship, and to avoid romantic complications. Of course, one look at the out-of-this-world -attractive principals, and you know the romantic part will be a certainty.<br/><br/>The more interesting challenge of beating boredom for 90 or so years is the decisions that determine how the years will go, such as constantly assessing the outcome and working to subvert it by taking over command of the self-propelling ship. Along the way the two befriend an android bartender, Arthur, played smoothly and ingratiatingly by so-cool Michael Sheen, confirming the intent of the film to scrutinize humanity in a microcosm rather than technology. Even the bot has human-like attributes.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie may rely too heavily on the romance, as some critics have pointed out, ignoring the rich thematic possibilities of monogamy. Because the heroes rely on themselves completely, a case seems also to be made by writer Jon Spaihts for the virtue of a couple's isolation in the pursuit of happiness. <br/><br/>These possibilities are my own speculation because the film itself does not explore them except by inference. Regardless, anyone appreciating the allegories of 2001 and Twilight Zone will be delighted by the rich possibilities of Passengers, albeit with a little work to extract the meanings:<br/><br/>""Man has gone out to explore other worlds and other civilizations without having explored his own labyrinth of dark passages and secret chambers, and without finding what lies behind doorways that he himself has sealed."" ― Stanisław Lem, Solaris"

"troyemet","3","1","4","7 August 2017"," Another weak female character drifting through the vastness of interstellar plot holes
","I'm sorry, I want to like this movie but I have a real hard time getting past the central theme of it. This is a movie about a man, who when fate cruelly but effectively takes his life from him, chooses that the best thing to do is to cruelly take the life away from the first pretty young thing he finds on board so that she can now dedicate her suddenly empty life to taking care of him. AND SHE DOES! What kind of patriarchal crap is that?!? Sure, her whole character seems to have been conveniently structured to play this role willingly (how perfect for our male lead) but what kind of message does this movie leave?!? It was once said that an author can ask the audience to make one impossible leap with them but no more. That was supposed to be belief in an amazing starship that makes interplanetary colonization possible but this movie asks us to make two impossible leaps beyond that. One is in a starship so perfect (and bizarre - it is a luxury liner or a colony ship?) that malfunctions are unheard of and yet it cannot figure out how to awaken a *single* staff member in case of some situation it cannot auto-handle. Even if you accept it was programed to avoid that option until all else failed it had two years to fail in fixing the situation and watching it slowly deteriorate and still would rather blow up than wake anyone. Maybe because for some reason it can do anything except put people back to sleep for some crazy reason but even that logic does not hold up when compared against utter destruction.<br/><br/>The second leap, which I already referred to, was that this woman Aurora could fall so utterly head-over-heels in love with the man Jim who took all her hopes and dreams from her so he would not be lonely! Can you even imagine the violation that Aurora would have felt when she found out?!? Certainly, it never occurred to Jim who in all his time ""agonizing"" over whether or not to wake her apparently never asked himself the question about what she might say or feel if awakened! He therefore found himself *completely* without any kind if a plan or thought in his head about how to proceed after sabotaging her pod and goes with ""just let her assume it was an accident and ask the bro-bot to keep quiet about it"". Yet despite suffering this horrific betrayal all she needs is a little time to pout and a few good ol' fashioned action sequences and suddenly she doesn't give a damn about every other soul on that ship as long as she does not lose her true love who apparently now completes her. Even when she is handed the solution to rejoin the rest of the crew (why not wake up once a year for a few days to keep him company since the writers decided to only leave a ticket for one back to Homestead?) she could suddenly no longer imagine a life without this entitled macho prick.<br/><br/>In short, I cannot recommend this. If you were only after a good sci-fi thriller then it is going to be wrecked for you by the massive plot holes and contrived scenarios. If you wanted a romance then it is going to be wrecked by the two-dimensional writing for the female lead who was apparently nothing more than a prize to be claimed and is unrecognizably complicit in discarding all her disgust and betrayal so that she can live out her feminine duty to love and nurture him despite her own plans for her own life that he stole from her.<br/><br/>But, hey, great effects if that is enough for you."

","My wife and I sat and watched this one and we were both impressed. <br/><br/>I have become rather jaded with regards to Hollywood productions, so I was pleasantly surprised by Passengers. Its a simple adaptation of a Robinson Crusoe style epic with a space setting and a romantic twist. <br/><br/>Its a combination that works exceedingly well, aided by very down to earth scripting and narrative and strong characterization.<br/><br/>Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt's chemistry is wonderful. It sparkles and bring this film to life with emotional and funny moments that work well, alongside some well timed action. <br/><br/>All in all there is a heck of a lot to like here and little to criticize, aside from a slightly weak ending.

"theta30","4","1","4","21 February 2017"," Uninteresting
","I found myself dozing after about 15 min and wanting to leave the theater-reminder next time sit close to entrance.<br/><br/>Other than that, the story between the two protagonists is full of clichés. The mechanic is typical mechanic and typically experiencing Robinson Crusoe despair. For some reason he finds ""perfect"" match with a writer, which in turn, for some reason falls for him. There is no dislike between them whatsoever. The dialogue is bland; I don't see what's special about her writing, any teen can write like that. Everything in the movie is typical and anyone can write such a script. Hey, guys did you hear about someone called Cpt Picard, who had his own quirks and imperfections? SF evolved. But, probably the creators of the movie were interested in something as average and bland as possible. The heroes are two eye-candy white actors (though as not to be totally politically incorrect they have a black captain). <br/><br/>Also the selfishness act of the protagonist is not so original, the idea can be found in Interstellar.<br/><br/>The only good thing here are visual effects, the things that happen in the spaceship, the images of the outer space are beautiful. And the spaceship looks cool. The part after she wakes up is slightly more interesting. As they start to talk, occasionally they talk about more important information. For example her mentioning how the company profits from travellers."
"talltree-31254","9","1","4","17 February 2017"," Forget the paid off critics. This movie is outstanding. In fact, I hope there's a sequel.
","I don't know what the critics are on about, I loved this movie.<br/><br/>I didn't give it the last star only because I felt the last scene should have been 2 or 3 minutes longer with a few more views of the crew experiencing the 'aftermath'. <br/><br/>There were a few instances where the science fiction didn't match up with real science but that's nothing new in the movies and I can overlook that artistic license. The biggest scene that sticks out most in my head as being off is the sealed compartment with the hull breach. In reality, the immeasurable vastness of space, entirely a vacuum, would suck a human out of a pinhole....A stream of liquid emerging out the other side. Any movie that shows people holding on to something and being lifted while they fight the force of the whole universe with their mere grip is pure fiction. The air would also vent instantly.<br/><br/>OK, that science bit aside, I loved it. I thought it was a great plot, the visuals are amazing, the cast is outstanding and it's just a great movie overall. I just don't see why it was judged so harshly. <br/><br/>I would definitely like to see a sequel that picks up initially about 55years from arriving where we see how they've lived and the lead up to a decision to have children or not. Her book narrating the history of their new lives like the decision to turn the promenade deck into a farm and 'outdoor space'. Perhaps so the couple's near century of unintended living, breathing and eating didn't deplete the ship's resources for the 5000 others or perhaps issues arise from the children not being registered passengers with bracelet ID's. <br/><br/>Fast forward to the Awakening of the crew who discover what has happened, see the results of Jim's and Aurora's entire lives worth of living and surprisingly meet their two children, now in perhaps their 40's and 50's themselves. The adult children pick up the narration from there and describe not only the continued story of their parents triumphs, trials and eventual passing but most importantly, how history repeated itself when the children, longing for mates and love beyond a sibling bond awoke other passengers resulting in two separate yet complete family units on board! Perhaps at war, with a Cane and Able tribal vibe, or perhaps just living in peace anxiously awaiting the awakening to finally speak to the others... and tell all. <br/><br/>Or alternately, they only have one child named Gus who is found in the Auto-doc and recalls their stories culminating in their last act.... placing they're now 20 something child in the improvised pod to spare him the loneliness they themselves are intimately familiar with. The possibilities are endless."

","Some have called this ""A rape fantasy"" (incorrect), a Stockholm Syndrome film (maybe) and Creepy (in parts). I call it mostly dull, since it drags in parts and barely science fiction (for reasons since I don't want to write spoilers, I won't go into depth). But there's barely any science to the science fiction - as any sf fan who watches this - especially the reactor vent scene - will see. While the leads are good together, I found the story un-involving and the premise as well as the sappy ending, silly. With a little work this could have been really good, but as it is, it's barely worth watching once. I keep hoping Hollywood would simply allow a great sf movie like Ex Machina to be made, but they keep failing the viewer and then wring their hands, wondering what went wrong."

","Cast Away, in the future, with a huge twist.<br/><br/>I need to start this review off by saying that it has been so long since I've enjoyed a movie at such a high level. <br/><br/>From start to finish this film doesn't stop. There is a constant stream of emotion, action, and suspense. The characters are relatable, the pacing is great, the special effects are breathtaking (especially in 3D; and I HATE watching movies in 3D but this one is worth it). <br/><br/>Watching Chris Pratt, who I now consider an amazing actor, fight a morale tug of war both mentally and physically was blast. Had it been him alone throughout the entire film I'm sure I would have enjoyed it and perhaps given a 6 star rating.

","Let's begin with something really important: trailer do deceive you sometimes and this is the perfect example of expecting to watch a determinate kind of movie and find something unexpected (and not in a good sense).<br/><br/>When you watch the trailer you might expect some kind of ""Pandorum"" (minus the paranoia and all the horror) but sorry, this is not that movie. It is not an action/adventure movie where people are travelling in a spaceship with a new planet to live as destination and where someone awakes beforehand because there is something big, deep and dark behind it. Instead of that we find ourselves with something completely the opposite: a romance drama.<br/><br/>Yeah, you heard me: romance drama. Something that is really good disguised in a science fiction environment, with a background mystery (which by the way is solved sooner than saying Schwarzenegger). For half of the movie, H-A-L-F-O-F-T-H-E-F-I-L-M we are presented with the two main characters and nothing, absolutely almost nothing happens. And I didn't feel so bored since watching the beginning of the last ""Fantastic Four"" movie, which lasted also half of the movie by the way. Then something seems to happen but no it doesn't, and then the finale.<br/><br/>Although there are two frontlines in the movie and they have chemistry on-screen, the way the story is told is boring and you will find yourself looking at your watch every 5 minutes for the first hour, then you will be happy that something has happened but then the movie is over and time to go home!<br/><br/>Titanic on space is what this movie has been called, but remember, Titanic has a good story and good dialogues, this one not so much. If you are a fan of the two main stars you may be excused, even more if you like science fiction. but believe me, you will be quite disappointed about the result. On the other hand, if you miss those 90s romance movies, please go watch it!"

","Gravity, Interstellar, The Martian. These are all great outer space movies made in last couple of years.

They are just stunning. But definitely no other nominations would be deserved.<br/><br/>The movies runs for 2 hours but in reality something is happening only in last 30 minutes. Everything else is much more like a space travel documentary. But a really good one. There is not much action or dialogue but it still manages to entertain you and I enjoyed every minute of it. Didn't look at my watch even once.<br/><br/>This movie is much simpler compared to all three already mentioned movies but that's a good thing. It creates different type of emotions.

But after watching this movie it all makes sense and I feel like I want to see space one day.<br/><br/>It is not the best space movie but it is still quite decent and it is worth to be watched on big cinema screen rather than home.

","(Originally published on my blog site, whingewood.wordpress.com)<br/><br/>There were some good points; the ship itself and the society that the characters come from (corporation-run, heavily-reinforced class system based on wealth) were glimpses into a universe that was interesting. Also the idea that they regularly send these kinds of ships on 120 year journeys made me want to know more of that story.<br/><br/>But the film isn't about that universe, it's about the two main characters and their interactions (which is fine, as it was marketed that way, so it's not like I was surprised by that), and it's upon these characters that we should judge the film by.<br/><br/>Without wanting to go into spoilers, the part of the film where Chris Pratt's character is on his own for a year reminded me of the only good part of 2007's I Am Legend, where the character of Robert Neville (played by Will Smith) roams around with only his dog for company (in Passengers, the companion this time is the android bartender, Arthur).<br/><br/>The rest of the film after that was formulaic, which in my eyes resulted in it being fairly mediocre. Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt both gave good performances, it's just that they didn't have much to work with. To top it off, the ending was far too 'Hollywood' for my liking, but that may be because I'm something of a cynic!"

There is a reason that we woke up early"" In the movie he says ""There is something I have to SHOW you."" And the last line is never said in the movie, and the first line was connected to something else.

","Passengers is an art-house science fiction movie that somehow got made by a major studio with A-list stars. Passengers isn't scared to go into dark territory, as a choice made by the main character could be deemed morally dubious. However, as questionable as his actions may be, they are totally human and are handled with tact by the director. The movie's failings are concentrated in its final act when contrivances turn Passengers into a less compelling experience than what it starts out as. The action transpires sometime in the distant future. No date is given but, given the level of technology, it is closer to Star Trek than modern day."

","The movie's script can be better, if changed to this plot：<br/><br/>The man in the spacecraft was accidentally awakened, who had been divorced for some reason. However, he awakened his ex-wife due to loneliness and refused feelings. after all, It is about 88 years that the whole journey need to take to the destination, which is equal to ruin the woman's life. Because of the past contradictions, they were quarreling and fighting with each other. At the time when calming down, they were considering whether to wake up their two 10-year-olds. Then the problem arose. Waking them up, it is would equal to the destruction of two children's life. When they will be in adulthood, the two children may hate their parents in the spacecraft over their lives. Not waking them up, the two children may hate their parents because parents did not wake them during the journey and other children go to their homes in new world. This situation has risen to the philosophical choice, which needs the parents to choose. After solving the problem, this movie can follow the original script to carried out.<br/><br/>If this 90-year journey is really to achieve, I suggest the system of rotation。During the whole journey, no one control the spacecraft when the crew has been hibernating. This situation is not consistent with common sense. If the entire spacecraft is fully automatic running, it would possibly have no way to automatically repair itself when errors occurred. In this case, the spacecraft should have been arranged to take turns on duty staff. For example, 10 crew members are on duty in each decade when the rest of the crew are hibernating. When this 10 years' job is over, the 10 crew members must return to the cabin aiming to hibernation. At the time, the other 10 crews will be on duty."
"orlakelley10","6","1","4","30 December 2016"," Not exactly what I was expecting
","Initially, this film seems interesting, captivating and full of content. After explaining in brief detail why 5000 odd passengers are aboard the ship, Jim (Pratt) awakens after a pod malfunction. For the first thirty minutes or so the film follows his struggles alone and outlines how unhelpful the ship is. This is partially the reason for the low stars because it just seems so unbelievable. Everyone seems to emphasis how these pods can't malfunction, but 2 fail on the same journey? Even if they'd never failed before, surely the manufacturers of the ship would prepare for the worst and have staff woken every now and then to check on the ship? It makes no sense at all that they'd make no preparations for if anything went wrong which would have ultimately led to the death of the entire ship if it had been for the extraordinary luck that two of the three people who wake up during the movie can save it. If it had been anyone else, everyone would have died because they needed the crew member to tell them what was going on and how the ship was failing, and Jim to fix it.. On top of this, the romantic story line in the film is bogus! Fair enough, he was unhappy and alone and would do anything for a companion, but sentencing her to death is unfair in all its entirety . Half of the film consists of the pair being enemies after she discovers he woke her up on purpose (which is understandable). This is the main problem I had with the film- the WAY she found out. Arthur, the bartender (and seemingly the only human like robot on the ship, unlike the rest of the robots)) for some unexplained reason spills the beans? Jim specifically asks him not to tell Aurora (Lawrence)but he does it anyway a year after her awakening. What's with that? Did he have a grudge against their happiness? Was he jealous? Turning bad? Who knows, because it is never explained why Arthur suddenly decides to speak up, and Jim isn't even angry that he told her which ruined there relationship indefinitely. But apart from that,the film was generally rather good with a captivating story line for the most of it, with impressive graphics and interesting characters.. The ending, however,was absolute drivel, and you don't even get to see what the new world looks like. There was no way Jim could've survived any of his heroic acts, because being blasted with fire for an extended period of time, and having no oxygen for a good 5 minutes would definitely kill you. There's no doubt about it. Plus, I'm pretty sure space suits aren't fireproof. Anyway, apart from the films story line being unbelievable, it did keep me interested and I'd recommend it to others because I enjoyed it overall."

","The movie was a pretty solid, not perfect, sci-fi film. The main reason I'm giving it an 8 (instead of probably a 7 or 6) is because of the whole ridiculous controversy the critics started over how Chris Pratt's character behaved.<br/><br/>Here's what he did. Pratt prematurely wakes up from cryosleep in a spaceship bound to a distant planetary colony, all alone. He can't go back, due to a malfunction, and there are still tons of years left on the flight. He can't stand living alone and wants some company, so he researches the other passengers, finds one he likes, and wakes her up, making it look like an accident.<br/><br/>The critics pounced, calling it 'creepy', 'toxic', 'not okay', and all those other words they come up with to describe things they can't bear. I'm not saying that Pratt's character acted in a morally acceptable way, but the movie wasn't saying that either. Isn't this kind of the point of science fiction, to show these possible moral dilemmas in fantastic scenarios and depict how humans would react to them? I'd be willing to bet that any of those critics, if they were in Pratt's situation, would have done the exact same thing; the act wouldn't have been so 'toxic' if their own sanity was on the line. It just shows that these critics have a poor understanding of science fiction storytelling. If it's something slinging mud on the patriarchy or on capitalism, they cheer and say how daring and thought-provoking and clever it is, but if it instead brings up moral problems beyond the scope of political correctness, they cry foul and slam it. It shows incredible close-mindedness and lack of intelligent thought in their political-ideology-driven minds.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie was okay, but not great. Jennifer Lawrence is an incredibly overrated actress. The moral dilemma was the most interesting aspect; without it the movie would have been dull. I was a little disappointed at the sterile ending."

There is redemption through heroism of course but the premise of living entrapment is hard to forget.<br/><br/> Both Pratt and Lawrence are great. They created a loving couple that you want to know more about at the end but you will have to fill in the blanks from what you are given. It's not a movie that will spawn endless sequels. It's simply a singular powerful story that you won't soon forget."

","First of all i got some bad reviews from friends so i didn't expect much from this title, also i watched it with my wife who doesn't appreciate SF much and i thought it will end up much worse that it actually ended up. <br/><br/>She loved the part of his solitude, his transformation when woman is involved in his life, her reactions after, that drama part. <br/><br/>I enjoyed it completely, i was astonished by some part where director really made an effort and watched on every small detail. Like message sending and times traveled, in space when she pulled his rope and counter force pulled her opposite to tighten her rope and bounce her, the part where the throws shield doors to get pushed away. Also story is refreshing, it fills the gaps gradually to keep you decently informed. also visuals are astonishing so i think it was an excellent choice for cinema screen. <br/><br/>Good work people"
"wrigleymatthew-25335","6","1","5","28 December 2016"," An enjoyable yet underwhelming and predictable adventure through space
","The movie Passengers asks audiences what would happen if somebody sleeping in a sleeping chamber for 120 years woke up 90 years too soon, leaving them in total isolation. This film stars Chris Pratt, a man best known for such roles as Andy on Parks and Recreation and Starlord in Guardians of the Galaxy, who typically uses comedic interventions to capture audiences' undivided attention. Passengers is no exception to this trend. The movie, although meant to be a sci-fi thriller, is carried by Pratt's comedic interventions strewn throughout, rather than the thriller that was intended to be used to grasp audiences' attention. Pratt plays a man named James (he is called Jim) who is left in isolation after waking up 90 years too soon while traveling aboard the starship Avalon. Like any normal human being, James does not take this very well. He gets so lonely that he feels the need to wake someone else up early, which is considered murder because neither of them would be able to survive 90 years given their current ages. By using this hint given at the beginning of the movie, you can pretty much predict the ending: James, along with the woman that he wakes up named Aurora, both indeed die. Hence, the movie probably would've been better given a better script, and also if they took out Lawrence's character completely."

","I have never been more frustrated with a film more than Passengers (2016). Large leaps in logic, underusage of a fantastic premise, cheesy direction-- these complaints don't even scrape the surface of the mess that is this movie. In an era where we get thought provoking science fiction films such as Moon, Blade Runner 2049, Upgrade, and Annihilation, somehow people decide to enjoy this film. It truly baffles me that a viewer could be so roped in by characters as bland as these. Its cinematography, its direction, its performances, its themes are so quickly forgotten. In fact, the only thing I truly do remember about this film is how angry it made me when I was when watching it.<br/><br/>The critics got it right. This film is void of tension, enjoyability, and inventiveness."
"guchrisc","Null","1","6","5 January 2017"," ""We apologize to passengers for the interruption in their journey ..."" (standard travel announcement).
","Sleeping passengers are startled to be woken up on their journey to their destination. However, being in a space-ship in space, this story is out of this world, rather than just being another everyday commuter horror story.<br/><br/>The film opens, travelling through space, and Chris Pratt being woken from his induced hibernation sleep. Those familiar with the trailer will enjoy seeing Mr Pratt preening himself before he goes off to meet the other passengers, as we know what he does not. There is comedy here, as well as some satire, that will be familiar to mere earthlings experiencing different classes of travel, and trying to work through computer options. As the full reality of his situation dawns on Mr Pratt the film becomes more serious.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt in Jurassic World (2015) played a likable action figure, whilst also giving us a comic touch too. Mr Pratt played the role well, though to be fair, it was his character who was responsible for the dinosaurs running amok. Here, in 'Passengers', he again has a role that combines elements of action and comedy. However, there is also much more depth to his character in this film, and Mr Pratt demonstrates this well in some superb acting as he faces his future choices.<br/><br/>This reviewer was excited to see this film, but was sadly put off by a critic who revealed a plot twist. However, going to see the film, I was happy to see that the plot twist, which is a major one, and which I believe is best not revealed, is central to the plot of the film, and is rightly dealt with, and explored, in depth. There are one or two other plot twists too, which again are best left to be discovered.<br/><br/>Louisville Kentucky gave us 'The Greatest', the three-times World Heavy-weight Boxing Champion Muhammad Ali, (who sadly died in 2016). In 1990 it also gave us another world champion, and star actress, Jennifer Lawrence.<br/><br/>Her appearance in 'Silver Linings Playbook' (2012) as a sulky and mad date for the equally mad and sulky Bradley Cooper, who then won his heart with her running and dancing, (as well as Robert De Niro's), was merely one of several tremendous performances in recent years. The three stars, followed that up with 'American Hustle' (2013), and 'Joy' (2015). In 'Hustle' Miss Lawrence again played a border-line mad, and this time, not too smart, but very manipulative wife of Christian Bale. This time last year, she starred in 'Joy' (2016), playing the eponymous real-life inventor of the Miracle-Mop, who was necessarily made of much sterner stuff.<br/><br/>Miss Lawrence must be considered amongst the best, if not the best, actress of her generation, and this era. She seems to be able to be truly authentic in her portrayal of her characters, exhibiting true and believable emotions in all of her character dramas. In this film 'Passengers', she again shows us her talent and is rightly billed with the first credit as the star of this film.<br/><br/>Miss Lawrence's character, (the appropriately named Aurora), like that of Mr Pratt, wakes up alone, before she meets him. These two humans are alone. It cannot really be said that this film has a cast of thousands, as all the rest are tucked up asleep for the duration of the trip. Our two woken humans face an awful future alone, with only an android barman as company. Barman Arthur, played well by Michael Sheen, will be easily recognized as being like all human barman on planet Earth.<br/><br/>'Passengers' thus does have a very small cast, though it does seem a spot bigger than that of 'Gravity' (2013) starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney. The two films are similar, with both being dramas set in space with a small cast. Having seen both films in 3D, I can say they share excellent production values too. In 'Passengers' the interiors and exteriors of the space-ship are excellent, as too are all the shots of the rest of the universe. Music was excellent. It heightened tension and drama at the appropriate moments, whilst never intruding either.<br/><br/>'Passengers', and 'Gravity', have good plots and stories. Sadly, at the end of last year, 'Arrival' (2016), went nowhere, and could be best described by old Mrs Soprano as ""just all a big nothing"". 'Interstellar' (2014), did at least go somewhere initially, however both films were really ruined by silly time-loop stuff.<br/><br/>By contrast, 'Passengers' is recommended as a seriously well-made film, with a good story-line, that also raises some thoughtful questions that will need to be addressed before we move from our everyday commuter problems here on Earth to those involved in space-travel.<br/><br/>Miss Lawrence, sadly, only teases us with a dance in this film, but the silver-lining is more running, and some swimming too.<br/><br/>Whilst the film deals with some adult issues and themes, it's UK rating of 12A, means that it is suitable for a wide range of audiences.<br/><br/>Good stuff! 10/10."

"terrildavis-44052","Null","1","7","24 December 2016"," Avoids being a ripoff of BATTLE ROYALE 2: REQUIEM.
","This movie is hilariously heinous and will incite incredulous rage - the plot, the dialog, the acting, the wobbly sets, the list of infuriating elements goes on. During the 120-year journey of the ""Starship Avalon"" to a distant planetary colony, a computer glitch rouses mechanic Jim Preston from hibernation decades ahead of schedule. Watch with irritable and articulate co-watchers for best experience. In my opinion, the biggest problem of the movie is the lack of scientific coherence. For example, in the movie, the crew lives inside that ship just as if they were in Earth's gravity, but there is no explanation or device that could create such gravity. Explosions in the space make loud sounds, although sound waves do not propagate in vacuum. OK, you can argue this is a fiction movie and in a fiction unimaginable things happen; but these things are more than unimaginable, they are scientifically incoherent.<br/><br/>Other reason for the low score is that some scenes are boring, stupid and add nothing to the movie. Seems they were filmed only to occupy time. Enjoy the flood of relief that washes over you when you realize the movie is over, it can't hurt you anymore."

","I saw ""Passengers"", starring Jennifer Lawrence-The Hunger Games movies, The X-Men movies; Chris Pratt-Guardians of the Galaxy, Jennifer's Body; Michael Sheen-Nocturnal Animals, The Underworld movies and Laurence Fishburne-Black-ish_tv, Batman v Superman:Dawn of Justice.<br/><br/>This is a romantic sci-fi movie-Fun fact, Jennifer got 20 million for her payday whereas Chris only got 10 million. Jennifer and Chris are among the 5,000 passengers and 380 crew members aboard a space ship headed to colonize a distant planet. It will take 120 years to get there so everyone is in suspended animation. The ship is on auto pilot. Something goes wrong after 30 years and Chris wakes up. After he realizes what happened, he tries to go back into his sleep pod but he can't get it to work. Then he decides to check out the accommodations of the ship, since he still has 90 years before he will reach the planet, and he finds things quite comfortable. Plenty of places to eat and drink, exercise rooms, gaming rooms. Heck, there is even a robot bartender, played by Michael. But after about a year, he starts getting bored and stir crazy. I mean you can only eat, drink, exercise, play games and talk to a robot for so much before you start getting suicidal thoughts. That is when he finds Jennifer's pod. He starts visiting her and reading about her from the files in the ship's computer-she is a journalist-and then he wrestles with a dilemma; he is an engineer so he could mess with her pod and wake her up for some companionship, but then, she would die, like himself, long before they reached their destination. Guess which decision he makes? And guess what happens when she finds out what he did? See, the basic plot of a rom-com. Anyway, Laurence plays the pilot of the ship and his pod malfunctions too-maybe, if they waited long enough, everyone else would have a malfunction and wake up too. Laurence seems to have been put into the movie just to help Chris and Jennifer on a few little things. It's rated ""PG-13"" for action/peril and sexual content-including nudity- and has a running time of 1 hour & 54 minutes. I like both Chris & Jennifer and the effects are good but I don't think I would buy it on DVD-once was enough-but it would be alright as a rental."

But I have to say that this is a science fiction skin ethics drama, the main control computer hung up unexpectedly only one chief wake up, set to have a hard injury, there is no other way to rest dormant, the main control computer has changed, too. AI level is too low, how can a 120 year-old starship full of passengers have no emergency response system? How come there's only one cabin? This is unlikely.
It is said that Jim's awakening of Ojola is immoral and sinful, and that this is tantamount to murder, I do not deny. But if anyone had to spend the rest of his life with more than five thousand coffins, he would be mad. Therefore, it is human nature, not morality. It was selfish, but it was a last resort redemption.

","In the future some spaceship owned by a corporation is transporting thousands of people in hibernation to a colony planet. Even though it has some fancy shield to protect it during a meteor shower it is hit by a large meteor. The ship can also fix itself, which it does, but there some one item left it can't fix. Suddenly one guy named Jim is awoken from hibernation. There is no else awake not even crew. The whole ship is automated, the AIs are of no help. There are plenty of little robots cleaning things. Jim sends a message to headquarters which is going to take several decades to arrive. He learns that they are 90 years away from their destination and he cannot put himself into hibernation. For some reason Jim desperately tries to break in the cockpit but to no avail. He makes use of the facilities on the ship which include everything someone could want. Except that it's arranged by social classes. He's a mechanic so he's lower class and gets a small cabin and lousy food. But the spacewalks are fun. One day he discovers an open bar and a bartender, but it's a robot as well. But at least he can have conversations with it. After a year he goes looking at the hibernation pods and finds a pretty girl. It occurs to him to maybe wake her up. But he's undecided and chats with the robot/bartender named Arthur about it.<br/><br/>Then one day he decides to wake the girl up pretending it's another ship malfunction. She's pretty antisocial and doesn't care much about him. She too tries to break into the cockpit for no good reason after getting frustrated with the unhelpful AI. But she's upper class so she has access to better food/facilities. Little by little she warms up to Jim and they go on dates and try to have fun. On the day he wants to give her a ring, Arthur decides to spill the beans and tell the girl that Jim woke her on purpose. She flips out of course realizing that it's a death sentence and basically wants nothing to do with him.<br/><br/>Over time things start to malfunction aboard the ship, starting with the little cleaning robots. Then suddenly Jim and the girl run into another guy, he's the captain. Now things on the ship start breaking down real fast. The captain, too, is sick. The healing pods can do nothing for him; he's got massive multi-organ failure and has a few hours to live. In the last couple of seconds he tells them that they have to find out what is wrong with the ship and fix it.<br/><br/>Somehow they quickly realize it's something near the fusion core and sure enough the meteorite broke through the walls. Things now are seriously overheating and the venting system isn't working so Jim realizes he has to do a spacewalk outside to fix the vent doors while the girl pulls the handle to vent the core. Of course things don't go smoothly and we learn whether they manage to save the ship and all people on board.<br/><br/>I'm telling it as if it were an action sci-fi film, but Passengers isn't. The focus here is the on/off romance and drama between the two. The romance is alright I guess. Not sure if people who like romance are annoyed as much by the bits of action as much as action people are by the romance. The setting was ideal for horror action sci-fi instead of romance and drama. The premise is pretty good, of course nothing new. The visuals too are cool, both the bits of cosmos and the fancy modern interior design of the spaceship. The problem for me was the excessive length of the movie and that during most of it, nothing is really at stake. No effort is made to get us to care about the fate of the 5000 passengers. The rest is pretty predictable, so it's not like the movie surprises at any point. Not sure why Tyldum got involved in this. There's nothing in the script that is remotely interesting or that has potential for a director to leave his mark. If anything it's Pratt who makes this dull movie work."

","Watched this movie tonight and straightaway writing a review just after that while the feelings are fresh in my mind.<br/><br/>This is a romantic sci-fi movie and runs between two main characters Jim and Aurora. The things which I liked about this movie are the graphics and cinematography, I was able to live few hours of my life in the beauty of a bigger world out there. The stars and the galaxies always enchanted me and the movie does justice to capture the magnificence in few scenes, well done. Apart from this it is a normal romantic movie with predictable storyline and unimpressive ending. I guess, most space movies end with an imminent danger and how leads have out of box ideas to save the ship. Have seen this concept in many many other movies. I liked the female lead, Jennifer Lawrence, she is beautiful and can see why Chris Pratt fell in love with her. Lawrence Fishburne was given a cameo role and I feel he could have got more screen time and more powerful role. The movie did injustice to his acting abilities. Chris Pratt, hmm., nothing special about him, regular guy who tries to find meaning to his existence on a space ship without any mission in his life. If I compare him with Matt Damon from the martian, his character didn't impress me. Regarding the robots, I liked the all full medical diagnostic and full operating machine, wish we could build them in real world, the world will be better off with it. Overall, I would rate it under time pass category and will watch it under subscription. Don't bother paying separately for it. Cheers!"
"MarQuilly","Null","0","1","19 April 2019"," Weak, very weak
","Althought I like SF and Lawrence and Pratt, this movie doesnt work for me. They are both miscasts, because Pratt usually is a goofy guy who can uplift any movie, and here he is funny as a funeral. Lawrence is usually playing strong female lead in movies, but here she plays sort of deep space Cinderella and mostly wonders aimlessly trough a ship and movie, only to decide to abandon all she dreamt off and her strong motive for boarding the ship is lost completley in space, only after couple of dates with mehanic.
Really? Couldnt she do that on Earth?
This movie tries to be a lot of things at once: SF, action, romance and study of people behaviour in interstellar travels. And fails in each, unfortunately.
As SF is not very convincing even to ordinary viewer: This ship suppose to be some sort of twin to Titanic in space, unsinkable and unbreakable, and we all know how that fake confidence endeded for real ship.
How far fetched is to presume that humans will put random 5000 people in the ship and sent them in tincan over 100y long trip without a single human or supercomputer to operate a ship?
If supercomputer is only super when it needs to coordinate cleaner robots, then we are doomed in space for quite some time.
Even further, doesnt ship of that calibar suppose to have more saftey measures in more extent then just -they told us it is resistant to meteors and hybernation chambers never ever fails.
Again, Titanic much?
Action scenes are, well, same old action scenes in space, so no added value there.
Romance part: Do you really fall in love in someone who woke you just to spend your life with this person in lifelong journey trough space? Without a single human beside your selfimposed boyfriend? She couldnt choose, he choose for her. And what if she simply did not like him? And why he didnt wake up a doctor, or a crew member, rather then a winner of genetical lottery? Right, there wouldnt be a romance then.
And lastley, people travelling trough space, in my humble opinion should grow a little more spine then: buhu I don't want to die alone and I am going to wake prettiest girl I can find.
Again, saftey measures? Waking up crew? Computer wakes only necessary people autonomosly? No random person can wake who please his eye?
Oh well, I am overthinking now, which is more than obvious that filmakers in this movie didnt do much.
Some nice visuals in there, so I gave it 2 stars. More then I can spend."

Besides, the script missed the opportunity to easily increase the suspense with not starting the film from Jennifer Lawrence's point of view, leaving it to the viewer to find out the truth about her early awakening.<br/><br/>All in all, this concept could have made for a great low budget indie film similar to Duncan Jones' MOON, but it just comes off as a boring mess within the scope of a blockbuster movie."

","Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt make a handsome couple in this sci-fi version of a desert island romance (think ""Blue Lagoon"" or ""Swept Away"" in space), but the film ultimately fizzles on a promising premiss and becomes a routine sinking spaceship story that is no ""Titanic."" 5000 passengers are aboard a space cruiser on a 120 year trip to a distant plant called Homestead II when Pratt finds himself unexpectedly woken up from his sleep chamber about 90 years too soon. Pratt goes a little crazy all alone on the massive ship, growing a bear, walking around naked, and basically losing his mind (think Tom Hanks in ""Castaway""), when he hits on the idea of waking up another passenger. Enter Jennifer Lawrence, who he wakes from her sleep, but doesn't tell her he woke her, instead blaming the faulty ship. Can their romance survive such a huge lie? Pratt's decision to wake her was essentially sentencing her to die with him, so should he ever tell her the truth or should he live with the lie? That kind of story is ripe with possibilities and almost reaches Andrei Tarkovsky ""Solaris"" levels of smart science fiction, but instead those emotional, ethical, and moral implications are barely addressed and the plot instead quickly shifts into a routine ""THE SHIP IS FAILING"" storyline where the two have to try to save their slumbering fellow passengers from dying in their sleep. If this was a desert island romance film, the equivalent would be the happy couple spending most of the film fighting pirates and completely ignoring the first half of the film's intriguing set-up. Considering the likable stars, a strong story premiss, and the lavish production values, this film was a real missed opportunity."

The concept is a really fascinating one, really thought-provoking, and the acting is great, you do genuinely becoming involved with the characters.
There's a great period of tension, I won't give specifics in case you've yet to watch it, and it even gets relieved in a self-consistent (with the film) and interesting way.

Secondly, since only three or four characters were presented throughout the whole movie we as viewers had the fulfilling opportunity to care deeply for each and everyone.. Now I reach the good stuff; It's one of the greatest/purest Love stories I've ever witnessed in a movie. At the beginning the main character ""Jim Preston"" arguably commits an unspeakable act, a really bad thing which concerns the other main character ""Aurora Lane"", however he's only human. And as the story progresses it turns out that what he did brought two passionate hearts together only to join and form an unmatched power. His outrageous decision revived her soul and gave her the best version of a life which she never remotely expected, a life that only existed in her wildest dreams, A one Hell of a Life !"
"safeJ","6","0","2","30 September 2018"," No Science in the Sci-Fi
","I pretty much agree with the 5/10 review by Stefan Morcov. A romance, love/hate story aboard a spaceship headed for a distant galaxy and planet. The first half of movie moved much too slow, remaking the Robinson Crusoe role. Even after he awakens Aurora, watching them dine and dance, etc. took much too long. The trailers and official studio promos say that the 2 sleep pods malfunction. The one surprise is that the ""hero"" disables the girl's pod for his own ""companionship"" needs. I don't blame her for beating the c**p out of him when she finds out! Being the mechanical engineer that he is, he swings a great sledgehammer to fix things. Agree with the alternative solutions which Stefan offers. Once the Officer's pod malfunctioned and he awoke, they had full access to controls of the ship. An awakening of key crew member(s) would have been extremely important at that point. Also agree that 5200+ passengers and crew needed more than 1 autodoc bed. Therefore could have put those awake back to sleep after crisis over. A miracle that Jim survived the plasma blast while in space and didn't die of radiation poisoning.<br/><br/>Beautiful visuals and CGI. All in all, glad I didn't pay big bucks to see this in theatre, but watched on DVD from library. Only gave 6 instead of Stefan's 5 because of the special effects, visuals and CGI."

Their romance is very believable, with its highs and its lows.<br/><br/>There is one huge plot hole, although I agree it may be asking too much to want consistency from such a wildly futuristic plot. Lawrence's character says she has booked passage back to Earth after a year's stay on Homestead II. This means at Homestead II there must be technology to put people into hibernation. Does it make any sense that this technology would be on the remote bare-bones outpost, instead of on the ship itself? Not to me. But that would eviscerate the dilemma that drives the entire plot."

"rzajac","8","0","1","18 March 2018"," Operatic
","Flicks like this are what I call ""operatic"": It's a simple scenario fleshed out with a thinly reticulated plotline. Though I'm not an opera *fan*, I understand the attraction for some and have gotten varied mileage from the medium. The job of opera is to convince you that the core one-note-johnny plot concept is driven by truly powerful emotional, humanistic forces.<br/><br/>And I feel that _Passengers_ comes pretty close to succeeding. It's got the finery of opera; astounding set, costume, and props work; great pacing via artful storyboarding and editing; fine acting; some truly great scripting. Newman's score is subdued, yet well-integrated with the action.<br/><br/>From time-to-time a ball gets sorta dropped: No spoilers, but some of the depiction of tech work, particularly in the crisis toward the end, seems clumsily done.<br/><br/>And, true to opera, we're left with a closing image that invites us to metabolize that simple plot as one vested with deep humanity and even redemption. Will it work for you? Who's to say?<br/><br/>Loved Sheen's work, here. So nice to see him stretch a bit to play an AI automaton. A delight to watch!<br/><br/>Anyway, with the caveats given above, I think it's safe to recommend the flick.<br/><br/>An interesting side-note: The flick nicely dovetails themes of cosmic ennui, an abiding interest in truth as key to sustainable relationship, redemption, and interpersonal fulfillment. Gotta say: With so many flicks these days dropping hints--seemingly being picked up by many--that the eldritch Significant Other relationship as key to happiness concept is overrated, interesting to see a high-tech future sci-fi flick pushing against that androgynous, sexless tide.<br/><br/>I mean... Is that a *perfect* ""date flick*, or WOT?(!)"

","The opening of the movie felt jerky at first with its quick scene transitions, but at the end it reminded me of a comic book and I was impressed that they managed to give a detailed and satisifying background without requiring anyone to make any explanations. Throughout the movie, this has been done very well.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the science behind the plot. They didn't attempt to be too scientific, and their explanations and theory, are, for the most part, plausible. There are a few things in there that weren't that logical, but it's not so bad that you would pause to dwell on it. Certain media, like Toyko Ghoul, attempt to be scientific and none of their ideas are actually feasible, which is a turn off.<br/><br/>For the story itself. I believe that the concept is excellent. A man make a moral choice that I am sure is much better than the decisions a lot of other people would have made. He is a good man, and what happened at the end is supposed to show the power of love.<br/><br/>I would say that I probably wouldn't be able to deal with that kind of life if I was either of the characters, I am sure that you need more variety in your life.<br/><br/>I would have rated this higher, but even though it has an interesting story and concept, it's just another traditional love story in a different setting(stranded on a space ship), and there wasn't anything else to it."

","This film is interesting because it is a big parable, a tale, a fairy tale even. No monsters. Just humans, one android, many robots and an enormous machine, a spacecraft built up with thousands of machines that have to work together in the most coordinated way.<br/><br/>On its way to its 120-year-away destination, it meets with an enormous meteoroid and the shield is not strong enough. The meteoroid causes damage that will take about four to five years to come to the point of no return. It woke up one of the 5,000 passengers from hibernation. This passenger will survive alone for three years and then finally yield to the temptation of waking up a woman to bring his solitude to an end. He is a technician and knows a few things about the spacecraft. Aurora is the woman of his choice. He is a Jim of no special metaphor whereas the woman is the dawn of morning and the morning glory in this dark adventure that will bring them to their destination dead. <br/><br/>The bartender, an android, had promised not to tell the woman but of course, he does. Never trust androids. They are programmed not to hide anything and not to tell lies. The situation of love and care becomes one of hate and rejection. Luckily the ship becomes a little bit berserk and the captain actually wakes up out of schedule. That will not last long because he will die within just a very few days. But Jim will have the captain's ID and a few other privileges and passwords.<br/><br/>The captain dies and right after that, the promised major disruption happens. And Jim is alone with Aurora to stabilize the ship. A difficult task for two people who do not like each other very much at that point. They will succeed and Jim will die and will be resuscitated by some miracle mechanical medical doctor. So Jim and Aurora will get married, in a way, and they will have something like 87 years before reaching their destination which no longer is their destination. They will not reach it.<br/><br/>So they decide to transform the spaceship, at least the main atrium in the center of the common passenger spaces into some garden of Eden. The Bible is buried under one million years of alluvia. Adam and Eve just cultivate a garden of Eden on the spacecraft somewhere far away, hence nowhere at all in distant immense and limitless space.<br/><br/>And sure enough they do reach their destination and the crew is woken up and these crew members discover something like a rose garden in the forum of the spacecraft. Magic and romantic. Enjoy the fairy tale.<br/><br/>Dr. Jacques COULARDEAU"

The science is sound and there is a scene in the pool that is absolutely remarkable to watch. Watching that ship plow through space, being protected by a force field is very cool. In fact, all the science, all the gadgets, and especially watching the ship first identify a problem, then repair itself is the stuff of dreams. Watching Pratt's character try to get a cup of coffee that is outside his ticket class is very funny. <br/><br/>There are many beautifully realized scenes in this movie. Pratt standing outside the ship before deactivating his magnetic boots then launching himself out into space is very cool. And little touches such as his tether automatically attaching itself to his suit are great too. The cyborg bar tender, with its cool, matter of fact delivery, is a welcome counterpoint to the main action. And those sets! Whether real or CGI, they're spectacular. <br/><br/>Of course there are parts that are totally outside the realm of possibility. One glaringly unrealistic scene is the where Pratt has to open the reactor vent door from the outside and gets caught in the fiery hot blast from the reactor. And survives! Nuh uh.

To be honest, those bad reviews are absolutely garbage! I mean c'mon, this is not a sci-fi blockbuster likes 2001: A Space Odyssey or Star-Trek but a love story in space. Even though there are some plot holes (but which movie doesn't have any?) and cliche moment, it turns out to be quite alright. The story, the characters, the atmosphere, the pace, they are all okay. There is at least a cohesion in the plot, which I highly appreciate after several so-called blockbusters that supposed to blow people's mind away this year. Yes, it is a simple movie, but it is good at it own way and doesn't try to live up to any franchise or imitate any other popular trend.

The psychology of what happens when Chris Pratt's character does what he does and how it affects the relationship was well done. It added a tenseness to the drama. The ending had to happen the way it did as the story is really an inversion of a classic fairy tale.
Michael Sheen stole the movie for me as the bartender robot. He was pretty hilarious.
This is a great movie that has quite a wide appeal in that it's not a sci-fi flick that just caters to nerdy guys (for what it's worth I am a nerdy guy with an astrophysics degree, but I like sci-fi that tries something a bit different. I'm hoping for a sci-fi musical next!)"

","'PASSENGERS' - 2016<br/><br/>Directed by Morten Tyldum<br/><br/>Starring Chris Pratt, Jennifer Lawrence and Michael Sheen<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​On a routine journey through space to a new home, two passengers, sleeping in suspended animation, are awakened 90 years too early when their ship malfunctions. As Jim and Aurora face living the rest of their lives on board, with every luxury they could ever ask for, they begin to fall for each other, unable to deny their intense attraction until they discover the ship is in grave danger. With the lives of 5,000 sleeping passengers at stake, only Jim and Aurora can save them all.<br/><br/>I won't lie to you by saying that I was put off seeing this movie by the rotten tomatoes score. I know, I know - that score isn't the be all and end all of movie criticism but, considering I didn't care for the movie prior to seeing it advertised, I decided to see if most people saw it worth watching. And they of course did not. It was near universally panned by critics, but very warmly received by audiences. And I have to say that I stand firmly in the centre of the two. Passengers is a perfectly average, disposable movie. It's not good but it is not bad. It's not something you NEED to watch but I don't exactly discourage you from doing so. Were there moments that I enjoyed? Absolutely. I admire aspects of this film, but by the same token loathe others. Of course, I'll elaborate on that further along but what I will say is that this film may or may not be worth your time, watch the trailer and find out. <br/><br/>Let me begin with the positives. The visuals of this film. Any and all effects used in this film are pretty much breathtaking and look absolutely gorgeous. Then, there is the excellent cinematography. Editing could have used more refinement but it wasn't offensively bad. The set design of the ship was very interesting and I really liked it. It's no 'Nostromo' but it was still a very visually interesting ship. <br/><br/>Then we have the performances. No one in this movie does a poor job. In fact, all the performances range from above-average to good. Pratt was good as Jim as was Lawrence as Aurora. Michael Sheen was good as Arthur. All the performances in this movie were at least good and none of them were bad. But the problem wasn't with the acting, it was with the chemistry, writing and character development. None of the relationships were refined and none of them felt natural. It just felt so manufactured and contrived. And manufacturing emotion NEVER works in a film!<br/><br/>My other main flaw with the movie was the entirety of the last act. I actually enjoyed the first 2 acts of this movie. They were at least entertaining. But, without spoilers, I thought the last act of this movie was so dumb and over the top. It was so utterly disappointing and they could've done so, so much more with it.<br/><br/>As a whole, I wasn't a huge fan of passengers. It wasn't good but it also wasn't bad. I don't regret seeing it but I'm sure I could've spent my time more wisely. It's a film that just does not deliver for me. If it interests you, then please watch it; you may very well enjoy it. I watched it out of morbid curiosity(and it was free). Watch it if it interests you but if it doesn't then you don't need to. I'll rate 'PASSENGERS' 5 'Bartender Tricks' out of 10!"

If this were a French movie, it would've ended in a murder-suicide and rightfully so. Nice production design and score."

It would have been much more interesting to see if they didn't fall in love, Aurora turned out to be really strange not like the idolized vision of the protagonist, or straight up started hating him, or their relationship was treated more like what it really was- a toxic one started because they were both the only ones there.

","*** This Review May Contain Spoilers! ***<br/><br/>As far as sci-fi goes, I'd put Passengers in the middle of the road. CGI was passable with some nice eye candy - clearly they spent a few bucks on it. The story, though, was sub par - boy meets girl in outer space, they get in on, they have a fight, and boy has to do something really far out to win girl back. Pratt's acting was not bad, and the chemistry between him and Lawrence was a plus yet I felt that Jennifer Lawrence's presence and acting skills carried the film. And what guy, unless he was gay, wouldn't want to get marooned in deep space with Jennifer Lawrence? I'm certainly in - at least for a couple of weeks<br/><br/>About halfway through the film Chris Pratt had a solo scene, and low and behold, a fly danced around his head - this, of course happening after coming out of 30 years of suspended animation. I rewound a bit and played back the scene to be sure - yep, the little guy definitely flew in for a cameo. You'd think in a CGI extravaganza that someone would have done a bit of touch-up. But I guess they hadn't booked enough time in the editing room.<br/><br/>The pool was killer, complete with a huge dome-like glass window extending out the ship's side revealing an eye-popping starry panorama. The only problem with this picture was that the habitable portion of the gargantuan ship was rotating to simulate earth's gravity and the view through the window looking out from the pool had the stars in a fixed position. Whoops!<br/><br/>Speaking of gravity, when push came to shove near the end of the film, a worsening system-wide power failure killed the power and along with it the gravity. Everything just began floating around in zero Gs. Good for special effects maybe, but the visuals in the film went to great lengths again and again to show this huge habitable superstructure rotating to generate its gravitational field. The power failure shouldn't have had any effect upon the ship's gravity. Either they didn't care or the writer has to brush up on his physics."

Other reviews do that in a more entertaining way than I ever could. Jennifer Lawrence is great actress and her performance is the best part of this movie.

Aside from one sexy spacewalking sequence, The setting doesn't make these events feel any more remarkable than they would have been on Earth. <br/><br/>As we near the final act, the ship starts to fall apart. Lawrence Fishbourne is shoehorned in as a mere plot device.

","This movie was really more of a love story than anything else, not a sci-fi thriller which is how the preview portrayed it. Jim is a passenger on a spaceship on the way to another planet that takes over 100 hundred years to get to. His body has been put asleep like all 5000 passengers. But he wakes up and is alone and for a year; he tries to get to the crew(behind solid doors) and tries to put his body back to sleep but none of that works. He only has a robot to talk too.<br/><br/>So he starts reading biographies of people on board and sort of falls in love with Aurora. So he decides to wake her up even though it is like a death sentence. She doesn't know what he did, so they become a couple. Of course when she finds out he woke her up, she hates him. As time goes by, the ship has more malfunctions, due to a meteor hit. Eventually, someone else wakes up but he is very sick and not much help. But he tells them they have to fix the ship before it just explodes due to the malfunctions.<br/><br/>So Jim risks his life to save the ship and Aurora forgives him. Other crew members wake up so their trip is saved.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: OK would have been better if more of a thriller. Worth a viewing."

","Just want to get it out there, because I'm amazed how few people even notice this apparently.<br/><br/>Jim had to die at the end. Just had to! Otherwise, where is the morale, where is the substance, where is the 'food for thought' here?<br/><br/>This, in turn, would place Aurora in the same situation Jim was - kill yourself/go mad from loneliness. And this would most likely make her to come up with the same decision she hated Jim so much for - wake up another passenger. But the studio decided to play safe once again. ""We cannot kill one of America's dearest! How would all the teenager girls react!?"" But I guess this is what comes with any high budget movie where even a slight risk in unacceptable. Overall, I've seen fan made sci-fi movies that are more believable and thought provoking than this gorgeous looking flick.<br/><br/>This is my major issue with the movie. But, of course, there is a ton of 'technical' issues too. Which I was prepared to let slide, by the way, as I got used to a 'typical' Hollywood production. But this cheesiest happy-end made me furious about wasting my time on this movie. And since I made myself type, I might as well go whine about those 'minor' issues as well, which, in combination with the major one, made me give it a 4/10.<br/><br/>Spared equipment. Is spared equipment not a common knowledge? I mean any equipment critical to an operation that is required to be continuous is installed in pairs. And a freaking control computer of a freaking reactor on a thousand million million million dollar spaceship only has spare parts in a freaking storage? Really?!! Shouldn't there be 2, 3, 20 control computers installed in-line? Shouldn't there be at least two reactor cores on this humongous ship? No??<br/><br/>Poor old Capn. It's funny, but it looks to me that the whole engagement of the captain in the movie was done solely for the reason of killing him. Killing at least someone for the sake of gravity of the situation. - Hey, we need to kill at least someone. Since we cannot kill main characters, let's introduce one just so we can kill him. - How? - Doesn't matter, let's just figure something on the go. Oh and, let's make him black. And let him be someone significant on the ship, since he is going to be in the movie for just a few minutes because we have to plug him into the script somehow. - Errrm, captain maybe? - Sure, why not. By the way, Fishburne's character almost became the only one I could feel for, since I too hate the ""spawn and die"" mechanics in some games ;) But, I knew him for just like 2 minutes, so...<br/><br/>VIP's pod. So you would think that ship captain's pod would be at least more fail safe than any of those 5k passengers and would be among the last ones to malfunction? Nope! He is important to the expedition, not to the movie.<br/><br/>Med pod hibernation option. You would think that an engineer who has spent a year looking to get back into hibernation is going to check that second level menu of the only MEDICAL pod on the ship, right? This is the least troubling issue though, because I'm not sure override was needed to activate it. But it seems like override was needed just for all the revival procedures to be performed at once.<br/><br/>This movie is not just a waste of time, but it also made me pretty mad."

","When I saw the reviews of this film it was very mixed. User reviews seem to praise it a lot and critics the opposite. In truth the film is somewhere in between.<br/><br/>The film starts with a colonisation ship being hit by a meteor shower causing disruption to some of the ship's functions some 90 years earlier than expected, including that of a certain life support pod containing Chris Pratt. We then how he comes to terms with being the sole person on the whole of the ship, including some of the moral choices about whether to deliberately wake up another passenger (Aurora - JL), even though this will mean their eventual death, for companionship. So far, so good.<br/><br/>This is where the film starts to go off the rails a bit. Without successfully accessing any useful part of the ships controls JL (Aurora) and CP (Jim) develop a romantic connection... that is until Aurora discovers how she was awakened too early. It takes the awakening of Laurence Fishburne, as a member of the crew, to provide access to the ship's sensors to discover that the ship is ultimately doomed unless they can work together and bring the plot back into focus... MUST... FIX... SHIP... AND... GO... BACK... TO... DEEP... SLEEP.<br/><br/>It's the second half of the film that leaves me wondering whether I enjoyed the film or not. It appears that wrongly waking a woman from hibernation for selfish reasons and then lying about it can be forgiven by placing yourself in a life-threatening situation.

","The starship Avalon is in the middle of its long journey to a new colonizable planet, carrying thousands of sleeping passengers. But then something causes one of them to wake up decades ahead of his time and now he has to face the long solitude of space travel completely alone.<br/><br/>Let's start with the good stuff. The film looks amazing, first of all. The sets are amazingly detailed, the CGI is some of the best seen to date and the whole film has a very pleasing look to it. Full marks for the production team. I also really appreciate some of the science shown in the scenes taking place outside the ship. They're small touches, mostly, but they're something you don't see in every scifi film and show that at least someone behind the scenes had a working knowledge of physics involved with space, zero-gravity and vacuum.<br/><br/>The cast is also strong. Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are both rising stars in Hollywood, and for a reason. Both give good, credible performances and more than easily carry the weight of the film on their shoulders. I also really like Michael Sheen's small role in the film. At least half of the film's heart revolves around his charismatic performance.<br/><br/>And then the problematic part. The plot in and on itself is serviceable. It's not great, but it's executed well enough to make it work beyond its initial limitations. The problem is Chris Pratt's character, who ends up making some truly questionable choices in the course of the film. Choices that look really bad, not just on paper, but in reality as well. Choices that I can easily see as deal breakers for some people. Personally I do think that the film handles those choices with the needed gravitas and doesn't sugarcoat them in any way, which saves the film for me, but I can totally see someone not being so forgiving.<br/><br/>And that's Passengers. It's extremely well-made scifi adventure romance with some nasty undercurrents. Proceed with caution, but also with an open mind."

","There were numerous viewings of trailers and TV spots for this movie that made itself out as a mystery, what is the cause of a passenger's hibernation to hatch early? Having no trust as what ridiculous Hollywood-style ending would make me groan, I voted down seeing it in the theatre. After seeing the rental DVD, I think the trailers and spots were deceptive as to what the movie was about. However, I may have been just dreaming up my own reaction to some flawed sci-fi films like ""Sunshine"", expecting the third act to be some extra-terrestrial mumbo jumbo, or like ""Sunshine"" some strange concoction of ghosts and monsters. <br/><br/>Well, it is all just a romance flick with two hot Hollywood stars and a decent sized CGI budget. Somewhere a cross between ""Solaris"" and ""Wall-E"", the first act also has a strange semblance to Jack Nicholson going crazy in ""The Shining"", complete with an obliging bartender. Chris Pratt thankfully acts like a normal person who is stranded on this isolated spaceship in the middle of nowhere. The film kept my attention as it dazzled with nice space scenery and cool spaceship design. <br/><br/>Once Jennifer Lawrence is brought into the mix, it is a little dull, as we watch them become romantic, in order to fulfill the target genre requirements. But it is all too mechanical, with zero chemistry between them. I was rooting for the talkative bartender to have some evil turn, but alas, he was stuck behind the bar. So no, this is not a thriller. I barely remember after the film was over that Laurence Fishburne makes a brief appearance. One might wonder if he was just a hallucination. <br/><br/>There are, thankfully, brief moments of tension. But they are not allowed to become to frightening because, you know, romance. Which is too bad since<br/><br/>Many spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>The ship temporarily loses gravity while Lawrence is in a swimming pool. To her horror, she is unable to gain any traction to escape the large bubble of water and is trapped inside. This could have been a much more heart pounding scene that risked the life of Lawrence, but resolves itself rather tamely. And there is another tense scene.<br/><br/>Pratt, trying to go back into hibernation, crawls inside the capsule, which seals him up. He soon realises that it isn't working, but now is trapped inside the capsule. Pratt begins to struggle to escape, with the tough machine staying shut. Pratt starts to struggle to breathe, and, oh he's OK folks. <br/><br/>The same goes for the big reveal about the cause of Pratt's hibernation machine malfunctioning. It really is nothing beyond the opening sequence in which the spaceship encounters a large barrage of asteroids, damaging the self- diagnostics.<br/><br/>And here again, the idea of a ghost in the machine, the gremlins that turn up with malfunctioning zoombas or whatever. These malfunctions could turn some of the artificial intelligence into rogues and lethal to our unwitting passengers.<br/><br/>Ah, so much blockbuster material left off the storyboards because Romance. Except, suitably, when Lawrence finds out she was woken on purpose by Pratt. All romance is now broken off. With only a hint of redemption as Pratt performs a selfless deed. <br/><br/>This film showed some mild science fiction elements. But with the potential for some weird space psychosis that could have worked it's way into the characters, instead all malfunctions are mild and infrequent. And Pratt ends up being too inert to create any tearjerker scenes at the end. <br/><br/>So no thrills, a few chills, bland romance cut short, and a boring bartender. Thumbs down."

They certainly never did during the meat of the film. (sorry about the choice of words... there wasn't any meat; just whipped cream). They must have pressed the 'gene override' button on the ship's computer."

","Just as others have mentioned, the trailer for Passengers leads you to believe that both Jennifer and Chris awaken at the same time and eventually fall in love. For the life of me, I don't understand why they didn't make the movie this way. Then, it could have at least been classified as a love story and somewhat decent. But the way it goes down, it seemed very selfish and disturbing and I had trouble finishing it after that. <br/><br/>Imagine that Chris isn't as handsome or charming, or even better that Jennifer's character is engaged to someone who's already at the homestead or better yet on the ship still sleeping! Any kind of actual conflict would have made for a better, fuller movie, but what we're left with is a boring and misogynistic waste of 2 hours. <br/><br/>It really is a shame as all the elements are there for what could have been an awesome movie, great actors, a seemingly hefty budget and an interesting idea. Only it falls flat, lending itself neither to romance nor science fiction. Very disappointing."

","Pacing is way off on this visually impressive space ride that suffers from a dull script and low key performances from the major players. (Although, in fairness, one of them is playing a robot.) The premise is cool, about a lone castaway stranded within the confines of a spaceship heading to a new colony light years from earth, but we've seen the 'isolated castaway' done before and better in everything from 'The Shining' and 'Castaway' to the more recent 'Gravity and 'The Martian'. Jennifer Lawrence is wasted and Pratt proves he can carry a movie without falling back on his usual boyish charms; still there is little chemistry. Everything seems hurried and predictable. A major flaw that is difficult to overlook (and would have been easy to fix) makes it almost impossible to be sympathetic to Platt's character. (Suffice to say he's not really on the ship that long to justify the drastic choice he makes.) And whoever said ""there are no small roles just small actors"" was wrong. Sometimes there ARE just small roles. Just ask Andy Garcia."
"jds_grl_7","7","0","1","12 April 2017"," Excellent acting but some lackluster effects
","I knew little more about this movie than the fact that it starred two of the sexiest actors of today. Chris Pratt plays Jim Preston and Jennifer Lawrence plays Aurora Lane, both passengers aboard the Starship Avalon. The ship is on a 120-year voyage to planet Homestead II where it will deliver 5,000 passengers to cultivate a new world. These 5,000 passengers and 258 crew members are all in hibernation – that is, until Jim accidentally wakes up a few decades too early.<br/><br/>I don't want to print any spoilers here, but I will say that the trailer for the movie led me to expect a slightly different storyline than what actually transpired. Perhaps it is because my brain has been imbued with so many space-themed movies lately, but I expected a more action-centred movie. Instead, the film was more focused on relationships, uncertainty towards the unknown, and the imperfections of the human psyche. What little adventure the movie included was saved for the end. I'm not even sure if it qualifies as the climax of the film or simply the denouement.<br/><br/>Speaking of space-themed movies, I have to talk about the actual ship. Its design is unlike any concept I have seen before. It flies in a corkscrew fashion and includes a forcefield to combat space debris. The interior reminds me of a cross between the ships on Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy and Wall-E. In a time where everyone and their brother is producing the same thing (i.e. space movies), an original theme for a spaceship is a breath of fresh air.<br/><br/>Space scenes are very infrequent and frankly, slightly lackluster. To be fair, the visual effects team did a good job of representing a star up close (trust me, I've seen many stars up close) including prominences and flares, but the scene that included this celestial body had an air of ""we spent too much money on this visual effects team so we'd better get our money's worth"" and was a little too unbelievable for my taste.<br/><br/>Now let's talk about the acting. As previously mentioned, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence are two of the sexiest people in the public eye right now, and their acting did not disappoint. Pratt does a great job of articulating hopelessness. I have no idea what I would be thinking if I were in this character's shoes, but it's obvious Pratt put a lot of thought into Jim's motives. As for Jennifer Lawrence, her shining moments occurred in the hatred her character feels for Jim. Anger is not, for regular humans, an attractive emotion, and Lawrence does not shy away from the ugliness that goes along with it. There are numerous scenes in the film where veins bulged, spittle flew, and extremities shook, all giving the impression of intense animosity.<br/><br/>The film ties up rather neatly, although it did take a bit of a turn I did not expect. The film is not extremely intricate, which works in its favour as there are not many ways a critic can pick it apart; he simply would not have enough information. Regardless of the potential for plot holes, Passengers is a pretty thrilling and thought-provoking movie that has a bit of everything for any audience member.<br/><br/>This movie does not pass the Bechdel Test (however, keep in mind there are only three speaking roles, two of which being male).<br/><br/>Read more of my reviews at mindovermoment.wordpress.com."

It takes almost two hours but in this case I'd preferred the usual 1.5 hours many US mainstream movies have, would have been enough.<br/><br/>But it's not a demanding, sophisticated movie, there is no real good acting (Martin Sheen being the exception), no real suspension, no real catastrophe (in the end the ship is just all fine, as at the beginning of the journey), a way too simple script and a lame ending. Basically, just some simple and cheap entertainment, packed in a nice form and featuring two actors who have to drag the audience in. Most of them might ending up being quite disappointed and rightfully so.<br/><br/>Either you make a real disaster, a psychological or a philosophical movie, but trying to mix them all up in one thin soup doesn't work out, and that's what we got here.<br/><br/>But: the starship is really cool and closer to a real one than most others; might have been inspired by Stanislaw Lems ""Fiasko"" starship.

The guy Jim manages to look like a few employees in Provo utah which is neat i thought the same thing about Nicolas hoult in Collide but it was not local and centralized specifically.So where i'm at almost two hours into the movie the generator in the theatre went down. There are moments when Aurora Lane the character played by Jennifer lawrence resembles both joey laurent adams as well as Renee zellwegger.Her name is super because its also a name of a main street almost highway out in Seattle: aurora.So the ship is really kind of screwed up.Everyones life is at stake. The passengers have already had every access available to every part of the ship..there is a critical point of reference going on right now during the blackout...and its life or death. In the meantime a lot is going on with so few characters hence the Gravity reference..plus,well you know how George Clooney ended up.This seems to be almost like that except the two main characters Jim and aurora have already dated and been intimate unlike the professional business relationship Sandra Bullock had had in her film...well its back on hope you like it as much as i did But Don't Get Your Hopes Up."

Jennifer Lawrence was good, but nothing special, though her part didn't require it!. The only other two actors were Michael Sheen, who played an android and Lawrence Fishburne, who in my mind was a nod to 'Event Horizon'. The Cinematography was excellent, and the direction was OK.

","So if I was suddenly awoken from hyper sleep 90 years before my journey was complete and had no way to get back to sleep and I was stuck on the ship alone with Jenifer Lawrence to keep me company, that would not be the worse case scenario.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt definitely agrees as he plays Jim who was put in that situation as a bit of a nod to the film Silent Running, as he wakes up all alone and attempts to get back into hyper sleep with all his failures leading to depression, until a bar tender gives him the advice of taking advantage of his situation on the ultimate star ship cruse liner by tempering with some functions to upgrade his room stay and some other perks, which I think loosened him up a bit to make a decision most lonely men in his situation would most likely do.<br/><br/>It is a very inactive Sci-Fi film that actually test the charm of Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence as with the exception of a few scenes from Micheal Shannon as a robot bartender and Lawrence Fishbure as a crew member awoken on a glitch, it's pretty much those two for almost Two hours. Though I think I preferred watching Matt Damon for that length of time stranded on Mars, Chris Pratt is very likable, and I have to be honest J-Law is very cute. I could not even tell you if I liked her character or not all I could tell you is that there were moments when she looked crazy hot and in those moments it enhanced my like of Chris Pratt's character whose lucky enough to be stranded with her.<br/><br/>It was a beautifully made Sci-Fi film with the visual effects creating an amazing ship.<br/><br/>While the film does explore some interesting ideas in Sci-Fi it's mostly done with talk, which is ironic as the movie looks like it cost a lot and there is far too much talk for it to cost that much dough.<br/><br/>Had great potential to be a great Sci-Fi film (and get people kissing it's booty like they are Arrival) but your love of the movie does fully count on how much you like Pratt and Lawrence <br/><br/>http://cinemagardens.com"

"MaximumMadness","6","0","2","14 February 2017"," ""Passengers""- An average Sci-Fi drama that is sadly more notable for the debate it has stirred about critic and audience perception than it is for its actual quality.
","The fascinating thing about director Morten Tyldum's Sci-Fi drama ""Passengers"" is that it's become more a news-story than a movie. A symbol that perfectly surmises something that had become a highly debated subject by the time of its release in late 2016- that being the difference in opinion between professional film critics and the average movie-going audience. In a year filled with high profile duds that were beloved by fans despite their debatable poor quality and equally poor professional reception (I'm looking at you, ""Batman V Superman"", and I still am not ready to forgive you for letting me down!) and decent enough releases that were dismissed by audiences despite positive critical reception, the disconnect between what critics enjoy and what audiences love has turned into a hot-button topic. Even skimming through the first few pages of reviews here shows plenty of people whose focus seems to be more on ""disproving the critics"" than discussing the film itself. It's become such an issue for so many that people are more obsessed with the Rotten Tomatoes score for the film than with the film itself.<br/><br/>As a genre fan, I've always found these debates pretty fascinating, since many of the films I enjoy tend to be those that are often looked down on and dismissed outright by the mainstream. But I can understand why and accept that everyone's tastes are different. And in the case of ""Passengers""... well, I hate to say it, but the film is almost more fascinating for raising these discussions and debates than anything else. On it's own, it's merely an enjoyable but very average Sci-Fi drama that boasts strong performances in the service of a very standard and even bland storyline.<br/><br/>Chris Pratt stars as Jim Preston, a passenger on-board the spaceship Avalon, who is accidentally awakened from hibernation 30 years into a 120 voyage to an Earth-like planet called Homestead II. Helpless and alone, he spends months trying to find a way to reactive his hibernation pod to no avail, before discovering and falling in love with a fellow passenger named Aurora Lane (Jennifer Lawrence), learning about her through video-logs taken before the Avalon's departure. After spending months contemplating the dubious morality of awakening another passenger and sentencing them to a fate of possibly dying before reaching their destination, Jim decides to awaken Aurora and lie to her with the claim that her pod malfunctioned. Although shocked and heartbroken by her situation, she soon takes a liking to Jim and they quickly become lovers... but their connection is threatened when she learns the truth, and when a series of events occurs that may lead to the destruction of the Avalon.<br/><br/>Contrary to the common complaint that the questionable and troubling morality of the story is a negative, I actually thought it lent a lot of weight and drama to the proceedings. The film is most certainly at its strongest during its first half, which are almost exclusively focused on small character moments involving the increasingly- troubled Jim as he debates awakening Aurora, and their eventual sort-of courtship. The fact that Jim in a way is sort-of murdering her by taking her life away is a very strong theme, and I enjoyed it. Especially given the expert performances of the delightful Pratt and Lawrence, who are both acting their hearts out, and director Tyldum's strong visual direction.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like many stories that start strong and put their focus almost exclusively on character, the film completely collapses in its second half, which is where it loses major points for me. Rather than simply telling a unique character-study about two people put into an extraordinary situation, the film then tries to saddle us with a series of increasingly convoluted plot-twists and developments and unnecessarily complicate matters, and it robs much of the drama and suspense. Basically, the first half is solid... the second half is a flippin' mess. It trades in the atmosphere of the earlier sequences for big, loud explosions and non-stop CGI-heavy effects sequences. And it gets rid of the quiet and contemplative moments of character development for every predictable suspense cliché in the book. And it almost ruins the entire film, dragging down what was otherwise a very decent drama and turning it into an average, run-of-the-mill sci-fi thriller where suspension of disbelief goes right out the window and you're left scratching your head at all the conveniences and plot- holes that pop up. It's really a shame.<br/><br/>As it stands, ""Passengers"" definitely has enough going for it in terms of strong performances, good visuals and an intriguing first- half that I would still give it a slight recommendation. But my suggestion? Once you hit the one-hour mark, you can basically stop paying attention. The first half of the film is quite well-constructed... the second half is just bland and predictable. And as a result, like I said above... it's almost more fascinating to watch for the debate it affords about critic vs audience perception than anything else.<br/><br/>I give it an average 6 out of 10."

","This film proved that the two most lovable actors in Hollywood have some amazing chemistry together, if only they were in a film that actually contained a reasonable plot. Passengers follows the lives of Jim (Chris Pratt) and Aurora (Jennifer Lawrence), two passengers on their voyage to a new life on an uninhabited Earth-like planet who are somehow awoken 90 years earlier than their estimated arrival date. This film is essentially a tedious cast-away love story in the worlds largest shopping mall in space, which truthfully, may not have been as great as the Axiom in Pixar's Wall-E. There is a good heap of comedy and wit (from Michael Sheen) that makes the movie a bit more worthwhile, but the film totally fails to live up to its potential by simply casting a shadow over its already dark premise. There was just so much hype from this film and I'm utterly disappointed at what Morten Tyldum did with this film, especially after what he had done with ""The Imitation Game"".

Everything in space !<br/><br/>The whole idea sounds cool, but most did not expect that as a primary plot.

Unnecessarily, in a view to introduce a twist and bring back (wake up) audience from the romance portions, the captain arrives. I felt it is not necessary.<br/><br/>Very little is known about the professions of passengers. That made me wonder how the hell they know chip repairs, component replacement and assembly logic.

There were major challenges and everything was overcome. I think this is one of the only movies I have seen in about 1 year, where everything comes together in a positive and good way. The movie is like V for Vendetta where a lot of the challenges seem to be cliché, but on the other hand - what is wrong with that? Living in a Western Hollywood Film culture - I have gotten used to clichés and at times they make me feel comfort at identifying them, viewing them and experiencing them. This movie is also very predictable, for example, the man wakes up a lady who he is the most attracted to physically and mentally to help him on his quest to save the spaceship. If each one of us, as humans could pick out our soul-mate by reading their life stories and then matching their beauty to the picture - our world would be like going into Walmart and picking up an item we ordered on-line; except in Walmart you can return the item if you are not satisfied, which was not the case with the lady whose pod he opened. Of course this movie is a sci-fi movie and not based on reality and there needs to be a disclosure on that - for example that love is based often on indescribable thoughts, feelings and emotions - versus a description and the physical appearance of someone."

","Lucky me was able to purchase cheap tickets to see ""Passengers"" at an Advanced Screening in Centennial Park's out doors cinema in Sydney Australia on the 30th of Dec 2016, a few days before the official release, had read the critics reviews, was expecting a lackluster movie ... being a Sci Fi nerd I wanted to see the movie regardless, plus I enjoy Fruit Bats making noise, flying over head and pooping on me while watching movies :) <br/><br/>Enjoyed this movie so very much, and so did the crowd, a hearty cheer and clapping was heard at the end ... Passengers is a good movie, do yourself a favor and see it while it's still on the big screen."

","The Movie started of very good. The first ""quarter"" of the film felt like The Martian and Chris Pratt showed some great acting skills. <br/><br/>The combination of Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt worked very well throughout the movie.The setting (especially the beautiful design of the locations and the ship) made the Movie worth watching.<br/><br/>The movies basic idea was brilliant. Passengers is not a space action adventure neither a romance all along, it's a mix of multiple Genres. <br/><br/>Good acting, beautiful space scenes and a little laughter helped keeping a constant level of joy.<br/><br/>The only thing I didn't liked about the film was the ending. The Ending was weaker than the beginning and a little bit over the top... However, Passengers is a movie worth watching."

","Now having agreed to go see this on Christmas instead of collateral beauty which would have been my choice this film definitely did not disappoint . It's not easy making a movie with just one or two characters for pretty much the entire film but they definitely did a good job with this one . It takes place on a flight to a new planet that will take 90 years to get there, all the passengers are in a chamber that will preserve them for the duration of the 90 year flight. The problem is there is a malfunction and some of the chambers open, leaving Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence awake and alone 90 years early. This is one of those rooms where the less you know the better so as to not do too much away let's just say they have to figure out how they're going to survive For 90 years all by themselves, Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawerence both give good performances that make her feel very enjoyable definitely a movie to check out in the theaters"

","The critics are just wrong when it comes to Passengers. It's not action filled or has a plethora of alienswhat is does have is a unique love story and a moral dilemma. Of course it IS essentially a love story but it is set in space. Chris Pratt is Jim, one of the 5000 passengers on a giant spaceship traveling to a distant new colony that will take 120 years. His sleeping pod malfunctions and he wakes up 90 years too soon. He finds out that he can't go back into suspended animation.so what is he to do? I won't go into details so as not to spoil the story. What I will say is that the critics are wrong: go see for yourself. The visuals are stunning and the acting is quite awesome. Of course you have the gorgeous and talented Jennifer Lawrence and the always adorable Chris Pratt as the two leads.....and Michael Sheen as the bartender is quite entertaining! I really enjoyed this film and I would tell people to just take a chance and go see it.it's more than a love story. What would you do if you were in Jim's place?"

","I was really looking forward to this movie and the build up to the first half was great, but it turned into such a weak, banal disappointment that it was a shame really. It's great to have a movie with an original plot, which this one kind of was, I know we had interstellar, I know we had Martian but they were different and this was unique in its own way, which was great. Both Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence did well. Although Lawrence lacked the earthy, genuine warmth that you sense she was trying to portray in certain scenes. I don't know why she missed that - she's great at everything else, whereas Pratt never misses his mark. Sheen and Fishburn never disappoint either, although Sheen's character as instrumental to the plot as he is, is just illogical and Fishburn's character seems to have been added as a stop gap to block all the leaking holes which are oozing logic and reason. So it really barely holds together. The denouement becomes tediously predictable and the conclusion relies on a weak narrative which is not supported in anyway by the closing scenes... It was OK and I'm sure a lot of people will enjoy it, but you're never going to want to watch it again. Having said that, some of the special effects were great, well thought out and executed and they manage to convey some awe and wonder - but I just think with a little more thought it could have been so much better..."

","I can see the meeting in the board room of SONY PICTURES as director Morten Tyldum (fresh off his hit, Oscar nominated film, THE IMITATION GAME) is pitching his new Space/Love Story PASSENGERS.<br/><br/>""It's a love story set in space"", says Tildum, ""We spend 95% of our time with just the two lead characters, so they need to be 2 VERY charismatic actors in these roles.""<br/><br/>""Who do you have in mind for the leads"", says Executive ""A""<br/><br/>""Chris Pratt and Jennifer Lawrence""<br/><br/>""Green light""<br/><br/>Unfortunately for PASSENGERS, Executive ""A"" never asked to look at the script.  Two very charismatic actors will need to work very hard to overcome a less than stellar script delivered by Jon Spaihts (Dr. Strange, Prometheus).<br/><br/>And work hard they do.  Pratt and Lawrence are very...well...charismatic as a couple who are accidentally (or are they?) awakened from cryo-sleep 30 years into a 120 journey to a new planet.  They play off each other well, the chemistry between them is strong and they are two very good looking people - which helps.<br/><br/>But they aren't given a whole lot to do but look distressed, then determined, then dejected, then in love, then angry, then despairing, then hopeful...you get the point.  They are trapped on this ship and we are trapped right there with them.<br/><br/>Director Tyldum does a nice job trying to keep this movie moving along with some SPECTACULAR visuals, it is rich to watch - almost as rich to watch as the two leads - but, I think, even he knew he didn't have much to work with so throws his might at the Special Effects, where he should have spent time with the script.<br/><br/>And there really isn't much else to say about this film.<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars."
"drdedoverde","5","0","3","29 December 2016"," It's pretty
","Yepa, if there wasn't a ten line minimum I'd leave it at ""It's pretty"", because that's actually all there is to say about Passengers. I only gave this movie five points, because I had a lot of fun watching Jen&Chris promote the movie and it's well made. A story would have been nice though. And watching two boring characters fall in love doesn't get more exiting, only because they are in space and there are five thousand people asleep in pods - it really really doesn't. This is just another soulless product of the industry: a lot of look and that's it. Sure thing, a huge water mass in zero gravity is a nice special effect to have, buuuuut if you compose the ""story"" around these little visual highlights here and there, well, you end up with a big budge movie full of nothingness. So stay away from that movie and find yourself a cosy pod to sleep in instead - you're way better off that way!"
"yoel_marson","6","0","6","25 December 2016"," Bit of fun lost in space
","There are two types of science fiction movies; Intergalactic laser wars and loneliness in deep space; Passengers is the latter...<br/><br/>Suspend scientific fact for 2 hours and enjoy this predictable romance. <br/><br/>If you're going to be stuck in space for a zillion years you could do worse then being stranded with Jennifer Lawrence and Chris Pratt.<br/><br/>Bored after a year of playing Just Dance the protagonists embark on an all-inclusive space cruise with just an android bartender for company. <br/><br/>They are later joined by the chief deck officer who comes and goes too quickly but not before giving out Red pills and things soon get worse. <br/><br/>Andy Garcia makes a 5 second appearance. His shortest credit ever?<br/><br/>But what is saved on actors fees is made up on special effects and lots of Maplin circa 2030 technology to enjoy. <br/><br/>And also at half the speed of light you would only age 63 years in 90 lol..."
