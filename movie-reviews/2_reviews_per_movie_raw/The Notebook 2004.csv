"bronteh","Null","758","876","24 November 2004"," the notebook was a truly remarkable film
","In all honesty, my Dad paid me to go see the Notebook with my friends because he kept saying how magnificent it was. i went because it was free, and with no expectations. However, the Notebook drew me into the story from the beginning right up until the credits- and then kept me crying for quite some time after it had ended. I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten."
"filmnoir500","10","534","636","10 February 2005"," Beautiful
","I went to see this film with my sister and my Mum and we were the only ones in the cinema. Not the best start, but I continued to watch it anyway and am so glad I did. This is probably one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen! From the relationship of the two characters to their surroundings, every scene is breathtaking! The Notebook tells the story of a summer romance that turns into a romance never to be forgotten. Allie and Noah are the two lead characters and they are wonderful. You immediately fall in love with the characters and you want to follow every step of their doomed love story. it is one of the greatest love stories ever told. Look out for the lake scene, unbelievable! I came out of the cinema wanting to go back in again and watch it all over again. It feels like you are reading a diary watching this film, thats how detailed and wonderful this film is. Cannot really give too much away about the story, all I can say is if you haven't seen this film yet, be sure to see it. I cannot think of a film more perfect for Valentines Day!"
"jcorpuz@ucsd.edu","10","287","346","15 February 2005"," SImple but wonderful
","This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of the director's guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can't be movies like this every year..."
"threester","10","432","527","29 June 2004"," The Notebook : Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks
","Often times when a movie comes from source material such as a novel that did well, the people who were fans of the book end up not liking the movie as much. Sometimes those same fans even end up hating the movie, or not even giving it a chance by seeing it. Such was the case, that I already knew the ending of Nicholas Sparks's novel even before I got into the theater. Let me clear up though, that the best thing about the film was that I ended up getting wrapped in the story on the screen, rather than sitting there thinking to myself what part of the story should be coming next. That is what makes a great adaptation, when you can get lost in the story, and forget about your thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world. Not only that, but the film soared past any expectations that I had for it from the start too, by being very well Directed and acted. <br/><br/>Best known for his acting credits, Nick Cassavetes was tapped to direct this film. His past experience, which didn't consist of very many films includes the Denzel Washington film John Q. This was not going to be an easy task for him though, because the story was built on us believing the love that the main characters of the film would be showing was real. It?s not as easy as it sounds, and some films (like Star Wars Part 2), end up making the audience laugh, rather than feel what the characters are feeling. He did a great job, and helped put together a great cast for this film that would end up including Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, and Joan Allen. All actors who have found their niches before, and were brought in to this film to help carry the story. <br/><br/>Gosling is best known for his role as ""Richie"", one of the kids, in Murder By Numbers. He brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. She was actually one of the leads (Regina George) in an earlier Summer movie, Mean Girls. At the heart of this film the couple represents the love story that is being told by James Garner's character. He reads from a book , the story of the two lovers as they go through everything life has to offer. Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the story, Noah and Allie meet in one of the cutest scenes of the movie. He sees her at a carnival, and knows right away that he wants to be with her. He does not know quite why at first, and all he can say is that something inside of him is drawing him to her. He convinces her to give him a chance, and she eventually agrees to give him the date that he seeks. What progresses from there is a Summer romance that goes through all of the emotions that we all have experienced before. What makes it even more real, is that it is not played off as if every single moment is perfect between the two of them. It depicts that they do have fights, that they do have disagreements, but that they do have a love that is stronger than any of that. This is what made the romance real for me. Everyone knows, that in real life we can't have a relationship where everything works out perfectly, or where everyone agrees on everything. <br/><br/>The romance blossoms, but a problem exists that could spell trouble. Noah is from a one- parent family, and sees himself working at a lumber-yard for the better part of his life. He says that he has found his place in life, and this is what the ""cards"" have planned for him. Allie on the other hand, come from a very well-off family, and is being brought up in a rich societal circle. Her family is spending her 17th Summer in the small town by the sea, and first comes across Noah by pure coincidence. The romance between them is kept under wraps for quite a while, until her parents find out. The mother immediately thinks that is should end, but the father feels that it is just a summer ""thing"" that will come to an end rather quickly. That is, until she is out late one night with Noah, and he takes the side of his wife. They see no future between their daughter and this ""boy"", and take her away from him the first chance they get. <br/><br/>That coupled with the outbreak of World War II keeps them apart for a couple of years, and the story really gets underway. Will their love be able to endure the separation, or will one of them move on to something that is easier in their own lives? The story becomes an epic of its own, as its starts to split time between the story being read, and the story of Garner and Rowlands living in the present day. This is what I love about films like these, as we are given the opportunity to enjoy two different stories going on at the same time. The love shown by Noah and Allie is something that envelopes us, and it makes us forget about the current story. By going back and forth, we are able to look forward to where each of the two stories is going. All of it leads to an ending of each story that is both very enjoyable, and very emotional at the same time. <br/><br/>As I said before, sometimes a book can fail to transition to film. This is not one of those cases, as the movie instead becomes its own entity. Both stories have great chemistry between the characters at the center of them. It is amazing just how well the actors/actresses in the parts play their roles, and just how much we as an audience start to care about their lives. As it progresses, we truly care about what will happen to the main characters, and we have in our own minds how we want things to turn out. It is that type of film, where we start to become part of the story, and want them to act or say something specific, that truly makes a great story. Even though this is a movie that is heavily geared to lovers of romance novels, this is a film that I found very enjoyable. I highly recommend seeing this film while it is in theaters, or purchasing it when it hits DVD, because it has everything that is needed for a truly great love story."
"punk_rawk_princez","10","358","437","3 February 2005"," Just beautiful!
","This amazing love story can be enjoyed by all. The Notebook is not one of those cheesy chick flicks that often come out, it is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to.<br/><br/>Even most males will agree that this movie pulls at your heart strings. Filled with fabulous quotes, and sentimental moments I found this movie to be one of the best I've seen. I got to know both main characters and found myself relating to each of them. Most of us remember our first love and that strong connection we had with them. This movie makes us think of what could have been and gives us a fresh look at the meaning of true love. I recommend this movie to anyone with a heart."
"jameslamont","10","441","550","3 January 2005"," An Heartwarming movie that makes your insides go mushy with emotions!!!
","I went into this movie with the misconception of thinking this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this film and the themes portrayed in this movie were handled in a great way.<br/><br/>This movie will have you feeling happy and joyful and the scenery is just brilliant. You will feel like you are part of the characters, and you will care about them throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>The movie gallops in speed as we are absorbed into the great plot and brilliant acting of all the cast involved. Ryan Gosling is brilliant as the shy and quiet Noah, and Rachael McAdams is superbly beautiful as the star of the movie, Allie.<br/><br/>As I said earlier in my review, I did go into the movie not expecting much and that was because I thought it was a typical ""boy loves girl"" movie which are sometimes just too predictable. Don't get me wrong, they are some good Romantic movies that pull it off very well, but there are simply too many in that particular genre.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The supporting cast were good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the ""rich man"" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many ""cliches"" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie.<br/><br/>It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. You will be talking about this movie for a long time.<br/><br/>The only bad part about this movie is the length, which I think could be shortened a bit but on the whole this was a superb movie which is well worth a watch.<br/><br/>Go and Watch this! Amazing movie which will have you brimming with joy.<br/><br/>9 1/2 out of 10"
"chron","10","284","354","26 February 2005"," Unabashedly Romantic and Sentimental. It's Storytelling at its Best
","This story plays out as Duke, played by James Garner, reads a story about two young people in the 1940s who fall in love and endure life. The movie moves between present-day and the 1940s. It is structurally very similar to ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", which is also one of my all time favorite movies.<br/><br/>Unlike ""Fried Green Tomatoes"", this focuses on young love as it grows and endures through wars and parental dissent. Sure, the core is the ""Romeo and Juilet"" theme, but the way is plays out and the exceptional charisma that the actors bring to the screen make it feel fresh and not entirely predictable. This is a deeply romantic movie. If you are cynical at all about romance, timeless love and dedication to another person, you may find yourself rolling your eyes a bit. I am not that cynical about the emotional ties that bind us and I was thoroughly taken in by the story.<br/><br/>This is such a gentle movie. The characters are very human and very likable. All of the actors turn in engrossing and compelling performances.<br/><br/>Technically, this movie is exceptional, too. The scenes during the opening credits is absolutely breathtaking. The editing is very good. The story is compelling from the opening credits to the closing credits.<br/><br/>My wife and I don't always share the same perspective on movies, but we agreed on this one. We both loved it immensely. I am certain this will become part of our permanent collection."

","The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant, and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watching it.. as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of the story just that much more real. There really are no words to describe how this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure... It will make you feel. After watching it, i've often just.. sat where i am and just thought about it. It's just one of those movies that you will think about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feeling in your heart.. and you'll know that it touched you in one way or another.

","I am a big fan of love stories. Lately, the film industry has been lacking the sort of element that I love to see in a movie. The last movie I saw that made me cry as much as ""The Notebook"" did was ""Ghost"" with Demi Moore. The casting of Allie and Noah in the movie was exceptional and made the feelings and emotions seem real. After watching the movie in the theater, I noticed every person, including the men, cry as they left the theater. Now when was the last time you saw anything like that?? I bought the movie on DVD the day it came out and have been watching it everday since that day!! I would highly recommend this movie to both males and females."

"lavatch","Null","172","253","18 June 2005"," My Favorite Scene was the One with the Geese, not the Gosling
","Prior to watching ""The Notebook,"" I was not familiar with the work of the actress Rachel McAdams. She made an indelible impression by sustaining an outstanding performance in this film. Her character Allie is the pivotal role in the film, as she must make the crucial romantic decision on which the story turns. There are few performers capable of evolving the complexity of characterization as achieved by Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>The film recreated effectively the world of the 1940s in America, including the parental pressure exerted by the well-to-do family of Allie on whether to allow their daughter to pursue a young man from the other side of the tracks. As played by Ryan Gosling, the character of Noah could have revealed more emotional layers. There was only one scene in the film where he really showed that there was something at stake in his love for Allie. He apparently wrote her a passionate letter every day for a year. Especially in the film's early scenes, Gosling could have shown more of the passion.<br/><br/>The other cast members were outstanding, including James Garner and Gena Rowlands in the parallel story. In the two plots, ""The Notebook"" merits comparison with another outstanding romantic film, ""The Bridges of Madison County."" As the two subplots of ""The Notebook"" come together, one of the key characters is Allie's mother. As always, Joan Allen delivers a convincing and complete character portrayal, as the well-intentioned, but conflicted mother. In one of the most moving scenes in the film, the mother opens up to the daughter and tells her story of youthful love and a fateful choice similar to the one Allie herself must face.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the film: a wonderful sequence where Noah and Allie are in a boat in the backwaters of South Carolina. The waterway is simply filled with white geese. It is a stunning and picturesque moment, among many in this well-crafted film. If there is such a spot in South Carolina, then I want to go there!"

It was the best dollar that I ever spent. I never had a movie that moved me nor made me shed so many tears and as soon as my wife came in from shoping, I told her that its a must see movie and then started to tell her the who story.

"tfrizzell","Null","49","80","1 July 2004"," Cry Me a River.
","Heartwarming, heart-wrenching, poignant, emotional, conniving, manipulative and forceful romance tale based on the vastly successful best seller by novelist Nicholas Sparks tells the story of two young lovers (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) who fall for each other in rural Seabrook, North Carolina over one faithful summer in 1940. Naturally there are problems galore though as Gosling is a commoner who works at the local lumberyard and has no real prospects while McAdams is a socialite just visiting for the summer. Soon it is apparent that she is going to be heading for the women's college Sarah Lawrence in New York City when the season is over. Her parents (caricature David Thornton and the always brilliant Joan Allen) are cold for the most part as they know that Gosling is way beneath their social standing. The typical romance between the classes becomes strained and it becomes apparent that the relationship may not work out. Gosling does not fret though as he swears to write to McAdams everyday. As time passes, the U.S. involvement in World War II forces Gosling and best friend Kevin Connolly (a real scene stealer) to go to Europe to fight for Patton's Allied Forces. Meanwhile McAdams volunteers as a nurse in New York while attending school and instantly injured army man James Marsden falls in love with her. A short courtship, and the fact that he is from a wealthy southern family that her parents approve of, endears him to McAdams. She also falls in love with him, finally putting the hurt of her time with Gosling behind her (she never knows that Gosling's letters are intercepted by Allen). Gosling returns from war and his loving father (a fine turn by the excellent Sam Shepard) has sold his home so Gosling can buy and fix up an old dilapidated house from the area. Gosling's promise to McAdams to repair the old mansion during their summer fling drives him to brilliant work, but self-destructive emotional tendencies. He drinks uncontrollably, sheds himself from others and has a loveless physical relationship with young war widow Jamie Brown (in a well-timed and very convincing role). A crazy twist of fate then leads McAdams back to North Carolina. She finally starts to rekindle the immense love she once felt for him while his love for her continues to burn as bright as ever. We all know that there are consequences abound for McAdams though as she is now engaged to Marsden and still falls in line when confronted by her domineering mother. The whole story goes on through flashbacks as in the present-day a kind elderly man (arguably James Garner's crowning achievement) reads to a fellow nursing home occupant (Gena Rowlands) who is suffering through Alzheimer's Disease. The titled item is read to Rowlands everyday by Garner in the hopes that she will always be reminded of the story and hopefully always moved by it. My goodness ""The Notebook"" is an emotionally charged candy cane of near epic proportions that is so sweet that you might get diabetes watching it. The film does its best to persuade and make the audience feel the way it wants you to feel that it turns those watching into slaves to the story. So help me, I liked being a slave to this picture. It is not near as complicated and creative a story as it would make itself out to be, but it knows exactly which buttons to push and when to push them as the old Hollywood formula (which has been around since the late-1910s in the cinema) sucks its viewers in. This film is not as good as many wonderful romances of the past (everything seems mixed here from ""Casablanca"" to ""It's a Wonderful Life"" to ""Summer of '42"" to ""Annie Hall"" to ""Cinema Paradiso"" to ""Titanic"" to ""Love Actually"" and everything else in-between), but it will still grab and hug at you tightly. Nick Cassavetes (Rowlands' real-life son) is a deceptively clever director that knows how to use tone and varying film-making principles to literally move his audience at will just as he would move his characters to perform in certain ways. No doubt there are shortcomings and flaws here as the movie runs too long and sometimes talks down to its audience. But with these things said the project is a smashing success that serves its purpose. Garner and Rowlands are amazing as they have basically a table-tennis match of roles when on screen. Gosling (best known as one of Denzel Washington's players in ""Remember the Titans"") and McAdams (who has a credit list of ho-hum films like ""The Hot Chick"") do definitely have a heated chemistry that pulls you in almost immediately and never lets you go. The other actors are all perfectly placed with Shepard and Allen providing stellar screen-time and Brown (in admittedly a relatively small role) showing the makings of an individual who has the  potential to have an exciting film career. Beautifully scripted by Jeremy Leven (maybe a bit too beautifully done if possible), ""The Notebook"" will engrave itself on you. 4 stars out of 5."
"emrelanur","9","23","35","20 July 2007"," The best love movie i've seen
","Although they're fun to watch, most love movies are predictable after seeing the first five minutes. The Notebook, however; keeps you glued to the t.v and guessing. Rachel Mcadams' character is a more sweet and disciplined rich girl who she plays beautifully. Ryan Gosiling also brings out the best in his character and together they make the perfect couple. I'm not much of a romantic, but the scenes of them together are really not easy to put into words. All i can say is that, if you're a love movie person, it's the movie for you. And if you're not, it's still the movie for you, to make you realise not all love movies are the same."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","8","25","39","31 January 2005"," Who doesn't like a love story?
","I must stress to you my belief in that the 'romantic comedy' is pretty much the worst creation of mankind. Some may argue that religion or the atom bomb are more destructive but the romcom (ugh!) is consistent proof that the public are idiots willing to fork over cash multiple times for the same old, same old crap. We very rarely get a sincere romance film, they kinda died out in the forties and have struggled for breath since.<br/><br/>I liked A Walk to Remember a lot and felt obliged to check this out (because it's from a book by the same writer). That obligation turned out to be quite rewarding as this sober, mature film was everything zillion dollar attempts to make us cry (I'm subtly referencing Pearl Harbor) were not. It's all about character and the guts and imagination to tell a good story.<br/><br/>Noah is a simple 17-year-old lumberyard worker. He's cocky, arrogant but very good-natured and he quickly attaches himself to Allie, a girl from the city, from Old Money and a fussy family who condemn her relationship with Noah. This is all told in flashback as old Noah (James Garner) reads from his book of youthful memories. Yes, this part is nothing original but the conviction by the cast make it astonishingly real and believable. The performances all round (but especially from Gosling and Rachel McAdams) give The Notebook a strong edge over most attempts at romance. You can literally feel their urge for each other and are involved with them all the way. 'Will she or won't she' plot lines have been done to agonising death so credit must be given Nick Cassavetes (who you'll probably best remember as Castor Troy's bald pal from Face/Off) for pulling it off so eloquently.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend that you give The Notebook a try. Even if your a hardened 300-pound muscle-man who's afraid to love it's still worth it. But I must warn you, if your the kind of person who breaks down in uncontrollable crying at the end of Bicentennial Man (err...) you must know that The Notebook ends very similarly. So if your lip quivers easily, watch it alone.<br/><br/>The DVD is in gorgeous-looking 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen that perfectly shows off the wonderful cinematography and warm color pallet of the film. The Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is most unsophisticated but considering the nature of the film, that is to be expected. Extras include, 2 Commentaries by director Nick Cassavetes and writer Nicholas Sparks, 12 Deleted Scenes, featurettes on Cassavetes and Sparks, 'Locating The Notebook' Featurette, Casting Noah and Allie Featurette, Rachel McAdams Screen Test and the Trailer."

I've seen better acting on lifetime! and so many unnecessary parts that are completely pointless. ""A walk to remember"" is about a hundred times better and it didn't get half the attention this movie did. If you're not aware already, it's based on a book by the same author as ""the notebook"". if you want to see a moving love story you'll be disappointed from this film unless you're 13...can't believe all the rave...it is not deserved...a total waste of my time..."

","It's not that I dislike romance anything but this has movie tries so hard to be some sort of acronym to the word ""chick flick"" that it ends up shooting you to death with it's intended love arrows. Now could it be that I can't relate the alleged lovers in this movie? I mean I wasn't born in the 30s, I'm not a soldier so I was never in any wars (haven't we seen enough WW2 stories by the way?) and of course I don't have any family as of yet. But surely the universal power love is something everyone can relate to? Especially when depicted by a movie that uses no other element to drive its plot. Think again, the definition of love shown in this film is so naive, sugar-coated and completely oblivious of anything in the real world that it makes Star Wars look like something from the Discovery channel.<br/><br/>The so called ""couple"" in this film are only in love because the movie says they are, not because there's any sort of chemistry between the actors and not because the characters themselves even act like. Even Allie's alleged interest in painting felt so tacked on shallow and fake it made my head hurt. Speaking of Allie, it actually infuriates me to see the character acting like she has absolutely no control over her libido because the sex is just about the only thing the couple seems to have in common, and the only thing, aside from arguing, that they enjoy doing together. And yet this movie is supposed to be oh so romantic.<br/><br/>It's by some small miracle that this movie got the raving reviews it did, luckily it seems most of those were given by teenage girls and their tool boyfriends (no Oscars or anything) so I don't have to completely give up on humanity yet. If one day your girlfriend suddenly shows up all lyrical about this movie and wants it to ""share it with you"" I'd strongly advise any guy to end that relationship pronto. Your girlfriend will obviously already have built up her own twisted fantasy of what a relationship should be like, a fantasy that no guy, live or dead, could possibly live up to. Stay away."

","This was one of the greatest love stories that I have ever had the pleasure of experiencing. Ryan Gosling was, as always, authentic in his portrayal of Noah, a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie, a beautiful rich girl who is staying in town with her family on their summer's vacation. The relationship is not well received by Allie's parents which leads Noah to make a decision that he feels is in both of their best interests. The result of a hastily made decision leads our main character down a road that first shuts out true passion as he tries to forget his past hurt. But, a stint in the military, where he experiences loss as well as his loss at home following his service in the military, leads him right back to his heart. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. It doesn't get any better than this. Wow!"

MILDLY but it doesn't even come close to elliciting any of the emotional response you might expect from a good movie.<br/><br/>The plot goes from one twist to another without any other purpose than to surprise especially naive viewers and the tear jerker ending is a big yawn, even with the talent of poor Rowland and Garner who are completely wasted on the flat dialog and cliché storyline.<br/><br/>The whole thing probably isn't helped by Gosling and McAdams TOTAL lack of chemistry and forced acting but I can't say it would have improved the poor plot any if the young actors had been even remotely close to the talent of their eldest.<br/><br/>If you're expecting a real romantic movie like Casablanca or Now Voyager, watch something else."
"dallas_viewer","2","80","147","18 June 2005"," Like a poorly made ""Hallmark Hall of Fame"" special
","I think most of the folks who rated this movie between 1 and 3 stars have pretty much nailed the reasons why this film was bad-to-mediocre.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling looked and sounded like he was straight out of L.A. Hands down the worst casting in the movie. Gosling seemed like he *might* be able to act in a movie with a title like, say, ""Hey, Dude, Wha's Up"", but that's about it. The guy has the energy of a turnip. At one point, I thought he might possibly be a step away from being stoned.<br/><br/>Gosling's character's on screen relationship with Rachel McAdams appeared to be relatively chemistry-free. But that might also have been due to the lame script. Some of the lines were hard to take seriously. Still, it would have been nice if Gosling, in particular, had tried. <br/><br/>The movie reminded of a Hallmark Hall of Fame production, but with poorer production values. And the film seemed to be about the '30s and '40s as imagined by someone contemporary. Hence, there is no hesitancy about a woman sleeping with someone she barely knows (and to whom she is not married), blacks and whites cheerfully intermingle everywhere--this contemporization of a much earlier era was distracting. <br/><br/>Also, I never understood why Allie falls for Noah in the first place. Noah is an immature doof--endangering himself and others on the ferris wheel, talking to Allie later on like a would-be stalker, and then, when they do go out, lying in the middle of the street. And when Allie tells Noah she doesn't want to lie in the middle of the intersection, Noah pulls the manipulative old, ""Your problem is you just don't let your self have any fun."" <br/><br/>Maybe her problem, Noah, is that she has common sense and you don't? <br/><br/>According to the young lovers, all they do is fight. And they have nothing in common. But hey, as the movie shows us, they're physically attracted to each other. And that is enough to produce a great and enduring love. <br/><br/>Now there's a wonderful message to send the teenage girls who must be watching this film.<br/><br/>And finally, the movie shows Allie's fiancé, Lon, as a wonderful guy. Mature, hard-working, with a string of virtues already mentioned by another IMDb poster. And Allie is in love with him. I cannot fathom why she would be more attracted to Noah, with whom she argues and has nothing in common (except sexual attraction, evidently).<br/><br/>I did think James Garner did a decent job with the script he was given. But it was all too little too late."

","My wife and I watched The Notebook last night. Within ten minutes we were furious at how slow, cliché, and predictable it was. And then it just got worse and worse. It was so very very bad that we were actually drawn to watch in perverse, embarrassed horror as each scene plodded through stale, obvious dialog, and the actors tried to salvage what was obviously a terrible muddle by overacting. I can't begin to convey just how awful this movie is, in every sense. Leave aside the horrendously dull, cliché-ridden script, the terrible acting, the ham-fisted directing, the swelling tear-jerker music, and the incredibly obvious plot -- Even the freaking costumes were terrible. The fake facial hair looked like it was done by 3rd-graders. If movies are meant to fascinate, then this one did all right. I consider this the worst film I have seen in at least five years, but rarely if ever have I (and my wife) been compelled to stay all the way through such abysmal crap out of some sort of hilarious anger at how were were wasting our own time. I mean we were jumping on the couches ad screaming in warped glee as each predictable plot point was tediously checked off the director's checklist. All the way to the very last shot (in the backstory) of her coming back and them hugging in a swirl of stock sentimental string music -- OF COURSE SHE'S COMING BACK. And the front story? They, uh, die TOGETHER? My God. We could not stop howling. Was he even sick? No. He just died -- just because! Because it went with the sickeningly sweet music, I guess. Then I come here expecting to be vindicated and I find a bunch of comments by people who were actually taken in by this plodding, pathetic drivel. What in the world is up? I usually am with IMDb folks on their 7.8s, but man alive, folks, step away from the Kool-Aid."

","Why this movie is rated so high is beyond me. Don't get me wrong: I'm a girl, love Ryan Gosling and was pretty much excited about watching the movie. Unfortunately, when this torture finally finished after two long and excruciating hours, I just couldn't help to think that this must've been the corniest piece of trash in the history of movie making. The lead actors in my opinion had zero chemistry, and Ryan Gosling really disappointed me as Noah. The diversity of facial expressions was basically nonexistent and the acting was bad. And what's up with the character of Noah? Was he supposed to act and sound like a psycho? Cause if he was, they did a hell of a job. Rachel McAdams was really pretty, and that's basically it. And the ending... Oh, the ending! It was so lame and unrealistic it made me gag. What's heartbreaking and sad about it is a mystery to me. I don't know, maybe I just can't see the grandness of The Notebook, but I certainly don't wish to come across it again."
"Cpartak","9","20","32","20 May 2005"," Beautiful Film
","I went to watch ""The Notebook"" because my girlfriend had read the book and asked me to come watch it with her. Being a guy who does not enjoy romantic movies very much I was very reluctant about seeing this film. However, I can honestly say that I was blown away by this beautifully written, acted, and directed movie. I had only seen Ryan Gosling in one other movie, ""Murder by Numbers"", and was impressed by his performance in an otherwise forgettable picture. He has a great charisma and on-stage presence that few other actors have. Similarly, Rachel McAdams truly shines here in her breakout role as a rich southern girl who falls in love with Gosling's character. Not to be outdone by their younger counter-parts, Gena Rowlands and James Garner are also excellent in this film.<br/><br/>There are many things that I truly enjoyed about ""The Notebook"", most notably the simple but poignant love story between Noah and Allie. I think one of the hardest things to do in a film is to show true love, which is so rare in real life, and thus extremely difficult to replicate on screen. Nick Cassavetes does an exceptional job of presenting the story without any sappy or phony elements that would have made the film cheap and predictable. Instead, he allows Gosling and McAdams to become the characters of Noah and Allie and they take it from there. Their performances are truly outstanding, I could honestly feel the love between them in every scene. This was a completely new experience for me because I rarely watch romantic films, and even more rarely find them to be believable.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film to everyone, both male and female. I know that most guys will be hesitant to watch this movie, but they should not be. If you've ever been in love, and if you've ever felt about someone like you've never felt about anyone else, you will enjoy ""The Notebook"". And even if you've never been in love I think that you will find this movie to be an honest and sincere story about two people that never stopped loving each other until their very last moments together."

Just so sad to see two fabulous, classic actors accept supporting roles in a poorly written movie; with countless obvious mistakes, many being historical in nature; from a terrible book.<br/><br/>I think if they had a different writing team, different researchers!, and ditched those two awful youth actors (who belong in teen flicks and those stupid giant lizard and shark movies on the Sci-Fi channel), the movie may have been good if the focus was on the late stages of their life and not the early. When they were young, it was all totally unrealistic cloudy rolls in the hay, giant rivers filled with birds and a wet sundress contest and pouty fights. But the roles Gena Rowlands and James Garner were totally different and could really make a wonder movie.<br/><br/>The many historical flaws were very distracting. Such as her jewelry styles. The types of pearls a betrothed upper class girl at her age were totally wrong. Also the lack of progression of the fashions through the decade of their youth is wrong especially for someone w/ money.<br/><br/>Unusually, I would say read the book, but that was just as bad.

","SPOILERS THROUGHOUT. 'The Notebook' is the 17,329,587th movie about a woman choosing between a reliable steady guy who sincerely loves her and a macho jerk. It's also the 17,329,587th movie in which (big surprise!) she chooses the macho jerk, and we're supposed to applaud that decision. This movie's one slight twist in the moss-encrusted formula is a flashback framing device, which supposedly makes it more difficult for us in the present to guess which choice she made in the 1950s.<br/><br/>Gena Rowlands (who pronounces it 'jenna') plays a woman with Alzheimer's Movie disease, which is different from real-life Alzheimer's disease because it only makes her forget things in the service of the plot line. Real-life Alzheimer's patients, tragically, forget their toilet-training and stuff like that. Gena Rowlands is all glammed-up here, remembering everything except minor details like which man she married. When the script calls for her to have a convenient resurgence of memory, here it comes bang on schedule. When the script calls for an equally convenient loss of the same memory, there it goes.<br/><br/>Due to the flashback structure, the major roles are split between young actors (playing the leads in the 1940s and '50s) and senior-citizen actors as the same characters in the present. Gena Rowlands shares her role with the much younger Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton. Unfortunately, Ms McAdams has two very prominent birthmarks which have no counterparts on Ms Rowlands ... making Allie Hamilton the world's only woman whose body has FEWER spots as she gets older.<br/><br/>There is anachronistic dialogue in the flashback scenes. The 1940s sequences are production-designed within an inch of their lives, but they don't look like the actual 1940s. Everything is too bright, too colourful, with no sense of wartime shortages or rationing. As usual in Hollywood movies, we get the past as Hollywood *wants* it to be, not the past as it actually was. I cringed during one scene in an upscale nightclub in the southern United States in the 1940s, in which an African-American bandleader grins his approval while black and white couples share the dance floor. There may have been a few lower-class roadhouses in the Jim Crow south where the races mingled, but it did *not* happen in upper-class establishments like the one shown here!<br/><br/>Noah Calhoun, the macho jerk, not only places himself in danger but also endangers everybody else (first on a ferris wheel, then by grabbing the brake of a bus while it's in motion), and we're meant to admire this guy. Later, in the 1950s, he sports an incredibly ridiculous sensitive-guy beard that's right out of the 1980s or later. Any white man who wore a beard like this in the southern United States in the 1950s would have been carried out of town on a rail.<br/><br/>Sam Shepard does his usual posturing and preening. James Garner plays the older version of one of the two rivals for Allie's affection, and we're not supposed to know whether she chose irresponsible jerk Noah or steady reliable Lon. Sorry, but movie heroines always make that choice the same way, so the suspense level is zero.<br/><br/>I will give director Nick Cassavetes some credit: he's actually interested in telling a story about human interaction, unlike his father John Cassavetes who specialised in pretentious acting-school exercises in which nothing ever happened. Unfortunately, the story in 'The Notebook' is a very predictable one. This movie is soppy, sloppy, floppy and choppy. I'll rate it 3 points out of 10."

In the late 30's, the wealthy seventeen years-old Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) is spending summer vacation in Seabrook. The local worker Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets Allie at a carnival and they soon fall in love with each other. One day, Noah brings Allie to an ancient house that he dreams on buying and restoring and they make love. But Allie's parents do not approve their romance since Noah belongs to another social class and they travel to New York with her. Noah writes 365 letters to Allie, but her mother Anne Hamilton (Joan Allen) does not deliver them to her daughter.<br/><br/>Three years later, the United States joins the World War II and Noah and his best friend Fin (Kevin Connolly) enlist to the army and Allie works as a nurse of the army. She meets the injured soldier Lon Hammond (James Marsden) in the hospital. After the war, they meet each other and Lon, who is wealthy and handsome, proposes Allie. Meanwhile Noah buys and restores the old house and many people want to buy it. When Allie accidentally sees the photo of Noah and his house in a newspaper, she feels divided between her first love and her commitment with Lon. Meanwhile Duke stops reading to the old lady since his children are visiting him in the nursing home. <br/><br/>""The Notebook"" is a beautiful and sensitive romance with a love story that is not shallow and makes you think of how fast time goes by. The screenplay and lines are wonderful and the director Nick Cassavetes succeeds in making a movie that makes you feel different emotions, from heartwarming to heartbreaking feelings.

The only emotion in the movie (the awkward courtship/love scenes and Allie's annoying habit of squealing) are painful to watch.<br/><br/>I only watched it to the end to make sure the two old fools died (everyone knew withing 15 minutes of the start what the situation was).<br/><br/>Which makes it reminiscent of Titanic for me where I was hoping every minute after the first 60, that Leonardo DiCaprio would just die already."

","Like many guys, I was roped into watching this film by my girlfriend, and while I was expecting a chick flick that I would not enjoy but that would likely get me laid, nothing could have prepared me for the tidal wave of bullshit I was in for. ""The Notebook"" is one of the most unimaginitive, exploitive films I have ever seen, and Nicholas Sparks should be curbstomped for every hour he spent churning out this garbage.<br/><br/>Let's start with the positives. Cinematography was inoffensive and fellas, if you watch this with your special lady, you're almost sure to get laid.<br/><br/>And now on to the negatives. ""The Notebook,"" while masquerading as a love story, in fact, has no story at all. The plot is barely existent, the characters are one-dimensional at best and impossible to like beyond a superficial level, and the storyline is shallower than a children's inflatable pool, existing solely to pimp Sparks's Easy-Bake, feel-good concept of romance. While most ""chick-flicks"" do their best to create likable characters, humorous situations, and some sort of conflict, ""The Notebook"" is content to instead show only a slideshow reel of Kodak moments, an abstract representation of our fast-food, home shopping network society's ideal of romance.<br/><br/>""The Notebook"" is exploitive on every single level. In some ways, the film is worse than pornography, the way it masks its sleazy, purely commercial motivation under the guise of presenting a ""love"" story. In pornography, plot exists solely as a device to get from point A (the film's exposition), to point B (the sex) as quickly as possible. ""The Notebook"" uses a similar formula, but instead of graphic sex and nudity, this film's golden calf is a perfect, simplistic romance that faces conflict and challenge on the most superficial level possible. There's a massive section of the movie that contains little aside from the couple kissing each other in a variety of settings, all leading up to their first time sleeping together, which is, of course, perfect, just like everything else in this perfect, vacuous storyline.<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but I'm only allowed 1,000 words in this particular review. ""The Notebook"" is a shallow, simplistic, and wholly idiotic view of romance that seems to exist solely to make girls horny, a goal which it achieves remarkably. That being said, the film has no value on any real artistic level, be it storytelling, character development, or even simply on the level of pure entertainment. The entire film plays out like a slideshow you might play at your wedding - highlighting all the good times and ignoring anything that might make it remotely interesting. Everyone involved in the making of this film should feel dirty, especially the film-maker himself, who almost completely destroys the pre-eminence of the Cassavettes name in this one effort."

","I found this movie offensive, It's popularity is telling of the selfish delusional expectations and lack of consideration for anybody other than the couple, in fact the couples happiness should be at the expense of every other person, even when they are portrayed in good character.<br/><br/>Unlike other ""love story / chick flick"" components to movies such as titanic etc, the guy she left, who she also happened to be unfaithful to, for her ""true love"", was portrayed as a nice guy throughout the movie. No sympathy was attributed to this guy even though his loss was at the expense of her.<br/><br/>Another example of this was shown that the couple had 4 children ranging from young teen to adult. When the movie ended with the pair of them in bed both expiring at the same time, several people claim this was a happy event (a good way to go). Well it is for the 2 people, rather the one that would not have outlived the other and thus would not suffer the loss. However, they are not the only 2 people in the world, there were 4 children. I have had the misfortune of losing a parent. If I lost both at the same time, I don't think I would have thought that was such a happy event. This is another example of the focus on the ""love / romance"" at any cost to others. This happens in a lot of movies, but normally it happens less and the loss is to the ""bad guy"".<br/><br/>It goes to show how most women in our society (primarily at a young age) will over value (to say the least) the ""love / romance"" (if you want to call it that) at the expense of anybody else's happiness - even when they are portrayed as good characters."

Almost all the plot points are telegraphed in about the first 10 minutes (except for that supremely stupid ending...they died happily ever after, just because they wanted to).<br/><br/>A few observations: Why is she so surprised her mother hid the letters? Isn't that something a protective mother would do in those days? Didn't she know how to write?

People say this is the reason why I don't like the movie. I reply with ""So you only like the movie because the two old people die in the end?"" That's like saying that Jack dying at the end of Titanic is greater than the movie itself, which is a load of absolute cr*p. <br/><br/>The story is dull and boring and repetitive and takes bits and pieces from all different love stories and throws them together to create 2 hours of a nauseating love story. The two main characters have no chemistry what-so-ever...and for all you people who gasped when you found out that the old couple was actually Noah and Rachel McAdams (can't even remember the characters name it was so boring) .. if you were actually paying attention to the movie you would have realized it was obvious not even halfway into the movie instead of ""awwing"" over the characters like a child going gooey over a fluffy bunny.<br/><br/>The fact that this movie has turned into a ""Notebook"" religion is horrible. -I loved it! -Its soo sweet. -Its so sad.<br/><br/>When my friend Cait and I switched it on and expected to be sobbing our hearts out by the last act, we were mortified to find that this praised movie was nothing than your usual chick flick that usually just scraps the line of your average telemovie.<br/><br/>The movie is a joke. I have to stifle laughter when I see trailers for the movie because it is simply a chick flick with a twist ... a longer duration. <br/><br/>Please watch this movie and don't sheep it, sit there and ACTUALLY watch it! Block out the praising and see it for itself ... its nothing special, its not sweet, its not romantic... there is NOTHING memorable about this movie but somewhat everyone seems to go ga-ga over the very title. <br/><br/>Notebook schmotebook, if i'm ever made to watch this movie again I will personally place a gun to my head and shoot myself and die with a satisfied smile on my face just as the opening credits start to roll."

Seeing a girl whine and bitch about how she isn't allowed to do anything because of her parents is annoying and pathetic enough but when it involves a boarding school that's preparing one for an Ivy League college, this just reaches new levels of ignorance. The theme of finding a true love after spending years shitting your pants and forgetting the names of all those you ever loved except for one stands out as a selfish and sappy moment not to mention the repulsive character Noah dangling himself from a Ferris Wheel to get the girl to go out with him shows desperation beyond anything even I would try."

Performances by Ryan Gosling was okay but Rachel Mc Adams failed to impress, seemed to me all her scenes were overly done, with extreme anger or extreme opposite.<br/><br/>All in all, do not anticipate a classic movie here or you will be disappointed.

It has just about every ""first love"" movie cliché you can possibly think of, and has nothing new to add to them.<br/><br/>Unlike Jack & Rose in Titanic, you have absolutely no empathy for the characters, and there seems to be no good reason for their lives to have crossed. The two main characters keep swapping personality traits throughout the film. First one is weak, the other strong. The next scene it's the other way around.

He will always be the simplistic, loyal, romantic nice guy, and she will be the noisy spoiled girl that never made any decision in her life.

","I am a man who typically stays away from romantic films, but I don't object to watching one on occasion. After hearing good things about The Notebook from some friends of mine, I decided that, having nothing better to do, I'd see what the stir was about. Big mistake.<br/><br/>The Notebook is the weakest, blandest and most painfully boring drama/romance I have seen in ages. There is nothing interesting about the plot whatsoever, and the ending of the film made itself apparent right from the start. Expecting warm characters, good acting and a fun storyline, I was extremely disappointed. Instead of portraying the experience of falling in love as being the truly magical thing it is, this movie makes it seem dry, tasteless and liable to put people to sleep.<br/><br/>Thankfully I watched the film on DVD, so I had the fast-forward button readily available for the boring, wide sweeping 'romantic' scenes. If you are looking for a truly moving romantic film, I suggest Love Actually. Don't waste your time with The Notebook."

","""The Notebook"" is a trite, hackneyed tale of a poor little rich girl who falls in love with a boy from the wrong side of the tracks. It's South Carolina in the 1940's, and Allie Hamilton is a highly educated, ambitious young lady living under the watchful eyes of her snooty, upper crust parents who have pretty much mapped out her whole life for her. Enter Noah Calhoun, a poor working class boy with a devil-may-care spirit and a zest for living whom Allie falls instantly in love with while she and her parents are staying in town one summer. One look at their daughter's pawing this strapping young man from the lower social orders and the parents are hightailing it back to Charleston with the wayward Allie in tow, bringing an end to a flaming summer romance that somehow manages to live on through a subsequent world war (involving the least emotional war buddy death scene in movie history), Allie's engagement to a wealthy veteran, her eventual Alzheimer's, and Noah's disturbingly scraggly beard (he's too depressed to shave, you see).<br/><br/>Even though Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are appealing as the two young lovers, very little about ""The Notebook"" feels either original or genuine. It seems, in fact, to have been cobbled together from other, considerably more impressive tales of unrequited love in which wealth and class play a key role in keeping the lovers apart. The sad truth is that most of what happens to the pair smacks of dime-novel sentimentality and phoniness. For instance, after a night of powerhouse lovemaking between the newly reunited lovers, Allie wakes up to find herself alone with only a note from Noah telling her to follow the arrows to a surprise. And, lo and behold, what do we see but a long line of arrows lying on the floor leading from the bedroom to a sitting room down the hall. Now, is it really conceivable that Noah sat up all night with a scissors cutting out perfectly formed paper arrows, or is this just one of those scenes that could happen only in the movies? And why does Allie's mother keep all those letters from Noah - 365 of them in one year! - that she carefully hid from her daughter, only to turn them over to Allie years later all tightly wrapped up in a neat little bundle? And I won't even go into the final scene of the movie, which is the worst case of expediency over credibility that I've seen in a movie in a long long time.<br/><br/>Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, the film, written by Jan Sardi and Jeremy Levin, and directed by Nick Cassavetes, has been structured as one giant flashback, in which a now aged Noah (James Garner) is reciting the tale to Allie (Gena Rowlands), who is suffering from what the doctor calls ""senile dementia"" and so doesn't realize that the story is about them. This approach brings a certain added poignancy to the film - or at least it would were it not undercut by the sappiness of Garner's voice-over narration and that far too heavy-handed conclusion. Joan Allen gives her usual dependable performance as Allie's mother, although her character's 180 degree turnabout at the end seems more a matter of convenience than a carefully though-out metamorphosis within her character. At least the movie doesn't turn Allie's fiancé into an unreasonable and hateful villain. The writers do, at least, deserve some credit for that.<br/><br/>In a final note, the film isn't even careful with its period details. For instance, there's a shot (supposedly during war time or immediately thereafter) of characters leaving a movie theater with ""On the Town"" splashed across the marquee. The problem is that the film wasn't even released until 1949!"

","THE NOTEBOOK is the film version of the mega tear-jerker romance novel of the same name by the best-selling author Nicholas Sparks. Nick Cassevetes (son of John C.) directed his mom and a fine cast including good'old James Garner for this truly romantic movie shot at incredibly beautiful locations in South Carolina.<br/><br/>Two kids (the handsome Ryan Gosling as NOAH and the radioactively attractive Rachel McAdams as ALLIE) from wrong ends of the social spectrum fall in love despite the vociferous objection of the girl's super rich family.<br/><br/>The girl leaves town for Sarah Lawrence College while the boy continues to work at a lumberyard. Then there is WW2. The boy goes to fight in Europe. His letters (365 letters in 365 days) are conveniently hidden from ALLIE by her manipulative and class-conscious mother. So ALLIE, giving up hope on NOAH, decides to marry the handsome son of the cotton king of south, a boy she meets as a wounded soldier when she volunteers as a nurse to help the ailing vets in hospital.<br/><br/>After coming back home, NOAH refuses to quit dreaming about ALLIE and builds the home he promised long time ago to her as their future home.<br/><br/>Just before the wedding, ALLIE sees the house and a bearded and older NOAH posing in front of it in her local paper -- and she just flat passes out in front of a dozen ooohing and aaaahing southern dames while trying out her spectacular wedding gown! Then she visits NOAH for a very hot encounter and after a few more twists (will she? won't she?), she decides to forgo the millions of the cotton king and live her life with the working class NOAH as his wife.<br/><br/>Now, this story is actually told by a much older NOAH in a nursing home to his wife ALLIE, the same kids just grown very old, in an attempt to cure ALLIE's dementia by reading her the NOTEBOOK she kept for all those years -- the very story of their love that is told in long flashbacks.<br/><br/>At the end, despite some lapses, she manages to regain her memory and the movie ends with a Mother of All Tear Jerkers final scene. If you don't cry during this movie, just forget it. You never will.<br/><br/>What a relief in this day and age of terrorism and business scandals and hurricanes and global warming to watch a story of pure mad love, holding over decades despite all odds, sticking around for ages and for a lifetime. It would be unbearable to watch this kind of a movie everyday. I still need my CHINATOWN, BLOOD SIMPLE by Coen Brothers, for example, or CRASH by Paul Haggis. But I'm also very glad that unabashedly romantic writers like Nicholas Sparks do exist. We are all fortunate that he is not selling pharmaceuticals for a living anymore. We are way richer for it."

","The only thing good about this movie was the beautiful scenery. The acting was decent but I'll probably only be able to view Rachel McAdams as a popular and mean high school girl. The story was predictable and boring. I thought Allie was a superficial slut and didn't have any chemistry with Noah. Their relationship was based on looks and sexual desire. I didn't see them have a true conversation once in the movie. Not only that, but when Allie was engaged she actually went and had sex with Noah. That, to me, would seem like it would make her fiancé angry, but he didn't even care. The ending was disappointing, especially in comparison to the novel's, even though I didn't enjoy the novel either. It's one of the most overrated romances I have ever seen.

The mix of the present and the past was exceptional, Noah and Allie present and past was acted very convincingly. <br/><br/>An exploration of senile dementia and the test to see if real love can break the barriers that medicine can't. Can a teenage summer romance last a lifetime? <br/><br/>I thought the scene where Noah's girlfriend comes to visit was very well done, even though later on Allie's fickleness is a bit upsetting. And while you know or think you can guess how it will end there are a few subtle slight swerves to keep you guessing. Will Allie have an accident, who is the old guy Duke, Noah or Lon? And Gena Rowlands was fantastic as the Allie the elder, I almost fell in love with her myself and I am 30 years younger. Definitely worth the $10 entry fee and if you see it on DVD cuddle up with your other half and be prepared for the sniffles cause it's touching if you have a heart."

","You know that movie that everyone swoons over and you're like the only person who can't stand it and can't understand why so many like it? *sighs* Yeah, this is it. The Notebook—Nicholas Sparks' most notorious story, which reached out to many people and couples. This movie is talked about by almost every single couple I know. And honestlyI don't get why so many people like this movie. I thought this was HORRIBLE!<br/><br/>Alright, here's the story. In the 1940's, Noah, played by Ryan Gosling and Allie, played by Rachel McAdams fall in love over the summer, but there's one little problem: The guy's poor and the girl is rich. Yeah, sound familiar (Titanic, Dirty Dancing)? Oh, don't worry; there'll be other clichés along the way. The girl's parents aren't okay with this and the two are separated. World War II happens and the two eventually reconcile after seven years, but things have changed. Allie is now engaged to another guy, who is actually really supportive. So now that Allie has found Noah again, she is now torn between her old flame and her fiancé.<br/><br/>So what's the problem? The romance is SO manipulative. For example, how does Noah get Allie's attention at the beginning? He hangs off a Ferris wheel and asks her to date him or he'll let go. Yeah! Suicide! That was the answer to everything! That's right, men! If you want to get the girl of your dreams to go out with you, just threaten to kill yourself in front of her! Yeah, you might die, but hey! Doesn't backfire! And the dialogue between them is SO damn corny and SO cheesy and SO clichéd, it makes me wonder, why should I care about these two after seeing a setup that has been overdone countless other times? And even after he threatens to commit suicide in front of her, they see each other again and they strike up a conversation. Cos that's how women would react, right? She's not at all freaked out by this?! And another thing about it is that they talk and—I'm not kidding here—They're together in literally the next scene as a couple. Just like that. Yeah, it's that rushed.<br/><br/>And wouldn't you know it? The fights between these are so forced and half the time, they don't even make sense! After the fight from her parents, he breaks up with her and she's like ""get out of here! I don't want to see you again! I hate you!"" no, wait come back!"". What?!? Does she have multiple personality disorder?! And the second fight near the end is forced. It's written in just to make the movie seem more ""dramatic"" or a way of saying ""ooh, they're so hurt"". And the line ""I'm not afraid to hurt your feelings"". Did a guy who says that he loves her so much really just say that? ""Oh, well he's just saying that because he's not afraid to tell her when she's being unfair"". Okay, fine. But can you word that a little better?! To me, it sounds like he doesn't care about how she feels! And keep in mind; this is when she is forced to decide who she'll stay with. The fiancée is at least calm towards this and states that he'll never force her into this! The rich guy, who the movie wants you to be against, is the more believable choice!<br/><br/>Ugh. I'm sorry, but this movie really ticked me off to see how forced and manipulative the romance is and yet it surprises me to see that so many people really love this movie and how emotionally invested they are in it. Never once did this grip me. I couldn't care less about these people except for the rich guy Allie's engaged to. I couldn't care about the couple, I couldn't care about her problems, I couldn't care about anything!<br/><br/>Romance is written in a way for us to relate and hope that the main characters should come out okay in the end after so many hardships. It should be about a real couple, who go through relatable and realistic problems, which act as obstacles. Just show a couple trying to fight their way through hard times and not use these clichés over and over again. Either way, I know a lot of people like this, but as for me, this was god-awful and I will try to stay away from it as much as Allie should have stayed away from Noah to begin with."

There is a point about 10 minutes from the end when you think (with relief) that the movie is over. It certainly would have been a good place to stop; there's nothing more to add to the story. But no. The director has to go on and rub in the schmaltz just in case we thought the movie might display some subtlety.

I can't believe how many liberties they took with the story!!! It was totally ruined for me. Entire segments of Noah's life were omitted. Noah was shy and not the type of person to hang himself from a ferris wheel (which never happened in the book). He also never met Ali's parents during the summer Noah and Ali fell in love. (And I don't recall Ali going to Sarah Lawrence.) And what about Ali's art career?? They mention one little picture without indicating how important that picture was to Noah. It's movies like this that make me hate Hollywood and all the talentless producers who wouldn't know a good story if it hit them over the head. Thank goodness for independent films!

I had heard good things about it from others as well and yet I procrastinated about watching it for three months. It was as if some little voice was saying ""don't do it don't do it"" I wish I had kept listening to that little voice. The night before I was to see the DVD's owner again and did not want to lie about having watched it, I put it on. The good news is that I thoroughly cleaned the kitchen that night I couldn't bear to sit there and engage with it after the first few minutes, but I did allow it to run its course while I busied myself with useful pursuits. If I had randomly selected this film on my own, I would not have finished it.<br/><br/>Where do I start? Well, for one thing, it's predictable. I am one of those people who can NEVER see what's coming in a plot, and for me to call this whole thing within the first 7 minutes or so is pretty damning. ""Oh, lemme guess, the old couple is the young couple and she's got dementia and he reads her their own story"". Yep. And towards the end, guess what I did? I called it again. ""Oh, lemme guess, they both die together."" Yep, right again.<br/><br/>Maybe part of the reason I was so deeply offended is that I have married friends who are going through the dementia nightmare right now, and it's not like this at all. Gena Rowlands without a hair out of place, fully made up? C'mon. Flashing in and out of lucidity like she was on a light switch? Bull. It ain't like that in real life, folks, and to have it portrayed so cutesie-wootsie on screen is a poke in the eye to people who are really dealing with this illness. The only 'real' thing I saw was when Rowlands' character flipped out on James Garner; his reaction was the truest, most honest thing on the screen during the entire two hours.<br/><br/>The young actors were both terrible. I've never seen either of them in anything else and I hope I never do. The script was vapid, simplistic, and contrived. It seems hell-bent on trying to FORCE viewers to feel, rather than ALLOWING them to feel. I have a soft spot for good old James Garner and I consider him the one and only light in this entire mess.

I appreciate that as far as it goes.<br/><br/>However, as the father of a teenage girl (now 15) trying to rear her with values in this valueless world of ""sex, lies and DVD,"" I must protest.<br/><br/>Above all, young women (at least) AND young men with any integrity whatsoever did NOT behave this way in the 1930s and 40s. Such unbridled passion leading immediately to sexual gratification occurred seldom. Usually it was the young woman who, by virtue of cultivated modesty and a sense of personal worth, refused to put herself in such a predicament.<br/><br/>Certainly ""stuff happens,"" but this was NOT a typical story. The idea that a young woman, regardless of her depth of emotion, would immediately throw herself into bed with her Summer romance--not to mention one she had not seen for years--is just not reality.<br/><br/>Could it happen? Yes. Would it have happened? HIGHLY unlikely. In those days, a woman had far, far too much to lose in such a scandal.<br/><br/>This was a matter of taking modern sensibility--where ""love"" equals ""sexual passion""--and projecting it into the past, ignoring all the mores and sensibilities of that era. I repeat: It Is Just Not Realistic that a ""mature romance"" would result from such a shameful act.<br/><br/>So, it's only a movie, right? Well, my daughter viewed this with her older, married sister, and was so taken with the story. This is the way that young girls are gulled into believing this dark lie: That ""love means giving yourself to 'him' when the opportunity presents itself.""<br/><br/>Meanwhile we have our present-day dilemma, of illicit sexual relations between children with no thought of consequence, risking unwanted pregnancy, abortion, emotional trauma and low self-worth, all because these things are depicted as ""part of romance"". It is NOT reality, and it is reckless.<br/><br/>This illustrates all too clearly the widening gulf between ""Real America"" and Hollywood--and why Hollywood has done so much over the last generation to help destroy traditional values and land us in the mess we're in today.<br/><br/>In 1999, 79% of all births to women aged 15 to 19 were to unmarried women, compared with about 14% in the 1940s and 1950s (SOURCE: Nonmarital Childbearing in the United States, 1940-1999. National Vital Statistics Reports, 2000). Think of that: Even with contraception AND ABORTION available today, the RATE of unmarried teenage pregnancy coming to full term is more than FIVE TIMES what it was in the time period depicted in this movie.<br/><br/>What do you think that irresponsible film-making of this kind has contributed to that problem?<br/><br/>If you are the parent of a teenager: What messages are you sending to your sons and daughters by your support of films such as these?"
"stuck_in_lodi","4","5","7","25 July 2009"," Gosling and serene setting save otherwise drab outing
","Doesn't Rachel McAdams's acting make anyone else gag as much as me?? Ugh. Granted, Nicholas Sparks is a dismally poor writer... he relies on cliché after cliché after cliché, w/out fleshing out any of his characters or plots beyond two-dimensional predictability, but McAdams ALmost ruins the entire affair for me. Wanting to act well doesn't mean actually acting well. She is cute, perky and tries very hard, but she simply adds no depth to the bland character written by Sparks. The stunning cast surrounding her (R. Gosling, G. Rowlands, J. Garner, S. Shepard) demonstrates how flatly-written roles can be imbued w/ depth, whereas she plays it exactly as it is written: ""high-spirited Southern girl torn between Southern gentry and working-class stud"". Every time I hear her fake laugh, I cringe and have to either look away or mimic her flailings. I definitely blame Cassavetes' direction, as well; I suspect he was so taken w/ her cuteness, that he didn't recognize the vapidity of her performance. It wouldn't be the first time!! Ha ha. The remarkable acting of R. Gosling, however (have you seen Half Nelson?? Dude.), plus the stunning N. Carolina scenery, i.e., the righteous cinematography of Robert Fraisse, are what keep me coming back, time after time, even though it involves a lot or eye-rolling and heavy sighs. I do think that, given the crappy aspects of the film, the only way you will enjoy watching this one is if you're a hard-up girl :)"
"alex-richie","3","5","7","14 January 2009"," Nothing but a pretty picture full of clichés
","To be honest I'm quite amazed to see this movie so highly rated. In many ways it's just as bad as those Paris Hilton films and should be rated accordingly. Yes I do realize that ""Notebook"" is a chick flick and being a chick myself, I do like to watch romantic, ""heart-warming"" films from time to time. But to enjoy such a film I need to be able to connect with the story and sympathize with the characters, and I absolutely couldn't do that in ""The Notebook."" It's so pathetic, made up of clichés, mediocre acting and entirely predictable plot twists, that it feels like a soap-opera squeezed into a couple of hours. Rich girl falls for poor boy (could as well be poor girl - rich boy, but that would be Cinderella). They are having a summer romance with dances and kisses in the breaking waves. Then the summer's over - real life begins, and the lovebirds are being separated by the evil rich parents (how unexpected). The boy then writes the girl letter a day for a whole year (no kidding), but the evil mom keeps the mail to herself, and in the end he gives up. By the way, the story is set in 1930s-40s, however the historical aspect has little impact on the story, merely allowing the heroine to wear red lipstick, curly retro hairdos and dresses - this is basically the only element adding color to the story. Oh, yeah, there is war in the film too. But it doesn't seem to be a big deal. The main hero enlists and there is a quick glimpse of him on the battlefield as he watches his best friend die, but the next moment he's back home and never mentions war or his friend again. The pretty red-haired heroine, gets compassionate and is once seen helping out at a hospital for the wounded in the war - her spotless nurse's dress and hat look so picture perfect, as if she's about to pose for a magazine. No wonder she catches the eye of a certain heavily bandaged soldier. In a short while he's miraculously healed - not even a scratch left, and turns out to be a super rich-super handsome guy (what a coincidence) - a perfect candidate for a fiancé. In the meantime the poor guy is still unable to like another woman and instead gets busy restoring the old house, secretly hoping that his dream girl will be back once more in his arms. The finished house looks so impressive (and absolutely impossible to have been built by one single carpenter) that it attracts the press. When the girl see the picture of the guy and his house she faints immediately (is it a comedy after all?) and decides to take a ride to ask the guy if ""he's OK."" To be honest, till the last moment I had hoped that the movie will have at least one surprise in store. None. The story was getting cheesier with every minute. The fact there is a sub-plot - showing an old man reading the love story to an old woman, doesn't make the film any more original, as everything in it is as predictable as the rest."
"MOscarbradley","2","5","7","15 June 2006"," Dire
","Ryan Gosling is far too good an actor for this mawkish rubbish about young love and old love and eternal love. I knew things were bad when I started admiring the ducks on the lake. Gosling is the boy from the wrong side of the tracks who has a summer romance with rich girl Rachel McAdams, (who has the kind of face you are unlikely to remember from one movie to the next). They lose each other and just as predictably find each other again and all the time nice old codger James Garner tells the story of their 'great' love to Gena Rowlands who has senile dementia. No brownie points for filling in the gaps.<br/><br/>Rowlands is sensational considering she doesn't have anything to do but look vacant and Joan Allen is simply brilliant as McAdams' rich bitch of a mother. The fact that Allen is one of the best actresses in America helps. She can rise above the most mediocre of material and this is truly mediocre; appallingly scripted, indifferently directed and if a few members of the cast are giving it more than it's worth, they can still hardly be said to be redeeming the material."
"JWBly","3","5","7","6 November 2005"," Poignant but predictable
","I just viewed this movie last night, as part of a $5 bet with a girl. She told me she would pay me $5 if I did not like the movie. Since she had been right before, most notably with the enjoyable Bill Murray vehicle LOST IN TRANSLATION, I decided to give this one a try.<br/><br/>My verdict? Standard ""chick flick"" with the obligatory tear-jerking moments. Unusually predictable storyline even for a woman's movie, standard to substandard acting, and obviously fake facial hair which provides an unintentional comic distraction. While it was pleasant to see the former YOUNG HERCULES star trying a dramatic role, he looked lost without his companions from that show, and possibly a good fight scene to liven up the plot. Of course, if it contained a good fight, it wouldn't be a ""chick flick"" - would it guys?<br/><br/>It is not a bad film, and it has a good message. Trust me though - I was happy to collect the $5 at the end, and that made the whole evening worthwhile. Skip this film - unless you're trying to impress a girl of course."
"armstrongd_uk","3","5","7","1 May 2005"," A film travesty of a touching novel
","This is one of the rare times I have read, and deeply enjoyed, a novel shortly before seeing a film adaptation (of which I had not been aware until noticing it in the local video shop). In comparison to the novel, this film was such a disappointment. In my opinion, a travesty.<br/><br/>My wife and I agreed (and that is a fairly rare event in our appraisal of films!) that the casting of all the leading roles, without exception (except Noah's father, who didn't even figure in the novel!), was inappropriate and unsympathetic, and that the special qualities that made this short and economically written book so touching and memorable were lost in the film version. Even the house shown in the film was not all evocative of the one Noah had restored. Above all the descriptions and mood created around Noah on the river at sunrise, and the magical trip leading to the 'bird lake', such powerful images in the book, and of his poetry, were played down to a minimal level.<br/><br/>It was as if the task of adaptation to screen was handed to someone who kept only the title and bare outline of the story and then proceeded to create a different, and vastly inferior and less powerful work.<br/><br/>What a shame The Notebook has not enjoyed a truly sympathetic or sensitive adaptation like The Bridges of Madison County, Enchanted April or even the recent Ladies in Lavender. The power of the novel deserved this. Perhaps a European director (or Clint Eastwood) would have done it more justice.<br/><br/>A missed opportunity."
"SpiderCider","4","5","7","30 July 2004"," A movie that could have been amazing...
","I really hate it when something like this happpens, you have a movie, with an amazing story, with unlimited potential, and then Hollywood has to go and screw it up by casting it with teen ""hearthrobs"". There is so much wrong with this movie it's not even funny. Small stuff that anyone making a movie should know, most of it's just common sense. Ryan Gosling was wrong for this part for a number of reasons, the part needed a good actor. He had about three emotions in the movie, ""smile"", ""loving anger"", and ""lonley"". That's all. The role should be contended for best actor at the Academy Awards, but they had to give it to someone based on looks, it's ridiculous. James Garner and Gene Rowlands were just pathetically fake. Their acting was so over the top and so bad it made me laugh several times in the movie. This movie has a very good story, but it was ruined by Hollywood. Who knows, maybe in 20 years they will remake it with better actors, hopefully."
"DavidYZ","1","8","13","20 April 2017"," Lame chick flick
","I'm puzzled at how popular this sentimental melodrama is. The on-off couple at the centre of this aren't likable, nor are they believable together. <br/><br/>Perhaps it's impossible for me to like it simply because it's intended for a female audience."
"qck1","3","8","13","25 December 2008"," Main actors did not feel like they were southerners from 1950
","I am sorry, but this is another movie that I thought the actors used for the main characters were inappropriate; they did not bring across the feeling they grew up in the south in the 50s. If one grew up in the south in the 1950s there would be a certain speech, and dignity that I felt not one of the main characters brought across. If they were going to use these actors, they should have put it in a different location, which, also, would have changes a lot more. Now the supporting actors/actress all were very good, at least I felt they were southerners. I also felt the story was a bit contrived, but the proper actors probably could have pulled it off."
"tjw-buckeyes","10","8","13","3 April 2005"," Notebook is a must see; Possible Spoiler...Beware if you've not seen it.
","My husband and I watched this with another couple. All four of us really enjoyed the movie. It is a wonderful movie that I will recommend to everyone I know. I must admit that I'm not normally a ""cryer"", but I highly recommend that no one watch this film unless you have a steady supply of tissues close at hand. *****SPOILER???****(this is my first comment on this site, so I don't know if this is a spoiler or not??? Better to be safe and mark it so)<br/><br/>I loved the scene when Noah took Allie to the old mansion for the first time, and even though they wanted to ""prove their love"", he was still gentleman enough to say that she didn't have to go through with it if she wasn't ready and that he could wait...that's more indicative of true love instead of just some hungry male trying to get in her pants. I loved, loved, loved this movie...but I didn't understand why her mother would keep all those letters. IF she really desperately wanted Noah out of her daughter's life, then why wouldn't she have destroyed them on the spot? And weren't there inconsistencies with hair colors? Did anyone notice? ********<br/><br/>All in all, minor discrepancies aside,this is a must see. For all ages, men and women will love this film. I will certainly add this to my DVD collection."
"TxMike","Null","8","13","11 February 2005"," Heartbreaking and uplifting at the same time.
","We have this older man, Duke (James Garner at his best) who comes to a nursing home daily with a notebook. He seeks out this pretty older woman (Gena Rowlands) and reads to her from the notebook. She likes the story, she looks forward to hearing what happens next in the lives of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams). The main of the movie is set in the 1940s, as we see Noah and Allie meeting one summer in South Carolina, then the triumphs and disappointments of their relationship over the next 7 years. Fine movie-making, fine acting, a good story. The DVD picture and sound are first-rate, the making-of extras interesting. <br/><br/>MAJOR SPOILERS FOLLOW. We figure out mid-way through the running time that Duke is really Noah in old age, and the lady he reads to is Allie, suffering dementia. Most of the time she doesn't know who he is, and doesn't recognize their children when they visit. They plead with dad to ""come back home"", but he says ""She is my home"", so much was his love for her. He was reading from the notebook she wrote of their romance back in the 1940s, with the inscription, ""Read this to me and I will come back."" He never knew when, but after reading to her for a while she would ""come back"", she would recognize him, they would share a few minutes, before she reverted. The doctors thought it impossible.<br/><br/>In 1940 Noah, from a poor upbringing, worked at the local saw mill. Allie was vacationing for the summer with her wealthy family, who expected her to go to college in New York and marry a wealthy young man. When the summer fling did not end promptly, Allie was taken home, Noah knew of the disapproval of the parents. They parted, he wrote every day for one year, but received no answers. Allie's mom had hidden all the letters. Noah moved to Atlanta, war broke out, he served and fought, made it home safely. Meanwhile Allie in college volunteered in a VA hospital, caring for the wounded, where she met her eventual fiancée.<br/><br/>Noah's dad sold the family home, gave Noah the money so he could buy and renovate the old mansion by the water that he and Allie had dreamed 7 years earlier of living and growing old in. Going to Charleston to get permits, he sees Allie on the street, finds her in a restaurant, but leaves unseen when she meets and kisses her fiancée. Noah goes back to work on the old home while Allie and her mom prepare for the wedding. <br/><br/>With Noah still in her mind, she makes a last-minute trip back and finds him, the house was complete, even the room for painting that she had requested. He told her he did it all because he had promised it to her. Mom shows up, she shows him a laborer who, 25 years earlier, she had been in love with, suggesting that maybe she regretted marrying for security. Allie decides to go with her heart, she and Noah get married, and all that brings us back to the nursing home almost 60 years later. <br/><br/>While heartbreaking, the ending is also uplifting. After suffering his third ""minor"" heart attack in a few months, Duke returns to Allie's bed, she recognizes him, wonders if they can ""go together."" He lies down next to her, they hold hands, and are found that way the next morning, having been taken to their reward during the night. Many may find that overly sappy, but to me it is the perfect ending to a lifetime love affair."

","Girl meets poor boy and they are kept apart by mean stereotypical rich parents. She then gets engaged to a very nice man and sees it fit to cheat on him with her ex. But it all ends well because she is SO IN LOVE with her ex. I don't think that helped her fiancé very much...<br/><br/>I can't understand why this film is so popular. Perhaps it is because it lets women feel like anything they do is justifiable as long as they do it for ""love"". It encourages selfish behaviour and revokes any responsibility in favour of instant gratification.<br/><br/>Besides that, it was all very predictable and slow.<br/><br/>Finally, speaking as a woman whose grandfather had serious dementia, I think it was really really ridiculous that he would confuse and upset her daily like that just for his own selfish needs. Anyone who has been around dementia sufferers would see how unkind/not at all plausible this story line is."

","The Notebook is a simple example of Hollywood tying to make life out to be all happy, simple and like a fairytale. I had to sit through this movie, and boy was it boring. It dragged on and on and on. It had a very stupid script, with corny and idiotic lines from poems that are trying to make this movie memorable. Well let me tell you its only memorable for the lack of quality in this movie. The only good thing about this are the special effects (such as the boat scene at the start), which is why i gave it 2/10 instead of 1/10. The reason this movie is so bad is because it is using a story that has already been beat to death in the movie industry - the happy ending love story. Also the stupid idea of the old lady (who ends up being the female main character just older) magically regaining her memory temporarily, despite the fact she has dementia! Wow, what a miracle! All in all i give this boring, predictable and unoriginal movie 2/10 simply on the fact that the acting is average and the camera work and special effects are passable."
"nbellechan","5","6","9","25 May 2007"," Honestly!
","OK, when you haven't read the book, it must be the most amazing movie ever, but for me, it was really disappointing to watch. when I was about 10, I read this book, and I LOVED it (despite the love parts thing). But anyway, the book was really inspiring. I cannot believe this movie had a high rating when it the book was much better than the movie. Plus, the book shows much more emphasis on how the two actually loved each other. The movie was just too dull for me compared to the book. My advice is, read the book first than watch this movie if you haven't. The book is the most touching love story I have read.<br/><br/>some corrections that I want to say: this movie sort of showed two young lovers who just ran away, and just got lucky with their relationship. It actually makes the movie look bad!!!! first of all, it should have showed how much deeper their love is than making out and stuff that made themselves attracted to each other. If their love is that shallow, it just shows some madly in love teenagers who would break up eventually. Plus, there were a lot of scenes that was totally different from the book. when they make book movies, they must show what the person is thinking even though they can't exactly blurt it out, since it is a film. well, it will be more difficult to do this, but they have to find a way, because everything comes out differently when it is just acting."

I've never seen a well played movie within a movie.<br/><br/>Some part that agitated me was when the movie was getting good but then they would cut back to present day! I mean that was the point of the movie to keep it suspenseful like but here I am crying my eyes out wanting to find out more!! I was very disturbed with Allie, as an older women, having that memory problem because that just isn't how I would picture a love story. Felt really bad for her husband but give him props for still loving and wanting to be with her.<br/><br/>I was very surprised seeing Rachel McAdams playing Allie after seeing her in previous teen movies ""Hot Chick"" and ""Mean girls"", but her acting in this movie was pretty phenomenal. And Ryan Gosling...very good looking actor who played his character well.<br/><br/>I think, though, that they caught Allie's and Noah's stories short towards the ending.

","Overall, nice little movie. But it is also a bit 'tricked out.' That is, it is a bit manipulative and overly sentimental. I LIKE romantic movies, generally, and even some intensely emotional ones.

But here, I was (and to my great surprise) put off a bit by some of the formulaic vibe of the movie. It was kind of corny, and silly, and inauthentic. Again, though, it was nonetheless watchable. I gave it a 6 out of 10, and would have posted a 6.5 if I could have.<br/><br/>James Garner is magnificent in everything. Gena Rowlands is good, and good here. The guy, Ryan Gosling, may be a great human being, but his screen persona is too creepy for me (recall his total creep-out role in 'Murder by Numbers'). The chick was good--- Somebody Mc-Something.

Gosh.....Its a trap.I like romance but it must contain a minimum standard obviously not something like ""Love at first sight"" or ""and then they happily lived ever after"" or ""born for each other "".The movie starts with pre-affair condition between two teenage noah and allie like all other cheap teen movies and then breaks them up by highlighting the financial discrepancy between two families. The ending is horrible as well that tries to prove that they are in so deep love that they must die together.Comparatively ""Lake house"" or ""serendipity"" are far better than this one. Although It has placed in top 250 i have to say that it is a very healthy teen movie.As i am not a teenage anymore it breaks my heart."

","Mixed feelings about this one. Saw it on HBO,cuz I would never pay a cinema ticket for a movie with R.McAdams again after Red Eye.The dialog had its moments and the filming was pretty nice.Story was somewhat corny, but it was suppose to be primarily romantic, so it didn't bother me much.Where the movie really kinda falls apart is that it almost never puts emphasis on the complexity of the human emotions.It is almost like the director was going: ""Ok,ok,this is where the audience feels romantic and identifies with everything,let's not complicate things any further and stick to that.Too bad, because the movie might have had potential.For ex., there is a scene where Noah and Mrs ""Born with a silver spoon in my mouth"" have a final argument and discussion outside the parents house.I liked the dialog and the acting, only the whole thing stops where it was getting interesting.Some more ""I hate you""-s,""Go to hell"" and some more hysteria would have been more realistic and maybe some long shots insisting on the characters emotions would have created a more complete picture. The same pattern of ""stop here,it will get hazy and confuse the audience"" is followed throughout the movie, culminating with a final scene between Allie and Lon where he is behaving with the utmost nobility and selfishness and the scene ends....right there.My point is, the characters are...well...incomplete and to some extent unrealistic and one-sided. Too bad, because the subject was treated decently otherwise and had some interesting issues.It deserved a 5 or 6 from me actually, but R.McAdams, as always, manages to wake the subjective beast in me.Will somebody stop casting this woman, please !!!!!!"

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>There's a lovely Shinto tradition of folding prayers and leaving them on trees. The more clever, careful and perfect the fold, the more whole the message will be.<br/><br/>I am in the midst of writing a book about `folding' in film. Folding in this context refers to layers of some kind that carry double meaning. The simplest and easiest to describe is the kind of folding in this little movie.<br/><br/>A movie is a message sent to us and sugared enough in some way that we will receive it. One of the most effective flavorings is the `love story' which though invented by books is now exclusively owned by cinema. The message we send to ourselves and our loved ones about what love IS is a message that comes from films, each of which is a lower order of message.<br/><br/>Sparks understands this, so he devises stories about messages. With `Message in a Bottle,' he did it simply with one layer. Here, he employs three, which added to the two above makes five folds in this slick film, five origami birds approaching our window.<br/><br/>Sparks' three messages are:<br/><br/><ul><li>the one from Noah to Allie every day</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the notebook of the title that Allie wrote, effectively to herself to use her love to bring herself back to her love</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>the letters that Noah wrote, one per day for a year.</li></ul><br/><br/>Now whether you find the gauzy valentine haze too sweet, or the notion of the world (not just the world of love) too smooth and safe, you have to admire how this film was conceived. These sorts of things don't happen by accident, they are engineered by people who study the deep cognitive mechanics of this business. Oddly, the plot suggests that happy unengineered accidents are what are more real.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 3: Has some interesting elements."
"pkatzzz","2","9","16","9 April 2005"," This movie was vapid and trite
","Sorry, folks, but I'm getting the impression that the people on here who just loved this movie are a bunch of 16 year old girls who haven't a clue as to what makes a good movie - they just see this ""really cute guy"" on the screen and it's instantly SO romantic!!!<br/><br/>First of all, I really do love romantic movies - but well made ones. I like ones where the acting is good, the writing is not trite and amateurish, the characters are believable and likable. I like the kind of romantic movies where I actually CARE what happens to the lovers. I could not have cared less about Noah and whatever the chick's name was (i saw it last night, and i've already forgotten her name). I thought the actor who played him was hideous - he mumbled his words and basically just walked through the part. The girl was irritating as hell. I just did not see or feel ANY chemistry between them - I couldn't see what she saw in him and I certainly couldn't see what he saw in her, her personality drove me nuts. and I kept wondering - what did Noah actually do for a living to support himself as an adult? I mean, you can't renovate a house like that for FREE - and you certainly can't make a living by renovating your own house all day. <br/><br/>So many things didn't make sense or were so unbelievable to me:<br/><br/>1. Why did Noah keep showing his house, then when he had the opportunity to sell it, he kept turning the buyers down? Either decide to sell it or not, but wishy washy behavior was weak. 2. Sorry, I'm 45 years old and I have NEVER seen or known a man to pine away for years over some girl he met when he was 17 years old to the point where he becomes a drunk and has passionless relationships with other terrific women (as did Noah with the very beautiful and sweet widow, who frankly seemed to have more substance to her than his ditzy old girlfriend). I mean, REAL men move on... 3. Speaking of moving on, it didn't seem real hard for the girl (still can't remember her name) to move on to another man. And why not? He was smart, sweet, successful, mature, thoughtful, hardworking, loving, handsome - everything mature women really want. But no, the girl really wanted some apparently unemployed, immature kid with a constant hang-dog expression on his face. I mean, come on, this revealed to me that the girl was extremely immature ""i love you..but I love him too!!!"" Perhaps they deserved each other after all! 4. OK, we're supposed to believe that the mother was STILL crying over some day laborer guy she broke up with 25 years earlier to marry a rich, handsome, nice man? Oh, please. Were we REALLY supposed to feel sorry for her as she boo-hood into her hankie saying ""boo hoo, I keep wondering what would've happened if I had married him instead of your father. Boo hoo"". You wanna know what would've happened if she HAD married the day laborer? She would've have been BITCHIN in the trailer park to her husband, ""you lazy, drunk A$$hole! I coulda married a rich man, but No, I had to let my ""heart"" lead me and now I'm poor and married to a filthy day laborer!!"" Most likely, she wouldn't have had the fancy car to even drive by the mansion where the rich man she ""coulda married"" lived! Nor would she have had the well-dressed, Sarah Lawrence-educated daughter with her to boo hoo to.<br/><br/>5. Hmmm, by my calculation, her daughter was 25 years old when her mother drove her to see the laborer at work...I kept expecting to FINALLY see a twist, a surprise in the movie. I thought the mother was going to confess that the day laborer was really her daughter's father!! But no, the writer decided to have EVERY aspect of this movie 100% predictable.<br/><br/>I can't waste anymore time for this movie - I couldn't believe how predictable it was (hell, I figured it out while reading the DVD description!), how i didn't care about any of the characters, how trite the dialog was, a la ""Do you think our love can make miracles happen?"", how bad the acting was...<br/><br/>Hey, I'm a softy as much as the next woman - movies like Casablanca, My Dog Skip, The Enchanted Cottage, Big Fish, Mr. Hollands Opus make me cry and cry. But this movie was not even SAPPY, just CRAPPY."

The characters playing the younger versions of the leads were so void of personality that I just didn't care if they ever found each other again. I think this film wanted to be a deep and moving testament to the power of true love. I'm sorry that it lacked that sort of gravity. It was more like the English Patient on a half a Valium and a tab of X. The leads wallow around in sappy, sobbing love scenes that didn't move me as a viewer. The most irritating part was the dismissal of the Young male lead's girlfriend when the female lead moves into the house. They all have coffee and everyone is fine with what is happening. She drives away in her car saying what a great girl the female lead was, after it was well established she had great affection for the male lead.<br/><br/>this film was a waste of time."

If you buy into that baloney, then by all means, please buy this film, watch it, believe in love that is described in the movie, and continue to be delusional about life.<br/><br/>Though James Garner and Gena Rowlands put on formidable performances (worthy of Oscars for best supporting roles), the story and script was nothing short of complete pit bottom garbage. Clichés are the pillars of the movie, while the acting by Gosling and McAdams made me sick.

","I like Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen. They acted well here but could not save the bland and contrived plot and the awkwardness and cheese oozing out of Ryan Gosling, as a prime example of the unbearable characterization with which the movie's 2nd half is filled. (the 1st half till they broke up at summer is pretty watchable). As Allie turned to leave Noah's house after her mother's visit and Noah broke out in a rage while reciting superfluous dialogue with a stiff palm on his chest, I just could not watch his performance for a second more (good thing there wasn't any more of it)! How on earth does a man sound so justified at getting mad at a woman leaving him, necessarily and potentially temporarily to sort out a melodramatic mess because she's engaged to someone else? Here's a loser who spent all his life missing a girl without any other ostensible ideals or goal in life (given I didn't read the book), and whose morals and maturity, assumed to be sound by default owing to an upbringing of stereotypical paternal love and wisdom, are now collapsing into a heap. Other parts that made me laugh/cringe include widow on the verge of going back to loneliness, her place taken by a prettier and richer girl, experiencing sublime feelings of love and hope, cheesy teary old Noah, and Joan Allen's sudden hysterics of ""I love your father"". So every rich girl needs a poor boy and then gets split for romance? I always thought the American depiction of love and human nature is much more true to life, but it seems traditions are traditions, from the Qiong Yao and Korean dramas to America in the 40s, lol. For Rachel McAdams I would give it a 6; a 5 for the over-ratedness and complete lack of empathy in characterization."

Boring. The subplot or whatever with the old man reading to the old woman is interwoven inexpertly and there is very minimal suspense before you figure out who these guys really are. To be fair, some of the scenes are very beautiful, and the rain storm scene was actually really good, but that doesn't make up for the other hour and a half of clichés.

","A fairly boring film that will appeal to people who have no sense of history. Too many anachronisms (like Allie beginning a sentence with 'Like' which did not become a speech habit in the US until the 1970s; or Noah's hair after the war - again more '70s than late '40s or '50s). The manners and behavior are also not in keeping with the times. And Allie screaming all the time as a means of conveying 'emotions' gets grating after awhile - just want to tell her to shut up already.

"tasnim82009","3","3","4","30 December 2014"," The Notebook: Soppy, Cheesy, a bucket full of Cringe and just plain Bad
","CONTAINS SPOILERS<br/><br/>All that can be said is that if you do choose to watch this film and happen to have a weak constitution for slushy mushiness, you are advised to have your sick bags at the ready; or if you're feeling exceptionally sensitive, a box of tissues or maybe 4.<br/><br/>The film begins in present day, as an old man calling himself Duke, superbly portrayed by James Garner, reads a tale from his Notebook about two star-crossed lovers from the 1940's: Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Ally (Rachel McAdams). He's a poor labourer with a passion for love and poetry whilst she's a high-flying society girl with rich parents who naturally, don't approve of the love affair; so far so cliché  Even from the onset we can just see what sort of romantic cliché this film will turn out to be. So typical. A story of how love conquers all, how nothing matters but love, love makes everything become hunky dory; how beautiful! Not. 'The Notebook' may have you in tears, but it had me gagging right from the beginning. <br/><br/>A summer of love and romance, that's what it was! They were together all summer long and couldn't take their eyes (or hands) off each other. Isn't it weird to be able to do that in public in the 1940s? - especially as they were unmarried, oh and wasn't that random house in the middle of nowhere so very convenient? Regardless, they were completely and utterly madly in love with each other. Aww, isn't that just adorable? Because what do we have if we don't have love? Well, money according to Ally's parents, lots and lots of money. Such typical parents they were, haven't we had enough of parents not approving of the poverty stricken bad guy? Oh parents and their dubious morals eh?<br/><br/>Despite the fact they came from completely different backgrounds, they did have a few things in common: They were both crazy, they both did mad things (like lying on a road and waiting for death) and most importantly, they were both CRAZY about each other, ugh someone pass me a sick bucket, please!<br/><br/>Obviously, the couple were destined to be apart and eventually when Ally's parents couldn't separate them, war did. Have we not had enough 'war' stories to last us a lifetime? Do we really need anymore? Apparently yes and a terrible one at that. I mean be original, we need something special not a Romeo and Juliet copycat. And this whole concept of war is just horrible because there was so much more pain and suffering to the second world war than it shows in the film. As if every significant thing that happens in this world is just suddenly linked to some sickening love story. <br/><br/>But oh, it doesn't end there! They meet once again 7 years later when Noah is advertised in a newspaper and everything comes back to Ally again who starts to feel like that love stricken 17 year old once again! Oh like we didn't see that one coming! What is the need to make things so obvious? But after they meet, do they rekindle their romance straight away and get married, live happily ever ¬¬¬¬¬¬after so very wonderfully? Nope, there's a twist: Ally's engaged to the man of her parents' dreams and apparently, hers too uh oh<br/><br/>What makes this film all the more boring is how it constantly flashes back and forth from the past to present day. In the present day we find out that the woman 'Duke' has been reading to happens to be Ally (now not so greatly played by Gena Rowlands) with a profound case of dementia (ooh plot twist). However this is not any type of dementia it's such a 'special' case that for about 5 minutes at the end of every day Ally remembers everything! <br/><br/>The soppiest part was when her children came to visit and were so VERY disheartened by Ally's ability to remember her own children, therefore attempting convince their father Duke (or should I say the very special Noah) to come and live with them again. Oh what caring children they are! I feel like this twist was also quite an obvious because, why else would it start off with an old man reading a story to an old woman? Obviously, these people mean something no? In my opinion, the whole film is completely predictable so the film really is a pointless mess.<br/><br/>What a sentimental fantasy! I mean how on earth would that in any way be logical? Well I guess films are not supposed to be, especially not love films. Nope this one in particular is exceptionally magical because everything (and I really do mean EVERYTHING) seems to work out in their favor, even when Ally essentially no longer has a purpose to her life. Assuming you are not going to watch the film after reading this, let me just ruin it for you completely and tell you that THEY DIE IN EACH OTHER'S ARMS. And that is my friends, how this story ends. I hope, I have not written this for nothing, do not watch this film, or read the book as you may love it and become brainwashed by how ridiculous it is. <br/><br/>So, ladies and gentleman, I hope I've finally persuaded you enough that The Notebook really isn't worth your time. There's so much more you could do with those two hours, really there is. I'd rather sit and watch someone laugh hysterically then go through another two hours of my time watching that. But obviously not everything's all that bad, it's just personal opinion. You have been warned."
"ironhorse_iv","8","3","4","29 June 2014"," If you're a bird, I'm a bird. I like flying with the Notebook. It's a good movie.
","Come fly with the Notebook. Directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the novel of the same name by Nicholas Sparks. The movie is about Duke (James Garner) an elderly man, trying to re-spark the memory of his dementia suffering love one, (Gena Rowlands) by using a notebook about a young couple love affair during one summer in 1940. It's here, the movie flashback from present day to 1940, where we're introduce to worker man, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) trying to work out, their own relationship. While, it's not a healthy relationship like the novel. The chemistry between them are pretty good, when you get to see them as being a lovely couple. The movie still has more arguing and fighting then love scenes. It's a bit overwhelming, but without conflict, it would be a really boring chick flick. It kinda hurt the film, but kinda doesn't in a way. First off, both people really put each other in danger. The first bad sign was when Noah climbed up on that Ferris Wheel and threatened to kill himself by letting go if she didn't go out with him. Sure, it seems cute in the movie, but imagine if a guy did that in real life. You would be calling 911, thinking he's a psychopath. Honestly, he almost get her run over by a car by lying in the street. That's a sign of unstable, ladies. I have to give props to Ryan Gosling for making these scenes, more charming like a crazy lover, than crazy stalker. Also, Allie is no Southern Peach here, too. She's abandon him multiples times, beat him with slapping him in the face or punching his chest and cheats on her current boyfriend, Lon (James Marsden). At less, the movie doesn't make them too unlikeable. The relationship here, is way more realistic than the unrealistic cheese in the novel. The supporting cast is alright, but they're so clichés characters like the mother (Joan Allen). It's so generic, to have a mother that doesn't want her to date this guy in these films. At less, I have to say, Joseph Stalin mustache, Allie's dad (David Thornton) was pretty cool. Also, James Marsden has to be the most typecast actor for the role of woman cheats on her current boyfriend for a much hotter guy. This guy doesn't get a break! The writing is pretty clichés archetypical story of the Boy Meets Girl. Examples of this, are with establish scenes like kissing the rain, romantic boat rides, and others. Honestly, the things trying to pull them apart is ridiculous unrealistic and could had been solved. It felt really dumb. Like why Noah couldn't go to New York? He's alright with going to a new city with his friend, Fin. (Kevin Connolly), but not with Allie? Also, how on earth, Allie's mother, able to gather all her mail, if Noah wrote that much letters. You would thought, for one whole year, Allie might beat her mother to the mailbox, at less once. Also, it's not uncommon to people to call other people back in those days. The only thing that could make sense, is World War 2, but they really pan over it, quickly. It's ends as fast as it started in the film. Honestly, if they kept the WW2 part, going longer. It would make a way better pull apart conflict. Instead, the movie really misused that. The twist in the end, wasn't really much of a twist as the movie kinda hints at it, 2/4 in. The cinematography is pretty good for the film. Still, the director hits you over the head with a bird metaphor. It's everywhere, here. Enough with the birds! The movie really does look like it takes place in the 1940s, but like any movie in the places, there are some historic inaccuracies. I do love the references to 'Leaves of Grass' by Whit Whitman. It's themes of faith and fate in the poem, """"Song of Myself,"" are two topics serve to foreshadow future revelations in later parts of the film. Glad, it's not a throw-away line as it brought up multiples time in the film. Noah's love for poetry, music, and the outdoors all play important roles in The Notebook, not only adding interest to a number of scenes but also deepening Noah as a character. The biggest different between the book and the film is the fact, that Allie didn't write a notebook at all. It's seem like Noah wrote the notebook, but it's not really mention. The best thing that made this movie really good is the theme of love conquer all, when Alzheimer is a setback. This part, made the movie so watchable. While, the ending is bittersweet. It was a better way to end the movie, then the novel. The movie being PG-13, didn't really hurt the film. It does show that you can still show a great sex scene without one shot of nudity. The violence is pretty tame, as the WW2 years are passed over, quickly. I can say, this movie works better than a lot of modern young adult novels. Overall: The Notebook isn't anything new, if you follow chick flick movies, or know anything about romantic novels. The one thing that made this movie really good is the struggle of remembering love ones. That is the backbone of the story. It's the reason, why this movie works."

It is not that I am so jaded, but ultimately I see the relationship between the two as troubling rather than beautiful.<br/><br/>And even if it was ""just beautiful"", have we not seen it before? Isn't it kind of like The Titanic (minus the sinking ship) set in the deep south on the cusp of WWII? The actors were very good at playing people I would not care to know.

","Firstly let me say i'm a lover of romantic films (Titanic is one of my favorites) and when i go into a romantic film i expect cheesy lines and clichés...but i just could not ""get"" this film, i found it laughably cheesy...roll your eyes, ""i cant believe they just said that"" cheesy.<br/><br/>The film begins with an old couple and through a story telling session we begin to learn of the romance between rich, beautiful Allie (McAdams) and the poorer, handsome Noah (Gosling).<br/><br/>The main problem i had with this pairing was how unlikely the whole thing seemed, Noah meets Allie and without even a sentence uttered between them, in only minutes of meeting... he threatens to kill himself if she does not go out with him, there he is hanging off a fair ground ride, putting himself in danger all for a girl he only met literally 2 minutes ago....REALLY? it just felt too unrealistic for a film obviously trying for a realistic romance.<br/><br/>Mcadams and Gosling have strong chemistry, they are very talented actors and i was impressed with both of them..but something about their romance just did not work for me, good acting can only take you so far...i never felt connected to these characters, i never felt involved but i don't for one minute blame this on the actors.<br/><br/>Second MAJOR issue: The old couple storyline, not only is it MASSIVELY predicable meaning the so called ""omg"" twist as to who this old couple is becomes just another eye roller...but its horribly cliché, cheesy and badly acted....i often think i might have enjoyed this film had it only focused on the young allie/noah story (at least the acting was top-notch). these old couple scenes are filled with one cringe-worthy line after another.<br/><br/>The ending was also another massive fail, it tried to be sweet/romantic but came of as predicable and corny...it almost felt like the ending to one of those made for TV movies.<br/><br/>All in all despite very worthy acting from its leads this film was just TOO cheesy for me to take<br/><br/>My advice: go watch Titanic, it has the same rich girl/poor boy concept thats MUCH more believable, it has an old lady flashback storyline but again thats done so much better...its just an overall more romantic film....and the cheesy lines work."

","Before I watched this movie, I was looking for a nice drama to watch and since everyone was telling me that this is such a great and wonderful and warm and fuzzy and emotional film, I gave it a shot. During those two hours I was just waiting for something great to happen. I thought the movie was going to be remarkable, exceptional and all that, but I am very disappointed. I think this movie is just a cliché after a cliché. The guy is poor and she is rich and her parents won't let her be with him - what a classic. Of course she is all nice and doesn't know how to have fun in a way only he knows - doing irrational things which are supposed to make the characters feel as if that's the only right way to enjoy their ""love"" - lying in the middle of the road (I don't think so). And that is supposed to be fun. After 2 minutes, I knew that the old man and the old lady are actually Noah and Allie... There are no quotes to remember, nothing interesting and unexpected. Of course, I guess we all knew she will come back to him in the end, because she loves him - dirty, dumb guy with whom she fights all the time. It is obvious that she is only physically attracted to him, she acts like a really stupid girl. I have to admit that her fiancé is a little too perfect, kind of phony. I gave this movie 3 stars, because it isn't all that bad. It did make me feel tender in the end, but only a bit, nothing spectacular. I just don't understand how people keep falling for these things over and over again. It certainly does not deserve a 10. And I apologize if I didn't spell everything right, because English is not my native language..."
"Minerva_Meybridge","5","3","4","23 September 2008"," Ruined by Miscasting
","The story was mediocre. Don't rush out and buy it on DVD unless you're a guy who is totally hot for Rachel McAdams, who is stand-out beautiful in the film. What bothered me was the the obvious miscasting. James Garner plays an old Ryan Gosling and Gina Rowlands an old Rachel McAdams. Come on! What was director Nick Cassavetes thinking? I know exactly what; find his mother, Gina Rowlands a role. Had he gone with make-up for Ryan and Rachel, it would have been a far, far better. It just struck me as unbelievable, especially Garner's pairing with Gosling. They look about as much alike as Queen Elizabeth and President George. The problem was, though, that while in a book, the true identities of the ancients can be masked, seeing them, make-up or not, would have given the plot away on film. I had no problem accepting the old woman in Titanic as a rundown version of Kate Winslet. But this was too much of a stretch. Remember Saving Private Ryan, how good a job they did making Matt Damon not only look old, but make him look like an old Tom Hanks? Another fouled movie was Norma Jean and Marilyn, where Ashley Judd and Mira Sorvino both play Marilyn Monroe, which drew a big, ""Huh?"" from me.<br/><br/>I also found the present-day aspects of this film way too depressing. I get the undying husbandly love and all, but to go from alluring to Alzheimer's in one fell swoop was just unnecessarily cruel. In book form it's one thing. We can conceive of people growing old, their minds wandering off into oblivion, but the fantasy seemed to have gotten mixed in with reality TV. And their deciding to die together all at once without any medical aids stretched all credibility.<br/><br/>One last comment about the outfit Rachel McAdams wore when she revisited Noah, a white dress with red trim, red hat, red earrings, red gloves. Two thumbs up for costume designer, Karyn Wagner! She had Rachel dressed to the nines, which, by the way, was not my rating for this film."
"dcldan","5","3","4","13 August 2006"," why so well considered?
","In this film there are two mixed stories: at 40's Noah and Allie meet themselves at the summer in a little town of South USA. They quickly fell in love despite the fact that they are from very different families, which will cause them lots of troubles. lots of years later, in an asylum, an old man reads to a woman the story of Allie and Noah, that it is written in an old crappy notebook. This movie is considered one of the best of the year, but i can't agree. Despite the fact that the script is very good, the development of the story, the idea of the power of love...The election of the main young pair splits it all, I cannot find any kind of chemistry between them, they never seem (specially she) comfortable in their parts, which make the young's story (the most important) very annoying and hard to watch. On the other hand, the old's story is much better, good acting and directing, and, as it goes after, and the fact that it is VERY well ended, it leaves you a good feeling, but I have found most of the two hours before quite boring; which has caused me to put it not as good mark as other people has done."

","Embarrassing and atrocious. A charade that insulted me beyond all conceivable belief. How could something so dreadful be given an 8? Some of the acting was OK, however I was not entertained. It left me feeling hungry.<br/><br/>The score it got can only be put down to an abuse of the voting system, because this is not better than, for example, lost in translation, which scored less, I recall.<br/><br/>James Garner was mildly enjoyable.<br/><br/>Everybody else was either wooden, overly ambitious in their acting or clichéd to the extent of me expecting a ""gawd bless us, every one"" at the end."
"qaz53074","4","3","4","31 March 2006"," Was This a Made for Lifetime Movie?
","This is a beautifully photographed film, however I don't feel that that's enough to recommend this movie. It feels like a made-for-Lifetime movie, meant only to tug at your heartstrings. The story is thin and predictable (I knew who the older couple were from the first scene). And indeed, the plot is not very unique. (The same thing happened to my mother: she fell in love with -gasp- a Jewish man, was sent off to boarding school, her mother stole the letters from the young man, etc, etc. But she didn't reconnect with the ""love of her life"" until she was sixty years old.) The movie does portray young passion quite well, and with a modicum of humor, but it's not very interesting. Unfortunately, the movie is littered with anachronisms. For a much more interesting story, buy ""Fried Green Tomatoes"" instead.<br/><br/>I originally rented this movie because I love Gena Rowlands and, although her performance is stunning, she doesn't have much screen time. The young leads (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) are believable, but not stellar. The best scene in the movie is when Allie's mother takes her for a drive and tells her about her first love.<br/><br/>BTW, (with apologies to Mr Zigman) some of the score has been stolen. During the scene where Allie discovers the painting supplies, the underscore is playing the theme from the movie ""Making Love""! <br/><br/>For the best movie EVER about relationships, buy ""Two for the Road""."

","What portion of the ultimate makeup of a Hollywood product is driven directly by the viewer? An interesting topic for debate, and this film has a lot to say within the context of that debate.<br/><br/>One can easily see what happened here. The end is so obviously incompatible with the rest of the story it jars. We suddenly have this business about love's miracles and God. The book this film was based on has no death, a detail which test audiences will subconsciously sniff out nearly every time. And I believe that's what happened here.<br/><br/>Try to quickly think of a modern film drama with no instance of death within. It's not that easy a task. That's because as the lineage of film progresses, more and more is demanded by the viewer to qualify a movie as engaging drama. Death lends a tone of seriousness that is nearly prerequisite these days. This tacked on variation of the original ending was clearly (at least partially) created in our own imaginations, that of the viewer.<br/><br/>So what we end up with is a film that is ostensibly about love, inwardly about memories that ends with an incongruous statement about God, via beautiful death. The love element is provided by our book's author (Sparks), the memory slant by the filmmakers and the ending thanks to you and I.<br/><br/>A side note: The overly sugared down tone of the film has been criticized as too safe and wholesome, but it works effectively for me considering that these memories are from the minds of the elderly and presented as an elderly person might wish."

","""The Notebook"" (2004) has something absolutely amazing - the best on-screen chemistry between two young lovers who are crazy about each other, whose love is so real, so overwhelming, so tender and passionate that you actually forget that they are acting. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are sensational. Since I saw Ryan in his controversial ""The Believer"" (2001), I always wait for his next film. I believe that he's got a great future. McAdams was radiant- just to think that the first movie I saw her in was Rob Schneider's ""Hot Chick"" (yes, I rented it). Her work in ""The Notebook"" made me think that for many young (and not so young) artists the biggest problem is not the lack of talent but the chance to find the right material and the right director who can make the best of their abilities. <br/><br/>I like the movie. I believe it deserves its tears. It really made me think of Woody Allen's words, ""If you want to make God laugh, tell him about your plans"".

It tells a great story, with good actors, and great scenes. It can relate to everyone, because everyone knows, you just can't forget your first love (or your true love.) The notebook doesn't follow the regular style of a love story, where two odds meet, dislike, like, fall in love, separated by outsider, and end up together. It is more than that, and makes it more enjoyable."
"mathieu_scheffers","9","3","4","13 October 2004"," a very beautiful, touching love story
","It's one of most romantic movie ever to be seen. I cannot describe how wonderful this movie was. From the very beginning you are drawn into the movie. At first I thought the movie a little silly, but the longer the movie going on the more i was going to love it. Although the story of the book is at some point very different from the actual movie. But for me that's no problem. I've watched quite a lot of movies without reading the books where they're based upon. <br/><br/>The story as you know is about Noah and Allie. When they meet each other, they're both around 17 years of age, it's almost love at first sight. After a summer of romantic love they have to split, because he is poor and she is rich. So Allie's parents believe it's a love that will never last. But fate decides otherwise. They'll meet each other again.Just before Allie's wedding with another rich man. And their love returns and in the end they both believe this love is meant to last forever.<br/><br/>This story is told by the old Noah. He reads the story to a woman with Alzheimer disease. (Of course it turns out to be his wife)That part is beautifully played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands. <br/><br/>This is one those movies couples will not easily forget. It's about your first love and never able to forget it. The performances of the leads are incredible. Especially the young pair, played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, are absolutely stunning. I've rarely seen so much chemistry between lead characters. The movie itself is beautifully shot, the music is wonderful. I read that many people cried throughout the movie, but i didn't(I never did by the way.) Crying no, deeply touched and tears not to far away yes. <br/><br/>Of course the movie has some minor weaknesses.(All movies have, even the Lord of the Rings3,considered the best movie of all time) For one,the end is taking too long and the best part, the young couple, is missing in the last 15/20 minutes of the film. The other is the sometimes ridiculous lines the actors have to say. But that is hardly avoidable. Rate:9.5/10<br/><br/>P.S. Don't listen to what critics have to say about this movie.They often do not like romantic movies. That's why I had to watch it with only 5 persons. That's too little for this excellent movie that takes your heart away."

Because for me to give a movie a 9, you are looking at movie that is a) Oscar material; b) The kind of movie that becomes a classic.<br/><br/>The movie is unique and has twists that some may or may not pick up on early. Its handling of a gentle subject matter the range of emotions the actors use is outstanding. James Gardner surprises us near the end of the movie with so much depth that you truly suspend all disbelief and feel as if you are secretly peeking into someone's room during a private conversation.<br/><br/>The movie may be hard to watch for some and will pull at your heartstrings at every opportunity while not forgetting to make you laugh at other moments.<br/><br/>As with any movie, there is always place for tweaks but this is about as perfect as a movie gets.

The story of Notebook takes us through turn after turn of cliché and improbability, ending in (for those who have not timely walked out or switched off) twist-my-arm sentimentality. I never have much defense against a good tearjerker, but this film left my eyes dry. Worse: it left me angry at the attempt at invading my emotions with such third rate movie drivel."

""The Notebook"", along with other popular rom-coms, has left most girls with a muddled line between fiction and reality. Though Nicholas Sparks may be talented as a fiction writer, it is only because he knows how to manipulate the female mind into an emotional puddle. Aside from the beautiful Southern setting (a Sparks trademark) and Ryan Gosling occasionally sweaty and shirtless, this movie provided not only no relatability for me, but also did not provide even a fictitious escape."

Suddenly, you're not sensitive, and the relationship drops a rung on the sex ladder.<br/><br/>This 2 hour long movie depicts a love story read by an aged husband to his wife who has a disease (something like alzheimers) and she forgets things easily. He reads to her their love story, and every time he does, she remembers just a little bit more about the relationship they have.<br/><br/>Not my kind of movie, but I gave it a 7 out of 10, because it was good nonetheless. I'm just not a crying for every movie kind of guy, I felt sincerity for the ending, and my eyes were on the verge of watering, but it just didn't work for me. On a sad, crying ending scale, it would receive a 6. If you want to cry at the end of a movie, and still watch something that keeps your attention... rent Con Air."
"donricodelavega","7","5","9","22 February 2005"," Why is this movie sad?
","This is a good movie, don't get me wrong. But its not sad because its romantic. Its sad because the end of the movie revolved around watching older people's lives fall apart. I'm sure anyone who has parents can relate to the fear of knowing they have fewer days ahead then they have behind. Now take some people in their later years and show their lives falling apart, well of course people are going to cry. Its a terrible thing. Tacking on flashbacks full of a moderately interesting love story is just a con into making people think this is one of the most romantic movie of all time. It is romantic, but so are lots of other movies. THIS movie just wanted to make you cry. So I'd compare it to watching a love story, then showing someone drown a bag of puppies. That would be sad too.<br/><br/>r"

","Come on people, what is new about this story? If you are a male and actually sat through this junk it's probably because your girlfriend or wife thought it would be a romantic evening well spent. Well, isn't that just sweet? Now I have spent approximately 12 minutes looking over the reviews that folks posted in regards to this junk. I cannot believe that people are falling head over heels for this picture. I don't see anything original or creative about this, which would make it worth my $9.00 (adult ticket),nor my $2.00 (rental fee). We've seen this story too many times. Boy meets girl at a carnival and they then fall in love. Oh wait, doesn't every love story need to have the adversity issues near to the middle of the film? Well, of course they do, and this one follows the trendy path. Ally, the girlfriend, develops Alzheimer's disease. Gosh, my heart just poured right into my lap once this was revealed. Look, all you guys out there that raved about this film are a sorry excuse for the male gender. Now it's your turn to have her sit through a movie. Go ahead and torment her with films like ""Roger Dodger"", ""Zomibe"", ""Cobra"", ""Die Hard"", ""Slumber Party Massacre"",""Nightmare On Elm Street 3: The Dream Warriors"", or ""Vice Academy."" I think that with those titles you'll be able to form some sort of a decision. The only redeeming thing that this movie offered was that James Gardner had some affiliation with the film, and that is the only reason that I even give it two starts. There is NOTHING NEW here."

","I, like many others, was expecting the typical romance/love story. And as it started out, when we discover that Allie is the rich girl and Noah is the country boy, I figured I was getting what I anticipated. But as I watched the film, I realized there was more to the story. I don't want to get into it too much, but needless to say, I was very happy by the end. Also, it has to be noted that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have tremendous chemistry on screen. Also, Gena Rowlands and James Garner give moving performances in their respective roles. Although I found one of the plot twists quite easy to identify, it was developed in a very interesting way, which didn't ruin it for the viewer. I unfortunately have little time to read for leisure with my hectic class schedule. However, I am pretty sure I will pick up the next Nicholas Sparks novel. All in all, a very moving tell of human emotion which brings you in to the story."

","The first thing i thought was the best way to ruin the movie was using Rachel Mcadams. I mean don't get me wrong the girl can act and I don't think anything negative about her, Its just after seeing her in mean girls and the hot Chick i will always see her as the person good to play the part of a preppy girl who is spoiled and doesn't have a care in the world. Also the movie is supposed to be set like sixty, seventy years ago and they did not do a good job at acting like they were living that long ago. I admit it was a good love story its just a few things that spoiled the whole movie. If you watch this again just pay attention to the way they act instead of the story line and you will get a good idea of what I'm talking about"

","I don't understand why women love that kind of movie. They say it's true love, but their ""True Love"" movies, like this one, always has a part in which the female character is cheating. In this one, oh yeah, she's so in love with her first love, and yeah, the mom prevents her from receiving his love letters and everything, but she eventually moves on and falls in love with another man. But as soon as she sees her first love, she starts falling for him again. That's cheating. And she eventually goes back with him. Oh, so true love! But what about the guy she was with and about to get married to? The fact that women love that kind of movie gets me confused. Is any woman on this planet actually faithful?

","The Notebook was a movie made great by the actors on screen. The storyline is amazingly predictable and most of the lines are cheesy. The special effects, are not so great either. However, I would recommend that anyone and everyone should see this movie for one reason: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams together on screen. I have never in my life seen two people who had as much chemistry between them as this. What they posses together blew me away and made me glad that I paid to see this movie. The two connected extremely well and made me believe their love and why they would go through such a tragedy for it. On the negative side, Nicholas Sparks is not my favorite author, I did not enjoy ""A Walk to Remember"" for two reasons, Mandy Moore, and the predictable plot line which always appears in Nicholas Spark's novels. But, thankfully, I was able to overlook such blunders and see the core of the movie, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams"

Stupid and shallow. Good points? That it finally ended. Why I watched it to the end? The hope that beats eternal. Don't waste your money, not even as a weekly video for two bucks. If it comes on free-to-air, bypass it. The last movie I recall that was as bad as this was Kramer versus Kramer. This was an attempt to take a teenybopper B grade comic-book love story and turn it into a meaningful movie. For whom? Pre-pubescent fairytalers probably, and I imagine it even failed for them."

","This film is very overrated, I had started watching it a couple times with people or by myself and got bored so I'd never seen it all the way through. Finally I decided to watch it through, I'd heard all the stories and all the jokes about how sad ""The Notebook"" is and everyone is bawling always by the end. I've been told I have to watch this film I just have to. I didn't shed a tear and usually I have a few it's not like I never cry in movies this one just was so cliche that it was so predictable so you knew what was going to happen. The movie was built on cliches the girl choosing between the steady stable man or the risky choice. The film was so slow paced and simple it's just like any other Nicholas Sparks movie - they are literally all the same. Also how did they end up dying at the same time? Was Noah even sick? It's very poetic and all but COME ON! and how Allie would remember some things out on and off always at the right moment.

","Nothing new...... you would have seen this story a hundred times. But what elevates this movie from others in the genre is the performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams . You truly believe they are in love. <br/><br/>That's why the part of the movie set during the 1940s works. What doesn't work is the modern day story set in a hospital. It just feels distracting , butting in the middle. All the time you're just itching to get back to the story in 1940s. It also leads to a long drawn ending where you wish they had ended the movie long before.<br/><br/>The notebook maybe overly sentimental and manipulative for some. But it is not cynical in it's portrayal of romance. It truly believes in the story it tells."

","If you like corn syrup on your pancakes then this movie is for you. It cops the slushy bits from lots of the romantic hits which I have loved: Last Picture Show, Splendor in the Grass, Great Gatsby, The Graduate, and so on. That's OK except the renderings are kind of inane. It's hard to imagine someone going ape for the girl - especially three times. I guess the movie maker is hoping to convincingly romanticize his mom. I feel guilty for raining on a neurotic-girl fantasy. My wife liked it. I'd love our romance to hold up as well."

","I am probably the only 16 year old girl that hates this movie! First of all, it's disgusting kissing scenes and cheesy script makes you roll your eyes or throw up. I have too agree that it was unrealistic and had a happily ever after mood about it...which is not real. The character Noah has a dirty way about him, I mean he's nice and everything but he becomes a crazy alcoholic man who runs around with other women...respectful?..I don't think so! And Allie..Oh My Gosh! don't get me started. She annoyed me soo bad! she was very immature and spoiled and childish!She never took responsibility of her actions! I think that this romance was never true love but lust...if it was love they would have respect for each other, they would know how to act mature and wait till they were married. All it seemed to me was was short summer fling, it was all flirting and going completely gah-gah over each other for just some physical attraction. I think the author of the book thought that if he made the boy poor and the girl rich, it would be an excuse for love because the rich don't fall in love with poor people..right? wrong, that is no excuse for ""true love"" a rich girl can go out with any boy just to have some fun for a while and then leave him.It dosen't mean it's true love just because of status. I think the author dramatized it a bit too much so if you want to see a good, mature, romance I would suggest Message in a Bottle or hey..Pocahontas"

Actually this movie has two different point of views, for both young and old watchers. The 40 and 50's style of life in USA is quite well done with fantastic scenes. And you can realize not only how appearance change by time and also how people live and think. I was expecting a better end but again I am sure most watchers loves the end.

"jillzhere","4","3","5","27 November 2006"," Great story, poorly made movie.
","Let me first say I've never read the book. I like the story presented in the movie-- it's very romantic, so I suspect I would have liked the book, but there's a big problem with the movie. I'm surprised I didn't see anyone else comment on this. I think the directing is poor and possibly the screenplay as well. Rachel McAdams does a great job in spite of this, perhaps she's a superior actor or maybe she's the only one the director bothered to direct. Allie's father was particularly laughable with his obviously fake hair, fake mustache, and bad acting. All the early scenes in the nursing home were poorly done, I'm not sure if the screenplay, directing, or acting is to blame. The quality of this movie is more on par with an after school special than a major motion picture. Am I the only one who noticed?"
"Danusha_Goska","7","3","5","13 September 2006"," Didn't Love It or Hate It; Just Wish It Had Lived Up to Its Potential
","""The Notebook"" is one of those love it or hate it movies.<br/><br/>""The Notebook""'s champions insist it is one of the greatest love stories of all time. ""The Notebook""'s detractors savage it as a manipulative, mawkish soap opera.<br/><br/>I didn't love it or hate it. I saw a lot of good in it, but it didn't really move me, and given how much it had going for it, I wish it had lived up to its potential. In fact I find it kind of sad that so many loved this mediocre movie so much. That just shows what a huge appetite there is for non-violent, family friendly movies that celebrate old fashioned values like committed love.<br/><br/>The best thing about the movie, for me, was Gena Rowlands' performance as an Alzheimer's sufferer. Gena Rowlands is one of those truly magical performers who bottle lightening, and firelight, in their performances. She is exciting and seductive.<br/><br/>I worked with Alzheimer's sufferers for years, and Rowlands' exacting and yet poignant performance took my breath away. I would have to guess that Rowlands' studied Alzheimer's sufferers and crafted her performance from meticulous and compassionate observations.<br/><br/>It was also great to see a movie that spent so much time with a female character, and actress, over forty.<br/><br/>James Garner's -- entirely unnecessary -- removal of his shirt was challenging to watch. I remember Garner from films like ""The Americanization of Emily"" where he was ripely sexy.<br/><br/>That was a long time ago, though, and Garner looks his age, and the movie doesn't spare us what time has done to him. His lips are blistered; his teeth have black spots; his body is spongey and thick.<br/><br/>But I came to be grateful for that. There's something to be said for a movie that doesn't shy from viewing an old man's body.<br/><br/>Garner is all the more impressive in that body. He still possesses and exercises the cocky command of his youth. In his love scenes with Rowlands, he gives his all, and his all is awesome to observe.<br/><br/>The sets, lighting, and costumes are all lush.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling, who tears up in fifty percent of his scenes, is very sweet and dear, and Rachel MacAdams comes across as spunky.<br/><br/>For all that -- this movie never came together for me. It was just too much of a Hallmark card, of a Thomas Kinkade painting. Everyone, without exception, is nice; everything glows; nothing is too challenging and no one is too smart. In fact, it's all just a wee bit afraid of being too intelligent, too challenging.<br/><br/>The movie hearkens back to another era: the 1940s, in which much of the plot is set. Too, the tear-jerking, five handkerchief plot, with its unlikely twists, hearkens back to older unlikely tear jerkers like ""Random Harvest."" The thing is, though, those older films were not afraid of intelligence, or of the darker side of life. Yes, they were movies that an entire family could sit down and watch together, but they, often through subtle suggestion, evoked life's complexities. Even Frank Capra did this; suicide was a repeated theme in his most upbeat movies, including ""It's a Wonderful Life."" And Capra was not afraid of some very dark characterizations.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""The Notebook"" fails its brilliant cast, and its audience, ravenously hungry, in this age of teen - boy - exploding - monster movies, for dialogue-, story-, and character-driven movies that celebrate women of all ages, and timeless virtues.<br/><br/>In spite of its failures, though, one could do worse than pop some corn and settle in for a couple of hours with ""The Notebook."""
"vladymirror","6","3","5","20 January 2006"," behind every love there is a story (forget the great)
","The reason I saw The Notebook was because I really liked Rachel McAdams in Wedding Crashers. She is a doll, isn't she? Rachel was so good in Wedding Crashers so I wanted to see her in another movie.<br/><br/>To tell you the truth I'm not quite sure about this one. The Notebook is definitely not a great movie  that's for sure. I haven't read the book but I got the feeling that the director was picking from different passages of the book in order to give us maximum information in a very limited time. I am referring to the second act with all the many short stories  the war, house, new boyfriend and girlfriend, and so on and so on. The acting was also not that good. Rachel in a way was OK but Ryan Gosling acted too boyish for this role. There wasn't a good chemistry between the 2 leads. The whole cast with the exception of the old Noah wasn't convincing. Not to mention the ending was so very contrived.<br/><br/>However this is a love story and as such some fantasies are allowed. From a bird's view this is a film about the time old question: should one follow the heart or should one follow the head? Which body organ is more reliable when making decisions? Choosing between what's good for the soul or what's good for the body. Passion or reason. Ideal versus money. Tough question I know. But what I know is that the movie also won't give you a convincing answer. I guess there isn't one.<br/><br/>There are other good love stories out there that are much better than The notebook. One that comes to mind from the new ones is The Constant Gardener. The Notebook is a romantic melodrama that has its moments I guess. If it so happens that you might even cry, take a look at yourself in the mirror, take your time and think what's wrong withyou.<br/><br/>6 stars out of 10"

The production design is well done, specially selecting locations. Photography and art direction is also superb. But the movie is predictable and not a real tearjerker in my opinion. I have noticed the movie has moved American audience and it is because it has same plot seeing on soap opera shows. Before the end, the predictable plot suggested by all means that somebody should die, in we got the two main character dying together (the best way to bring tears to the audience).

As for Ryan Gosling & Rachel McAdams, they really were not suited for the role. For pete's sake, Gosling and Garner looking nothing like each other and it was really hard to see them as the same character.

The film became more and more annoying as it progressed. Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams)'s meeting was anything but romantic. Noah was the most forward, cocky, obnoxious, persistent character I've seen in a while. Oh, and I think the intention was for him to be charming...(??!!).<br/><br/>The love birds were fighting all the time and they were the most incompatible lovers I've seen on screen. There were simply no chemistry between them. The falling in love set-up as well as the meeting of the family scenes were so similar to 'Titanic'. In fact, the film would eventually become nothing more than a 'Titanic' meets 'Pearl Harbor' film - only much, much more boring with nothing interesting happening except for the couple fighting all the time. Yawn.<br/><br/>There was simply NOTHING romantic about their relationship. They did and said the most preposterous things! I mean, honestly! I also didn't find anything in the film justified. Everything simply happened for the sake of creating an epic, somber, tragic love story. I mean, did Noah honestly expect Allie to sit around waiting for him for years and years?? And how is it romantic when they have sex during a moment of lust while she is engaged to be married to another man whom she proclaims to love?<br/><br/>This was the most unromantic, most annoying love story I've seen in a while. Credit where credit is due, though. The cinematography was really great. Joan Allen was very good as Allie's mom (although she was very similar to Maggie Smith as Rose's mom in 'Titanic').

I don't know that any movie has ever brought so many happy & sad tears. Life is beautiful and cruel at the same time. To the doubters love like that can be real, I've got a friend who's mom started getting sick about a decade ago, his dad still cares for her and takes her out for a walk most days even though she today is almost totally blind.

"summerloud","5","2","3","4 July 2017"," Charming, if a little generic and naive romance flick
","The notebook is a charming romance movie that easily transports you back into the 40ies to tell its pretty implausible story of a woman torn between two men.<br/><br/>That being said, I do not understand Ryan Gosling's acting at all, especially not in a romance flick.<br/><br/>Like in the movie Drive, his character keeps the same constant look of detached, dreamy, slightly silly, perpetual slight amusement on his face all the time - whether he meets the love of his life, or his best friend dies - it doesn't seem to make any difference to him.<br/><br/>I simply don't understand whats the point of that. In a romance movie, the actors should try their best to convey believable emotions, not try to hide them at all cost? While in Drive, this sort of acting made some sort of sense within the generally weird framework of that movie, it just seems completely out of place in a romance movie, and is especially noticeable here because of its contrast to the lively, hearty performance of Heather Wahlquist as Sara.<br/><br/>In the end, this did not really completely ruin the movie for me, but I still found it distracting and detrimental to the overall charm of an otherwise above-average romance movie.<br/><br/>Still, the high rating on IMDb would have irritated me either way, but I guess the tear-jerking end served to push that up.<br/><br/>5/10"
"songwriterrc","2","2","3","30 December 2016"," Philosophically Inconsistent
","Let's consider the themes:<br/><br/>* Money ~ The movie portrays the hopelessness of both males caught up between a hopeless girl who couldn't hold onto her own integrity, and yet considered that she could find peace ultimately in either of her choices. So although she may remain authentic to the poor guy, she won't stay with him, however if she stays with the rich guy, the rich guy could never receive her love.<br/><br/>Wonder if people should rather explore the grave themes of how capitalism has torn apart the social healthiness of our society, and the lack of women empowerment -_- I mean shouldn't she just do her own work, buy her own house, develop her own ways to sustenance? That way she'd at least be in a better shape to make a worthy decision... At least she won't be implicated to make a choice she doesn't truly want to go for.<br/><br/>* Concept of Love So we have a whole bunch of movies based upon love stories like these where people correlate love with a sense of intuition, without concept, thus as we'd say 'Blind in Love'. So blind, that there is no love to be seen anywhere around. I mean the girl could love the guy, and fail to make a point to her parents as to why it's valuable to her, and even though if she fails, at least she could have some regard for the concerns her parents may have about her, they do after all care for her, she could deal with the situation with lesser repulsion and by being much more considerate and open to a proper fruitful discussion (Although yes we have exactly the same happening in reality, where usually situations go haywire, and we could always attribute that to these movies which failed to cause a change anyway. What is that love which takes all the lovely people away from one's life?) ... I mean how come we always end up having one love destroy another, that's not universalizable, it's principally immoral.<br/><br/>* Dealing with Loss and Crisis The movie portrays the only way of dealing with a crisis, due to a loss or let alone that of a loss of existential purpose, but that too of prioritizing one's values all upon the end of living through a sense of bonding with another (and that too being a SPECIFIC person)... Guess it's time we got to face it, and find better ways that arouses in us a sense of fulfillment without having to use others as a means to that end. That is just IMMORAL!"
"imranatherr","3","2","3","5 April 2016"," So out of reality.
","Rachel Mcadams likes to talk about how she isn't in the movie business for fame, but she never seems to pass up an opportunity to star in these unrealistic love stories. This is definitely one of them. <br/><br/>The vow (2012 I think,don't want to remember) was another one. This movie would have made more sense in the 20s, but by now, audiences are too smart and too experienced. <br/><br/>It unbelievable how much time and effort the two main actors take in this movie to convey their feeling to each other and explain the situation to others. <br/><br/>A rating of three is sufficient for the work they have put in the movie."
"alombardy","5","2","3","1 June 2014"," Overly drawn out mushy love story gives us a decent ending (but it's not worth it)
","I'm not sure what this movie was trying to do.<br/><br/>Let's start with the length; it's far too long at over two hours. For about 100 of those 120 minutes, however, I was thinking of coming on here and absolutely trashing it. It employs every stereotype, every romantic cliché, every predictable situation and outcome, and every setup and resolution you've seen a million times before. And yet the last fifteen minutes is actually a fairly satisfying conclusion. I don't think it's quite strong enough to save the movie - you have to go through far too much of Ryan Gosling infuriatingly mumbling for that to be the case, but in honesty it was the only highlight of the picture for me.<br/><br/>That said I don't want to criticise the actors too much. I think Gosling and Rachel McAdams do a fairly good job of what is a trite script - McAdams is best in brat mode (a la Mean Girls) in the first half hour or so of the movie - and while Gosling's acting range seems to go from being mildly amused to gormlessly distracted, it's only because he's written as such a dull goofball. About 5 minutes in I was sure that after an hour of this film I'd get sick of the Southern accents, but in fairness, they pull them off pretty well - admittedly this may have been because I was so distracted by the other problems (or, maybe, caught up in the romance....haha) but they proved me wrong on that count at least.<br/><br/>As I said, this movie seems to struggle with its own identity - at times I wanted to laugh, especially in the scenes where McAdams' character is brutally attacking Gosling's (they fight, it's what they do, apparently) but I was fairly sure they weren't going for the Rom-Com angle, and it didn't appear to be intentionally funny. So it was supposed to be a drama? Well, the climax aside (which, as I said, did pull at the heartstrings a little) I really could not get involved in these people enough to feel anything. Not at the famous kiss in the rain, nor at the dramatic reunion at the end. <br/><br/>Again, I think this is down to the writing and direction - the actors are doing the best with what they have - but there was potential here. Without giving too much away, the action cuts back and forth between modern day and the 1940s, and again it's derivative, but that's not a problem as long as its done well. But it's not. The pacing is agonisingly slow. It doesn't help also that there is absolutely no subtlety to it - yes, that's fine if it's another Romantic drama, it's expected, just do it well, but they were clearly trying to do something a bit different, and it just doesn't work when everything is spelled out to you and treats the audience like children.<br/><br/>So it's a 5, and it would have been a 3 but for the efforts of the actors and that last fifteen minutes. Now I know a lot of people like this movie, and if you're really into romantic dramas you'll probably get something out of it, but for me, there are just too many problems to allow a good ending to let this movie off."

","The Notebook is a film about young love and old love, i first watched the beginning of the film in a school lesson and knew i had to watch the rest. I bought the film on DVD and watched it all the way through.This film made me feel happy and warm, mainly because of the time it was set where people could go to the lake and swim and play instead of now where people sit on the Xbox for the weekend. It shows how passionate Noah is about young Allie and what he is willing to do, just to hold her (in the beginning of the film) Ryan Gosling played a well-done part as playing shy and quiet Noah whilst Rachel McAdams was sweet childlike Allie. After i watched the film i cried for hours on end to the point where my eyes were fully swollen, it is a film that i cannot stop talking about and would recommend it to anyone to watch! I think that their story reminds me of how real love is supposed to be. The fact that Noah is rather good looking exaggerates the emotion of sadness. Overall this film is by far the best film i have ever seen.. and I've seen a hell of a lot!"

","Alright, so I heard a lot of hype and good reviews about this movie and people warned me to watch this with a tissue roll beside me....I finally decided to watch the movie last night and man was I disappointed....<br/><br/>The film starts with a cute young guy hanging on wheel ride for a girl to ask her out and on top of it, he doesn't even know her just met her.How many of us guys would do something so freakish in real life.From that point onwards I knew things aren't gonna get any good and they didn't.It went the typical way of boy and girl in love but family disagrees due to class differences, the plot so overly used in Bollywood cinema. I figured out that old couple was in fact Noah and Allie pretty early in the movie so the suspense of who Allie would chose didn't excite me either and were we supposed to cry because the old lady couldn't remember her hubby...they had three children and it seems lived pretty much of there lives together happily until she starts forgetting things, give me a break, what about ""50 first dates"" (Adam Sandler) that was more tragic as there she forgot her love everyday, thus that ""pain"" wasn't painful enough for my heart to bust into tears.....and that cheesiest ending of dying together was like icing on the cake in a sarcastic way....she wasn't even diagnosed with any disease that could kill her then why she died along with him(he was a heart patient so his death was understandable) what are the odds you die with the one you love at the same time, unless its deliberate, on the same bed.<br/><br/>Direction was okay, Script was the main culprit here.... Two thumbs down, go watch ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"" instead or Bollywood classic ""Devdas"" ."

","I finally watched this movie after years and years of hearing how incredible it is, and I say boooooooo! I am shocked at how many people consider this to be a great film. I'm guessing these are the same people who thought Titanic was a great film. It's sappy, overindulgent, crap! It uses incredibly tired and cheap ploys to get the audience's sympathy. Its only slightly redeeming quality is the pairing of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. He is a tremendously talented actor and she is utterly adorable. The two actors have great chemistry together on screen (and off screen apparently), but it is not enough to sustain my attention for the entire duration of the film. Boooooooo!"

The mellow capture of certain scenes was breathtaking, but Atonement still has my vote.<br/><br/>Now the fun begins! <br/><br/>The movie offers excruciatingly painful editing. It seemed as if... whoa, like where did this come from. Definitely, editing had me a little dizzied.<br/><br/>The actions of the characters were a little dumb.

"jacksonke","10","2","3","31 October 2007"," This is one of the best love stories I have ever seen!
","The Notebook is directed by Nick Cassavetes. This movie takes place in Seabrook, North Carolina in the summer of 1940. The movie begins with an elderly man (James Garner) reading a story to an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) at a nursing home. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) falls head over heels at a carnival for Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). Noah is a mill worker, and Allie's wealthy family disapproves of him. Within a few days of being together constantly, Noah and Allie fall in love. Then Allie's parents leave Seabrook and take Allie with them. When Allie moves away, she meets a man named Lon. They spent some time together, and her parents loved him. He asked her to marry him. Right when she said yes, Noah's face came to mind. Noah bought the Windsor Plantation and rebuilt it from the ground up. Allie decides to go visit Noah to see if he is okay. They both still have feelings for each other. Allie has to choose between Lon and Noah. <br/><br/>The wardrobe for the movie, as well as the cars, fits really well with the time frame. The music is very old fashioned as well. There is also a lot of symbolism throughout the movie (which I won't give examples of so I don't give anything away).<br/><br/>There were a couple of mistakes in the movie. At one part where they are in the Windsor Plantation, Allie says, ""This place is gigantic"" and the words didn't go with her lip movements. There was another part where Allie ran into a stack of logs. Her car wouldn't start back which isn't very likely.<br/><br/>Overall I loved this movie. I would recommend it to anyone who wants to see a wonderful love story."

","The Notebook, 5/10, 59th best of 2004, 258th in the 2000s, 783rd all time This movie started at a clear disadvantage because it is in the ""chick flick"" genre of which I am not a massivly big fan. It was further hurt by the fact that I was forced into watching it by my girlfirend, and at that I was forced to watch it late at night when I wanted to go to bed. Also, she fell asleep 10 minutes in to the movie, but I already felt I had to watch the entire thing. That being said, the movie was not entirely unpleasant. I can't really pick out anything that I loved about the movie (although I did feel James Garner gave a very good performance), I didn't necisarily find anything wrong with the movie either. It's relatively bland, predictable, unoffensive, and vaugly pleasant. In my mind this movie isn't good or bad, its just sort of there."
"csauer","Null","2","3","27 February 2006"," not real
","In the first part of the movie Noah and Allie were very believable having had a few young loves of my own. Very good scene on the wheel when Noah is holding on to a brace with one hand scaring the be-gebers out of Allie forcing her to go out with him and she says about four times she would, he then says ""alright alright I'll go out with you"" like she was begging him. Funny, very funny. When Allie was forced to leave to go to school the movie kind of went into the tank. First of all didn't Allie ever get the mail? Then we go to the nursing home where Noah reads to her most days and she can remember all of it. How can that be? She does'nt remember her kids but remembers A story being read to her? Then she gets her memory back for a few minutes and they are dancing. She then forgets Again and looks at Noah like he was Satan. Why? He reads to her every day and she does'nt go bonkers when they meet. One good laugh, many tears fall. They then die together. What do they do, strangle each other? Too many holes in this baby to be a top notch movie. To see it or not to see, flip a coin."
"ladyvolfan35","3","2","3","3 February 2006"," Worst adaptation ever
","Wow ... could be the absolute worst adaptation ever. The movie itself, was probably OK, but only if you could get by the fact that the story was totally different. Characters' personalities were changed, essential plot elements were changed ... In fact, it should have been called ""Not the Notebook."" Noah went from a shy, hardworking southern gentleman to I don't know what. He did nothing to ""earn"" Allie's love in this movie. Allie went from a somewhat ignored, sympathetic fiancée to a plain and simple pathetic cheater. Geez, what a disappointment. What about what made the lovers special? Where's that in this movie? The screenplay removed every single piece of motivation possible. And what was up with changing the nature of Noah's relationship with his father, not to mention the father's character entirely? This was one instance they should have left the book alone and written the screenplay from it completely. It didn't need changing, much less ruining.<br/><br/>Adaptation? How about remarkably bad re-write instead?"

","At first the film starts with a slow opening: easing you into the film. This alone was a reason to change the channel and watch something else. But something about it drew me in and kept me watching. But within 3 minutes I was glad I was still watching the film. The lives of the two main characters couldn't be any more different, but isn't that the whole point of a love story? The film takes you on a journey of the characters lives, showing not only the good moments but the bad as well. Just when your about to give up on the couple, and admit that not all love stories have a happy ending. The film bounces back to life and shows that nothing can stand in the way of true love. Just as you begin to be overcome with joy, you find yourself tearing up towards the end. I don't want to give too much away but its so happy its sad I found myself in hysterics while the credits rolled. All I wanted was to rewind and watch it again...obviously with TV its practically impossible so I bought the DVD this morning, in order to feed my hunger for it. I recommend this film to anyone. You don't have to enjoy romances to really get into this film, its more than a chick flick, its a work of art...a beautiful film."
"Madflanker","10","2","3","20 January 2006"," A film that clearly tugs at heart-strings.
","This movie, in my opinion, is one of the best movies ever produced. It is a movie of such rare quality that it even made me cry, especially when it came to the end, showing the loyalty and essence of true love that we should all pursue in our respective lives. And that message was brought out very clearly, even more so by the chemistry between Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gostling. The casting of such fresh, yet talented faces only served to cleverly tug upon the heart-strings of audiences. However, i believe that more could be done in the film. Perhaps a more detailed depiction of the dilemma affecting Allie, in the fields choosing either an easy pursuit of an affection-filled marriage, or rather, going with her heart in search of a greater love that lies with Noah. Still, the clever linkages back to the heart-rending love that Noah had for Allie when old is nothing short of being exemplary. The climax of the film would have to be the part when Allie finally regains her memory, albeit only for a few minutes. The dedication that a husband should have towards his spouse, and vice-versa, is best demonstrated in this film. Definitely not a chick-flick, but a masterpiece."

","No matter how indifferent and self-absorbed you are , you will be moved ! Truly Sensational ! If you have been wanting to break down and cry and let it all out for a long time , this movie is tailor made for you. The movie at some point of time, will most certainly let you relate to events within your life. A simple love story, superbly portrayed with an impeccable soundtrack in the backdrop of some breathtaking sceneries will suck you towards itself in an almost maudlin experience. Sometimes you could just feel all that love populating the story. Personally, the unforgettable experience that this movie is probably wont fade itself to oblivion for quite some years to come. If you wanna rent a DVD for Valentines, look no further. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling plays Noah , the young love-struck go-getter while Rachel McAdams plays his love interest, young Ali. The pleasant soundtrack and the wonderful cinematography leaves you in one of those halcyon days of peace and tranquility. You will go totally immersed in the movie as the two go crazy in love with each other , not able to keep their hands of one another. Just when you expect the typical love story to unfold, it hits you with a wonderful twist leaving you guessing all over again. One wonderful aspect of this movie was the absence of the usual stereotypical clichés of movies in this genre. <br/><br/>Gosling brings an almost incredible innocence to the role of Noah. Even with the beard, the innocence doesn't hide itself. Rachel on the other hand brings a lil bit of ""Mean Girls"" into this movie, only for the good of it, which helps in keeping with her character in the movie. Joan Allen also puts in a pretty decent performance while she contributes to the movies emotional allure.<br/><br/>The final sequence of events although believed to be the climax of the movie, isn't quite. The movie all over is the climax. From the moment it immerses you into itself it is a climax. I could re-run the entire movie in my mind after having watched it once. <br/><br/>10 on 10 ....my first 10 for this genre !"

","Love stories are often about the excitement and romance of falling in love, something most of us have gone through ourselves. But what made this movie so great for me was the devotion and the pain that was born from the love. When my mother died, I (along with my father and other family members) reflected back on her life. Through her final years, our focus had been on the insecurity and moodiness she showed during her illness. But with the mourning in her passing, our focused turned to where it should have been all along - to her whole life and all the good that was born from the love she shared with my father. This movie has caused me to again reflect not only on my mother, but even more so on my father and his loss. The love my parents generated in their youth (according to my father's accounts) was passionate and exciting, but it was the love that grew over the years and matured in the sunset of their lives that was most beautiful and everlasting. This movie, more than anything, drives home the most important aspect of love - the commitment, devotion and sacrifice that can result only after years of growth."

","After a terrible film in JohnQ, the notebook is much much better and actually a great movie. I liked the notebook because first off Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do fantastic jobs being in love with each other. They often give snug facial expressions that really sell their characters. Their on screen chemistry is great and the development of Noah as the ""regular"" guy is heart felt. He was truly a genuine character. When certain choices are made in this movie I really found myself caring and hoping that certain things would happen. That is what makes a good movie; caring about the characters and their journeys. When the movie stays on track and focused on the two main characters relationship it is great, but when it tends to go off it you feel its need and you want it back faster than you get it. One part I did not like was how Martha was brought into the story and in particular the scene when she leaves. It serves no purpose towards the story and her character has no reason being in the movie let alone this scene. We only want to meet characters that serve a purpose. Other that that I thought the end could have come shorter because you get the big pay off and there is still like 15 minutes left of the movie. But anyway this is a touching film and It is definitely worth me seeing it again."

","This movie made me remember how my husband used to look at me. It made me remember how crazy we were about each other. It made me fall in love all over again. This movie WILL move you. It also makes you know the strength of true love. Must See!!! The chemistry between these two is awesome. Ryan Gosling did a remarkable job playing the romantic- totally different from his previous movies. His eyes in this movie will make you believe he really loves Allie (McAdams). Rachel McAdams also did a remarkable job. Both of these two filled their role to the T. James Garner makes you hope your husband will care for you that much one day. The story lying behind it about Allie's Alzheimer's and how she wrote the notebook could have been expressed a little more. All in all- this is a must-see-movie-that-will-make-you-cry-laugh-smile-and hope for true love!"
"Brent_P","8","2","3","6 March 2005"," Touching and somewhat original.
","I must admit I'm not a huge fan of romance movies, in fact I don't even remember the last time I've seen one that I haven't fell asleep through or laughed at. But after dodging my wife's request to watch with her after she rented it a week ago, I finally yielded so I can move on with my life and ended up being somewhat impressed.<br/><br/>""The Notebook"" is really a two-sided story regarding an elderly man (James Garner) in home that reads a love story to another elderly woman on a daily basis. The love story itself is about two love birds in the beginning of adulthood and troubled by various obstacles in life like her overbearing parents and his lack of ""successfull"" lifestyle. Noah (James Gossling) plays a free-spirited, blue collared lumber yard worker that is smitten by Allie, (nicely played by Rachel McAdams) a rich, southern belle with strict parents looking to break out of her mold. Yes, it's somewhat a ""Dirty Dancing"", bad boy/good girl tug-of-war relationship, but the movie delves deep into their lives and you soon forget the typical clichéd baseline.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good, and quite exceptional for Rachel McAdams whose has played career draining, teen queen roles in the likes of ""Mean Girls"" and another Rob Schnieder flop ""Hot Chick."" Seriously, she must have one of the best agents in the business to pull for a deep role that required acting, and pulled it off. Gossling does a somewhat notable job as the nomad lover and of course James Garner is James Garner. The story of Gossling and McAdams, coupled with the relationship between Garner and the other elderly woman is what really puts this movie together. The ending is pretty predictable along with most of the plot, but in the end it all pays off.<br/><br/>If you're not a romance fan and totally dismiss movies like this I don't blame you. But, at least give it a chance when you're totally burnt out of other movies or if your significant other is jonesing for a chick flick, pick this one up."

Lately, it's much of what I think about, and I've been encouraging many of my friends to see it. Those who have watched it, cannot get over it's profound beauty. You do not have to be a love-sick 'teeny-bopper' to enjoy this movie. My boyfriend bought it for me as a Valentine's Day gift, & even he liked it. So- you do not 'have to have a vagina' to like it.

It's narration was good from the standpoint of James Garner who is a fine actor in his own! Rachel Mcadams' character was good also. She basically stole the show. I was trying to keep up with the story of it and couldn't follow much of the characters. The ending of it, however, was much of a surprise.

"dwight_b","6","2","3","14 February 2005"," A nice movie, but a bit predictable and unoriginal
","I found the movie enjoyable since the actors did a very good job and they had very believable chemistry. I also thought that Rachel McAdams did a wonderful job portraying Allie. Unfortunately I felt that the movie was a bit predictable and plagued with little production problems. I (unfortunately) am one of those movie watchers that loses touch with a movie when I see errors in it or am easily able to guess what's going on. <br/><br/>My three biggest complaints with the movie were it's predictability, minor technical errors and odd casting. Predictability:<br/><br/>My first gripe arose at the very beginning of the movie when the unnamed old man arrives to read a story to the also unnamed elderly woman. I was IMMEDIATELY able to guess that she had memory problems and that he was going to be reading a story about their lives together. I don't know exactly why I was able predict this (I think it was a combination of various things), but I assume many people were able to get the same impression right away. Again the movie continued to be predictable when Noah's friend mentions that Allie's father is extremely wealthy... how obvious was it that her parents weren't going to accept a poor lumber worker into their family. This 'wrong side of the tracks' storyline is so cliché that it has its own expression... 'wrong side of the tracks' (see ""Love Story"", ""Cocktail"", ""Pretty In Pink"", ""Say Anything"", etc.) In one scene some rich family friends ask Noah how much money he makes, at least when the scene was originally shown in Titanic (oops another ""wrong side of the tracks"" movie) it was believable, in this movie the guy comes right out and asks his wage- does that really happen at a dinner??? In Titanic they were clearly patronizing him, in this movie it just came across as a silly plot device. Finally, how obvious was it that Allie was going to get caught cheating on her fiancé. Oops, she accidentally mentioned that she was going to be staying in the town where Noah lives and the word got back to her mom... what a huge surprise (especially since they make sure that the fiancé repeats the name of the town she is going to be staying in... just to make sure we didn't miss that he caught it). Technical Errors:<br/><br/>The first and most bothersome technical error in this movie is the historical revision of race relations in the south in the 1940s. There was a scene where Noah and his father were singing and dancing outside of his house with a group of black people. Again when Noah's father died there were black people at his funeral. Now I know that not all southerners in the 1940s were racist, but I think it's probably a fair bet to say that you wouldn't see many black people and white people singing together on front porches or standing side by side at funerals. Personally I think it's extremely unfair to African Americans for us to pretend like things were perfectly fair and fine back then. The next problem was when Alli is driving to town after having a fight with Noah, and she almost hits a truck head-on. I love the modern steering wheel cover in the car. <br/><br/>My final issue with the movie was the unusual casting; specifically with peoples' ages. In my opinion Allie's dad looked like he was about 35, the fake gray temples and horrible mustache hardly make him look as old as his wife. In addition James Garner looked nothing like young Ryan Gosling, but I can't completely blame them since Garner adds his name to the films billing. The worst casting was with Alli and Noah's children. I was guessing that Allie and Noah looked about 70-80, and if the movie was in the present day they would be about 80... but their youngest daughter looked about 18 years old! Were Allie and Noah having Kids into their 60s? All in all, this movie was OK. The plot was very basic and predictable, but I have definitely seen much worse. I am also obligated to mention that my girlfriend loved the movie."

I think he is going to be one of the biggest stars in Hollywood in the future, luckily he is well on his way at the moment.<br/><br/>It's your basic love story: rich girl meets poor boy, parents don't approve, girl meets someone else, but can't forget the first love she ever had.

","This is by far the best romantic drama I have ever seen, and it would be difficult for future movies to compete with it. Although movies with elements of romance tend to get shot down so easily by viewers, I definitely thought ""The Notebook"" was worthy of a positive judgment. The story was beautiful and I can not think of one way I would change it. This is not simply a movie about two people falling in love and living happily ever after. It is a movie that gives you a view of how two people in love can find their way back together after a cruel separation. If you have not seen this movie in the theater, I encourage you to rent it when it comes out on DVD. I know it's a love story, and you may be figuring that it may not be worth your time, but I can assure you that there is nothing typical about it. The acting is superb, and I could watch it over and over again. It brought tears to my eyes. Will it bring tears to yours? Take a chance, and find out. Now, if you'll excuse me, I have to go buy the book!"

These two young actors seriously nailed these parts. This film had some pretty amazing casting directors. But anyway, i had not seen a movie like this for ages. This film never lost my attention once, it was to real. It was as if everything the characters were experiencing and feeling, i was feeling somewhat. And the two leads, ""Rachel and Ryan"" were to of the most likable people a person could see on screen. Then towards the ending i lost it.

"harry_tk_yung","Null","2","3","12 September 2004"," A few things I like about The Notebook
","Spoilers<br/><br/>It's a story, no it's two stories, both of which we have seen times and again. To link the two together is perceptive, but that's to the credit of the writer of the book on which the movie is based. The movie makers, however, are still faced with the task of making something that we come across as often as pancake, bacon and chickens (thanks, Noah) into something that at least delights, if not deeply touches the audience. Generally, it has been successfully done.<br/><br/>First and foremost is the cast. The last time I saw Ryan Gosling was in The Believer, when he plays an explosive, complex character of as Nazi who actually had a Jewish origin. So I know what he is capable of. As Noah in The Notebook, he displays most of the time a stoicism that reminds me of Josh Lucas. But then there are one or two explosive moments when we see the fire in him. Rachel McAdam from St. Thomas, Ontario I've not seen before. In her, I see a little bit of Kate Beckinsale. She will go a lot further than the lot in Mona Lisa Smiles. The last time I saw Gena Rowlands was too recent, in Taking Lives, an entirely different role. In Notebook, the role she plays may not seem too difficult  someone who has lost her memory (politicians perfect that performance on a daily basis!) But then, it's in the moment she regains her memory that we see her true steel. The biggest joy is seeing James Gardner still so active in making movies. True, he has a most winning role to play, but it also needs a winning actor to make it work. <br/><br/>All the scenes between Gosling and McAdam and between Gardner and Rowlands have been commented on. Not having gone through all the comments, I cannot say that no one commented on the one particular scene that really delighted me. This is the encounter between Allie and Martha (Noah's mate at the time, a lonely war widow) at Noah's house the morning after Noah and Allie rediscovered each other. From the moment the three appear together at the door in the morning, to the evening when Noah sees Martha off in her car, it's so elegantly done, and quite touching.<br/><br/>This is one of the movies in which a house plays a very important, pivotal role in the story. Two others that come to mind immediately are Shipping News and Life as a House.<br/><br/>Younger members of the audience may leave the cinema in a strange mood, not certain whether it's a story in which the lovers live happily ever after. I tend to look at it as an answer to a question posted in the title of the Bee Gee's most popular song 'How deep is your love'. James Gardner (the role he plays) is the answer."
"krational-66550","9","1","1","4 June 2020"," Love is complete.
","I watched a movie very much like a fairy in the early morning
This is a simple love story, a pair of first lovers experienced all kinds of joys and sorrows and finally broke through. Romantic and beautiful.
However, what makes people feel different is that the whole story is interspersed in the memories of old age. The old man reads this past story to his wife who has lost his memory.
They have been together for a lifetime and have sons and granddaughters. He still had to accompany her in the last time, waiting for a miracle.
He said, because she is my baby.
At the end of the story, she finally remembered him. Although only a short time.
She cried and embraced him and told him I love you.<br/><br/>In the midnight ward, he walked quietly to her bed and called her gently.
She opened her eyes and looked at him, calling his name. Noah, do you believe that our love will work wonders?
He said, I believe, so I will bring you back to my side.
The tears in her eyes were crystal clear. Will our love take us away?
Our love is infinite.
He lay down beside her, holding her hand tightly.
He says. I will always protect you.<br/><br/>The two gray-haired old men held hands together and left.<br/><br/>If the ending of the fairy tale is so beautiful, why is there so much sentimentality?
Seeing that there is still no trace of change in love even when it reaches the end of life, it is actually full of tragic color.
Such an ancient love made people cry.<br/><br/>The reason why fairy tales are beautiful is because they are out of reach.<br/><br/>She likes to wear red, so passionate colors, just like her character.
He was a happy and carefree man before, and she became silent and decadent after losing her.
He promised to rebuild a manor for her, and there was a room facing the stream for her to paint.
He wrote 365 letters, all of which were detained by her mother.
He experienced a war and she fell in love again.
She saw the bearded man and the manor behind him in the newspaper, and couldn't help flying to find him.
They quarreled in the heavy rain and finally realized that they still love each other.<br/><br/>This is an ordinary love story. Everyone will experience love, but not everyone will have the love that is firm to each other.
There are not so many excuses for love. If it cannot be completed, it can only show that it is not enough."

","A star crossed love story being told again to the couple who can't seem to remember. The Notebook based on the book by famous novelist Nicholas Sparks. A story that takes us back to the late 1930s of a high school summer romance. Young, dumb, and crazy in love. Rich girl Allie Hamilton comes to Seabrooke, N.C. Bring your lunch, clock in, and clock out Noah Callhoun meets Allie at a carnival and Noah shows how crazy and how far he is willing to go for Allie. And like that the couple was inseparable all summer. They find an abandoned house that Noah promises to buy and fix and make it how Allie wants it. Allies parents don't accept Noah and his social status which bring lighting and thunder within their relationship. Allie and her family move from Seabrook and her and Noah never talk since. Noah writes to her everyday for a year but Allie's mother hides the letters from her trying to prevent Allie from making the same mistake she almost made. Allie before her wedding to a new man finds Noah's ad in the paper he built for her. The house was the only thing he had left, and he knew deep down it will be the reason he will see Allie again. That blooms love again and they are back at it like they never left.
The theme of the movie is definitely the value of money can't outbuy true love. Allie's parents refused and took Allie back to New York so her summer fling with a poor young boy who makes forty cents an hour couldn't provide enough for their daughter. Allie found a man of looks and had that statue of money to his name. That wasn't enough for Allie; she found herself running back to Noah. Also the power of love does many things to somebody. Allie and Noah grew old together and Noah suffers from strokes and Allie suffers from chronic dementia. Noah believes she will remember because of the power of love. Then she has those flashes of the memories and her old life because of the power of love. Another major scene of the movie is when Allie comes back to Noah and she begins to leave again, he knows this time he won't let her go this time that their love is too strong and pure to let go again.
A scene analyzing is the scene where Allie and Noah get off the canoe from being caught in the rain and they open up about their feelings. The motif, angles and dark lighting and adding the rain to the scene shows how much they've been through together in the past. During the toughest storms now they are going to be together.
A reference to another film like the notebook is another Nicholas Spark book called the Best of Me, where a family feud within the movie. The high school summer loving couple split apart and that love never disappears and only grows stronger."

Some people always say that the past should not be remembered, and let it stay in the memories. Then the banner of this miss, sentimental everywhere. This movie makes up for our regrets in love to some extent, telling us this truth: When we work hard to love each other and fulfill our promises, why can't we be together? Dear Ellie, I had trouble sleeping last night because I knew it was over between us and I no longer suffer because I knew that there was true love between us.

","""The Notebook""<br/><br/>As the beginning of the movie opens, we find Noah Calhoun(RyanGosling), a poor mill worker and Allie Hamilton(Rachel McAdams), a rich girl from Virginia. While on vacation they meet at a carnival and fall in love. They are soon separated because Allie's parents, Anne and John Hamilton(Joan Allen and David Thornton), don't approve and they return home with their family. Noah goes off to war, and Allie believes Noah forgot about her.
In this award winning film by Nicholas Sparks, we soon learn that love never dies and for this amazing couple, Allie and Noah never give up on love. For this dynamic duo, love conquers all and with all of their challenges they endure love, separation, social differences and illness.
Later, we see Duke(James Garner)resident in a nursing home, reading a romantic story to a woman(Gena Rawlands) with dementia and memory loss only to find out it is Noah and Allie, many years later. Noah is called Duke as to keep from upsetting Allie and he visits and reads to Allie everyday so that she will remember their lives together. They are just as in love today, as the day they first fell in love, even if Allie's memories are slipping away from her. This is a very moving and heart warming story that everyone should see.
This movie was romantic, heartwarming and amazing in itself. Allie and Noah portrays brilliantly an amazing couple who never gave up on love no matter what challenges they had faced. It moved me just to watch this amazing movie.
The notebook is a feel good movie about love, and reminds me of another geat love struck movie by Nicholas Sparks, A walk to remember. In this award winning movie, we were introduced to another young couple who were passionately in love but faced many obstacles, social differences, illness and death.<br/><br/>The movie, ""The Notebook"", had man great attributes including the motif that love conquers all in the movie, and some really amazing camera shots, during the scenes where these two had realized they were ""not over"". The camera shots where Allie got out of her car and stared in disbelief at Noah, and then ran into his arms, just amazing. Watched in awe as if I was right there with the two of them. I was in a trance myself as I watched on, and they we got to hear the invisible sounds like the bolt of thunder when Allie and Noah first saw each other after being separated.
Nicholas Spark does it again! This amazing movie about ever lasting love, for a young couple with social differences, will warm your heart as you delve into their amazing love story."

","The movie opens up with an elderly woman in a nursing home. along with this woman in a nursing home is an elderly man asking to read to her. Seeing the elderly man and woman first might confuse the viewer because they may wonder what their relevance to the movie. As the movie goes along the man is telling his story from his book. The viewer may get caught up in the movie forgetting the older man is reading the book. The director does not let the viewer get too caught up because he brings the movie back to the older man. The scenes where the older man and woman are not being shown is the beautiful love story between a young rich girl and a young poor boy and how one summer they cross paths at a fair in the small town of New Bern, North Carolina. The two seem to have everything going against them. Whether it is the girl's, (Allie) parents who believe the boy (Noah) is trash and doesn't deserve her or Allie's ambitions and her life ahead of her which was always destined. The two end up breaking up after that one summer but they do not leave each other without the viewer's heart being torn. The movie shows they clearly love each other but obstacles seem to be too big. At one point in the movie, the love story takes a break and we are brought back to the nursing home. the elderly man, Duke, his children come to visit him. the elderly woman ,Allie, is with him and grants permission to meet his kids. The kids introduce themselves and after while Allie leaves. It is then revealed to the viewer that Allie suffers from Alzheimer's and she doesn't remember that the kids standing in front of her are her kids. It is also revealed that Duke is indeed her husband that she also does not remember. This creates a shock and a slight turn in the movie because viewers realize the two broke but somehow the end up together over 60 years later, but how? The movie is brought back to the stories of the love story of Noah and Allie. This brings the close of the scene of the two young lovers and close onto how they found their way back to each other despite the odds. The two lovers find out that when one truly loves the other they always find their way back if they try hard enough. The writers and directors of the movie wants the viewer to want to be Noah and Allie. Girls dreaming of a man who will go through what seems to be a lifetime of mountains to end up with the only girl he could ever truly love. Maybe the also wanted guys to have a girl like Allie who is worth the problems because they could want to love a girl the way Not loved her. The very end of the movie which many people interprets to be sad and will ""rip your heart out"" can be seen as to be sweet because the two lovers are still in love ad they leave the earth together and so their love story die with each other."

","The movie begins in 1940 where young and poor Noah (Ryan Gosling) falls in love with rich Allie (Rachel McAdams). Naturally she hates him at first but soon falls in love with him too. However her parents are horrified and keep them apart. Seven years later they meet and she's already set to marry someone else (James Marsters). Can she forget Noah? Also the story has a wrap around featuring an elderly couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands).<br/><br/>At first I hated this film. I disliked the characters and was insulted by the non-stop clichés popping up. But, eventually it won me over. The acting was great, the cinematography stunning and the story moved briskly. By the end I was crying my eyes out nonstop. This is a very romantic but heart-breaking movie to watch. Recommended but plenty of tissues handy."

","This is my all-time favorite movie it's not just a love story. Intertwines a beautiful love story with the ups and downs of life and if you're lucky enough to love ones like that in your life I truly believe that's what life is about that's what makes this movie so beautiful. I'm personally a hopeless romantic and yes a male.I just think it's sad how our society is nowadays you can not have a love like that now people are un trustworthy i wish the world is how it used to be back then plain and simple."

","I watched this movie cuz I was looking for romantic movie it's been a while I haven't watched a movie like that so I went with the notebook cuz it was highly rated and to be honest it delivered Especially the end I would say that the start wasn't that miracles but story is just amazing especially if u did not read the book and u'r not planning to ( according to IMDB most of people who read the book didn't like the movie).
I honestly didn't like Rayan Goseling play I would say he could've done better, but I ve enjoyed everything else the pictures the soundtrack and the way I felt when I was watching it, made me happy when it's happy and I was crying when it was sad, I really loved it till the end."
"taliahebert","9","1","1","9 August 2018"," Simply romantic
","It's not wonder why the novels and the films written by perhaps one of the greatest romance novelists in history, are so popular. This film, particularly, explores genuine themes of love and death, presenting the idea that love is worth fighting for. Using mise-en-scene, visual elements within the camera's frame focuses on telling the story, evoking sensory emotions through common human feelings and experiences. There are noticeable melodramatic clichés following the irony of rich, reputative girl falls for poor, hardworking boy - both from opposite ends of the social spectrum. Alongside the difficulty and distress of Allie's parents' disapproval, tearing the two apart, you really admire the sentimentality of the story, especially as Noah contests for Allie throughout most of the storyline. The two reignite their incessant, passionate love following Allie's engagement with another man. 
The seamless weaving of the elderly man and woman in the present with Noah and Allie's connection in the past, makes their romance even more classic. It is evident that Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allison ""Allie"") have a strong connection, thus consistently providing the viewers with realistic aspect of love; including the positives and negatives. The main actors, Gosling and McAdams, perceive their characters very well, emotionally and physically throughout the film. 
This story isn't just narrow and straightforward, there are twists and ultimatums, thus making the story even more meaningful and engaging. Watching this film never fails to provide the audience with an exploding mixture of emotions."

","Probably after Titanic the movie most adored by young girls- just a guess but I am probably correct. It is melodramatic, sentimental and even cliched but Gosling and McAdam's (who were an item whilst filming) are too good actors to let all that become obvious."
"clifto-18832","8","1","1","14 December 2017"," *Spoiler Alert*
","""The Notebook"" (2004) is a great love story about Noah, Ryan Gosling and Allie, Rachel McAdams based off of the famous novel written by Nicholas Sparks. The film is the story of how Noah and Allie met and their lives together being read later in life out of journal by Noah to Allie while she is suffering from Alzheimer's. 
 This story is your normal cliché love story that everyone loves. The guy chasing after a girl, her parents not approving and in the end the two of them fall in love and live a happy life. In the beginning Allie meets Noah at a local carnival. Noah spends most of his time throughout the film trying to convince Allie to fall in love with him and convince her parents that he is good enough for her, although he is a boy from the other side of town. Quickly, Allie falls into him and their story continues despite her parent's approval. Allie's mother is the one who causes much of the problems in this film. She sets them up to begin fighting in many different way and eventually to stop talking all together while Allie moves away for school.
 While she is away Noah continues to love her, and try his best to contact her throughout many years apart. He builds their dream home and goes out of his way to make sure that they could rekindle the fire that was once there. 
 A few years later, Allie and Noah run into each other and it all unravels. Everything that Noah had done, all of the letters that you later find out Allies mother had been hiding. They fall in love all over again until the day that they are sitting there while Noah is reading to Allie while she doesn't remember. The movie closes with the two of them having the ends of their lives together just like it always should have been. 
 So, in conclusion while wanting to watch this movie, expect it to be your average Nicholas Sparkes film just like these others; safe heaven, the longest ride and the best of me etc."
"groktalo","4","1","1","28 January 2013"," Overly sentimental, but not boring
","Having seen the relatively high score by both the public at large and the critics, as far as a romance movie goes, I had had pretty high expectations. Unfortunately, I was disappointed. It is clear from the very beginning that the intention of the movie was to get viewers' eyes well up with tears in response to over-the-top sentimentality. At the end of the movie, I felt neither entertained nor in any way enlightened. <br/><br/>It seems that 'The Notebook' is trying to tell us that the true love happens only once in a lifetime and we can all guess what the rest of the message is. Granted, the love story is presented without too many clichés, in the very beginning at least. <br/><br/>In sum, if you are into overly sentimental romantic dramas, this is a movie for you. Otherwise, it's not terrible to watch, but far from great."

","The Notebook is a romantic movie of a poor young boy and rich girl. I think it's a Women / Teenage Girls movie. There is something emotional in this particular movie that we men don't and will never understand. It's nature.<br/><br/>Today, I have seen two movies. One is Titanic (for the third time) and second one is The Notebook. I was surprised to note that IMDb rating for Titanic is 7.5 whereas The Notebook is 7.9 out of 10. I will never ever see this movie again because it did not touch my heart.<br/><br/>If I am not wrong and hear it correctly then ""a woman's heart is a deep ocean"".............now I understood the meaning of the line."

I didn't mind it but i thought it was a bit boring some scenes of the film are OK but some are dreadful i love the bit on the beach that was my favourite. When back in the nursing home i really don't see people thought it was that sad as it was just people getting older. Just because a film made you cry doesn't mean it is any good. there are much better films i think and my friends couldn't believe i didn't even shed a tear.

","I don't have a heart of stone and I do like a bit of romance.This was a movie that I had read about on IMDb and it had many a glowing review.So why did it leave me so cold?I'll try and explain.<br/><br/>First the good.It is generally well acted,especially Ryan Gosling and James Garner.I did think that Joan Allen gave probably the finest performance though.Mmmm,now the not so good.I found the two romantic leads to be slightly annoying,what with him hanging from the Big Wheel and lying in the road waiting for the traffic lights to change.Grow up sprang to mind.I just didn't connect at all with either of them.Then there is the cynical attempts to make the viewer sob uncontrollably.<br/><br/>The boy's father dies(where did that spring from?).They drift apart,she meets someone else,they meet again and fall in love.I have seen this so many times that this movie just didn't offer anything different.*MAJOR SPOILER ALERT*----Then there was the ending.What the hell can we do to have the audience sobbing their hearts out?Yep,They can both die in bed together.I may seem an unfeeling oaf,but I didn't feel the slightest twinge of emotion because I could kind of guess something like that would happen.That was the major fault of this movie.There are just so many clichéd moments you can take.When emotion is done well it can work brilliantly.The endings of 'It's A Wonderful Life','Gladiator','Braveheart' or 'City Lights' are classic examples of the viewer being gradually drawn in in a very subtle way.'The Notebook' may well be a very popular movie amongst many people,it just 'aint my cup of tea."
"Leparsdon","5","1","1","19 July 2006"," Formulaic, predictable film
","Like the title of this says, this film was one of the most formulaic and predictable pieces of drivel this side of the Mississippi. Right at the beginning it reminds you of all of the dozen movies that have been written that just added to the overall cheesiness that they make you sit through, trying to make it seem as if they are really telling you something new. The acting wasn't bad, it was better than most in this genre of film and once again you see James Marsden as the other guy that's only there as a matter of convenience. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling held their own, but the real problem that I have with this is just that it is so gosh darn irritatingly sappy. So to conclude this review, I wouldn't really recommend this film, sure it's good if you are a prepubescent girl who still has some silly ideal about how love is supposed to be (and mind you films like this only reinforce the rarity of ""true love"") the sad fact is in the real world things just don't work out that way.<br/><br/>5/10"
"SmileysWorld","8","1","1","27 December 2005"," How love should be
","I am not a big fan of so-called ""chick flicks"",but I found myself to be very affected by this film.A young man sets his sights on a beautiful young lady.She resists,mainly because at first she on a date with another fellow.He persists,eventually winning her heart.They are total opposites,and butt heads quite often,but opposites are supposed to attract.There are bumps in the road for the young couple,including a big one that leads the young lady at one point to be engaged to another.They get past this hurdle,only to find bigger ones down the road.This film successfully illustrates to us that true love overcomes the greatest of obstacles.Virtual newcomers Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as the young couple shine brightly,as do established veterans James Garner and Gena Rowlands as the couple in their later years.Although there are not many physical similarities between the two couples in my opinion,the sweet story line helps you past that rather well.I challenge anyone who isn't into romantic films to give it a look.You just might like it.Excellent film!"

I sat down expecting a crappy movie and then got up at the end crying my heart out and thinking over and over that this was one of my favorite movies ever.

"Utoepeea","10","1","1","1 April 2005"," Great writing, Great story... Amazing film
","This movie has been on my mind since I saw the trailer sometime last year. It totally slipped my mind until a co-worker told me to rent it.<br/><br/>This movie was soo easy going and personable that not only did I get emotionally invested, but my husband did as well. At one point, it was so intense and emotionally charged that we almost started hating the writer and director for making such a wonderful movie. At times, I had to just pause the film so I could just catch my breath and so I could continue with watching it.<br/><br/>This movie probably has been the best ""love drama"" kind of movie in well over five years. I cannot say enough about this film to even due it justice. I know what I like and to me it is a pretty simple concept. Good writing, good story, good director and most importantly....good cast will more than likely equal an AWESOME movie. (and those are odds I would bet in Vegas with) I am not sure why this movie was not up for an Oscar, Golden Globe, or any of these kinds of awards. I think the voters really missed the boat on this one, and someone (or people) were left out of a very important season that in most cases should have included them."
"jpschapira","9","1","1","31 March 2005"," Now is the time to say it: All you need is love
","I was, when I saw it some weeks ago, and still am amazed with this movie. I'm talking about one of the best romantic movies I've ever seen. The romantic movies that combine that passionate loved with drama and a perfect chemistry between the leads.<br/><br/>My God! Rachel McAdams looked gorgeous in this picture; that's one thing that had to be said. Her performance was also great, for the kind of character she was playing (I'm saying this because of the other characters she has played; superficial sometimes). She can actually act, and this role is going to give her the opportunity to grow, although it was not recognized. I'm not saying it was overlooked, but it was impossible. Ryan Gosling got the performance of his life as Noah. He has chosen interesting roles in the past, but didn't have the chance to shine. Every move he makes here is perfect; his performance is flawless (although, as McAdams, impossible to be recognized). His way of talking remind me of Sylvester Stallone, when he played Rocky in the first film of the anthology; a little bit rough and dumb, but the perfect sum for a person in love. Anyway, the movie depended on the chemistry between the two young actors, and they didn't disappoint at all.<br/><br/>The pros, Garner and Rowlands, have the same chemistry Gosling and McAdams have, only that they are older. Garner has been recognized with the Screen Actors Guild, for his whole career, and with his performance as Duke, he closes a cycle of an entire career. Rowlands seems pleased to be working with his son; who must admire her for everything she has done. Her work is remarkable, as Nick's. I heard Cassavetes directed this film because he wanted to. He hasn't got a great career as a director, but he knows what he's doing. He knows how to create the environment, for the whole movie, and for each frame in it. I saw him watching the actors from close, in each scene. He wants to watch everything; direct but also make the actors feel comfortable and sure of what they are doing. It shows.<br/><br/>""The Notebook"" is actually a novel. And if it wasn't because of Nicholas Sparks' hands and inspiration (when he wrote his first novel), this film wouldn't exist. How romantic a story can be when it starts with the paragraph that says more or less like this: ""I'm a common man. There are no monuments dedicated to me and soon my name will be forgotten; but in one way, I have succeeded as any other being in this world: I have loved another person with all my heart"". The answer you'll find it watching ""The notebook"". The movie has many beautiful and moving scenes; sometimes, you know what is going to happen although you don't want that to happen. But those are the scenes you will see, and enjoy as I did.<br/><br/>I don't know if this has been said, but I had to put it. The rain is falling down, and Allie (McAdams), says angrily to Noah (Gosling): ""Why did you end it? Why was it over?"". ""It was not over"", he answers with tears in his eyes. ""And it still isn't over"".<br/><br/>And it will never be."

","I was a bit skeptical of this movie. Firstly; I'm not a huge fan of ""chick-flicks"" and secondly I had read a few critic's reviews and none of them seemed to indicate anything out of the ordinary love story. However, my wife said that we needed to watch it so I rented it and from the moment the movie started until the very end I was captivated by it. The acting chemistry between McAdams and Gosling is pure magic. They are so believable that they make the viewer feel as if they aren't watching a movie, but watching a documentary.<br/><br/>I won't say anything about the plot as I wouldn't want to ruin anything for anybody, but it's a marvelous story and not one that's easily forgotten. I highly encourage everyone to watch this film. You won't be disappointed."

It was the type of movie that I didn't want to end. When it did, I thought that it was very touching. It is a movie of continuous power. It has ups and downs and when it finally ends, it ends well.

It was sad that they both died at the end, but extremely wonderful that they did together. Noah worked hard to get Ali back, he did anything he could to make her remember him, if only for a short while. That is true love, never giving up on the thing you love.

","This will become a classic love story. My wife and I watched it together and it confirmed that we are where we are supposed to be. I truly believe that relationships like the one portrayed in the movie exist today but are not celebrated. We mostly only get to see the negative aspects with being involved in one. Too many times people just settle for something that might be safe or more accepted by others. I think this more often then not leads to regrets. Much like the one that was stated by Ali's mother towards the end of the movie. Total commitment to each other is what it takes to make a close and real relationship work and I think that was shown. Was this a movie that ""moved"" me? Absolutely! Great movie!"

Ryan Gosling could probably be the next Tom Cruise. Having mostly built his career on playing dark characters, he pulled off this romantic lead pretty well.<br/><br/>The story itself is touching and does tug at your heart strings.

Noah, the main actor is indisputably the most convincing actor I have ever seen. He delivers an example that should be followed by other men. You'll want to watch it over and over.....It's tough being single when you view this movie, but I have faith that"" What you are seeking in this life is seeking you also"".

In a true love affair, as so appropriately shown by the wonderful acting by James Garner and the rest of the cast, you never give up on your loved one, even when that means being someone new in their life every day.<br/><br/>This story touched me, as well, because I had just lost my husband of 20-years within 6 months of viewing the movie, and had experienced many of the same things during his final days.<br/><br/>This was the movie that James Garner was made for; his acting skills could not have been more ""right on."""

","This movie is authentic! The cinema photography beautiful!! The music, everything about this movie is for the person who has truly had the experience of true love!! This movie portrays what real love is all about in every sense, and for the those who have been critical that this movie was ""corny"" one would have to question whether or not they have had the unbelievable pleasure of a truly real love experience!!! Well done!!!!!Hurray one of my most favorite movies of all time, from the opening scenes until the very end...this movie captivates our hearts!!!The actors were well chosen and very believable. I cried and laughed through out the entire film. America needs more of this kind of stuff."

It did make me cry out of sadness and happiness. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams did an incredible job in this movie and have an amazing and unique chemistry. <br/><br/>I never really thought one way or another about Ryan Gosling until this movie.

"Brippa","9","1","1","22 February 2005"," Main Overview of The Notebook
","The Notebook is a wonderful romantic movie set Southern U.S.A in the 1940's during World War 2. Allie is a seventeen year old wealthy, snobbish girl living in New York with strict parents allowing her to only date rich young men. Noah is a 19 year old poor,romantic man who is architecturally gifted, living with his father in an old house. When Allie visits the town where Noah lives for the summer, they miraculously fall in love but are torn away by Allie's selfish parents. After Allie returns home, she meets another boy who she might be falling on love with too. But Noah can't stop thinking about Allie even while fighting in the war. When it all comes down to it, Allie must choose between her first love and her new flame. I highly recommend everyone see this movie. It is beautiful and proves our true love is really out there somewhere."
"weirwoman","10","1","1","22 February 2005"," Regarding ""The Notebook""
","I feel that ""The Notebook"" is an excellent love story! It is timeless, moving, ""edge of your seat"" romance. It drew me in at the beginning and it is now three days later and I can't stop thinking about the relationships that the movie portrayed. With a box of Kleenex handy I could watch this movie over and over again. It is not a cliché love story which is so refreshing. The twists and turns in each of the character's lives is so realistic - the movie just doesn't stop. The WHOLE movie right up to the end was just magnificent! I also think the acting by Gena Rowlands was wonderfully moving. She captured her part marvelously in such a short time. I enjoyed it immensely! An 11 out of 10."

","This movie was excellent! It was so romantic to see two young teenagers fall in love then reunite after 7 years and then when aged, to see them still very much in love and together even though their were differences. My favorite scene was when Allie came back to Seabrook to see how Noah was doing and then he taking her for a ride out on his boat. It rains and she stops and turns around and ask Noah why he did not write her. His response was, ""I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you everyday for a year."" Allie-""You wrote me?"" Noah-""YES! It wasn't over. It still isn't."" Then the two go into a passionate love scene. The two young couples made their love seem so real, the love-making seemed true."
"amandalstr","10","1","1","21 February 2005"," Magnificent; the acting, the location, the story
","It has been less than 24 hours since I rented the DVD, but the thoughts and images from the movie have stayed with me. It has been several years, perhaps since Somewhere in Time when I was a teenager, that I have been so affected by a film. The story is magnificent in it's simplicity. The acting is magnificent in the apparent endearment of the actors to their roles and their place in the story. The locations are magnificent in their pristine and uncluttered and unpolluted place not only as a part of geography but as a part in time. I will see this movie again, damn the late fees, and I will buy it as well as the novel on my next trip to a place that sells either. This movie is a treasure and ashames me to think that I have ever said that I have loved someone."
"Emilip05","10","1","1","21 February 2005"," Awesome Love Story
","I must say that this is one of the best love stories that I have ever heard of. I saw this movie five times in theater, and attempted to buy it the day it was released, however it was sold out. I have watched it six times in TWO days, and I bawl just the same every time (if not more.) It is hard to find love like this in today's world. While watching this movie, it is almost like you fall into it, you forget that you are living in the real world, and you feel like you are a part of these people's lives, you feel as if you are Alli and Noah. In many parts you cry, and in many parts you laugh... you may even get angry a few times, but even after the 11th time you've seen it, it will leave you longing for more, because let's face it folks, we all want a love story so genuine."
"evil_squirrel6916","10","1","1","20 February 2005"," Complete Daydream!
","This is the best movie if you have a summer love, or no love at all...you can just imagine yourself in Allie's position. the love that she feels for Noah is incredibly unbelievable and just the thought of having that euphoria is unbelievable...Every girl dreams of that one hero sweeping them off of their feet, and there always seems to be that one obstacle that wakes us up to the reality that we don't have that hero. and with the imagination of this movie, it makes us feel like we need to obtain it even more, to have such a feeling of happiness. It's something that we all desire. and when we imagine ourselves in this movie, its obtainable."
"MsCub4ever","10","1","1","20 February 2005"," An important scene was deleted
","I DON'T KNOW IF THIS IS CONSIDERED A SPOILER. I watched the deleted scenes when I bought the DVD and I believe the scene where Allie is giving Noah her handwritten notebook, explaining he should read this to her in a few years and she'll come back to him, should be added to the actual movie. It's just a key piece of information that really ties everything together. There are other deleted scenes too but I think some of them were probably deleted to keep the rating from shooting up to an R-rating. This was such a good movie. I saw it twice at the theater and have watched it three more times since I bought the DVD. Oh how I wish I could have been like Rachel and made the right decision."
"digimom99","10","1","1","20 February 2005"," Brought to tears
","After watching this movie last night, I was literally sobbing. I don't fall easily into girlie movies, yet this one for some reason went right to my heart. I was 17 once, full of fire and emotions. I was exactly the type that would lay in the street and watch stop lights, just because of the fact that no one else does it. There is no reason for it, except that you are young. I got that part. What touched me the most was the love between the older Noha and Allie, and they are the ones that brought me to tears. To me, the story seems like it didn't have to be anymore than it was, it was supposed to be a story about someone's lives, the story of their life, and to them, it was important enough, it was special enough that they would do anything to relive it.. It was a story of young love, maturity, and true love that never dies. In my opinion, acted out very well by all. I loved all the characters in this movie. It made me wish I was there too."

"Scorching","7","1","1","24 January 2005"," The best among the Sparks adapted movies
","If you have previously watched films that were based on a Nicholas Sparks' novel than you can pretty much get the tone of this movie. It really has the same framework on this one. People have been saying that thus novel by far was the best from Sparks and there was a good chance that it would translate in to a good film. Well among the three movies I got to say that this movie is indeed the best one as it had the best story. The characters too were far more complex and developed.<br/><br/>I thought the acting of the veteran actors was stronger than their younger counterparts. Even if they only had a limited screen time and were doing very little they were very effective especially at the latter part of the film. The young ones did a good job especially from Gosling. Unfortunately for McAdams I had only seen Mean Girls a few short weeks ago and it was a little hard for me to see her doing two completely different roles.<br/><br/>Definitely a good tearjerker of a film & I was expecting a lot considering the rave reviews of those who have seen it before me. It did just enough for my expectations to be met."

I hope they make a follow up movie on the THE WEDDING, the sequel to the THE NOTEBOOK...also incredibly written with much depth and love put into each character.

","****Contains spoiler****************<br/><br/>I took my wife clothes shopping and then to a chick flick. That made me top dog; a situation nearly undone by an argument over whether in the early part of the film the setting is, romantically set in the house that Noah built or, more logically, a nursing home in a similar location. I quite enjoyed the film. The main character, Noah is engaged in the Sisyphean task of reading the story of a life long romance to his wife, who is suffering from dementia, in the hope that she will remember him and their romance. Apparently he has done this a few times and having labored through the story, is rewarded with a relatively (minutes) where she remembers their life and love together. The story unfolds as he reads the narrative. Given the amount of alcohol that he consumes during history, it is ironic that she cops the dementia. The film certainly elicited tears from my wife."

","I thought I was going to get in an accident driving home after watching this, I just could not stop thinking about it. If this movie doesn't move you nothing will. It is full of passion, romance, and emotion. The use of the flash backs makes your love for the characters so much stronger. The whole movie is layered with beauty. The casting for this film was very well done. Ryan Gosling has a lot of gravitational pull here in his depiction of Noah. His charming performance shows how much potential he has. You can never go wrong with James Garner. Sam Shepard, and Joan Allen put in very strong supporting roles as parents of the young lovers. The only downfall to such a beautiful story is that everyone is going to go home unsatisfied with there own true love. So just remember it is just a movie and make sure you have plenty of tissues with you when you watch it."

","This will be on every true romantics Top 10 list, and this may well go down as the greatest love story since Casablanca. Guys listen to your girlfriends / wives and go see this movie. I honestly hope that this movie is considered for some Oscars because it deserves some. The acting is incredible, James Garner fans will love his role in the movie. Honestly I can be a pretty harsh critic, but I could not find any fault in this movie. The scenery was awesome, the story just sweeps you away into that all to familiar love you felt with your first love. I can't think of any one thing I would change, and these young actors will get some great roles in the not so distant future I hope. I have never heard of this director before, but I will be looking for more movies from this director. I left this movie knowing that there is a special love out there for everyone. This movie is just fun, and it is a great escape from the real world. Enjoy this movie and plan on adding it to your DVD shelf! I have been disappointed with the Accademy before, but I can't imagine this movie not getting some much deserved Oscar attention in February."

And, I feel that the actors did a very good job portraying their characters. Ryan and Rachel are both really attractive,sensual and endearing as the young couple. Their story is both beautiful and heartbreaking at the same time, at the end. I wish that I could find someone who loves as Noah did, with every fiber of his being; never giving up hope that his true love would return to him. Only to have to lose her over and over, day after day, as age and an unforgiving disease steal her mind/memories away. James Garner and Gena Rowlands are superb!"

Fantastically, utterly believably acted - I got completely drawn into the film, identifying with the characters; artistically filmed with the most beautiful scenes adding to the aesthetic enjoyment, underpinned with beautiful music. Finally a film that captures the reality and transforming power of love beyond the boundaries of youth and of life as we know it. A wonderful counterweight to the usual messages conveyed to us - even daring to mention the word ""God"" at one central scene contrasting science with love (with God). I went to see it four times, the first time ever to do this with any film. Truly inspiring."

The performances are so powerful that you forget these people are just actors reading scripts. I don't remember the last time I was so deeply moved by a film.<br/><br/>I have read a few detractions. Those comments, however, were written by emotional amoebas who couldn't put together a cohesive sentence. With this in consideration, I would have to say that this film is not for the desensitized or mentally inept.<br/><br/>I would give this movie a 9.9 out of 10, but only because nobody's perfect.

You are guaranteed to at least get misty eyed..or have a good cry or two. If not then you are not breathing! I give it thumbs up as well as my hubby! Waiting for it to come out on video and add it to our collection! I would not show it to children under age 12 at least...but I took my children to see it and they weren't upset by it or in shock of seeing sexual scenes. However I probably wouldn't have taken my 10 yr. old had I known beforehand that it went as far as it did. On the other hand...she really loved the movie as did her sister.

Even if you don't, its good, but it's better to read the book first in this case, even thought the book is different in quite a few ways. If you plan on watching this movie, just be prepared to cry your eyes out for probably about the last half hour of it, or so. It's horribly sad and happy, all at once, but it might just end up being the best movie you've ever seen, and even if it isn't, anybody who has seen the movie will tell you it's definitely worth it. So, if you haven't seen this, you really are missing out, but just to let you know, the amount of heart-breaking, heart-warming, and teary-eyed moments in this movie is almost too much to handle - the movie was just sooooooo good."

But they way the scenes were directed, well, for all you women out there that love good love scenes, you WILL NOT be disappointed, that's for sure. It's the things that are not only in action, but the actual words that they say. Whew. This movie was rated PG 13, and there isn't much cursing in it as well. But personally, I wouldn't let anyone under 16 see it, because of the love scenes. This movie is spectacular. A+++++++++++. Anyone that hasn't seen it, PLEASE see it. Not just a chick flick.

","I watched this wonderful, beautiful film last night knowing absolutely nothing about it and was totally captivated by its softness, delicacy and truth-a combination not often seen in American movies. I saw no crime, no bloodshed and no guns but the human drama that was played out before our wet eyes was that which we can all relate to through all the convolutions of human existence.<br/><br/>I don't watch movies that I don't think I'll like; therefore, in the first minute I know that this is going to be watchable and if it is, then I have no eye for mistakes-if the movie has swept me in I am its captive and I will care nothing for possible mistakes. If I'm not mistaken the first scene was that beautiful image of Noah rowing a boat in the darkening evening on one of those lugubrious South Carolina rivers-I was hooked! I was not disappointed until the house lights came on at the end and I have nothing but superlatives for the acting, the script, the camera work, as well as the direction. Just the staging with those beautiful classic cars rolling around rural Carolina should be enough to win over any naysayer.<br/><br/>Do yourself a favor-see this film and choose a dark area of the theatre with few people around."

","This is a good movie. It is predictable but is better than something you will see on Lifetime network. The pairing of Gosling and McAdams is simply chemistry in a bottle. This makes the movie something more than it should be. I'm glad to see directors/writers/producers who understand that you just can't say two people are in love but that you need to give them dialogue and a foundation for their love. This is where the movie Pearl Harbor failed and this movie succeeds. <br/><br/>The movie is bookended by veteran actors Garner and Rowlands who are superb.<br/><br/>These are clearly breakout roles for McAdams who also had success in Mean Girls and especially for Gosling.<br/><br/>8/10"

Whenever there's a movie about a bestseller, the reader is almost always disappointed (it happened to me with Message in a Bottle).

But I have to say that I fell so deeply in love with the movie as well as I did with the book. I thought all of the main character did a wonderful job portraying their roles, and had great chemistry.

"jamieruder","Null","1","1","13 August 2004"," A GREAT love story!
","I just got done reading everyone's comments on the movie, ""The Notebook."" I remember reading this novel a long time ago and I didn't really recall too many of the details except that Allie had Alzheimer's Disease and her one true love read to her to make her remember. Beyond that, it was kind of hazy! In that respect, the movie was amazing because I didn't really know what was going to happen and I looked forward to every single scene. Ryan Gosling is an amazing actor! I remember when I used to watch him on ""The Mickey Mouse Club"" when he was around eleven-years-old. In one particular scene, he was singing a song and he just looked at the camera and smiled and winked and I thought he had such expression for such a young child--obviously that carried over to his acting career! He's so effortless--not many actors can make you REALLY believe that it's not a movie--that it's really happening. It's like he and Rachel McAdams were really in love--I wonder how she could resist him!! ;) All of the scenes that were mentioned in the other comments are pretty much my favorite ones, too. I have to add one thing, though--when Allie and Lon are talking in the room and he says he wants her to himself and she responds by saying something like she was confused because Noah made her feel like one person and Lon made her feel like someone else. (Forgive me, I don't have it all memorized...yet!). I can totally relate to that! Many times in your life you come across people that you could potentially love and you act different when you're with different people. Everyone has certain qualities that attract you to them and then you find those qualities within yourself as well! That's why this movie is so great--no one here is a bad guy or doing something wrong to make the audience root for Noah. Lon is a wonderful character as well--rich, handsome, gentlemanly, and very much in love with Allie. That's why I can understand Allie's struggle trying to choose because both of them would compliment her and her personality. I bawled my eyes out during this movie!!! For one thing, my dad's name is Lon!! But mostly because it reminds me of my own grandmother and her battle with Alzheimer's. It broke my heart watching Gena Rowlands play the old Allie. How she couldn't even remember her own husband and children. How she didn't remember being able to play the piano (my grandma plays the guitar)--but every so often the light begins to glimmer and something is remembered from the past. Anyway, I'd like to write more, but I need to get off the computer!"

","I didn't like the book for this movie, and thus stayed away for a while, but on the recommendation of a friend, I went ahead and saw this.  It is definitely a chick flick, but I found it to be well acted and a compelling story.  I thought the actor who played Lon, however, looked more like James Garner than Ryan Gosling did...and I guess it was a little unbelievable that the girl would pick him, looking as bedraggled as he did, over the good look rich guy...but maybe that's just me :)  When the older James Garner was looking at the photo albums, I almost laughed because it was quite a transformation...Gosling looks nothing like Garner.  Other than that, though, the movie was a pleasant way to spend an afternoon.  Don't forget your kleenex!"
"katydid4819","7","1","1","4 July 2004"," A True Love Story From Beginning To End
","You don't find many movies like The Notebook. Sure, there are many loves stories, too many, actually. They all follow the same formula and you know the ending from the time the lights go down. The Notebook is also a love story; it's a formulaic movie that you already know the end of. What makes it different is that it's the story of one couples relationship from start to finish. 	Allie (Rachel McAdams) and Noah (Ryan Gosling) meet at a carnival the summer that Allie is seventeen. She's high society spending the summer in Seabrook. He doesn't have a dime to his name. It's the classic tale of love, the rich girl and the boy her parents don't approve of. Despite, they fall in love. Fast-forward twenty years, Allie's about to marry to a man of money. But that wouldn't be fitting in this story of true love, would it?<br/><br/>	The movie is based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (A Walk To Remember, Message In A Bottle). Like his previous two book-into-movie adaptations, the focus is on the story and not the characters. These stories do not specialize in developing well-rounded characters. To enjoy The Notebook, you have to suspend reality in this aspect. Noah appears to the audience as the perfect boy, who's just too nice, too sweet. His character is always staring at Allie with sad, puppy dog eyes, even after twenty-five years. But, if you accept that this is the character, Ryan Gosling's performance is good. It's strong and believable. Rachel McAdams who's previous film this year was Mean Girls, takes a complete turn form that and gives the best performance of the movie. This may be because her character is the written better than anyone else's. 	The true achievement of The Notebook is in the portrayal of first love, the summer romance. McAdams and Gosling have a great chemistry that is not just a physical attraction but, even in their quarrels, they still radiate a deep friendship that helps underline the point of The Notebook. Fortunately, the portion of the movie with McAdams and Gosling is more than the part with the older versions of themselves (James Garner and Joan Allen). Garner is reading from the notebook to Allen. She is stricken with Alzheimers and he's convinced that if he reads the story to her enough, his Allie will remember. It's touching and sweet but not as accurately done as the former. From mistakes in the medical aspects of it, to the leap of faith the last scene makes, it comes up more scattered than the rest. 	It's not an amazing movie but from the material it's based on, it could have been much worse. The excellent performances by the whole cast and the heart that is shown make it a decent film. It's not one that will stand the test of time as an amazing love story but it's worth seeing. Though it's a tearjerker, it's also hopeful in the best way."

","I just saw the sneak peak last night, before I go on, I would like to tell you I am a sixteen year old guy who went with my best friend and our mothers, who were fans of the book. I loved the movie. I didn't cry, but most of the people in the theatre were crying about halfway through. The last scene is a big tear jerker too! It tells the story in past tense, which is kinda dumb, until the end when you finally understand. It is classic poor, hardworking guy, and rich, very educated girl romance, but everything isn't just smooth and great. There are a lot of twists, for a love story, and it all works out to be just how you want. This is the perfect movie to take you wife, girlfriend, mom, or even some guys too. On June 25 (the day it comes out to all theaters), I will take my girlfriend, she will love it. Go and see it, you will love it too!"

It's a much closer adaptation. The underlying love story is intact and very satisfying. The performances by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are star-making. Gena Rowlands and James Garner...not as terrific, but hey, let's cut them some slack. The photography was stunning, especially the water scenes. The production and editing are a little erratic and choppy (WW2 scenes in particular), but again it can be overlooked.

"soulmaned21","1","8","22","29 March 2005"," Not like the book at all.......
","If you have read the book, then you will see how much this movie is unlike the book in every aspect. I'm sure the movie would have been better had I not read the book. I know movies are different from their books, but this simple yet amazingly romantic story was lost in this movie that makes it seem like everything happened because of the girl's parents. The typical 80's love story involving parents against their daughter's lover is not what this story is about. If you want real romance and want a story to really relate to, read the novel. The movie leaves out important things such as the letters that Noah and Allie wrote to each other as her condition was progressively getting worse. I watched the movie with my girlfriend and after wards I read her the letters from the book and that made her cry more than the movie's ending which in a way kills the story. How can you make a movie based on a hit-selling novel and COMPLETELY change everything. This movie is more like Bridges of Madison County 2: The Search For a Good Romantic Movie. If you want a romantic movie, rent Bridges of Madison County. If you want to read a romantic novel, read The Notebook, don't settle for the movie."

","The beginning and middle of this movie was really great and what I was expecting. The ending however was not. I still won't say how it ends but I was in tears for about 30 minutes. I felt stupid crying over a movie but this really got to me. I rented it on Valentines day because I thought it would be a good romance movie to watch, but I was hit with a ton of bricks. For about the last 10 - 15 minutes of the movie it seamed like they were really trying to drag the sadness on and on. I would not recommend this movie to anyone I know.I know that not every movie or love story can end happily ever after, but I feel like they took things too far. They acting was great. You could actually feel the pain the two characters were going through. The whole experience was a little too real for me. Things come out at the end about how the notebook even got wrote, that will break your heart. Seeing the husbands devotion to his wife, and what it is putting him through, seeing his tears, just killed me inside."

"film-critic","3","5","12","16 February 2005"," This movie brought to you by big business Kleenex!
","I am of the utmost belief that Kleenex was a sponsor of this film. It has been a very long time since Hollywood released a ""true"" tearjerker film, and I know that Kleenex couldn't help but try to get a piece of the action. I know that my wife went through at least ten Kleenex by the time this film was over and she had read the book. Imagine what it would be like for those that didn't see this film coming. I honestly feel they could go through a whole box. Ironically, and corporately minded, I went through no Kleenex as I watched this film, but instead found my mind wandering and trying at any opportunity to search for any chemistry between our lovebird characters. From Garner and Rowlands to Gosling and McAdams, there was this sensation that they were nothing more than actors playing their part instead of the feeling of true love erupting from the screen. Adding to this mess was a mixed bag of story lines that seemed as if Cassavetes was trying to make straight lines out of circles. While this wasn't a horrible film by any means, The Notebook was perfect and its flaws cut very deep into this sad story.<br/><br/>While I think Sparks' characters in his book are probably much better than in this story, I still wish he would have pushed harder for better actors or a bit more story. There definitely seemed to be a lacking on both of these ends that hurt the overall feel of the film. James Garner is old, and that was about the only thing that he had going for him. Rowlands I can give some credit towards, but strangely I couldn't see these two working together. Garner's passion towards Rowlands seems scripted, while there definitely wasn't anything between Rowlands and Garner. It felt as if Garner was working too hard while Rowlands just didn't place any effort. The Kleenex effect only occurred between these two characters, in my opinion, because they were old, and that seems to strike a chord with all of us. Perhaps it is the grandparent effect or the fear of getting to that point in our lives, I felt that tears were shed near the end of the film because of their age, not their acting ability. The same can be said for McAdams and Gosling. McAdams did a decent job with the material given, but the slipping accent of Ryan Gosling was inexcusable and disturbing. Gosling was completely miscast in this film. I don't know if he was Cassavetes first choice for the role, but he just didn't capture the emotions that were deeply rooted in this film. He read lines, gave some expression, but that was all. I saw Ryan Gosling playing the character and not Noah on screen. His eyes are what hurt him the most. They just didn't seem to fit with what the character was trying to convey. Each time the camera moved to his eyes, the film lost more credibility. To build a great film that this could have been you need to staple it with strong players, sadly, this did not happen with The Notebook. Feathers trying to be paperweights instead hold down this story.<br/><br/>Then we have the story. Sparks has a great imagination, and this story seemed like it would make a great story to tell on the written page, but not in film. There were too many loose ends that were not covered or given enough respect for me in this film. Allie's parents are one of them. Allie's dad was hysterical looking as I kept hoping that I would see him whip out some Dapper Dan somewhere in the film. Allie's Mom, Joan Allen, is not given enough time to defend herself and her climactic moment at the end seems a bit forced and boring than emotional. We don't have enough information on her or this other character to really care about her big scene, instead it feels just like ""filler"". There should have been more with Sam Shepard, who conveniently did not make it till the end of the film. It felt as if he was written away because nobody knew what to do with him. The same can be said of James Marsden's character who arrives, conquers, and leaves with no emotional response. With many of these moments I felt we were given the short, short, short version instead of the emotional powerhouse this could have been. The final scene that I found myself laughing at immensely was the entire ""Noah going to war"" bit. The emotional scene during this brief interlude was completely forced and implausible. I needed more during this moment to have my heart wretched out of me, and not just a scene to tie up any loose ends. Cassavetes could handle this film, I think he just chose to throw too many elements into the fire that he could not fully develop, which hurt him in the long run.<br/><br/>Overall, this film could have reached new levels, but instead cheapened itself to cater to those with low emotional control (the weepy) and lovers. Everyone in love has their own story to tell that would probably make another person tear up, but that is what makes it your own. Cassavetes did not build a strong film with The Notebook, but instead used common clichéd Hollywood techniques to give the audience what they were hoping for, shallow characters that will make you cry. Well, if you are looking for a film that literally cuts the drama and gives you the tears, this would be the film for you. To everyone else, I say skip it. There are better dramas that will burst your tear ducts longer than this one! <br/><br/>Grade: ** out of *****"

","Balanced between the past and the present, The Note Book tells the story of Noah Calhoun, who while at an amusement park, spots the girl of his dreams. After risking his life to ask her out (by hanging off a ride), the two fall madly in love. But disapproving parents, love rivals and a world war, all help make their love live as much a roller coaster as the amusement park they met in. Playing the loved up couple are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, who help bring to the story the passion and worry that seems to fill the script. However some scenes feel so sickly sweet that diabetics should think twice, as director Nick Cassavetes goes for broke while trying to convince us of their love. Anchoring the film to the present day is James Garner and Gena Rowlands, as an old couple reading the story that unfolds. Garner is more Rocking Chair that Rockford File, and his scenes with Rowlands leads to a climax that even the most unobservant viewer would have guessed on page 1. However the film will please many who like reaching for a tissue, but for those who don't, this may be one notebook with pages not worth turning"

The plot line is the predictable boy-meets-girl, who end up getting split up by some outside force they can't control. Rachel McAdams (red eye) and Ryan Gosling (Remember the Titans), both talented actors, both seemed to cringe throughout the whole film because they had to play very immature teenagers. This movie was not suited for their talent. The chemistry between Rachel and Ryan is believable--it's just the plot line of the film--you know exactly what will happen.

","I think, for me, this movie can illustrate some of the difficulties in creating a romance drama that is very effective. This movie is a finely crafted and beautiful work of art. The story and the film-making are keen on providing a sense of profound happiness and energy into the concept of love, one that is both healing and outgoing.<br/><br/>However, some various problems arose for me with the exposition of the characters. I was simply not attracted to either of the characters. They got together too quickly, too loudly, and from there I couldn't really feel love for them even though I could feel their love for each other. Does this fall into personal taste, or does this fall into shortcomings of the story? Well let's take a look, for a moment, at how they got together, that scene with the ferris wheel. It was loud, it was out there, and it was pretty obnoxious, honestly. Does it connect with us, the viewers, at a level where Noah's actions are reflections of what we secretly desire to do, to climb and to jump and to yell and to make sure she promises to notice us at all costs? Or is it simply brash and contrived, a character that is so outgoing that he represents anybody who is impulsive, albeit completely honest about his feelings and completely persistent in his emotions? Or Allie, is she honestly someone that guys would fall in love with, the person we can imagine as ""The One?"" Of course at this point somebody will probably think I'm reading too much into them, or I'm just not accepting the movie for what it is, or anything along that line, but in the nature of film criticism I want to ask, what is the purpose of movies like these? As an entertainment medium, it connects us with the idea of ""love"", the one, the search for that precise person that the two characters find in each other that loves each other and can love forever, something that is needed especially since the world gets so cynical now.<br/><br/>So why am I just completely not in love with those characters? It's a good movie. What I liked especially were the opening shots and that entire scene involving the swans and the rain, which were indeed very romantic. The story was very touching. I just didn't like the characters. I think the real dilemma is that they had too much dialog. Sometimes they spoke when honestly they should have been a bit quieter; and I'm not talking about the first sex scene. That scene was actually one of the movie's strongest moments, one that was more honest about the anxieties for those two young lovers and the implications of what they were doing. I'm talking about moments in the film where all the characters needed to do was share a look, and instead they shared some dialog and it brought me away from the idea that they were truly connected on a deeper level.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"rosscinema","7","3","6","30 November 2004"," Sentimental love story works because of it's actors
","I bash Hollywood all the time as they continually churn out formula films over and over again but every once in a while they make a sweet love story that for some reason or another works well. This clearly works and I think it's due to the performances of it's actors that obviously had good faith in the material. Story starts out in a nursing home where we see Noah ""Duke"" Calhoun (James Garner) who everyday reads to his wife Allie (Gena Rowlands) from his notebook about the story of how they met and fell in love. Allie is suffering from Alzheimer's and doesn't know that the story that is being read to her is actually her life but Duke hopes that it will start a spark where she will briefly remember their great romance.<br/><br/>*****SPOILER ALERT*****<br/><br/>Duke reads their story as it starts in the 1940's in North Carolina when as a young man (Ryan Gosling) he works in the saw mill but one night he meets a very pretty rich girl (Rachel McAdams) and begs her to go out with him. She does and they start dating until they both eventually fall head over heels in love but Allie's mother Anne (Joan Allen) wants her daughter to end her romance as she deems him lower class. Allie goes to school and doesn't hear from Noah but then the war breaks out and it takes a few years before they meet up again. By this time she's engaged but with their meeting they restart their torrid romance and must now ponder whether to get married or stay for good with Noah.<br/><br/>This film is directed by Nick Cassavetes who is slowly learning how to be as terrific a director that his father was and with each film project he seems to be choosing material that is vastly different from each other. Here he tackles a sweet and sentimental love story and he does the right thing by staying close to the novel by Nicholas Sparks and assembling a great cast with his own mother in a pivotal role. Garner hasn't been in a role this good in eons and he's nothing short of moving here and I think this is the first time that he's actually cried in a performance. I was also deeply impressed by McAdams who I feel is a real emerging star and I do hope other well written roles come her way because she shows that she's ready. This film takes it's time telling it's story and it does tend to wander at certain points but this is a genuinely sweet and romantic film that is made with real care by it's young director and it's acted extremely well by the talented cast."
"Flickerlove","Null","3","6","16 July 2004"," MADE ME NAUSEOUS
","As a card-carrying romantic, I have to be frank; 'The Notebook' stirred my gag reflex. The characters were flat, the story predictable, and the dialog putrid. About 10 minutes into the movie the audience is forced to swallow a scene in which Noah and Allie are lying in the street watching a stoplight change colors-the scene is meant to be meaningful but it is anything but original or poignant. After this stale interaction between Allie and Noah, I felt myself craving dialog with actual depth in lieu of the hackneyed diatribes and empty banter spewing from the characters' mouthes. Throughout the film, Gosling unconvincingly delivers sugary, sappy lines and appears stoic, awkward, and seemingly removed from the situation despite his assertions of love. MacAdams' portrayal of Allie is somewhat unbelievable, yet spunky. Unfortunately, her already mediocre performance is hindered by the horrid dialog. I also found myself confused with the goals of the protagonists. The film wants the audience to hope for a reconciliation between Allie and Noah, but I was secretly rooting for Lon, Allie's fiancé-at least he had some personality! There just wasn't much chemistry between Allie and Noah. No amount of bike-riding and necking will create a spark. This film is supposed to be the sweet story of a man who will do anything for his first love.... But aside from a letter writing stint and a ferris wheel stunt, all Noah really does is stare vacantly and renovate a house. Everything about this film is dull and lifeless with the exception of the sometimes beautiful cinematography and the lovemaking scene where Gosling actually radiates some heat! To the film's credit, I did enjoy the older Noah-Allie couple played by Garner and Rowlands. These seasoned professionals managed to shine despite a shoddy script. Don't be swayed to tears by this disgustingly sentimental film, when it comes down to it, it just doesn't have any heart!"

Maybe this is a trend in Hollywood movie marketing: A triple package, a movie that will 1) appeal to the all-important 18-35-year-old female viewer with a passionate love story; 2) also try to boost attendance among movie-going geezerdom and their aging Baby Boomer children by wrapping the love story in a dementia gimmick; and 3) cram an R movie into a PG-13 rating so teenagers can see it without their (ugh!) parents.<br/><br/>The main plot line is a fairly pedestrian, fairly predictable love story: Poor boy from Seabrook, NC (Ryan Gosling) meets spirited, strong-willed rich girl (Rachel McAdams) from the city, poor boy loses rich girl, poor boy makes good, formerly poor boy gets rich girl. There is nothing in particular to distinguish the story except the gimmick, which is that the story is told in flashback; it is read from a NOTEBOOK (get it?) written by Allie, the woman in the love story, but it is sixty years later; now she is played by Gena Rowlands and she has moderate to severe dementia, presumably Alzheimer's disease (there are many causes of dementia, but most lay people don't know that; to most of the clueless general public, dementia and Alzheimer's disease are synonymous, aren't they?). Her husband Noah (now played by James Garner), who so adores his wife that he lives in her nursing home although he doesn't need to, reads the notebook to her over a period of days. It is hinted that this is only the latest of many such readings, but she doesn't remember any of it, you see, so each reading is like the first; neither does she recognize any of her family more than occasionally. While this is, in fact, a worthy subject for a book or a film, the depiction of this woman's dementia is ludicrously bogus. The way she behaves isn't true to life, it's arranged to suit the plot. No one with dementia acts the way she does. I wonder if the novel treated the woman's dementia with this much absurd inaccuracy. (Judging by his screen credits, Nicholas Sparks's stock in trade is treacly love stories.) There are (at the very least) two other scenes that also suggest that the producer didn't bother to hire a technical adviser for the medical parts of this movie: Toward the end of the film, the James Garner character is wheeled out of the nursing home on a stretcher, obviously toward a waiting ambulance to take him to the hospital, and the doctor or paramedic is saying there is ""no pulse and no blood pressure."" And NO ONE is doing CPR or performing ACLS (advanced cardiac life support) on him. Anyone who watches ""ER"" knows that's a major goof. He is shown having been discharged from the hospital a few days later looking not particularly worse for his near-death experience. A few days later, in one of the movie's final scenes, the Gena Rowlands character becomes agitated and combative, which is the only scene that seems remotely realistic---until the ""doctor"" rushes in with his trusty all-purpose movie syringe ALREADY UNCAPPED, and without prepping the skin or anything, gives her ""two cc's"" of something. In a situation like that, a doctor or nurse would invariably give a certain number of ""milligrams"" of a drug. Furthermore, she was not nearly combative enough to be given anything before you would try restraint and reassurance. And then comes the climactic scene that blows the movie right out of the real world into some kind of alternative romance-novel universe: He comes to her room that night; she asks him, ""Can memories take us away together?"", he says yes and crawls into bed with her, and they both die that night. Not a dry eye in the house, right? Go look up ""mawkish.""<br/><br/>Garner and Rowlands are durable talents who turn in great performances every time, but don't really have much to do in this film; much more screen time is given to the young actors, whose work is serviceable, especially McAdams as a fiery redhead, but they aren't really called on to endow their characters with any particular depth. The director is Nick Cassavetes, Rowlands's real-life son. Anyone who has seen his father John's idiosyncratic masterpieces will recognize that either Nick is not the talent his father was or has not yet really come into his own as a director."

","Last night's packed opening gala for the Seattle International Film Festival featured The Notebook in its premier screening, an excellent choice for an audience of seasoned filmgoers, and clearly a big hit. From the opening scenes, you know you're witnessing breakout performances by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams--the camera loves both, as they steal the lush, wistful, and often surreal scenes of youth from beginning to end. My companion and I were so moved by its impact that we could just look at each other in awe after leaving the theater, grateful that such beautiful films are made at all, however infrequently. Nick Cassavetes did a fantastic job here."

","I was absorbed in watching by the first half. Noah, starring as Ryan Gosling, and Allie, starring as Rachel McAdams's love scenes are very romantic. Their separation is so pitiful and makes me be anxious about what would happen after this.<br/><br/>Allie gets a new boyfriend after she separates from Noah. This guy is very good man and they become engaged to each other. But Allie sees Noah again by chance. They still love each other, so Allie starts wavering between two men. I got annoyed at her indecisive attitude. Moreover, she takes it out on Noah and her mother. It is James, her fiancé, that the sorriest person.<br/><br/>At the end, Allie and Noah get married but she has dementia. She cannot remember Noah and her children.

"g-bodyl","9","2","4","17 October 2014"," Perhaps the Greatest Love Story of Our Generation!
","As a guy, I generally try to stay away from Nicholas Sparks movies because they seem too schmaltzy and tripe for my taste. I do have a sweet spot for romance, but just not in these kind of films. Then I was forced to watch this film, The Notebook. I'm glad I did because this is the greatest love story of my generation perhaps only rivaling Titanic (please don't judge me.) This period piece also features memorable characters whom truly draw you in and I also mention this has one of the greatest film endings in cinema history and one that made the film even more remarkable. There are some clichés to be had, but in the end the film is just a simple love story.<br/><br/>This film starts off in modern day at a nursing home with this elderly man named Duke reading a romance story to a female patient. This story is about how a working class man named Noah who falls in love with a girl named Allie, a girl from the elite class. Despite their social differences, they spend every day together. But they end up separating anyhow because of their different statuses. But seven years later, fate has them meeting up again but this time under different scenarios.<br/><br/>This film is well-acted by everyone. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make a magnificent pair together on-screen and this movie is responsible for their stardom. There are good supporting turns by Sam Shepard as Noah's supportive father and Joan Allen as Allie's cold, stern mother. But we cannot miss the performances of the great James Garner as Duke and Gena Rowland as the female patient.<br/><br/>Overall, Nick Cassevete directed a magnificent romance film and from what I heard, the best book-to-screen adaptation of Nicholas Sparks. This film is also realistic as it effectively shows what history was like and how social interactions changed over the past seventy years. I may have to check out more Sparks films, but I'm sure they are not even close to living up to the Notebook. And yes, I nearly cried at certain points. I rate this film 9/10."
"RapturesDenial","3","2","4","4 June 2013"," Wooden and not in the quality warm way, in the stiff way more like it
","Where to start..... The acting was bad, horribly bad very wooden as the title said, except the older Noah And Allie they were good and Allie's mother was alright. Aside from that the movie was bad the book wasn't poorly written and wasn't too long that the movie would have problems following it more closely yet it didn't. The scenes seem so thrown together haphazardly that its like, what?! I am by far not against romance obviously (I read the book) but this movie seemed thrown together to get money off people like me who loved the book but didn't know how horrid the movie would be. If you like the book avoid the movie, if you never read the book...watch the movie then it might be good to you then. I don't see how though."
"emmak89","7","2","4","12 August 2009"," Beautiful cinematography and high-class actors, but something amiss.
","Perhaps I wasn't quite in the right mood for this film when I watched it. It was a film I had highly anticipated,and I wanted to love it. Don't get me wrong, I did like it. It is an enjoyable and touching simple romance, moving through the ages,depicting a generation of love. I wanted to be swept away in the sheer romance. But coming away from it, I found myself thinking it hadn't quite lived up to it's immense hype.<br/><br/>The film starts one fateful summer in the 1940s, and the young couple meet at a carnival. This is probably one of my favourite scenes in the film; unrealistic, but we know the film isn't trying to be realist – it's romantic, and that's the important thing.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling steal the show, conveying the emotions of young love superbly; the first steps as they get to know each other; followed by the passion as the couple can never seem to agree on anything, but their love for each other.<br/><br/>McAdams is especially outstanding in this feature, and I didn't even recognise her from her part in Mean Girls, released earlier that year. She has proved herself as a talented, flexible actress and after seeing her in this I can't wait to see what she does with the part of Claire in movie The Time Travellers Wife, coming out this year, which is based on one of my favourite books of all time.<br/><br/>Alongside the story of the young lovers, we have the parallel story of an older couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands). Both also play their roles well, but it's all a little predictable. Did anyone not see a million miles ahead that they would be the elderly Noah and Allie? <br/><br/>This film does have some genuinely touching scenes; watch out for when the children visit Duke and Alison in the residential home – this one had me welling up; ""That's my sweetheart in there. Wherever she is, that's where my home is."" <br/><br/>We also get a glimpse at what it would be like to lose a loved one to an illness like senile dementia; the painful circumstance where someone you've known your whole life can't even remember who you are.<br/><br/>All in all, The Notebook is a pleasant way to spend two hours; with an overwhelmingly romantic and sentimental core, but coming away from it, for me it's not as memorable as other films in the romance genre. We follow Noah and Allie as they grow up; falling in love young; living separate lives before being reunited again. It tells a story we've heard and seen a hundred times before, but it does tell it well."

","""The Notebook"" is the most amazing movie I have ever seen. The script was well-written, the actors phenomenal, and the overall effect enthralling. ""The Notebook"" was based on Nicolas Sparks' novel and was even better than the book. It was a beautiful romance that wasn't too mushy and captured the kind of love everyone longs for. The actors were absolutely amazing, portraying emotions that most actors have trouble with almost effortlessly and flawlessly. Rachel McAdams, who has starred in movies of every genre and done wonderfully in all of them, blew me away. Ryan Gosling was amazing as well, and there are no words to describe their chemistry. James Garner and Gena Rowlands were such a great pair that they made elderly love seem beautiful. If you have not seen ""The Notebook,"" I recommend that you rent it right away; you have not seen a romance until you've seen ""The Notebook."""

I mean, he had to wait like 7 years for his great love to come back, but then they married, had a lot of children and probably a great life.<br/><br/>I know I have used the word 'great' very often here, but it is for a good reason.

It's got moments that make you laugh, cry and just be happy for who you are.<br/><br/>Secondly, I'm so proud that i'm Canadian, and the fact that we have many talented actors, such as Mike Myers, Jim Carrey, Keanu Reeves...oh ya, Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling.<br/><br/>I've seen Ryan Gosling in ""Murder by Numbers"" with Sandra Bullock, and although he was hott in that movie, he kind of had a devilish look to him, but when I saw him in ""The Notebook"" he was like a saint, love his smile by the way.<br/><br/>This movie is great, love Gina Rowlands and James Garner too, both were great. Wonderful story, fantastic writing, the acting was very incredible.

"sbharti","9","2","4","29 December 2007"," Notebook is about ageless undying Love
","I have seen many love stories as movies (and I'm sure most of us as well), so by now I've somewhat become averse to them. Notebook was for long in my list, but I kept pushing it away because everyone told me its a love story. Today, When I watched it, I must say that I was missing something for that long time, and I'm happy that I watched it.<br/><br/>At the bottom, I didn't find Notebook's story very different. Teenagers falling in love, getting apart and their further extensions have been long portrayed in cinema and novels. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams played roles of young Noah and Allie beautifully, and justified to the roles. Rachel whom I have seen as a naughty girl in Mean Girls and Hot Chick was really sweet as an innocent cute girl. I was impressed with James Marsden too, though he shared screen for short time. However, all this wasn't all which touched me. James Garner and Gena Rowlands had to come to screen.<br/><br/>Most will say there was only one story in the movie, but I found there were two. James as old Noah along with Gena as old Allie do not share much of screen, but they grow their own love story in unique way alongwith Ryan and Rachel. Where all would take months and years to win their ladies, James does it in one day! As the story unfolds, all characters look good, but what touches you is that one day love story.<br/><br/>As the way I made my title, Notebook is about that love, that ageless undying love, which remains in each of us till we die, or even after death who knows. I gave 9 for 10 for those touching moments."

True love is unforgettable and unbreakable, going to any lengths to get his true love to remember him and keeping his promise is outstanding. I love how in the very end Allie shows up with her bags and hunches her shoulders, beautiful. They were meant to be together as the movie shows until death. Go see this movie!While its been done before, its never been done this way. With such depth and emotion, the predictable ending is no fault of the movie.

"elephantoats","6","2","4","29 August 2007"," it's a schmaltzfest, but it's watchable
","This movie is engaging, and the photography is pretty. Everyone seems to have liked it.. even dads. The period details are thorough, succeeding to conjure the atmosphere of a simpler, more romantic time. However, it is hard not to feel tricked when movies do this because of course life has always been complicated and dizzying, scarcely turning out to be as wonderful as it was dreamed. There is a shadowy area between what is actually romantic and what is romanticized to the point of artifice. The romanticizing in this movie can be excused somewhat because of the characters' states of being-- the story is mapped out in memories of people who desperately attempt to re-envision them, to savor the beauty of their relationship before time runs out. We all romanticize the past.<br/><br/>But the spirit of the old man Noah to me seemed too jazzy. It's especially evident in his conversation with the nurses. In addition to his lines, maybe the casting could be blamed for this. The personalities of the old man Noah and young Noah were too divergent. People only transform so much over time, and the reticence of young Noah just seemed too much in place to produce such a lively old guy. Rachel McAdams is a pleasure to watch, even though her performance was rather unvaried, including much coquettish giggling on the other side of puffed-up fussiness. Gosling turned out to be less fun than he promised at first. Parts of the script were good, others unbearable.. the whole bird thing comes to mind.<br/><br/>In the end, most of my complaints are simply a matter of taste, as with any review. I thought this movie could use a little criticism."

It doesn't take much to make me cry, but this film stuck in my head long after I watched it. The actors were incredible, the storyline was magnificent and the lake scene was indescribably beautiful, touching, memorable and tear-jerking. For anyone whose thoughts on the young Allie were tarnished because she cheated on her fiancé, I think you're wrong. She and Noah truly loved one another and she made the right decision.<br/><br/>The ending was heart breaking yet satisfying, and left me thinking of Noah and Allie's lives together that we weren't given an insight to- the births of their children, their time in the house...<br/><br/>I am positive that this film will stay in my mind for years to come, possibly even until I become a bird in my next life..."
"gooey_thickshake","10","2","4","19 February 2007"," powerful, impossible to resist. -spoiler alert
","this movie...will leave you with a deep-nesting feeling of comfort, appreciation, sadness and a general sense disappointment- not at the film- but at realisation that you did not live through that time, where romanticism was alive and blossoming, where the obstacles to love had such elevated significance and the overcoming of these obstacles brought such a vertiguous (made up a word) and poignant climax.<br/><br/>I challenge anyone to view this movie and not be deeply moved. you WILL fall in love with the characters, rachel mcadams performance will straight out flatten you, especially if you are male; as i'm sure gosling does for females.<br/><br/>A facet of this movie that gives it the base of integrity that allows us to enjoy the story and characters, is its avoidance of romantic clichés. We often see the run-of-the-mill cliché of girl falls for guy but has an overpowering, sleazy, cheating fiancé/boyfriend/husband who eventually has to pay his dues, leaving the romantic climax where the ""good guy"" gets the girl. the notebook differs- allies husband is a genuinely good guy, he does nothing wrong and treats her well, the realism of the ending of this film, and avoidance of cliché; i feel makes it more special.<br/><br/>The film is stacked with memorable and tear-jerking scenes. without spoiling too much, a certain scene involving a whalf is without a doubt the most powerful and emotion-packed scene i have ever witnessed.<br/><br/>i think the key element tipping this film over the good barrier to the amazing section of movie categorizing is the chemistry between the two main characters. Ryan gosling and Rachel Mcadams simply relate, and work off each other, viewers believe their feelings are authentic.<br/><br/>This is a rare film. its the kind of film you hope you will experience, and from this film on you will judge every romantic film against it, so it may be wise for Hollywood to give up and not attempt any more. 10 out of 10."

","When this movie came out in 2004, I had a chance to see it but passed on it. I was going to the movies with this girl I was interested in and she said ""That's a movie I would like to see."" Well, I opted for the ""Borne Supremacy"" instead, which was OK. <br/><br/>Last week, I was flipping through the channels and came across this movie. Having seen Rachel McAdams deliver a great performance in ""Red Eye,"" I figured I would check it out for a minute or two and keep on flipping. Well, I could not stop watching this movie, which for a romantic flick is very, very, very rare for me. I have seen it again since. It is a very sweet, believable love story and (IMO) it avoids clichés. <br/><br/>You have to understand, I do not just sit down and watch movies. It has to interest me somehow for me to give it the time of day. Heck, I'm a Stanley Kubrick fan! Romantic films just do not appeal to me because I just find it hard to care about the couple being together before the credits roll. But this one was different. Did I care about seeing Rachel and Ryan (and James Garner and Gena Rowlands) together at the end? You betcha I did! <br/><br/>A lot of people here have already spelled out the movie's details over and over again, so let me just say, if you are a guy and your girlfriend or wife wants to watch this movie with you-- DO IT! Don't screw up like I did. <br/><br/>Fav line -- ""I need food to regain my strength."""

","Not for the hopeless romantic; but the helpless romantic. This is a touching love story based on a Nicholas Sparks novel and exceptionally directed by Nick Cassavetes. THE NOTEBOOK is about an older gentleman(James Garner), who reads from an old notebook retelling a timeless love story to his aging companion(Gena Rowlands)in a nursing home. The tale brings back the love story of a young couple(Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams)who are separated by social class, a World War and a planned wedding. The young couple is passionately reunited seven years after they took different paths. The elder woman's memory fades in and out, but hearing the notebook read in episodes helps her relive the turbulent and timeless romance. A beautiful ending leads you to where you thought the story would go. One box of tissues may not be enough. Other cast members of note: Joan Allen, Sam Shepard, Kevin Connolly and Starletta DuPois."

","Other reviewers have been fascinated by a fairly standard Hollywood story of a youthful courtship. It's good (I'd say a 7 on the scale of 10), but not the real story of the movie.<br/><br/>An elderly man (whom I can relate to because I'm writing this on my 81st birthday) has an interest in a co-resident of his nursing home, an old woman who seems ""out of it,"" but who responds somewhat to the story he reads to her each day -- of the young lovers. (That story, of course, is told in flashbacks, and constitutes maybe 90 percent of the movie. I can relate to it, too, because the lovers are just about the ages of my wife, of 60 years, and me.) However, a second story also develops between the contemporary elderly people, that to me is the heart of the movie. My wife called it a tear jerker. I agreed, though I hadn't shed any tears. Nevertheless, unlike most movies that are forgettable, this one remains vivid, and doesn't lose its punch with time. When I thought about it the next day, I was, indeed, moved emotionally. It's a beautiful story, and if you don't get it, I'm sorry. You need to be alert to catch the point -- or ""punch line"" -- as the ""Notebook"" is shown in a close-up near the end.<br/><br/>A beautiful, and marvelous movie! It loses just a point in the ratings because of unnecessary, though implied, sex -- not characteristic of movies of the 40s. (The CODE, you know.)"

Were you taken against your will? tied up? then why see it, you knew it was a Love story, most are trite and take after each other and aren't true to life that is why they are Love stories..frankly i thought it was a different love story than ones i have seen. I am a fan of Nick Sparks work and know he makes elaborate LOVE Stories, not action films. So negative..ones why see it, why vote, must gave made some impact on your psyche....So we gave it a 7.7/10 big deal, it was what it was a Summer Romance film, viewed mainly in Summer, by people who like them. I believe Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling did splendidly, they gave us a true dramatic episode from each of them, esp in the cold Canada weather.

","I have never commented before, but felt compelled because it appears that no one who saw this movie found it hard to believe that in the summertime in South Carolina, our two romantic leads would be wearing winter jackets and having steam come from the lips as the spoke. Anyone who lives in the South knows that it HOT, unbearably hot, in June, July and August. And even if it were a cooler night, no coastal town temperature would warrant a wool jacket. There are no rocky coastlines for Noah and Allie to make out along--from North Carolina to Florida, the Atlantic coast is sandy. Time and again, this film has geographical inaccuracies that are simply unforgivable."

I won't spoil the film for those who haven't seen it by going into why this provoked so much crying in the audience. <br/><br/>It was great to see new faces in the cast -- especially Rachel McAdams (who was in Means Girls, which I haven't seen but will now).

2) The film is well put together, in the sense that the cinematography, costume design and production design are all pretty good
3) The second half is much better than the terrible first half<br/><br/>NEGATIVES:<br/><br/>1) Ryan Gosling literally gets Rachel McAdams to go out with him by threatening to commit suicide (?!?!) and then stalking her around the town?!?!
2) The dialogue made me wanna be sick, it's like nails on a chalkboard: ""if you're a bird then I'm a bird"" ""it wasn't over.... it's still not over!"" URGH
3) The film is littered with gender issues and race relations issues
4) The plot is so cliche and frankly feels like a poor Titanic impression. For example, the working class man falls in love with the upper class woman (like in Titanic) and the story is told in flashback revolving around the woman now being old (like in Titanic).
5) The score is so over the top and is constantly hitting you over the head with the swelling strings. They may as well have had someone holding up a sign saying ""you should feel emotional now"""

","The Notebook is a film about a sloppy summer romance that engulfs our two main characters, Allie (Rachel McAdams), and Noah (Ryan Gosling). After they are torn apart by Allies parents as well as different life paths, it's a fight to get back to each other after years apart as well as new romances.
The theme of this movie is that loves truly does conquer all. It is seen several times by the main characters as they get reacquainted after yeas apart, and somehow still find that they never fell out of love with each other. It is shown in several scenes that regardless of how much our characters fight, they never lost feelings for each other. For example in the famous argument scene where our characters are standing outside of Allies car in front of the house. They are both arguing over whether or not they are going to be together when Noah points out that, that is their dynamic. They fight but in the end they always love each other, proving the point at love conquers all. Throughout the entire film you can feel the emotional connection between the characters even when they are apart, similar to the movie Dear John (2010), another film based on the books by Nicholas Sparks.
What makes this movie extraordinary is the emotional connection and tension you can feel in he film through the use of things such as lighting and angle. In scenes such as the montage of Noah and Allie spending time together in the beginning of the film, the lightning used is a light colorful array, signifying that they are both happy and carefree as they fall helplessly in love with each other. In other scenes, such as the ones taking place in the nursing home and the final scenes of the movie, they use low key lightning in a way to make the scenes more dramatic. The angles help play an important role as well as they create personal and intimate moments between the actors and the viewers. As the camera pans from Noah to Allie, to a wide shot that captures them both, you really feel like you are there with them, watching it all unfold. The director has a way of really pulling out the emotions of the viewers as the characters go through several ups and down of the relationship but eventually figure out that in the end, love does conquer all."

","Incredibly beautiful, detailed, and stunningly emotional- The Notebook may have some formulaic issues, but is able to overcome them and prove itself to be a very unique and brilliant picture. The film is full of very lively and fantastic performances, most notably Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams who are absolutely perfect in their roles. Their chemistry on screen is amazing, and the even more surprising part of it is that they had a hard time getting along at first, both as characters and in real life. The cinematography in the film is often brilliant, and at its best, absolutely gorgeous. The direction is also quite good, surprising for this type of film, and goes to show where good direction could lead you in a film that can feel so much weaker without it. Luckily, the film is strongly lead, both directionally and through the actors on the screen, to make for a truly impactful and unforgettable love story that i'm sure will be cherished for years to come. The music in the film is very good as well, as well as the atmosphere in the film, and the feel in the film overall is continually impressive. At it's worse, the film can be a bit predictable and formulaic- containing a few tropes that you have seen in countless romantic films before. However, it doesn't impact the film too much, and for the most part it still remains an endlessly entertaining and beautiful time. In the end, The Notebook is a surprisingly special film- that is nearly perfect except when it decides to play it too safe. It's direction is impressive, as well as its lead performances from Gosling and McAdams, and its overall cinematography and feel is endlessly beautiful.

","The Notebook
When the film's premier of the film occurred in 2004, all the people in Mexico was exIiting for to watch it, because an excellent actress of it is a quite popular in my country, I am talking about Rachel McAdams, one of the most beautiful woman in the entire world. A lots of people was waiting for watching a gripping and romantic history of love.
This film was directed by Nick Cassavetes and was based on a book written by Nicholas Sparks in 1996.
The film goes back to a nursing home in the South of California where an old man was reading a book to other old lady with an illnes (Alzheimer) where the old man talk about a story about a handsome man (Noah by the actor Ryan Gosling) with a charming smail who was out of his mind for a woman (Allie by the actress Rachel McAdams), this guy was in love at the first sight when he saw the girl. The first problem that appear to Noah was trying to catch the attention of Allie doing crazy and moving things which took effect like an arrow in her heart giving an opportunity to have a love date with Allie, doing this story one of the best that the screen had ever seen in life with fascinating characters.
The film ouperform the typical stories of love because when a girl belonged to a rich family and the family's guy was average, is really difficult to have an excellent relationship, because of the interests of the parents, this is a key piece in the story due to the true love can break up all the obstacles.
The only thing that it was ommited is the music, I mean that this kind of films need to be immortalized by an amazing soundtrack; I think, it was the only bad point in the development to the film.
If you are considerated like a romantic viewer, donÂ´t doubt about to watch it, because you will never regret to take the desition. I think that the director put his soul doing this piece of art. I can tell you that when you will watch the final you will cry dramatically and you could remember your first true love or your best relationship because it is really a tought-provoking film and exceded my expectations.
I hope my point of view can help you to take a good desition due to this film exceded my expectations."

","I try to be a fair partner when it comes to my relationships with the opposite sex, and unfortunately my girlfriend is a hopeless romantic when it comes to her movies and books. She is willing to check out most of the films I enjoy (with the exception of more explicit horror films; she tells me they give her nightmares), so I think it's only fair that I endure some of her favorites now and then. So last evening we watched her DVD of THE NOTEBOOK. It stars Rachel McAdams and Sam Shepard. Now let me see if you've heard this one before: A young girl (McAdams) is at first turned off to a demonstrative young man (Shepard). Eventually he grows on her and they fall madly in love. Problems arise when the girl's parents feel the boyfriend is not the best choice for her. So she finds another boyfriend. But her first lover doesn't give up... and then... <br/><br/>I did not hate the film. Actually, even though it's mostly predictable and it's typical of millions of other chick flicks like it, I did appreciate the way it was structured. It's a story set in the 1940s that's told in flashback from a 2004 hospital as an elderly man (James Garner) reads the story to an old woman suffering from Alzheimer's (Gena Rowlands). The revelation here was not unpredictable either from the get go, but the film itself doesn't make a mystery out of it by the midway point anyway. I did get emotional during the final few scenes of the movie, and I'll tell you one thing - some sad things in life scare me more than those make believe horror films which my girlfriend prefers to avoid. **1/2 out of ****"

","The Notebook was designed to be another Nicholas Sparks tearjerker, but this movie was made great by the actors on screen, not the script. The storyline is amazingly predictable and most of the lines are cheesy. The special effects, are not so great either. However, I would recommend that anyone and everyone should see this movie for one reason: Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams together on screen. I have never in my life seen two people who had as much chemistry between them as this. What they posses together blew me away and made me glad that I paid to see this movie. The two connected extremely well and made me believe their love and why they would go through such a tragedy for it. On the negative side, Nicholas Sparks is not my favorite author, I did not enjoy ""A Walk to Remember"" for two reasons, Mandy Moore, and the predictable plot line which always appears in Nicholas Spark's novels. But, thankfully, I was able to overlook such blunders and see the core of the movie, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams"

","Nick Cassavetes' charming romantic drama grabbed me from the beginning. It was a spellbinding romance well-acted by Gosling and McAdams, backed up by Rowlands and Garner, two veteran actors. It was engaging, sweet, and even tear-jerking at times. It had a lot of heart, more heart than most romantic films in the 21st century do. Than the story went sour, the ending was contrived and almost felt laughable. The ending spoiled the film for me. Yet Cassavetes stages it well and the performances are vibrant from all four of the leads especially Rowlands in a very personal performance. Nick Cassavetes crafts this with personality like his father's films, despite all the flaws in Nicholas Sparks' writing."

The story touched me because having had an ailing parent with dementia, I sadly understand the frustration of wanting to share love with the individual who doesn't recognize you. Jim's acting was so appropriate, so sincere, and so right as usual. I will definitely add this to my DVD collection and will watch on those special times when I miss mom. In particular, this was a good movie for Jim, because he seemed to be just himself; a demeanor of independence on the outside, but deep inside, very caring. Great story and great leading actors.

This is definitely the exception.<br/><br/>The story that Sparks laid out is incredibly beautiful and sweet, but the movie does something that the book doesn't- it has a lot of when they first meet and fall in love. This takes up about three pages in the book, but it is a big part in the movie, and that's really nice watch.<br/><br/>After seeing this movie, Rachel McAdams quickly became one of my favorite actresses. She does such a great job, and so does her co-star, Ryan Gosling. They look great together, and they really look like they're in love.<br/><br/>Also, this movie is one incredible tear-jerker. I cry easily, but I had never ever seen my mom cry. When her hair caught on fire at thanksgiving, she laughed- but this movie had her bawling right there with me.<br/><br/>This is definitely a movie belonging in the chick-flick category, it is basically as sappy as it gets, but there seems to be something there that guys can like as well.

","I have a macho friend who wouldn't be caught dead sitting through a chick flick such as ""Message in a Bottle."" However, this friend of mine told me that ""The Notebook"" was a movie he watched without any great expectations, yet when it was over he said it was the best movie he had seen in years.<br/><br/>My reaction was a little more typical. I cried more than once, but the most at the end. Lucky I was watching it on cable, so I wouldn't have to cry so much in public. But it wasn't such a bad cry. It was just having been blown away by this movie. I am not sure I can articulate clearly just how good this movie is. Yes, someone can always find flaws in movies if they want to get picky enough. But in the end, did the movie touch your heart? This one did for me in a way none other ever has.<br/><br/>This movie sets the standard on what romantic love is all about. Is it extremely difficult, with many arguments, separations, misunderstandings, and problems? Of course it is. And that is played out realistically here. Yet in the end, the good outweighs the bad by a landslide. Spontaneous fun, kisses and hugs, lying in each other's embrace, gazing into each other's eyes, slow dancing to no music, being in a boat or by the water, allowed to be yourself yet being together as one, never giving up, never stopping the flow of unconditional love, overcoming all obstacles. That kind of love is a miracle.<br/><br/>If you are reading through reviews of this movie, and have never seen the movie or read the book, just stop reading reviews, and see the movie. Forget the spoilers, the movie is better watched just fresh. Then, if you are not emotionally moved by this movie, you are either brain dead or something is really wrong with you.<br/><br/>Not trying to repeat too much of what others have said, but Rachel McAdams is not only cute and ravenously beautiful, but the whole movie is beautiful. Why it did not win the Oscar for best Cinematography is beyond me. But then I don't understand why it didn't result in several Oscar nominations and winners. Starting with Rachel McAdams, who to me made this movie as great as it is. However, that is not to undermine the other three main actors who were so perfectly cast in their roles. This is the love story for the ages. I didn't feel like I was watching actors. It felt like I was there, like I was any one of the four main characters. I was riveted to the screen.<br/><br/>I am a fan of old movies. Casablanca and the like. Which is a great romantic movie. However, The Notebook outdoes even that great classic in its portrayal of romantic love. I had become jaded over the years to believe that great movies were in the past. How refreshing to come across a masterpiece, and one made so recently! One last compliment. My hat is off to you, Nick Cassavetes, as no masterpiece of a movie becomes so without a fine director. Now I'll have to go and read the book."

","""The Notebook"" isn't a movie for everyone. Face it, it's a love story geared towards young people so I don't expect everyone to love it as much as I do. But if you are the sort of person who loves a tear-jerking romantic movie, rent ""The Notebook"".<br/><br/>The acting in ""The Notebook"" is surprisingly good and is probably the main reason that ""The Notebook"" is not just another romantic chick flick that you watch and then forget. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have some of the best on screen chemistry that I have ever seen, only beaten by Audrey Hepburn and Richard Peck's chemistry from ""Roman Holiday"". And even then it's a close call. They show the passion, love and lust that their characters have for each other with perfect accuracy. Their emotions are transmitted straight back to you and you don't forget them in a hurry. James Garner is stunning as an older Noah, his devotion to an Allie who doesn't even remember him is touching and his reactions to her are perfect. None of the leads are cursed with delivering excessively cheesy lines. And if there are any cheesy lines, they are beautifully disguised as authentic emotions.<br/><br/>I loved ""The Notebook"" and really, really recommend it. For anyone who enjoyed ""Moulin Rouge!"" or ""Titanic"", you are pretty much guaranteed to enjoy ""The Notebook"". And even if you didn't like either of those movies, you will still enjoy ""The Notebook"" -- I promise."

","If Hollywood would make and effectively market more movies like ""The Notebook,"" they could end the box office slump and draw a much wider audience back to the movies.<br/><br/>The movie should appeal to ADULTS who like good writing, acting, direction, and production values. I doubt that the budget for ""The Notebook"" was very large, but every penny that was spent shows on the screen--and this is a period (largely 1940's) picture. Having just seen the incredibly overrated ""The Aviator"" which had all kinds of errors in continuity--for example, the scandal magazines like ""Confidential"" weren't published until a decade later than the screenplay claims--I appreciated the accuracy of sets, costumes, etc., in ""The Notebook.""<br/><br/>The pace of the movie is leisurely but not plodding. I suspect that a lot of viewers won't be terribly surprised at the twist that comes about three-quarters through the movie, but the film is so well-acted, written, and directed that no one will feel cheated.<br/><br/>Special mention must be made about James Garner and Gena Rowlands, the mother of director Nick Cassvetes. Rowlands has long been a brilliant actress, and she just keeps getting better. Thanks in part to TV movies as well as theatrical releases, she continues to enjoy a productive career. With any luck, maybe she will get that standout role that will bring her a long-deserved Oscar.<br/><br/>As for Garner, he has been underrated and unappreciated for decades. At least as far back as ""The Americanization of Emily"" and his TV series ""The Rockford Files,"" Garner has been turning out quality work, much like a much handsomer Spencer Tracy. He and Rowlands bring out the best in each other--their scenes together are heartbreaking.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast in excellent. In particular, Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams deserve to have long careers; and Joan Allen again shows why she should have more work.<br/><br/>Finally, anyone who has had a parent, relative, or friend in a nursing home will find ""The Notebook"" packs an extra wallop."

","Some movies are meant to watch once or not at all. Like when people say 'you have to watch this movie' and when you do, you can't think of what to say but that sucked! But not this one. This movie is a classic! You might find it predictable but what makes this movies great is the story. It shows how much two people love each other no matter what the circumstances are. I couldn't think of better actors to play Noah/Allie. Most of the people in the theater stayed seated after the movie to wipe their tears off their eyes. This movie is breathtaking! By far the best love story ever made. You'd miss half your life if you don't see it!"

","This my second unintentional adaptation of this writer. After the wonderful ""Walk to remember"", it is a confirmation of his talent for true love story...<br/><br/>The key of the movie is so true that every body will recognize its simplicity of genius: Lovers write the story of the passion to leave a testimony against the time and their loss of memory (a bit like my motivation behind my IMDb reviews...) If the idea is brilliant, remain for a movie to find the best actors and a real chemistry between them. For that, the cast is excellent. The young couple is unknown people (but future breakout...) whereas the old couple is Hollywood stars. It is one of few movies where i can find the same intensity & passion in same characters played by different people. And if there are ""clichés"" or ""deja-vu"" situations, they appear close to truth...<br/><br/>So, as in ""Walk to remember"", you just follow those incredible characters in their so simple and so moving story. When the guy asks what the girl does for herself, for freedom, well, this is for me like he has touched the very sense of life...<br/><br/>As the locations and the reconstitution of the 40's are opulent, there's absolutely nothing wrong in this movie.<br/><br/>So, make you a moment of freedom: watch this movie, go read a Sparks' novel and write the story of your love for your soul-mate...."

","""The Notebook"" is a beautifully written and filmed love story ranks right on top along with ""Terms of Endearment"" and ""Love Story"". James Garner's narration adds to the smooth flash-backs that illustrate the couple's first meeting, and resulting summer romance. Gena Rawlands grace and beauty is timeless. Their ""love/hate start as a couple will be identifiable to many, I am sure. It could be compared to a present day Romeo and Juliet. The span of years covered in the flashbacks is flawed only in the casting of the two young suitors. In my opinion, their characters should have been reversed. It was difficult to imagine that Ryan Gosling's young man could mature to look like.....Well, you be the judge. The film is beautiful and I guarantee it will stand the test of time and become a romantic ""classic""."

","What a beautiful story. If you do not like crying during movies, i would definitely not recommend it. This is the tragic Romeo/Juliet type story you dream about experiencing yourself (the loving each other so much part, not the dying part)The acting is fantastic and you find yourself really caring about these characters. This is definitely not your average brainless chick flick, it is deep and powerful and meaningful. This is the kind of movie that you find yourself thinking about weeks later. It is not a movie that is just here for mere entertainment, that once you return to the video store, you won't even remember watching it. I Haley recommend this movie to anyone who can stand very sad movies."

Ryan and Rachel were terrific, and i cannot imagine anyone else filling their roles. It also makes me want to believe that this kind of love exists not only in the movies, but in real life. Perhaps there is a real Noah out there.

The first time I watched the movie, I began crying it is such an unexpected ending. I didn't know how it was going to end, but I had not thought of how it did end, with them dying in each others arms. It is so sad but also it is good as you know they are together for ever, not how they were in real life with Allie's condition.

","The Notebook is my favorite romantic/drama movie in the world. It made me laugh, made me cry, made me sad and a whole lot more feelings. Not only was the Notebook great because of what it was about, but what also contributed to how great it was were the characters. The producer could not have chosen a better couple; Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams make the perfect couple and are brilliant together. (James Garner and Gena Rowlands were also great.)In the movie, when Allie Hamilton (McAdams)first met Noah Calhoan (Gosling) she did not think much of him. However Noah was struck by Allie's beauty, I would say it was love at first sight for Noah. Throughout the movie Noah tries getting a date with Allie but she plays hard to get. Noah however finally sneaks to a date with Allie and after that night, they got to know each other better, Allie and Noah were unseparateable. Unfortunately, Noah was not the man Allie's parents wanted their daughter to marry. Many, many more things that were happy, that were sad and made me cry occurred after that. You must watch this movie that my boyfriend and I can't stop watching. I have watched it four times and I am still not tired of it. The Notebook is one of those rare movies that are great in the beginning and have an absolutely striking ending. It is a MUST SEE breath taking movie!

"angelbelle212","10","0","0","29 October 2005"," Story behind true love.
","Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) are two young adults who find true love one summer, against all odds. He is a poor kid and shes the rich girl. This starts out as a basic rich girl/ poor boy, Romeo and Juliet kind of thing. Her parents don't want her with him and so forth. They beat those odds and that love grew and changed their lives. This love at times was...<br/><br/>1. Sweet, where you see them together at the beach when Allie tells Noah ""Now say you're a bird too."" and he responds ""If you're a bird, I'm a bird."" 2. Forbidden, when Allie's mom argues with her saying ""She will wind up with her heart broken or pregnant! Now he's a nice boy, but he's..."" Allie asks ""He's WHAT? He is what? Tell me!"" and her mother responds with determination ""He is trash! Trash! Trash! Not for you!"" 3. This movie shows all sides of love, even close to obsession. There are parts of the movie where Noah buys a house and works on it day in and day out just the way he promised Allie he would, even though he just saw her through a window kissing another guy (who happened to be her fiancé).<br/><br/>One of my favorite scenes in the movie, the day after Noah and Allie broke up, Noah wrote her a letter and one everyday after that for a year. They meet up and he tells her how much he still needs her and loves her by bringing up those letter... Allie ""Why didn't you write me? Why? It wasn't over for me, I waited for you for seven years. But now its too late."" Noah ""I wrote you 365 letters. I wrote you everyday for a year."" Allie ""You wrote me?"" Noah ""Yes... it wasn't over, it still isn't over."" The story is told in two parts. Young love that grows and old love that rekindles. Allie as an adult played by Gena Rowlands has the disease Alzheimer's, so an older Noah played by James Garner reads to her every day from a book she wrote herself about their love. Hoping she will remember one day about their love Noah sits there and sees his true love stare back at him as a stranger, you see his emotions, how this is killing him but he still does it in hopes that his Allie will come back to him. Garner did an excellent job in this film, though his scenes were short, he narrorates the film and you can hear it in his voice what Noah felt those times. You come to feel for him and hope it ends well.<br/><br/>My favorite lines in this movie are just a couple of words said twice in this movie. ""I'll be seeing you"" also the title of my favorite song in the movie.<br/><br/>It first appears at the end of Noahs first letter to Allie... ""My Dearest Allie. I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter any more, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you. Noah"" And at the end of the movie when Adult Allie asks Noah ""Do you think our love can make miracles?"" and Noah responds ""I do."" He then climbs into bed with her, she says good night, he says good night and then he says ""I'll be seeing you."" The next scene is when the nurse finds them both close together holding hands on Allies small twin size bed, at first it seems as if they are asleep, but they both passed away.<br/><br/>A love that can go through so much and still be there in the end. Thats the first time I've seen a love like this in a story or movie. It was a pleasure seeing this movie and its one of my treasured DVD's. It gets ten and a half stars from me if I could get that half star in there. Well done, beautiful cinematography, the script, the acting, the story. Good job."

","The Notebook is a story in a story format that opens with Duke (James Garner) and his friend, (Gena Rowland) who are residents in a nursing home. Duke reads to the woman who demonstrates advanced senile dementia and his story serves to recollect and intrigue from her fuzzy memory. The story he reads of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachael McAdams) is set in the pre-WWII rural south where he is a blue collar mill worker earning 41 cents an hour, and she is the lively daughter of wealthy parents who want her to make a good match. Noah and his father (Sam Shepard) are wealthy in other ways with their love of poetry which is integral to their relationship, while Allie is defined by the pressures for young women of patrician upbringing of the era.<br/><br/>Gosling and McAdams as the young lovers are vibrant, endearing, and explosive on screen as first love blossoms to overtake the plans of Allie's parents for her education at Sarah Lawrence College. While Noah's father supports his choice, Allie's parents are not delighted with their daughter. It is a familiar story of poor boy loves rich girl, pampered girl wants to please her family, and her family wants the best for their child and will go to whatever gets the daughter married to the rich nice guy (James Marsden). Noah and Allie fight, love, and are fated to be separated by the classism of her parents, the war, and her willingness to go along with the expectations of southern society, or so the audience is lead to believe. Noah rebuilds his dream house, rows on the lake, and pines.<br/><br/>Young lovers are contrasted by the devotion of Duke to the woman, and their relationship is the downside of the story as bodies and memories failing, the senior couple have their own problems -- his health and her inability to remember. Visited by grown children and grandchildren, Duke is revealed as Noah, and the woman is Allie. Although loving and supportive of their parents, the children want their father to leave the nursing facility and return to them because they recognize the hopelessness of their mother's inability to recollect her husband, her children and grandchildren, and their long marriage. But, Noah is committed to his sweetheart and stays by her side hoping for a miracle that will bring her memory back. So, he reads to her their story each day and waits for brief moments of lucidity to manifest.<br/><br/>The film is a wonderful example of exquisite cinematography, storytelling, superior casting, and picturesque location that unites in a rare film of charm and sentiment without deteriorating into maudlin emotionalism. With disposable marriages the norm for contemporary society, The Notebook presents the fading notion of loyalty, devotion, and commitment for a lifetime. It is a gentle film with old fashion values and as characterized by Gosling and McAdams, Noah and Allie experience the joys and heartbreak that long lived romantic love creates till death do part."

I was so moved by it, I watched it a second time shortly after seeing it for the first time. The Notebook was absolutely outstanding and without a doubt one of the best love stories I've ever watched.<br/><br/>The acting was of the highest caliber, the photography was gloriously stunning, and the story was so bittersweet and touching, it was almost to much so. For love story purists this movie's poignancy will envelop you. If one does not have a high tolerance for these types of films they should probably stay away.<br/><br/>This movie has been compared to Love Story but I Happened to have enjoyed The Notebook a lot more. The main negative is it is almost to bittersweet. It is draining and exhausting to watch but the film maintained an old style quality that makes it seem like this should have come out many years ago. It is unique and an instant classic. These days, a movie like this just doesn't come around to often. Judging from both the critical and viewer acclaim this film has received, maybe more of these types of films should come around.<br/><br/>There is nothing I can say to do justice to the performers who went above and beyond mere excellence. If I could only pick one performer to give an award to, however, it would have to be James Garner. Was he even nominated? His performance was pure, powerful and flawless. It Was as Oscar worthy as anyone's I've ever seen and I think this movie should have been nominated as well as all of the four main Performers.<br/><br/>The Notebook is sweet and nostalgic. It's also powerful, luminescent, graceful and visually lovely. It also contains one of the most powerful endings I have ever seen, and that's no exaggeration. Again-if one is not a fan of this genre they should stay away but for fans of romantic dramas, this one is a must see. The Notebook is an utterly magnificent film."

","Surprised at how engulfed I became in this movie. While I am not inclined towards such movies occasionally why not? I think as of to date I have watched 8 or so many times now, beautiful yet classic movie. That's what was nice, although not to cliché's in a cheesy way, it was a beautiful story that was well worth watching through without a moment of boredom. Though I understand the need for the parts with James Garner and Gena Rowlands as it relates to the movie, it would have been better if it were scaled back towards the last portion of the movie. I think it would've served better I think for the climax of the film, but that's my opinion. As a guy I was blown away at how this movie hooked me in and kept me till the end when this isn't my preferred theme solely in a movie. The lead actors/characters were brilliant simply brilliant. Both of these young actors impressed me greatly although I had seen Ryan Gosling in ""Murder by Numbers"" and was impressed by him in that, though he was playing a completely different character, his intensity was equally stirring and memorable if not more so in this film. Rachel McAdams was captivating, I loved her portrayal of this character. Her feistiness was amazing, great job, but equally more important was her ability to portray this time period as woman was beautiful and very believable. Her intellect, as well as being tied into the upper crust of society was portrayed well especially in the middle parts of the movie, yet to commit herself into this wonderful relationship, that was all about the love and how it never left her was portrayed in the most authentic way, simply beautiful. Where else to go I don't know other then to say wonderful story, great actors, beautiful movie, and seeing is believing.

I've seen other romantic movies with the same kind of plot lines but there's something about this movie that just pulls at something on the inside of you that you can't put into words. I don't know if anyone else felt this way,but I was finding myself wishing I was Allie.I mean not only because Ryan Gosling is drop dead gorgeous,but you want a man to love you that much, even though you went away for 14 years,and haven't heard a word since,still build her dream house hoping and praying it'll make her come back. Writing her letters EVERY DAY for a year, actually showing a woman that you love her.... even though I'm taken I'm so incredibly in love with Ryan Gosling.... =) I think Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author and I'm so happy he wrote this book so it can be made into the best movie I've seen. I actually made my fiancé sit down and watch this movie with me. He was griping the entire way to the movie store, all the way back home, the beginning credits but then once the movie started going I noticed he began to get VERY quiet and I began to talk in the middle of the movie right before Noah and Allie's second love scene on the dock and he actually ""shushed"" me to keep watching it. So that was a miracle and at the end he actually CRIED!!!! So... I love this movie and to those who haven't seen it...you're missing out on a wonderful experience. Love,Alicia"

","When I saw the preview for this, I thought ""Another cheesy, shallow romance"" but guess what? It wasn't. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have chemistry, charm and talent to boot. Although the plot is overused, it translates on screen as a pure original. To repeat what other comments said, the scenery is beautiful beyond belief and it fits perfectly with the story. The young Noah and Allie made the film exciting and easy on the eyes. However,the older versions of Noah and Allie(played wonderfully by James Garner and Gena Rowlands) make the movie into a true LOVE story and pulls the tears out of your eyes. Any film about a love story I ever saw before always gave me a thirst for more. The Notebook is the first and only that ever satisfied me."

","I really loved this film but surprisingly enough it really never took off in Ireland. When I heard that this film was released I deliberately read the book first because I'm a firm believer that the books are better. In this case I feel the film hit the target spot on. It was brilliantly edited and I thought that the two younger leads were fantastic but then I've been a big fan of Rachel McAdams since Mean Girls. I thought she played the role of Allie superbly and it just shows what a fantastic actress she is. To brutally honest though I was never as interested in the older couples story and I enjoyed it more when they stuck to the main story. But luckily I did buy the DVD about two weeks ago and I definitely think that it gets better every time you watch it. I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a good old fashioned love story."

","I thought it was absolutely AMAZING. Brilliant. I loved it so much. The first time I saw it I cried hysterically and even after it ended I was still crying.. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I still cry every time I watch it. Its the perfect love story, I suggest EVERYONE goes out and rents it. I think both Rachel & Ryan were really great. Their chemistry was just.. wow. They made me want to have my life end up that way. I think they are both wonderful actors, and I cant wait to see more of their movies. The supporting cast was great too. Everything about this movie was so.. wonderful. I'd also like to say Nicholas Sparks is a genius for writing the novel in the first place. Without him, this movie would have never came to be."

","I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! Why can't they make MORE movies like this??!! This movie is great because it has a simple, bittersweet plot that is so memorable...it is on my top 5 list of the best movies I've ever seen in my life!! <br/><br/>There are certainly numerous reasons why I love this movie so much. But here are my 4 main reasons:<br/><br/>1.) This movie made me fall in love with the characters, Noah and Ally. So much so, that it makes me yearn for a love like that!!<br/><br/>2.) The scenery in the movie is so spectacular!!! (I've never seen South Carolina so beautiful! The movie's scenery is even more beautiful than I last remembered living in South Carolina!!) <br/><br/>3.) I am also mesmerized by the very actors that have played these characters! It has some of the best acting I've ever seen from Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams!! I love their acting talent and this has inspired me to continue on with my drama studies! I will certainly look for them in future movies! <br/><br/>4.) It has one of the best ""kissing"" and lovemaking scenes in ""chick-movie"" history!!<br/><br/>This movie is classic and is worth seeing over again for many years to come!"
"Lechuguilla","Null","0","0","15 September 2005"," Somewhere In Time
","James Garner plays a contemporary older man who reads a story from a diary, in an effort to reach out to an elderly lady, played by Gena Rowlands. She likes listening to the story, (told in the film via flashbacks), a 1940's romance between a young country hick with a heart of gold, Noah, played by Ryan Gosling, and an attractive, but confused, young woman, Allie, played by Rachel McAdams. Allie lives with her rich parents. Noah lives with his poverty-ridden father. Naturally, the love affair encounters complications, including opposition from Allie's snobbish parents. Where this romance leads is the basis for the film's plot. ""The Notebook"" will appeal to viewers who enjoy low-key, sentimental love stories. In what it sets out to accomplish, the film does a fairly good job.<br/><br/>But the fact that so much of the plot centers on the two young lovers renders a somewhat unsatisfying result when the actors playing those two parts botch their roles. Rachel McAdams overacts. Ryan Gosling underacts ... stunningly. Indeed, throughout most of the film, Gosling, mumbling his lines, seems to be ""out to lunch"". Further, for a rural kid from South Carolina, Gosling's Southern accent was way too subtle. On the other hand, Gena Rowlands gives a marvelous performance, as does Joan Allen, who plays Allie's mother.<br/><br/>The film manipulates viewer emotions. But I suppose that is to be expected in a love story. The final twelve minutes really tug at your heart strings.<br/><br/>""The Notebook"" is a well-intentioned film about the chasm that separates youth from old age. And, I applaud any film, this one included, set in a contemporary nursing home. Although the plot is a little too predictable for my taste, and although the acting is highly variable, the film is a welcome, low-key alternative to Hollywood's usual preoccupation with monsters, gore, car chases, micro-burst flashes, explosions, and general residuum."

Romance, Drama. Well my girl would probably like that one, Okay. I rented the movie and we watched it...<br/><br/>...Wow! This movie has the most excellent storyline, keeps you entertained, keeps you guessing a bit, and for sure, will have you rooting for you hero. The end is a bit of a surprise, my girl saw it coming, no matter, you have to have a heart of steel not to shed a tear or two on this one, but the ending is not so sad, it could not have worked out any better.

But I never did get how she lost her memory i know she had some disorder to the brain but did they ever tell how she got it? Please someone help me there if possible. Anyway The Notebook definitely has to be one of my favorite romances of all time. Even though I'm not a fan this movie turned me back to the genre. If only there were more movies like this.

I saw Red Eye (also McAdams) over the weekend and decided it was time to sit down and watch the DVD I had bought two weeks ago. I was captivated from the beginning. The story is very well developed. I especially appreciated the depths to which their love had gone. Noah makes a promise to Allie that he keeps even though he is likely to never see her again. Despite the fact she may never know he had kept his promise his love for her lived on. I have to say this is one of the most touching stories I have ever come across. I honestly cried three times with the final tears ending at least 20 minutes after the film was over. In my opinion this is a must for anyone who believes in love."
"brandikcraven","10","0","0","11 August 2005"," my opinion of this movie
","i personally just cant get over how much i love the notebook. it is a heartwarming tale of true love. which i think is hard to come by these days, not that it doesn't exist or that everyone doesn't have an equal chance at true love, just by the fact that i think a lot of people settle. they settle for less than they should. they get pregnant, they don't want to wait, they are over-come with feelings of love and newness that only evaporate after so long if you don't truly love a person. watching this movie, i became so captured up in the love story and what was going to happen with these 3 people (ally, noah and lon). for each character was loving in its own way. its hard to point out the villain in the story, some would say lon b/c everyone is rooting for noah. but lon really cares for ally just as noah does. i found her mom to be the villain by keeping them apart. this movie reminded me of the innocence of first love, which wasn't that long ago, and how things don't always turn out the way you had planned. sometimes its hard to follow your heart but its even harder to go through life thinking of how you could have changed it."
"peterg-griffin","8","0","0","10 August 2005"," An ordinary love story
","There are many features about the Notebook that I liked. For instants the director Nick Cassavetes and actors gave their best towards this movie. Even though there is nothing really special about this film, it touched me: the simplicity and the beautiful way it was filmed..<br/><br/>The best part of the film where the performances of the different actors making the film therefor quite believable. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams really succeeded in giving a good-to-watch-performance. The old Noah and Allie (Tim Ivey and Gina Rowlands) had an important role and gave a extremely believable and absolutely brilliant performance.<br/><br/>Even though I don't think Rachel McAdams (young Allie) was the right actor for her role, I found her to be quite good and believable. Especially when she was acting a teenage girl. Ryan Gosling I a different matter, I think he was just the right choice for his part. He did really well in acting a teenager and the later a more mature man. Brilliant work from both the actor Ryan Gosling (young Noah) and the director Nick Cassavetes.<br/><br/>I personally watch tons of movies and I often like them even though many might say I sucks. I don't actually even like love stories that much, but the Notebook brought to my mouth these words; This movie has been done out of love towards movies. <br/><br/>My opinion is still quite simple: It's mostly just a good-old, ordinary love story with a nice touch to it.<br/><br/>The film succeeded in being the film that it was suppose to be. Well made and worth a watch at least from DVD, TV or cable.."

The actors and actresses were great and well chosen for their parts. Oh yes, I read some of the comments about the birds at the end, when Noan and Allie ""passed on"", please read the sequel to the movie, ""The Wedding"". It is a must read, I hope they will make a movie out of it, and will use the same cast. (Would ruin it otherwise) That would be a Godsend. It is so heartwarming from the beginning of ""The Notebook"", to the end of ""The Wedding"". This story enlightens a persons inner soul. Should have won all the awards that year.

"QueenMakeda84","10","0","0","3 August 2005"," Love, Love, Love This Movie
","This movie was beyond beautiful. The entire plot was just magical, sweet, and tender. I own the movie and it has become one of my favorite films. I enjoy the great love the characters have for each other. I work in a nursing home, so seeing that kind of affection from old school folks really does exist. It's warm to see that kind of love outlast some of the turmoil and cruelty life throws your way. It's so hurtful to watch the person you love and adore not remember you little by little. They forget the life you've shared. Alternately, Allie's depression and turmoil that she's forgetting the one thing that's been a constant in her life. The older characters played their parts to a T. You sensed the deep love and loyalty he had to his wife's well-being.<br/><br/>Ryan and Rachel were adorable together. I can't imagine anyone else in their parts, but I'm sure it could be doable with other actors. These two just had great chemistry like a real relationship. When I say that, I mean, you could see yourself in a relationship like their's. It reminded me a lot of my own relationship with a significant other. Two people come into each other's lives and profoundly affect the other so that nothing can really break that bond. Not years of separation or misunderstanding. That love really does exist, and this movie visualized it for us.<br/><br/>I liked the singularity of Noah's character. He has one parent, one best friend, and one girlfriend. His world is very closed, and Ryan hit upon that well. As Allie, Rachel played her as a likable young girl. Not some spoiled rich chick with no understanding of life. Rachel understood Allie's confusion to play by the rules, but it was different in that she truly loved him. It wasn't some arbitrary set-up by elitist parents. Lon was very deserving of her love. James Marsden has really grown as an actor as well by being in this movie. I look forward to greater things (no more ""Disturbing Behavior"" films please :D). Beautiful cinematography. Beautiful acting. Beautiful music. It was a love story that was on par with ""Love Story"" and other greats. Truly recommend."

When the movie was over I couldn't believe how extraordinary and moving the performance was. As the summer neared to an end, my friends and I all got together for our usual back to school meeting just to make sure we didn't buy the same clothes. During our usual meeting, 6 out of my 7 friends had seen it and absolutely loved it(the other one had been at camp so she didn't have a chance to see any movies.)We all decided to go see it again and came out of the theatre crying even though we had all seen it before.

During the opening credits the rower on the lake in the twilight to the fantastic piano main title by Aaron Zigman while the camera slowly pans in on Gena Rowlands, standing in a window of a mansion watching the birds approach, brings tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, in my opinion, the ""young"" leads come across as being rather bland and uninteresting whereas Rowlands and Garner as the mature couple are magnificent and more than make up for any weak moments. Joan Allen in a co-starring role as Allie's mother is great as well, especially as she ""becomes human"" and reveals a deep secret about her own youth towards the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Well worth watching for the beautiful story line and the fantastic performances of Rowlands, always a treat, and Garner.

I especially like the fact that he never left her side even through her illness. Nobody tells a story like Nicholas Sparks and I hope he keeps writing.

The Story of Allie and Noah contrasts with the friendship between Duke and Miss Calhoun and provides the background to understand their story. My favorite moment is when Allie returns to Noah and shrugs her shoulders. At that point Miss Calhoun's memory returns through the Alzheimer's haze and the young lovers are reunited. The realistic depiction of Alzheimer's as she loses those memories is heart wrenching. Without giving it away, the ending is ""perfect"". Kudo's to both set of actors.

","One of the things about a film with intelligent, realistic dialog and superb acting is that the viewer easily becomes deeply involved in the story.

You will feel the longing, the passion the pure emotion that you felt. I'm 42 now and the story of my first love could have become the script for this film, as I'm sure could have many other viewers, but I haven't re-experienced the intensity of emotions that I felt during that period in the way that this film helped me to feel. I cried at the end of the film because of the beauty of the love story on screen and because of the sadness of our life situations. I also cried because it reminded me of the unsatisfied longing I have to experience that pure love; you see, in the script of my love story, we parted and never did rejoin.

It has a glorious soundtrack as well as scenery, camera-work, and most importantly the script and especially the acting. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling give the best performance of their careers so far. This enriching story is bound to make both genders cry, but an interesting kind of tear. The very last scene is the most heartbreaking but also the sweetest giving off a mixed chemically dazzling effect. You can never be the same after watching this film. It may sound like the biggest clichÃ© - poor guy falls for rich girl, they fall in love, she has to go away - but it's so much more with all the other aspects of the movie combined.

I cried when they weren't because I genuinely felt for them. Any movie that can render such a broad spectrum of audience emotion is a piece of art.<br/><br/>This movie has it's roots in the story of a puppy love. But, it transcends beyond that, just as Ally and Noah's love for one another does the same. This is a movie about soul mates. And, just how great love can be.

The whole movie was so realistic, even i thought i was back in the 1940's, a very romantic era. I loved the fact that Noah and Allie first met at a carnival and the fact that Noah put his life at risk to get Allie's attention.

The plot consists of real life drama which is suspenseful enough to keep you glued to the screen to see what happens next. I recommend this movie to everyone whom has ever been love."

","When I first heard of this movie, I though it was a cheap shot at Drama/Romance, but after the first few minutes of seeing it, I knew this movie was going to be brilliant and touching...So I got myself a pillow and sank into it.<br/><br/>The young male lead Ryan gosling is really convincing as a young handsome determined man with a warm smile, and then comes Rachel McAdams from mean girls who plays a complex role of a young colourful blossoming woman from a well founded home who falls in love with him and is later caught in a web of harsh reality and the blurry promise of the future. The older leads are also brilliant and very natural. Though the movie rings a bell to Tim Burton's Big Fish, its a tale told well between generations and time line. But what this movie really does, is that it helps realise that falling in love once, can change your life over and over again. it explains that home security and family duties are great factors affecting love as in ""look beyond the bed of roses"".<br/><br/>I've rated the movie 8/10 because its a love lesson thats probably too late for some others to learn from but soothing nonetheless, please see it as I'll recommend it to anyone thats loved once."

","Even thought it may have been a classic love story, The Notebook was unlike any other movie I have ever seen. These two young children in love is enough to warm any cold heart. It is for certain a tear jerker, so ladies, bring a box of tissues if you're going to watch it. But don't think The Notebook is just a chick flick. It may be a tear jerker, but it also has a sense of humor. Guys and people of all ages will enjoy it, from young to old. It was THE best movie I've ever had the pleasure to watch, and I'm dead serious. I've seen it about 5 times now and it never gets old. I cry every time! I'm probably always going to love this movie, no matter how old I become. I HIGHLY recommend it for anyone who loves an awesome romantic comedy."

I don't think any other movie has better casting! The story was original and not predictable at all. I recommended movie strongly for everyone. It will capture your heart and remain in your mind as one of the best films of all time. To me this is Rachel McAams break-through role as well as Ryan gosling. This movie broke rachel away from the teenage-flicks. I wouldn't never thought she had this much talent to land this role as her other films don't give her the chance to shine. And Ryan Gosling...I didn't even know who he was until this film came out. Both of them will have steady careers ahead of them."

","I was pretty reluctant to watch this movie, as I had heard so many comments on it. Most of them good. Some of them bad. Other than that though I purposely did not read to much about the movie except for what was listed on the back cover. After finally picking it up, all I can say is do not let other's opinions make the choice for you. Good or bad comments often ruin a movie experience for me.<br/><br/>If you are like me at all in that respect, I urge you to just watch the movie. It isn't unpredictable. It isn't tragic, or happy. It seems a bit unreal, and hard to believe in today's world, where promises mean so little. This movie embraces what love is all about. Some macho people may call it it a chicflic, but to me that is just being afraid of the stigma of showing emotion. Where would human kind be without love? It seems movies like Troy, and Lion Heart are OK because men are killing other men, and fighting for love. But a movie that shows another side, of living a normal life and still fighting for love is somehow anathema is ridiculous.<br/><br/>Just watch the movie."

I didn't have huge expectations about this movie, but I decided to see it even though critics had mixed reactions to this movie. About halfway through the movie or even before, I cried like a baby. I fell in love with this wonderful drama/romance. And it's a good movie, and it doesn't matter if people don't like romances, because that's not what it is the whole time.<br/><br/>It's set in the 1940s in North Carolina, and I have to say, the scenery was beautiful and it made me feel like I was actually there. The story starts off with the rich girl Ally (Rachel McAdams), who's vacationing with her family, and the not-so-rich, guy from ""the wrong side of the tracks"" Noah (Ryan Gosling) and they so happen to meet and eventually fall in love, even though it's forbidden by Ally's mother because she thinks he's ""trash"". But they continue their romance. I liked Rachel McAdams's acting in this movie, but for some reason, I wasn't too hot for Ryan Gosling's performance; I thought it was mediocre. But that is the only negative I got from this movie.<br/><br/>Nick Cassavettes wrote this, along with "" A Walk To Remember"", which, don't get me wrong, was good, but I believe this was my favorite by far. I would recommend this to basically anyone, even men, since I know guys who have seen it and they have cried as well.

And out of all of it, how their love kept them together, even in death. When watching this movie, you just stayed glued to it, and it's awesome because it doesn't revolve around the sexual side of relationships.

","The Notebook is an old-fashioned love story with the subject of Dementia thrown in to heighten the tear jerking experience. The movie opens with James Garner telling a story (from a notebook) to an elderly woman played by Gena Rowlands. She appears to have a memory problem. The story is about a summer romance, a tale of love between a society girl (Allison Hamilton) who meets a young mill worker (Noah Calhoun) at a carnival, June 6, 1940. They are both 17 years old. Allison's (Allie) parents don't approve of Noah, because of his social standing (meaning, he doesn't have one). Young Allie's heart is broken when her parents try their best to split them in two. After their summer romance is over, when Allie is sent off to college in New York and Noah has to enter the military and World War II in Europe, you would think that there would be no way for this uncommon romance to get back together. However, true love has no boundaries.<br/><br/>The performances by James Garner (old Duke) and Rachael McAdams (young Allie) are outstanding. The screenplay is based off of the Nicholas Sparks heart-warming book. I'm not normally into romantic movies, put this movie was so well put together that I had to give it 10 stars. If you miss seeing the old-fashioned Hollywood love stories, then you must see this movie."

","Let's get this out there right away, this movie is about love, and for a lot of guys myself included it was hard to get past that and really enjoy it, but I did. About ten minutes into the film I said to myself I like this guy Noah (Ryan Gosling) and for me thats what made it work. I wanted him to get the girl. Most romance movies make the male lead so weak and feminine (no offense) that men can't relate to him and say ""that's a real man"". But Noah is real, he is a hard worker, knows what he wants and is dedicated to it, and like most men he doesn't know how to get it. I've read the book years ago and Ryan Gosling really brought Noah to life and was a different style of male lead, and was so crazy that he made me believe he would wait that long for one woman. As for Allie well I think every guy wants a girl like this, but there aren't many around anymore. It works for the time though and this movie really does show enduring love and that it can exist and overcome anything and everything. The Notebook is the first film I've seen in a long time that brought me so many different emotions and left me thinking for days. Guys give this movie a chance if you haven't already, besides your girl will love you for it.<br/><br/>JC"

","I was kind of cynical about this movie when it first came out, and had absolutely no intention of seeing it. But as the media frenzied over it more and more, declaring it was one of the best films of 2004, I began wondering if 'The Notebook' was worthy of a watch. So, when the DVD release came out, I borrowed it from Blockbuster. I was already pleased with the summary of the movie's plot on the back of the DVD; it wasn't one of those ordinary love stories, and the fact it was set in the 50's was also a pleasant change from all the typical, modern-day romantic comedies. I thought both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams acted their roles with great passion and there was an also unmistakable chemistry somewhere between them. The story was just absolutely beautiful and unique; unlike any other. As it unfolded, it made me feel happy, it made me feel sad and it made me feel warm inside. I won't spoil the ending for you, but I'll tell you it made both happiness and sadness well up inside of me. An amazing cast pulled off an amazing movie based on an amazing novel. Not only is this romantic movie unlike others; being set in a time quite different to ours, it has two sides of it, the present and the past.

","It's been a long time since I've fallen in love with a theatrical love story. Mainstream love stories are so quick to solve everything or too shallow to really delve into anything worth spending the $10 ticket price. It seems that Hollywood is more interested in a pretty match rather than a thematic delivery when it comes to the romance genre. So it was a bit of bitterness that I rented ""The Notebook"" following a barrage of recommendations from friends and relatives.<br/><br/>Admittedly, I was skeptical going into the film. I had hated ""A Walk to Remember"", the movie based on another Nicholas Sparks novel. Mandy Moore and Shane West were so pious and pristine in that flick, that it was hard for me to find a connection to their characters. That and Mandy Moore could stand to take an acting lesson. But I digress...<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel MacAdams had both caught my attention before in their previous work, but in this particular story, they sparkled. The chemistry between them as Noah and Allie is electrifying. I found myself leaning so far over in my seat as I watched their story unfold that I still feel the pains of stretching today. The passion and intensity between these two actors is simply the most beautiful exchange I've seen in years.<br/><br/>And while Gosling and MacAdams are spectacular in their roles, it was James Garner and Gena Rowlands who stole my heart. Without giving too much away, it is the relationship between Garner and Rowlands that sent me reaching for the Kleenex, and wishing on the night's most shining star that I too could experience the lifetime of love that these characters had shared. It's a love story to remember, that is sure.<br/><br/>I was surprised to learn that Nick Cassavettes (Rowlands' son) directed the flick, and did so with pitch-perfect care and respect for this story. I haven't read the book, but I can assure you that the movie prompts me to do so.<br/><br/>And while my comments may be dripping with the most sincerest of praise, I can only hope that others will take an opportunity to see this movie. It is wonderful."

","when i first saw the movie i said i had to do it again.i have seen it about 10 times since then.and the first time i saw it was last week.i cry every time i see the part when after remembering she forgets and has a seizure.i think every time i see it that boy suffers all over again.it's a simple story and that it might have happened to some of us makes it excellent.if you have experienced summer love that ended bad you can't remain immune to this movie.great acting and directing,superb ending (although a bit predictable,i can't think of a better way to end it). anyway in essence a touching film.it is nice to see that not everyone is interested in making big budget blockbusters, and that some script writers still have romance in their hearts.i hope to see more such elegant movies."

","I consider myself a fairly rough critic. Many elements plays into affect as to whether or not I care for a film. I'm biased toward no particular type but when given a choice I prefer drama any day. The notebook is 2004's winner in my book for the best dramatic romance. I am so glad my sorority sister brought the movie home and asked me to watch it. She cried and I balled my eyes out. Why someone wrote such a bad briefing on the back of the DVD, I don't know. I would have never watched it had I not been asked and boy am I thankful. May I just say that the scene on the dock (on the DVD cover)without a doubt is the most remarkably heart wrenching part of movie and is incomparable to any other dramatic scene played before. Forget 10. This movie is off the scale."

","My wife and I rented this movie for our anniversary and both enjoyed it.<br/><br/>One thing I really liked was the characters were all reasonable and seemingly real people. They behaved as real people would behave.<br/><br/>There was a lot of emotion, and we actually cared what happened to the people.<br/><br/>I guess my criticism is that they gave the ending away a little too early. We both thought there would be one last twist to the story, but there wasn't.<br/><br/>We thought we had it figured out that she ended up going with Lon but Noah was the one to join her when she needed him the most in the nursing home. Thought that would have been a good ending. And the kids visiting the home then would have been her kids, but not his, except for the one different looking one who was the product of the affair she had with him.<br/><br/>Our idea anyway, but we were both satisfied with the movie the way it was.<br/><br/>We cared what happened.<br/><br/>One last thing - we thought the girl's dad was kind of weird compared to the other people in the movie. Kind of a cartoonish character which clashed with the other earthtone real people."
"jeffthemartin","8","0","0","19 May 2005"," A smart movie inhabited by real people
","""The Notebook"" can easily appear to be a typical Hollywood movie, but it's a smart movie inhabited by real people, and that is why it is worth watching.<br/><br/>The story is the typical formula ""boy meets girl, and at first they're happy, but then stuff happens, and there's a big surprise ending."" Even the fact that the story is told, in large part, from the perspective of an old man isn't very original. What makes this a smart movie is that it assumes we know the formula, and it doesn't try to hide from it. It faces the challenge head-on, as if to say, ""we are going to do such a good job of telling this typical Hollywood story that you won't care that it's been told a million times before."" Most strikingly, the film recognizes that even though the story contains A BIG REVELATION, most people are going to figure it out half way through the movie, so there's no point in going to ridiculous lengths to hide it.<br/><br/>While the story is typical, the actors and characters are not. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling, as the romantic leads, play their parts with utter sincerity and believability. The characters are likable, not because they're hilarious, or perfect, but because they are normal goofy people, with their share of likability and good looks, balanced by imperfections. Their relationships to each other and to their families are just like real life--they fight, and they make out, all in the same day. The parents are not just parents--they are real people, with the same range of emotions and personality traits as any other person.<br/><br/>For me (a 25-year-old, recently married male) all this added up to me identifying very strongly with the characters in this film, while not being distracted by clichés."

","This is probably the best chick flick I've ever seen. I see everyone downing the movie on these boards. I believe they need to go back to the star wars and LOTR boards. Don't get me wrong, I'm a SW and LOTR fan myself. :P But this movie was great. I'm a 21 year old guy, and yes, this movie made me tear up big time. I thought the acting was great for how young the stars were, and such a change of roll for Rachel McAdams, coming from Mean Girls.

Another compliment for the surroundings, clothes and off course her first love Ryan Gosling. I saw him a year or so ago in a movies called ""United States of Leland"" which was also an impressive movie, but not as good as this one.

","i have watched this movie like 50 times and every time it still makes me cry. This movie shows you how hard it is to forget about your first love and always find a way back to them. Ryan Gosling, who played Noah, made a terrific performance,one of his bests. The way he acted out the part of Noah some people can really relate to. Rachel McAdams was absolutely stunning she was the perfect actress for the part of Allie. Together the two make a wonderful movie and made it come alive. Every young couple out there in some way can relate to Noah and Allie and let them know that their love can mean everything. <br/><br/>This movie is one of my all time favorites and i can't believe how magnificent it was. James Garner and Gena Rowland made a wonderful appearance in the movie too. They showed you how much the two main characters loved each other and would hold onto each other forever even through the good times and bad times.

","Go inside your bedroom, now move over to the cabinet, open the last drawer, and reach for that handkerchief. Why you ask? Because it's going to come in handy when you watch the romantic tearjerker ""The Notebook"". So are you ready to take notes? Here we go: ""The Notebook"" is the poster film of chic flicks for 2004. Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel Mcadams as Allie star as young lovers who must overcome obstacles to survive their romance: poor boy/rich girl dilemma, boy has cool dad and girl has overprotective mom, boy goes to war/girl goes to pray. Yea, we have seen these formulaic concepts before, but take note of this, they are presented by Director Nick Cassavetes as more of an instrumental plight then a serendipity fluffy ingredient. The story is told by older Noah to the older Allie, who suffers from a degenerate Alzheimer's condition, in hopes of getting her to remember their unforgettable love. That's it, reach for that handkerchief. James Garner did garner a S.A.G. Best Supporting Actor nom for his heartwarming performance as the older Noah. Gena Rowlands as the older Allie was no match for Garner but it was sporadically tender. However, she crawled up the wrong allie when it came to match Garner's magnanimity. Cassavates, who is Rowland's real life son, did execute a credible job with the festooning and amour of ""The Notebook"". Several scenes were of cinematography perfection by Robert Fraisse. His ""Fraisse"" frames were breathtaking. However, what binded me the most of ""The Notebook"" was the emotional breakthrough performance of Rachel Mcadams. I wonder if there is more talent in ""The Mcadams Family"". OK guys! Final Notes! If you request a movie to get your gals all romantic & horny then ""The Notebook"" gets straight lays, I mean straight A's, in that department. **** Good"

","If the clichés 'love at first sight' and 'true love', don't mean anything to you, don't even bother watching this movie. You'll probably be bored out of your mind and find this movie truly ridiculous. However, for the true believers among us, this movie might be one of the best ever seen.<br/><br/>Sure, the story is sweeter than sweet. We're talking mountains of cotton candy and care bears as far as you can see-sweet here. It's a beautiful story though that will captivate you from the very first second and will bring a smile on your face that's not going to be easy to wipe off.<br/><br/>The movie is about a summer love between two 17 year olds. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) lives in a small town with his father. Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) is a poor, little rich girl as some would say, from the city. Her relationship with her parents is far from good, but she seems to be happy. She spends the summer in a small town. Yes, that's right: the same small town Noah lives in. They first meet at the carnival. The second Noah laid eyes on Allie, he knew he had to have her, so he did everything he could to accomplish that. Of course they fall in love and although their love is an improbable one, the two really appear to be a match made in heaven. Allie's parents however, do not approve. They think she can do so much better than a lowlife who makes barely 40 cents an hour. This is what eventually breaks the two up. Allie is going back to the city, leaving Noah behind.<br/><br/>Of course this is not where the movie ends. They can't seem to forget about each other, but due to unforeseen circumstances (a.k.a Allie's mom), they don't stay in contact. Allie manages to move on and after a few years she gets engaged to Lon (James Marsden). Lon is a good guy who is very much in love with Allie and Allie really seems to be in love with Lon as well. Everything seems to go well, until Allie past starts to haunt her.<br/><br/>What will happen next? Will Allie discover that Noah is the love of her life after all or will she realize that maybe the memories between the two of them are stronger than their love ever was? Will she marry Lon or will she end up with Noah? I'm not going to give you the answer to that, but I can promise you the ending is going to be worth it!<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling very much surprised me. I knew he was an okay actor. I've followed him ever since his appearance on 'Breaker High' and 'Young Hercules'. But I never thought he was this good. He's a great, talented young actor and I can't wait to see more of him. Same goes for Rachel McAdams. She's a wonderful actress.<br/><br/>Last but not least: in this movie I saw something I hadn't seen in quite a while. Not really anyway: On screen chemistry between the two main characters! Ryan and Rachel's chemistry is undeniable and part of this movie's charm.<br/><br/>I give this movie 10/10. Why? It's simply perfect for a sucker for romance as myself!"

","The first half is dreadfully contrived and clichéd and rehashed/generic/typical, blah blah blah. Good, now that the machismo-infused bashing and criticism is out of my system, THIS MOVIE WAS WICKED! I had actually won this movie in a VALENTINE'S DAY contest of all things, this year (2005), and my girlfriend and I watched it a few days later. We actually did cry during the ending (which you may seem coming, but it doesn't really save your tear ducts any work, just kinda warms them up). The cinematography and matteur-en-scene/character proxemics are definitely the high points - Cassevetes has done well in his romantic endeavour. Gosling is surprising. At first, he seemed to have a Ralph Fiennes in ""Maid in Manhattan"" creepy-romantic vibe, but his character is simply earnest to the point of disarming, it's revealed. Anyway, this movie was durn good. If you want to remove the splinters from your eyes, watch this. But be warned: If you're a Tim Allen type, stay the hell away from this movie and don't bash it ostentatiously, while weeping in private."

","My dream would be to have a relationship just like theirs. They got the chance to grow old together and then in the end they died together still loving each other as much as they did the first time they met. It shows that love is a strong emotion and it can do unimaginable things. Their love kept them together so long and it made them die happily side by side. This movie gives hope for those who are in a relationship and know that something is missing; in the end, your soul mate will come back to you, according to this movie. It illustrates the fact that you can fall in love and you can live a happy life even when bad things happen. Noah and Allie were apart for so long, and yet they still ended up being together in the end. They knew for a long time that they were meant for each other, so this movie teaches us to follow our hearts no matter what our family, friends, or society tells us."

I think the movie makers all did Nicholas Sparks' story very well. I will see it over and over again through the years, like An Affair to Remember and The Way We Were. It will definitely stand the test of time like those classics and even though it identifies clearly what time frame the ""younger"" scenes take place, it's really timeless. A story like this could happen today or in the future. The soundtrack is gorgeous and is romantic and relaxing to listen to on CD. I highly recommend this--not just as a 'chick flick' either even though it really is. (What Nicholas Sparks book/movie isn't?)"

Stellar acting and an incredible story make for an all-time great. This is a film that should definitely be in your video library. This film is in my opinion one of the greatest love stories ever told.<br/><br/>On occasion you just do something at the spur of the moment for no real reason. Watching this movie was one of those things for me. I had no idea what the gist of the film was nor did I care.<br/><br/>The story is about a couple of seniors living in a retirement home. The man reads a story to the woman and takes you into the story. You actually feel like you are in the story with them. The transition from seeing him read to her to taking you into the film is so smooth and effortless that you don't even realize it has happened. It is just as natural as breathing air. The story starts out with a couple of kids falling in love. Their parents are opposed to the match and take the girl away. Time goes by and they do their own thing. Her thing is her thing while his thing is living up to the promises he had made to her.<br/><br/>Several years go by and she is getting ready to marry an elite socialite, which pleases her mother to no end. As fate would have it, she sees a picture of her former love in the paper and runs home to see if there is still any ""fire"" left. Of course there is, and what a roaring inferno she has stumbled upon! The old lady in the retirement home has dementia so she can't remember the story from the last time he read it to her. All she knows about it is that she loves hearing him read it to her. To her, the story is ""lovely"" but only vaguely familiar.<br/><br/>********SPOLIER DON'T KEEP READING UNLESS YOU WANT THE SPOILER ********<br/><br/>The story reveals only shortly after you figure out that the seniors are a couple. Not only are they a couple, but they have been married for many years. If you haven't guessed by now, ""The Notebook"" from which the man is reading, is a journal of their long lives together. The story being told is their story.<br/><br/>It is the story of their time together and their time apart; how she forgot him and how he kept her memory alive in his heart and soul.<br/><br/>The man has chosen to live with his wife at the retirement home even though she doesn't remember who he is. Their children and grandchildren visit and she meets ""his"" wonderful son and grandchildren for the ""first"" time again. They want their father to return home and abandon the mother since she can't remember who anyone is. He has vowed to never leave her alone. The nursing staff even tries to quarter them separately but he sneaks back to her bedside whenever he can. As all true lovers would dream of, they pass into eternity in each other's arms while sleeping peacefully."

","i think this film sums up what a love story should be like. It contains all the problems that love faces. It will probably make you cry as it is such a lovely story.

","this is by far the most romantic movie i have ever seen. the love and faith in this movie is amazing. this tearjerker is the perfect movie for a romantic night with your significant other, or a girls night in (just make sure to have plenty of tissues nearby). the love between noah and allie is unmistakable and undeniable. ""the notebook"" makes you laugh, cry, smile, and think about life and all that is worthwhile. it makes you wonder and hope about that person out there in the world that you will fall head over heels in love with - and only wish that your love is half as strong as the love of noah and allie. this romantic drama isn't just a chick flick - it's a movie for all genders and ages. anyone can appreciate this movie. this is a definite a must see!"

","Just looking at the characters and listening to the way they talk gives me a feeling, that the director was really trying to create an image of authenticity about the film. The way they look at each other, the way they talk to each other infers something very natural in the whole process. An excellent and brilliantly produced film which transmits a ""feeling"" otherwise missing in most films today. My daughter, who had first read the book, assures me, that the film is really VERY good in comparison! An attribute which one seldom hears! The film created an atmosphere of reality, transferring us back into the 1940's at the beginning, moving us on to the 50's after the war up into the (almost) present day during the narrations of the wonderful James Garner."

","An elderly man (James Garner) relates a story of forbidden love to an Alzheimer's patient (Gena Rowlands) at a nursing home.<br/><br/>This is a very touching, heartfelt romance. The flashback scenes are very sincere in detailing the love between a poor carpenter and the rich girl whose family owns a summer house in his hometown. I'm a little tired of the rich parents forbidding these romances in movies like this, but beyond that the story is quite good. The real emotional impact comes from the scenes between Garner and Rowlands. They are two wonderful actors and they bring great sincerity to their roles. The direction by Nick Cassavetes is good; he captures the beauty of the South wonderfully."

","There are many reasons why you cry. You can cry because you are so happy that you can't control your emotions anymore; you can cry because someone hurt your feelings in one way or another; you can cry from getting hurt; and you can cry from wishing you were someone else. In the movie, The Notebook, that was why I was cried, because I wished I was Allie. If I wasn't Allie in the movie, then I definitely would want to be the old lady. Despite her disability, the old man seems very devoted to her, and devotion is not a thing that comes along everyday. The movie was sweet in so many ways. It was very long, but because of the constant problems that occur, it felt like it was over as soon as it started. Sometimes love stories over do it and become cheesy. This was not one of those cases. Even though I knew exactly what was going to happen in the movie, because come on let's face it unless you see the movie opening night someone is going to slip, I still found myself crying at parts that weren't even sad. My friends laughed at me after the movie, complaining that I made too much noise, but I thought to myself, crying has never felt so good. Usually after a movie I've cried in I'm sad, but this movie I cried because I was overcome with a good feeling in my heart. I recommend this movie for girls or guys that haven't cried in awhile, because trust me, it will feel good!"

"ty4cubs1","9","0","0","10 August 2004"," A future classic with a very powerful message
","This movie caught my eye before it's release since I am a big fan of Ryan Gosling and Sam Shepard. I figured it would be the common ""girlie relationship movie"", since I have not read the book and I only saw the movie poster. Sure, this movie is somewhat of a ""girlie relationship movie"", but I think that the story is very unique and powerful, and can really make you think about what you really want and care about. I really don't want to get into a summary of the plot and that sort of thing, so if you really want to know what the movie is about, please go see it, or read the novel it is based on. All I can tell you is this movie really can grab you if you allow it to. I really enjoyed watching Gosling and Shepard in this movie, but unfortunately someone else stole the show. Rachel McAdams as Allie. Wow. The idea of this character made me lose my mind. Sure, she did the whole ""play hard to get"" thing in the beginning, but WOW, when she lets her defenses down, the person she turns into was absolutely amazing. You could tell she was head over heels in love, and not with herself. She was completely memorized by another human being that complemented her perfectly, and she did not care how different they were in society's eyes. She loved another with all of her heart, and the one she loved felt the exact same way she did. 3 scenes from this movie really stand out in my mind, and so that I am not ruining the movie for those that have not seen it yet, I will abbreviate: 1. Piano-floor in old house, 2. Wedding dress-newspaper-bathtub scene, and 3. James Garner explaining to his family scene. These 3 scenes are what love should be all about, and nothing less. In conclusion, I don't care if you are a guy or girl, go see this if you haven't yet. It may teach you something in answering this question: Do you follow your heart?"

The story grabs hold of your heart, the dialogue, the actions, the music, everything invades your soul so deep that you can't look away from the screen, and can't leave the theater without a smile and reassurance that love is by far the greatest, most powerful force in the world that can't be challenged."

","This middle aged lady viewed Notebook in a small theatre full of other middle aged ladies munching popcorn and holding tissues to eyes and noses. Afterward, we met in the ladies room for comments and further blubbering. Their reaction was that the movie depicted a love that few have experienced and that evoked deep emotions of either celebration or personal regret. Having said that, my reaction was the same as far as that goes. I have one disappointment, which is my usual disappointment where modern-day movies are concerned. Writers and directors take women from other times and places and bestow upon them a crudeness found in the latter part of the 20th century and first part of the 21st. A well brought up young lady from Charleston (she establishes that she is a virgin) would not unbuckle a boys belt and remove his pants, certainly not on a first meeting. She would not kiss him on a public street. She would not leap into his arms in front of other men.<br/><br/>She may do that in private, but never in public. I do wish the industry would realize that the present day luedness found in young women is not found historically in the better classes. Otherwise, this is a profoundly moving story and if James Garner is not nominated....there is no justice."

","I thought this was a wonderful love story. It was beautifully portrayed and the acting was excellent. However, I would be amiss if I didn't point out how disappointed I was that the movie was not like the book. They left out some very important parts. The fact that Noah went away and worked in NY for 7 years. I thought that would prove how much more of a man Noah was. I felt the movie made him inferior to Lon on purpose. In the book Noah & Lon were even. Noah inherited money from his former boss, but chose to invest it in fixing up the house. And Lon made a lot of money as a lawyer but chose to keep long working hours and not spend the money on Ally. The movie showed Noah as a poor guy that worked at the lumber yard and had very little of anything. I thought this was one vital missing part. Had I not read the book a year ago I probably would have loved the movie just fine, but when you see other sides it's kinda hard to ignore them."

","I generally try to see at least 1 movie every two weeks or so and The Notebook is BY FAR the BEST 1 this year! Not only are the characters believable but James Garner gave the best performance ever in the scene where Allie does not recognize him as her husband. The only thing I didn't like was the pace of the love story seemed a bit rushed at times,esp the scene where Allie goes back to see Noah and the dream house he built. Still, a fabulous movie that left everyone in the theatre in tears the day I saw it! I would see this movie a hundred times! Another scene I thought could have used more time for development was the one where Allie's Mom took her by the site where her former love worked and told her about her past relationship. It would have been nice to have seen Mom actually open up to those feelings more instead of tearfully brushing them aside. The ending was so touching with the scene in the Nursing Home and it caught me off guard a little, I was not expecting them to do that and it definitely captured the heart of the audience. At one point I thought it would be interesting to learn the response of others who are dealing with Alzheimer's or other memory loss disorders and see if they felt the movie approached the subject with authenticity."

","The Notebook--finally a film that captures the meaning of love. The actors were well chosen. James Garner was extremely believable, and the Noah and Allie characters were just right. Since I had not learned their names nor seen them in several movies yet, I was able to lose myself in their story, as though I might be observing the real history of their lives. <br/><br/>Some may say that it is ""sappy"" or ""too sentimental."" Do you not think that the love shared in a home and family has sentimentality? I wonder what you would be looking for in a movie about love, if there were no extremely happy notes, as well as extremely touching moments. <br/><br/>Maybe a younger, unmarried person has not lived long enough to experience some of the trials and sufferings that come with a life-time experience; however, after 32 years of marriage(a happy one, I might add) we have come to realize that the ""heat"" of trials only serves to make the ""iron become steel"" --inseparable.<br/><br/>Our children have entered marriage and see what a more lovely relationship it is than just living together. Without the ""bonds,"" both legal and spiritual, a relationship can go sour overnight and fall apart, with no obligations to either partner, or the children that could be involved. But with the strands of marriage--mutual love, respect, desire for the other's highest good--as well as the ""papers"", the relationship has the strength to tackle those waves of differences, disagreements, and sad times.<br/><br/>My husband and I both tremendously enjoyed our two hours living in their story and re-living our story with Noah and Allie.

The only thing I didn't like about him was his hot temper in the movie as opposed to the calm character in the novel. But I guess it did make for more dramatic scenes in the movie than they would have been if the book had been followed exactly. All of the characters were just like I had imagined them when I read the book. The book was, of course, much better than the movie, but that is always the case when a novel is made into a film. Nicholas Sparks is a genius; he really knows how to tug at your heartstrings! Everything in the story was fabulously romantic and deeply touching.

","Zing go the strings<br/><br/>First I'd like to thank Hollywood for finally telling a story that shows just how much I love my wife, Beverly, of 32 years. This goes as much to explaining the unexplainable as any I've ever seen. I'll skip the story description as many have described it, many without great accuracy. Save to say that it's a love story of young lovers from opposing classes, caught up in world events that help alter their lives. I'll stick to the meat of movie making here and what this has done.<br/><br/>It is apparent that audiences definitely get drawn into the story wholesale. As I left the theater the lobby was full of weeping females, some of which could be heard in the darkness throughout the film. What I really liked here was this great performance by the utterly charming Rachel McAdams as Allie. I saw her not long ago in an almost vapid part in ""Mean Girls"" but here she shines. The girl clearly has talent and I hope now to see more of her. I really fell into her story and it was great fun to watch her on screen. She stole the screen in every scene she was in with her sheer radiance. Of the younger cast she was most watchable on screen followed closely by Kevin Connolly. Of the more experience cast both James Garner as the older Noah and Gena Rowlands as the ailing Allie were stunning in their very believable portrayal of an older couple. I treasure both performances. Maybe James will finally get an Oscar nod.<br/><br/>The screenplay was a bit heavy if one reflected long but it's more pleasurable to buy a little suspension of disbelief and just enjoy it. The locations, scenery, costumes and sets were terrific, I loved it all - with the exception of the hoard of domestic geese foisted off as migratory (there's only so much I can swallow). That scene with them on the lake will be one that lives in my memory for a long time to come. The musical program was good too, not to heavy and just noticeable enough.<br/><br/>What I just could not swallow was the presentation of the Noah Calhoun character by Ryan Gosling. His acting was good, maybe even great. But his presentation got in the way of my enjoying it. With all the trouble to make a period piece, how can Hollywood ignore a central character? He looked like someone straight out of 1985, not 1945. He was way to shaggy haired, especially for the staid post-war South, and a beard, a waxed chest... give me a break! James Marsden was far more authentic looking for the time period but even his hair had too long a trim on the sides. I guess it's a move to try and woo the female attendees of today but it just stank authenticity wise to me.<br/><br/>I'll just stick to watching the captivating McAdams."

I loved this movie, although it pains me to admit it because I normally do not like love story movies (or anything associated with N.Sparks)- I find them unbearably long and dull (and usually can't sit through the whole thing) simply because the only thing going on around them at all times is their all-consuming romantic trials, which get old fast. Somehow though, it works in this movie. Perhaps it is because the leads seem to have a nice chemistry together (the younger and elder) and inspire empathy for their characters. It seemed to have an element of relevance for an older generation (the theater I went to had many older women and I overheard one pair talking about how they remembered when ""I'll be seeing you"" was popular when they were teenagers) showcasing the young lovers to the dealing-with-age elderly couple. Was it obvious? Of course. Does it matter? Not this time. Although normally I'm very cynical, this movie seduced me, I knew I was being taken for a ride, and I enjoyed it. It romanticizes a time when people who were in love were expected to be it for the long haul, end of story. In reality, things in the past were not any more perfect than they are today, but it still is a nice fantasy. Deep down I think we all wish we could find romantic passionate love with someone (our first love no less!) and spend the rest of our lives still enamored with this person. The chances of all of the above happening are not usually very high, so that is where stories/movies like this come in. Although I've read one Nicholas Sparks book and felt sick that I had wasted 2 hours of my life, I'm glad this movie was made. The movie did get a little over the top at the end, there were a few points I thought it could have just ended at. Even so, the costume design might have been worth the ticket price alone. I walked out wanting to be in love and have some killer shoes. Now that is a good movie!<br/><br/>Overall this movie is ** out of ***** on a normal movie scale, but for a romance movie ***** out of *****."

","...have I seen or heard so many people bawl in the last 20 minutes of a movie.  When the credits rolled for this movie, all that was heard over the soft music was sniffling, including my own.  This movie is certainly a tearjerker, mostly due to the performances of James Garner and Gena Rowlands.  If the film were just about young Noah and Allie falling in love, it would seem ho-hum and contrived.  It's not, though.  It doesn't end with them finally getting together.<br/><br/>***SPOILERS HEREIN*** Instead, like the book on which it is based, it ends with a very poignant look at Noah and Allie forty-some years later, when they are both elderly and ill.  The pain that Garner's character feels over his ""sweetheart's"" Alzheimer's is apparent without being hurled at us.  We watch him watching her deteriorate, which is hard to do, but you can't stop watching it because he is so in love with her that it is compelling while at the same time tragic.  The book ends very differently than the movie, and doesn't give away who Allie chose until the very end, when you realize that the older couple and the younger couple are the same.  Still, the ending of the film, while different than the book, is very powerful and is a slightly fantasized version of how strong the bond between spouses can be.  Who cares if this sort of thing doesn't happen often, if at all, in real life?  When Rowlands looks out at a sunset and says ""I've never seen anything more beautiful"" and Garner, looking at her, says ""Neither have I,"" don't we all long for someone to feel that way about us?  The film has its funny points too, especially between the younger couple (""Woman, you kill me!""), which breaks up the tears nicely.  This is a good thing, or else I doubt I would have made it through this one.  Good performances and writing all around-great movie for couples in all stages of love."

","I really thought the casting was great. I really hope to see more of Ryan Gosling, which I remember as the goofy guy from Breaker High, in future roles. I mean even Brad Pitt can't keep his accent straight throughout Troy, yet Ryan did a great job with the Southern accent. I remember seeing Rachel McAdams in Mean Girls, and didn't think much of her, but she's actually quite talented! Great Movie and must see. I definitely went through a box of tissues. I cried throughout reading the book as well. Just absolutely touching! Of course the screenplay was a little different than the original, but I really thought it was amazingly done. I just can't get over how great Ryan portrayed the character and how gutsy he was."

","Maybe ""The Notebook"" is a woman's film but it was a ""two hankie"" type for me and I'm a man! <br/><br/>I'm not as old as the characters. who are about 81 as the film opens. I was nine when Pearl Harbor happened, but I could relate to them, as they are separated by World War II. <br/><br/>The setting is South Carolina but the second unit worked in Montreal (not otherwise identified in the credits)--hence, the cold breath vapors as actors speak their lines in what are not supposed to be cold-weather scenes! But don't let that take away from what is an old-fashioned love story with a different twist at the end."

","This was definitely a really great movie. The plot wasn't all that original, but the way the movie was produced, the script, and the quality acting really pushes it over the edge.<br/><br/>The on screen chemistry between the characters was truly superb. And the setting and time was well portrayed. This movie is a roller coaster of emotions, contains some comedy, but the majority is having you extremely sad, near tears, then extremely happy, near tears again.<br/><br/>
So do i recommend this movie? Yes of course, it is one of those movies that everyone, well everyone who is into the genre of the film, should go and watch. Not something you want to miss out. Cant say anything bad about this movie. I give it a very high rating. Worth every penny."

","This movie has it all. I go to at least 1 sometimes 2 movies a week at the theatre. Gives me something to do here in the middle of Canada where its dry and boring. This movie was so great. I couldn't believe it would touch me in all aspects. It had the right mix of laughter, sadness, love, excitement and everything else all in one. It wasn't sappy through the whole thing, the two characters showed so much about there character that you could actually see them falling in love on screen. By the end of the movie you are so wrapped up in the movie that you want to go back to the theater and see it all over again. I can't believe the movie has only made 43 million. What a shame more people havn't gone to it.<br/><br/>I am a male and I can tell everyone else that this isn't what most refer to as a ""chick flick"". It a movie everyone should see.

","My mother died two years of complications from Alzheimer's, so it's with reluctance that I watched this movie -- but am glad now that I did. This is a love story with Alzheimer's as a reference point, lovingly directed by Nick Cassavetes, whose mother, Gena Rowlands, plays the elder Allie (I think she can prepare her acceptance speech at next year's Academy Awards ceremony). The movie comes ever so close to drifting into parity but I was blown away when Allie and her mother, played by Joan Allen, visited the sawmill and she confessed her feelings for an old flame. I was reminded of an earlier scene that Allie's mother said Noah was nothing but ""trash, trash, trash,"" but we realize later that it wasn't so much Allie, but herself, that she was trying to convince. So, unlike Daisy Buchanan in ""The Great Gatsby,"" Allie Hamilton, a rich girl, marries Noah Calhoun, a poor boy, and the angels in heaven rejoice. Anyone who has lost a loved one to Alzheimer's or just remembers his first love should see this one -- but take along plenty of Kleenex; believe me, you'll need it."

","This movie has more sentiment and is more in touch with the human heart than any movie I have ever seen. It is a beautiful story of two people, torn apart and the struggles to be together. The chemistry between the actors is what ties this movie together. It is like you are really there watching these people really fall in love. It shows how love is timeless, and unconditional. It also doesn't have major conflict which can be distracting. It shows how sometimes in life we must make the choice right by our hearts and not right by others standards. Best movie this year by far. Would nominate it for best picture. I recommend this movie to everyone, and plan to see it again in before I buy it on DVD."

"laurinn","10","0","0","13 July 2004"," An amazing story brought to life beautifully on screen!
","I cannot say enough about this movie. At a time where so many people are looking to see a film that lets their imagination take them away from reality, and venture into a fantasy world of super heroes and villains, this has really stepped in and exemplified the beauty of something so simple yet so complicated as love. I have never seen a romantic film that has had the ability to portray such feelings and emotions as this has. It's got it all; comedy, romance, and tragedy. Sure there aren't scenes of extreme violence, nor are there any amazing special effects. Though this does not fit into what seems to be the ever growing popularity of Sci-Fi, violent, suspenseful, or slap stick comedy movies out right now... it does find a place in people's hearts. I believe that while some may consider this to be ""just another cheesy romance"", it slips past that clichÃ©' and brings forth realism. The bottom line of this movie is that you do struggle with love, it isn't easy but it does exist. You live, you love, you die. Everyone has a different story... and in this one the characters found true love in one another, had conflicts, and in the end their commitment was everlasting. There should be more movies out there that make you feel as good as this one does. This film can inspire you if you let it... and I suggest that you do."

","This may be the best movie I  have seen in 30 years. The things I liked about it<br/><br/>1. Gena Rowlands and James Garner were masterful. They exuded true chemistry, and they were able to bring out the emotion of the story without being maudling and without being manipulative. I believe that they are shoo-ins for nominations for academy awards. He modeled tenderness and love in a way that I hope husbands of aging wives will learn from.<br/><br/>2. I liked the fact that Lon was not one dimensional. He loved Allie enough to let her go.<br/><br/>3. I liked the way that Allie's mother was able to show her that she understood the difficult choice Allie had to make between Noah and Lon. She admitted her mistake about not being honest with Allie when she presented the letters.<br/><br/>Questions left unanswered:<br/><br/>1. Did Noah work in the lumber mill for the rest of his life? I doubt he could have provided like he did in such a job. Would liked to have known his occupation.<br/><br/>2. What happened to Noah's mother?<br/><br/>One thing I did not like.<br/><br/>1. I appreciated that there was no nudity (no, I am not an old fogey). But can we not understand that characters in movies are having sexual encounters with having to feel like voyeurs. When Rhett grabbed Scarlet and carried her up the stairs we knew what was going on without full graphics. Can we go back to panning the cameras to the shadows or the moon.<br/><br/>Even so this is a great movie - should become a classic. I give it a 10.<br/><br/>Andy Smith"

Not only did the Notebook meet my expectations, they exceeded them. While watching the movie I experienced so many emotions. Joy, sadness, anger; it truly tugged on my heartstrings.<br/><br/>The Acting was so well done, I truly believed that Rachel Mcadams (Allie) and Ryan Gosling (Noah) were a couple. The chemistry was definitely there. It was also so wonderful to see James Garner again, he is such a great actor, he makes it look so easy. And last but not least Gena Rowlands. I don't think I could have picked a better actor for her role.<br/><br/>Everything was breathtaking, the visuals, the score, the direction, the acting.

","All right. I admit, it was a tearjerker and it was sweeet...but hardly. My friend, who I'd seen the movie with, kept going on and on about how sad it was. And, it was. But, compared to the book by Nicholas Sparks, the movie was not a must see. The book made EVERYTHING more romantic and involved. The movie-was just another wannabe love story. If there had been no book, the movie and it's story would have been excellent, but since it was supposed to be the book, it was not so good...In fact, they should have called the movie, ""Something Like the Notebook"". I think you should read the book instead of seeing the movie. I think the movie would have been better if it had just tried a little harder to follow the book and make a more romantic setting...but everyone who saw the movie and didn't read the book probably thinks I'm nuts! but I'm not.

","Great. Juuuuuuust great. All the years of strutting around and acting macho in front of my friends is about to come crashing down thanks to a 2-hour movie. Mr. Shade, Baker's Dozen, Walker, Carlson ... I ... I'm sorry. I'm sorry guys, but I liked this movie.<br/><br/>I know many guys will never admit to enjoying a movie like this. I'm pretty sure Johnny Betts circa 1993 would've denied it. Admittedly, there are elements of sappiness that would send the cockiest of the peacocks running for the hills. There's soft piano. There are sunsets. There are birds flying in slow motion. There's dancing in the street with no music. And yes, the leads act a little silly at times.<br/><br/>But come on, what guy hasn't acted silly before when he's in love? I'm man enough to admit that Stephanie and I have done some fairly silly stuff in the name of love. No, you don't need to hear any examples. I especially will NOT talk about any dance routines to Kid Rock's ""Cowboy."" *ahem*<br/><br/>As much as guys may try to deny it, love will change you. I think the moment I knew my life had changed forever was when I let Stephanie talk me into seeing ""A Walk in the Clouds."" I kept thinking to myself, ""I can't believe I'm watching a love story starring KEANU REEVES! This is it. There's no going back. How do I hide this from my friends?"" It took my system a while to recover from the shock of seeing a movie that didn't contain Bruce Willis or Sylvester Stallone spitting out one-liners, but I've since been conditioned to handle a straightforward romantic movie every now and then.<br/><br/>And you better believe I have friends who still give me a hard time. ""Sheesh, you saw another Matthew McConaughey/Josh Lucas movie? When did you have the operation?"" I always try to excuse myself by saying the movie was free or I did it all for Stephanie, but it all falls on deaf ears. Ah well, back to the movie...<br/><br/>This is pretty standard stuff as far as love stories go. Two kids on the opposite sides of the tracks fall desperately in love. Life's obstacles split them apart. The wealthy, refined gal meets and gets engaged to an equally wealthy, refined, dashing young man, while the not-so-wealthy, gotta-work-for-everything-he's-got guy sets out to prove to the girl that he can make something of himself. The two cross paths again one day, and the girl must decide who to choose. Sounds a LOT like ""Sweet Home Alabama,"" except this is a Romantic Drama whereas the former is a Romantic Comedy. There was even a wainchy mother thrown into the proceedings.<br/><br/>So no, this isn't the most original and unpredictable movie to ever grace the screen. Before the movie started, I wrote down exactly what I thought was going to happen. You know what? I nailed it. But here's the important part - that didn't ruin the experience at all. Even though I had a preconceived idea of how everything would turn out, the story is told in such a way that I was more interested in *how* we'd get to the conclusion than in whether or not the conclusion would be as expected. However, there were a couple of times when I had doubts about my theory, and the very end is a little unexpected.<br/><br/>The real selling point of ""The Notebook"" is the cast. Everybody does a great job. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are really, really good as the leads, and the two of them kept me fully interested in what I was watching. In a movie world full of pretty boys (you can keep Leonardo DiCaprio), Gosling's a breath of fresh air as just a regular guy who you can't help but root for. And McAdam's is very charming as the Southern belle. Easy on the eyes, that gal is. I really bought into their relationship. I'll even go so far as to say they displayed the most chemistry in a couple that I've seen in a long time. Yep, even moreso than Hellboy and Selma Blair. I know, it sure blew me away as well.<br/><br/>I also liked James Marsden's (aka Cyclops) character. I was hoping he'd be a big jerk thus making it a no-brainer who McAdams should be with, but he's actually a pretty good guy, and he doesn't really give you a reason to hate him. And Sam Shepard is very funny as Gosling's father. I just wish he'd had a little more screen time.<br/><br/>I need to point out that James Garner and Gena Rowlands play big secondary roles. You see, the story is being told by Garner as he reads it to Rowlands. So the main story is actually a collection of flashbacks. What is the relationship between Garner and Rowlands? Well, I'm not gonna spoil anything for you.<br/><br/>Garner and Rowlands do good jobs (although I pray I never have to see Garner in a wife-beater shirt again), but I was more interested in the relationship between Gosling and McAdams. In fact, I probably would've given this movie 4 marks, but I was a little disappointed in the last 10 or 15 minutes. The story completely shifts focus to the older folks, and we never see the youngsters again. I really would've loved one more flashback, but oh well. Warning: The very end will probably have a LOT of you reaching for the Kleenex. Pretty touching stuff, but it might not send you home tapping your toes.<br/><br/>Now if you'll excuse me, I've got something I've gotta go sew back on. After all, I've got a reputation to protect.<br/><br/>Rating: 3.5 (out of 5)"

I honestly didn't think I could see him playing the romantic type! He is a very versatile actor with great talent. My favorite parts were definitely when they danced together in the road and when he tells her that he wrote to her every day (in the rain).

I think this film is very true to what they are saying. i honestly think the notebook should be #1 instead of #6 on the box office chart. i know most people don't approve of this movie because it is too much of a love story for them, but we all like it! so what the heck matters! The end was sweet but also sad i cried throughout the movie, i probably even cried in parts that werent sad because i was thinking about the parts that were sad! and let me add that Ryan Gosling is VERY VERY VERY VERY handsome! and Rachel is a very talented actress!! well anyway anyone that knows where this movie is filmed answer right away!!"

","Some people drink, others jump out of airplanes I go to the movies to escape. I'm 24 and I absolutely loved this film, I haven't liked a movie this much since Titanic. I initially intended to see it but was late to the theater and saw Dodge Ball instead. Being the disappointment that was hopped on over to Notebook. I was the only guy there initially until other two others showed up with their girl friends. I'm sure the two mothers behind me with their teenaged daughters wondered where my girl friend was and when no one showed up wondered if I was playing for the 'other team.' I'm definitely not but I'm a sucker for feasible story lines and period films, and this one totally rocked. Rachel McAdams, whom I never noticed in Mean Girls or The Hot Chick, was absolutely beautiful in this movie, my goodness!

","The Notebook is the most touching and heart-wrenching movie I have ever seen. The story of Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson is a story of true love that is torn apart by differences only to be rekindled after seven years of separation. This is the best movie I have ever seen. Period. If you do not cry even once throughout this movie, then you must not have a heart. I loved everything about this movie. It was poignant and sometimes funny and should not be missed. Ryan Gosling was excellent at portraying Young Noah Calhoun. He is a great actor and when I came out of the theaters, I ran to buy the book. I love this movie so much that I am going back to see it this weekend. Go see this movie. It really is the best movie ever."

Needless to say, I cried during the movie. They did a wonderful job on this adaptation. The actors brought these characters to life .. and the scenery was fantastic. The scene w/ the swans .. WOW. The house was exactly as I pictured it.<br/><br/>If you are thinking this is a ""chick flick"" .. maybe so, however I brought my fiancée and thought he would laugh at my crying. When the credits rolled, I looked over and HE was crying!

","This was a very good and classically modern story. It was one of those real love stories. Predictable, but still had parts that would catch you off-guard. Such as the part of Noah finding a woman but didn't see her the same as he did Allie. Or the part of Allie in the ""big piece of crap"" and her asking Noah if he promised to make a big white house with blue shutters and a balcony. And he did it for her. She spoke and he listened. Now where can you find a man like that? It's very hard. This story is the love story of the year and I encourage everyone to go and see it.

","To start off...if anyone hasn't seen this movie already, go see it. I know it would be considered a 'chick flick' to many people, but it really is a heart warming new film. When I first went to see it, my friends and I didn't know what to expect, except that Ryan Gosling (my ultimate crush) would be in it. After the film...we all just sat there wanting more. The movie portrays a love that carries out through the movie that really is like a fairytale. McAdams and Gosling have a serious bond that makes everyone just fall in love with their love. At the end of the movie, pretty much every woman in the theatre were sniffling or still crying (including myself). I am hoping to see it again this weekend. I saw it about 8 days ago and i cant stop thinking about it. I'm hoping to order the book soon, and I've read about every interview I could find on the internet with the actors/actresses.

","I'm a cynic, plain and simple. But even the cynic in me stopped to enjoy the simple plot that drives this movie. I won't tell you to see it or not, and I certainly won't demand that you avoid it like some others have. If you want to see a film that makes you cry, and laugh, and cry, and smile, and cry, and suffer occasional bouts of disbelief, then this would be a good option. Ryan Gosling was understated and sweet as Noah, Rachel McAdams was luminous and believable as Allie, Gena Rowlands and James Garner were Gena Rowlands and James Garner. The scenery was breathtaking, the cinematography was stunning, and so what if it perpetuates the idea that there's ""the one"" for everyone. Maybe there is. As cynical and jaded as I am as a single by choice 40 something, I am able to watch something that celebrates love without becoming bitter like the reviewer who stated ""I'd rather put out a cigarette in my eye than to watch this again.

But it's like that slow paced book that you trudge through only to find out ""who did it at the end."" I wasn't satisfied by the ending. Otherwise, the cinematography is gorgeous. I love historical movies, but this one didn't have a lot of period sets.

","I am now obsessed with this movie...unbelievable. The acting was insane- it was SO GREAT! The chemistry between the characters was incredibly intense, and I found myself falling in love with them both. The characters had a lot of depth, making the love story all the more resonating. I hate to think that this film could be characterized as a ""chick flick."" Yes, it is a love story, but Noah is a ""man's man"", albeit one with an intense passion for his first true love (something I would hope most men could relate to). Not to get preachy, but this film left me with a sort of sadness for the present era of ""wham bam thank you ma'm"" culture we live in. I pine for a time when it was considered ""normal"" to actually get to know the one you will sleep with-thus, allowing people to actually fall in love on a *variety* of levels (and allowing the immense respect to build as it did with these characters). <br/><br/>I so love the relationship between Noah and Allie. I am happily single, and would live quite contently to live as a free bachelorette. I won't compromise myself by getting into a relationship where the commitment to love and respect one another is anything less than 100%. I'd be much happier single. To all of those in my position I say set this film up as your model of what a relationship should be-don't settle for anything less. Yes, it is a work of fiction but it is based on a real couple (the author's wife's parents), and it could be based on my grandparent's/aunt and uncle's relationship. In other words, it is not an unrealistic goal to set up for yourself. Okay, I have rambled long enough but, in closing, let me just say that this movie does what only the most legendary films are capable of doing-it stays with you and causes you to internalize it for use in the betterment of your own life. Love, love, LOVE IT!!!!!!!"

","For anyone who may remember the Coca-Cola Young Filmmaker trailers that used to run before movies, flash back to the one in which all the women exit the theatre sobbing and wailing, and then the men all go to the men's bathroom and the scene inside is of all the formerly stoic men weeping copiously and comforting each other. <br/><br/>I can't speak for the men's room, but after The Notebook, there were no less than six women in the ladies' room passing each other paper towels and crying. <br/><br/>It's purely amazing, the variety of sounds people make clearing their nasal passages in sad movies. <br/><br/>That said, The Notebook isn't necessarily a great movie; at times it's far too over-invested in either its own cuteness, or worse yet, wallowing in histrionics. (The only person in this whole movie who maintains the ability to cry with dignity is the always amazing, arctic Joan Allen.) It has a few young director flaws (Hey, Mom, look at me!) the most prevalent being the camera stays on the women at the expense of the men; there's a very lovely scene between Ryan Gosling and Rachael McAdams in which poor Ryan Gosling is lit like Dracula and seen only from the side. Unless he couldn't stop laughing, I'd have liked to see his face, too. <br/><br/>The story is simple, and there's only one explosion. It's a gentle, loving movie, and a true oasis in a summer of whizbang special effects. There's more genuine emotion and chemistry between all FOUR of the leads than in any other movie so far this summer- and I include Dunst and Maguire in that list. <br/><br/>It's a good watch, and a good ""sad"" time.

Nicholas Sparks is a great writer, and the I didn't the movie would do it the book justice, but it was nice. The one thing that really turned me off was the interruptions of the present-day couple. I think it would have been better if the story wasn't interrupted because, it kind of brings you back to reality and it doesn't... flow. But, I did like the ending, so it wasn't so bad.

Most of the people I talked to could relate on some level to the characters and their relationships with either each other or their parents. However, to enjoy the movie you really have to be in the mood for one of those sappy-romantic type movies. Most people seemed to enjoy it though. I don't think there was a dry eye in the theatre, including all the teenage guys sitting around me.

","The Notebook is a film that all married couples should see -- TOGETHER. <br/><br/>I would even recommend it for couples contemplating marriage or in (what they believe to be) a serious relationship. The outcome would certainly be a challenge to their level of commitment.<br/><br/>The Notebook has lots of glitz and glitter from the past, steeped in southern 1940s traditions and class distinctions. It also portrays a potent conflict in human relationships that challenges the characters. The motives in THAT story are noble and difficult to resolve. But beyond the wonderful story of young love and the marvelous cinematography is a story of the triumph of a love of higher purity. <br/><br/>The story, as read by James Garner to Gena Rowlands and portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams is the centerpiece of a deeper message of the passion that transcends time and the temporary circumstance of youth. This story soars to a greater truth of devotion and refusal to quietly accept the futility that Alzheimer's or dementia usually becomes. <br/><br/>As a determined Garner points out to a young doctor: ""There is a point at which science ends and God begins."" This motion picture tells that story of what ""real love"" is all about. Thank you Nick Cassavetes for a wonderful story well told!"

","Having gone through the struggle of advanced dementia with my mother-in-law and seeing a strong, independent, woman lose her mental faculties before her death at 91, I was intrigued and drawn to see this movie. It has its flaws, but it is a wonderfully romantic story of truly committed, special, and long lasting love. It speaks of love in the good times and in the tough times. I fell in love with the character played so delightfully and with such energy by young Pamela McAdams as she reminded me so of my wife of 46 years as a young woman. My mother-in-law was a very high spirited and beautiful young woman of the late 1920s and early '30s. So, for me, the transition to the Gena Rowlands character was easy to follow and the struggles she had so paralleled the experience of my mother-in-law who ended up in a similar facility. I want to be the kind of husband James Garner portrayed as he supported and loved his wife in her time of confusion and aloneness. The window that opened before she withdrew so suddenly from him was real, one we experienced. The person loses contact, but windows open that are amazing and then suddenly close. Yes, her dementia was probably beyond those windows, but still it gave us a glimpse of the reality of this situation. That scene where Garner struggled with her rejection and disappearance from the present was breathtaking. He was wonderful. And yes, Rowlands looked a bit too good for reality, but she is a wonderful actress and I could get by that. The ending was totally fanciful and I would have preferred to have seen it closer to the reality of life. But, I cried a lot in this film as I so identified with Garner's character realizing I or my wife could face this in a few years. It was a very special demonstration of the love marriage calls us to at any age, walking through the struggles together in committed and loving relationship. I highly recommend the movie, but bring the Kleenex."

The house transformation was totally unreal: nothing could be salvaged from that wreck.  Rachel McAdams (Allie) was all right, annoying at times.  Why didn't her nylon stockings have seams?  Her father appeared clownish.  ""Lon"" was on a Lifetime presentation which portrayed him as evil so I could not see him in any other way.  <br/><br/>My biggest problem is with the casting of James Garner and of Gena Rowlands, both excellent actors.  In this film, however, they were not the characters. They were James Garner and Gena Rowlands.  Some unknowns would have been better in these roles.<br/><br/>What was wrong with Edmond?  Did the novel reveal his problem?  He looked strange in the glimpse we got of him.<br/><br/>Too much time was given to their youth, and the rest just was not developed. I realize time constraints.  Why was all that time given to that street scene?  The Walt Whitman allusions seemed trite, too easy as a connection. Was the renovated house the nursing home?  And when she fed the ducks, why did they not overpower her and Noah?<br/><br/>To the writer who questioned salons in nursing homes:  many places do have beauty shoppes within for the residents' use.<br/><br/>An okay film."

","I went to see this movie last night, with my mother-in-law, sister-in-law and my 13 year old daughter. I expected it to be a typical love story. What we saw turned out to be much more! The underlying story line of dementia was so emotional. I felt like I was re-living my Grandma's last 6 months all over again. I knew my Grandpa had a hard time with Grandma not remembering who he was, but this movie really showed just how painful it really was. The ""sex scenes"", although nothing detailed is shown, was uncomfortable with my 13 year old seeing it. Good opportunity to remind her to wait until she is married."

","If people say that they don't make good romantic films anymore they obviously haven't seen The Notebook. With terrific acting talents and a brilliant director this movie is a cinematic triumph in an age of trashy comedies and over hyped action movies. Where most films have to try hard to differentiate themselves from the rest of the pack, the Notebook (on its own merit) stands out and gives people an actual story and plot that pulls you in and makes you feel ever emotion. Even as I sat in the theater I don't think I saw a single dry eye by the end of the movie. Everyone from teenage girls to the elderly were feeling the romantic emotions of The Notebook."

","This movie was a fantastic movie that showed how some relationships turn out. They fight one minute and the next they are in love with each other again. This movie shows how every girl wants to end up, in love with the one that loves her the most and will take care of her without no money involved. Nicholas Sparks is a great author and most of his books come out appealing to all readers. It shows that he is a nice guy that could possibly have seen or been through what he wrote. The director did an excellent job. This film is a movie that most women are going to look forward to on DVD. This film makes you cry, be happy, and even wonder if there are any guys like ""Noah"" out there. I loved this movie and I gave it a 10."

","I have to say that the second I saw the previews for it, I had to go out and see it. I will admit, I am that sappy girl who cries at just about every movie ever made and who loves a good romance, but this one was more than just a romance. It was a story of how true love never dies, no matter what the circumstances are.<br/><br/>I bought the book when I heard that this movie was coming out and I read it in two days. I couldn't put it down. I finally got to see the movie today and let me tell you, it did nothing to diminish what the book made for me. Most of the time, when a movie is made from a book, the movie follows nothing in the book. But this movie does. The story line, while somewhat different, is very much the same. I want to seriously say how amazing Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, and the rest of the cast did, bringing these characters to life.<br/><br/>If I were you, I would run out and see this movie right now with that special someone."

I thought I wouldn't be able to pay attention, b/c I'd be looking for myself throughout, but I actually missed myself because I was so wrapped up in the story. They did an amazing job adapting the book--one of the best book adaptations I've ever seen.<br/><br/>The chemistry between McAdams and Gosling is amazing, and they both brought a really natural charisma to their characters---I didn't see much overacting at all (although I thought their ""accents"" were a little iffy at times). I also liked that there was light humor throughout, breaking it up a bit. <br/><br/>The ending, as everyone says, was a tearjerker, for sure, and it probably could have ended without the 2nd ending/fadeout, so to speak. I went two times, and both times, the theatre was sold out and full of sniffles at the end of the film. <br/><br/>Anyway, really, they did a stunning job adapting the film, it looks great, and it pulls you right in.

","The only thing that disappointed me was the fact that I sobbed through this movie and didn't have a tissue! This movie was just lovely from the actors' performances to the romantic love story of two people, Allie and Noah. This movie is more of a drama and it shows the affects of age and disease with Gena Rowlands Alzheimer's. <br/><br/>The story starts where a man (James Garner) visits a woman (Gena Rowlands) daily in a nursing home. There he reads her the beautiful story of two people Noah and Allie and how they fall in love. Troubled that their daughter will marry 'trash', Allies parents take her away from Noah after one summer of love. There lives continue and Allie falls in love with Lon Hammond (James Marsden) and gets engaged. When she sees Noah's picture in the paper, she goes to see him and they realize they are still in love with one another. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect in the roles of the two young lovers. Usually their characters are much darker. (McAdams in Mean Girls and Gosling in Murder by Numbers) But they hit the spot perfectly. Gena Rowlands and James Garner were the true hit of the movie and the ending scene was done beautifully between them. <br/><br/>At the end of this movie, there was not one dry eye in the entire theatre. The ending is sentimental and makes you think of your first love all over again. I recommend this movie to everyone...this is not a 'chick-flick.' It is a powerful drama that will make you think about who you want to spend your life with and what you wand out of life."
"BrunetteBetty","Null","0","0","29 June 2004"," ""The Notebook"" at it's best
","I really enjoyed this film, it was beautifully done and even though the book is always better.. in this case, I think they are pretty even. I found some things wrong with the film in relation to the novel that was probably just changed for flow, but they were only minor details. I enjoyed the flashbacks the best, with Ryan Gosling and Rachel MacAdams as Young Noah and Allie and I wish they had involved that part of the story more so in the movie other than the nursing home scenes. In the novel, the two time periods are intertwined, but the flashbacks play a larger role than the depressing aspect of Noah trying to deal with Allie, now overcome by Altzeimers decease. I just didn't think that James Garner and Gena Rowlands, who played the aged Noah and Allie Calhoun, had much chemistry together and that their scenes together were more forced than anything. I loved the scenes between Gosling and MacAdams, mostly because of their chemistry and being a fan of the novel, to me they embodied the two characters. I just loved this film and though many people complain about the involvement of the older Noah and Allie characters, it's essential to the story because without that part of the story, the reader (or in this case, the watcher) never gets a feel for how strong their love is. Great novel, great movie. I'd recommend it to anyone who's in the mood for a great love story or a good cry. Either way, it won't disappoint."

","I must admit, after having read the book twice, I was a bit doubtful that the movie could do it justice. I was not at all disappointed in it though. It was an excellent movie. You see the characters, not the actors portraying them. I do not think there was a dry eye in the place last night when we saw it. It is on my list to purchase as soon as it comes out on DVD.<br/><br/>The casting is excellent, as I cannot picture anyone else portraying any of these characters now. Costuming was awesome. I definitely recommend this one to anyone who likes a good love story. Being a fan of the author, I look forward to anything else they put to the big screen. <br/><br/>It is hard to put into words, but the movie was just as it should have been. There was never a moment in this movie that was used as a time filler. The interweaving of present day and past was an integral part of the story and it was done very effectively. <br/><br/>I highly suggest you see this one!"

","So you know where this is coming from: I'm a white collar, educated type who lives the basics of beer and (American) football as well as good wine and Shakespere... on the lower cusp of middle age, who spends more time listening to ESPN Radio and playing softball, volleyball, and (in the) gym than parked in front of the TV or nose in a book (although I always have a couple of books in progress). That should do...<br/><br/>Having not read Sparks book (and I acknowledge that the book is always better than the movie) I can honestly say that I would NEVER have seen this movie if not dragged there by my other half. Sparks is her favorite author, and the Notebook, apparently, her favorite novel of the many he has spawned. Nor is this the first Sparks adaptation I have been forced to watch... even the supreme talent of one of my favorite actors (and human beings) Paul Newman could not save the awful Message In Bottle (Costner's horrible acting does a lot to cancel Newman's effect). I digress...<br/><br/>I have often been a fan of framed stories. When well done, it can add complexity and mystery to a flat subject like the basic romance, which as a guy, I have felt like I have been exposed to the same awful tripe 100 times too many (see any movie with J. Lo. in it <wretch>). Sparks and Cassevetes accomplish this, heightening your curiosity and raising a level of suspense not found in most tearjerkers. Without the frame, The Notebook would have been boring and predictable. With the talent of James Garner (who I would give a nod to for Best Supporting Actor for his work in this film) narrating the reading of the inner story and acting the frame, everything changes. I was thoroughly engaged in the timeline from here to there and back, cared about the characters, and despite my manliest effort, could not fight back the tears in the end. Even the tough looking African American marine sitting next to me was wiping at his eyes during Garner's incredibly powerful scene with Rowlands as she recovers her memory for a few moments before falling back into the abyss of (Alzheimer's?). <br/><br/>And of course, the ending, which I understand was changed substantially from the book... there was not a dry eye in the sold out theater. Only a goofy sob from a female member of the crowd was able to change the moment enough for me to wipe away the tears and have a chuckle.<br/><br/>If I can find the time, which I doubt, I may pluck the book off a the shelf at home and give it a try. I recommend any movie to others that has enough of an effect on me to still be thinking about it 24 hours later.<br/><br/>Guys, take your woman. She will be incredibly emotional and the movie is eminently watchable. If you have a heart at all, you will have to go to great lengths to keep the moisture from leaking out of your head."
"soundtracks","10","0","0","29 June 2004"," Most Romantic Movie of the Year - maybe Decade
","I saw this movie TWICE before it was even released. I saw it at a sneak preview on June 12 and then I loved it so much that I went back to another sneak screening on the 22nd. Everything about this movie is wonderful.<br/><br/>The movie is based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. It's the story of a couple (Noah & Allie) who meet when they are teenagers and fall in love and have a summer romance. Different backgrounds tear them apart from each other but they never forget each other. Reunited after 8 years, they must decide if their love is still there or if Allie should go ahead and marry her fiancé, Lon. The story of the young lovers is being told by an older gentleman as he reads the story to Allie. Allie is suffering from Alzheimer's and Duke reads her the story to help her remember the love she had when she was younger.<br/><br/>First off, the cinematography of this movie is simply breathtaking. Some of the scenery is just absolutely beautiful. The scene with all the swans (as you see in the trailer) is just amazing. It's so romantic and helps you feel the romance of the movie.<br/><br/>Secondly, the music makes you feel the emotions. I now have the soundtrack and while I don't normally like soundtracks that are mostly ""scores"", I find myself reliving scenes in my head when I hear the music. It makes me remember how emotional the scene was - in part because of the emotional music.<br/><br/>Then of course, I have to mention the acting. James Garner and Gena Rowlands were amazing. They bring such emotion to the characters. You really feel for them and you can feel the love that Duke (James Garner) has for Allie (Gena Rowlands). Then there is the young lovers portrayed by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Both of them are stars that we have not seen the last of yet. They were both amazing. The rest of the cast (Joan Allen, Sam Shepherd, James Marsden, and Kevin Connolly) were all outstanding support.<br/><br/>This was a feel good movie. While there was conflict amongst the characters, there was also deep emotion and love there as well.<br/><br/>10 stars! Go see this movie!"
"ChandaACR","10","0","0","29 June 2004"," A few comments *spoilers may be included*
","Okay, I've read almost all of the Nicholas Sparks books and this one was one of my favorites. I was very much looking forward to the movie and got a chance to see it finally with a few friends. This is an incredible love story and we can all hope to have a love like that in our own lives. I was a bit bothered by how much was altered from the book as some of it just didn't seem to flow as well as I'd hoped. Maybe I've forgotten, but I do not recall Allie being a nurse's aide in the book as she was in the movie. It was an interesting plot twist that introduced us to Lon, however. There were several other discrepancies, but this is one that greatly sticks out in my mind. The one that bothers me the MOST though is the ending. It totally ruined it for making the sequel book, The Wedding, into a movie as well since Noah and Allie both pass away in the end of the movie. It still moved me to tears along with the rest of the theater and I still recommend seeing it. I will advise you read the book first, though."
"sparta2012","10","0","0","28 June 2004"," Breathtaking! Still on my mind.
","This movie is just one of those types of films that when you tell someone about it its hard to put into words the effect it had on you. I found myself thinking about it the rest of the weekend and obviously today as well. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were perfection for the younger leads. They have an incredible amount of chemistry (and charisma) and in some ways their love is just simple, beautiful, and fun. It doesn't take long for you to start caring about these two wonderful people and just enjoy watching this romance bloom into a marvelous love story that never ever becomes boring. This story will take you back to a time when you were young and carefree and make you wish you could (or will) feel that happy and so full of absolute elation again. It will either make you long for those days again or look forward to those days if you haven't yet experienced your first true and real love. I suppose in some ways (if I were one of those cynical critics), if one must be a critic then perhaps the story it is alittle cliché (as one critic stated in a review I read) and saccharine sweet. But, you know, when I am in the mood for a good romance story... that's exactly what I do want! I want to get so involved and invested in the romance and the characters. I want it to be sweet and gooey and even borderline unrealistic almost. I want it to make me believe that a love like that is not entirely impossible or even improbable,but very real. When I walk out of the theater and I feel truly moved and touched then, to me, its a great film and this film did just that for me and will probably for anyone...almost anyone. <br/><br/>The cinematography is just glorious and the soundtrack is so smooth and lovely and just brings out the beauty of the story. Everything works here into one fantastic and eloquent package. Ryan Gosling plays Noah so perfectly and somewhat understated and Rachel McAdams is just ..a vision...well she just jumps out off screen. I think we will be seeing allot more of both of them. There isn't much pretense here either. I do get tired of the whole ""not bring them together till late in the film and make them hate each other at first and gradually figure out how they feel"" type mumbo jumbo we are so use to getting in so many love stories. Here you just watch them enjoy each other, have fun, and fall in love until they hit a couple of snags (which any couple would). You are always rooting for them and always smiling watching them. They almost make you experience it while they are. As much as I have great respect for Gena Rowlands (she is a wonderful accomplished actress) and James Garner when they would flash back to their storyline I was aching for the younger Allie and Noah to come back. But , nonetheless, their presence did add much to the film I have to say. <br/><br/>If I have any grievance at all with the movie it was that (SPOILER POSSIBLY) near the end I really wanted to see just a hint of their life together after Allie makes her choice of Noah (which you pretty much knew would happen)... a wedding picture, them having dinner together with their young children, something, but, it wasn't to be.Its a beautiful, breathtaking, touching movie...the acting is wonderful and powerful. This story completely and absolutely tugs at your heart and I can honestly say this is a well crafted/well acted love story..one I will always remember."

","What a pleasure to see a such a touching and sincere story in the midst of a summer full of special FX and comic strip characters! <br/><br/>The Notebook follows the story of 2 lovers from beginning to end. It was lovely to see two romantic leads (Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton, and Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun) portray the journey of innocent young love to passionate love reuniting. Seldom in Hollywood do we see 2 romantic leads that have so much chemistry between them! The slightest look from Noah or Allie could put a huge smile on my face. <br/><br/>Yes, the movie is cliché, but what romantic movie isn't? This is by far one of the best, if not the best, romance movie that i've seen. The acting is superb (not only by Gosling and McAdams, but in supporting roles like James Garner, Gena Rowlands and Joan Allen) the scenery is beautiful, and (as I mentioned before) the chemistry between Rachel and Ryan is AMAZING. I didn't feel like I was watching two actors portraying Noah and Allie, I felt like I was watching THE Noah and Allie. Expect very marvelous things from Rachel McAdams in the near future! <br/><br/>Overall, a very moving and beautiful love story that has not come to the silver screen in a VERY long time.

","First, let me note that I have seen many reviews labeling this as a `chick flick'.  And while it is a romantic drama, let me dispel the stereotype by classifying that I am a straight male, mid-thirties, who was absolutely taken in by this movie.<br/><br/>This is as good as romantic dramas get.  It is passionate, it is deep, and the story is captivating.  I would liken the romance of this movie to be on the same level of Titanic and Pearl Harbor, yet the plot may fall closer to Sweet Home Alabama (although not as much a comedy).  For the guys who didn't like any of those movies, you may want to skip this one as well. But for the rest of us with a soft sentimental side, this is a must-see. While it didn't actually bring me to tears (as many of the reviews suggest) it will be a movie that I will purchase when it is released for buying.<br/><br/>One quick note:  Many of the reviews on IMDB have suggested that the character was suffering from Alzheimer's.  However, this is not the case. She was diagnosed with Dementia, which is not the same medical condition.<br/><br/>I'd give it at least a 9 out of 10."

""The Notebook"" is a movie that can make you go through every emotion possible..you cry, you laugh, your happy for the people and at the end you feel as if you knew Allie and Noah and were with them the entire adventure through love, lost and the adventure of finding the one you cant live without.

There is so much chemistry between the film's two young stars (Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams), that you forget that they are not real life lovers. These two have bright futures ahead of them. Even for people who are not hopeless romantics (myself included), it would be difficult to watch this movie without truly caring what happens to everyone and how it will all end.

","While the story of young love (Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams) is full of passion, it is the true, deep, and mature love between the older couple (James Garner, Gena Rowlands) that strikes the heart at its core. Gena Rowlands plays a woman who is losing her mind to Alzheimer's. Garner's works to pull her mind back, to help her experience the joy of shared memory... of a lifetime together full of love and happiness. This is not a ""date"" movie--although many dating couples would probably go--this is much deeper and is probably best experienced by a ""married couple,"" where the thought of losing one's true love to the dementia of their mind is perhaps worse than death itself.

His facial expressions while listening to the conversation in the adjoining room told more than any words could begin to say. You could feel his hurt and see his love.

","Went to see this movie with two friends, who happened to be girls. Going in I thought this was just going to be a chick flick. I was seriously mistaken, somewhat. I'd say it was aimed towards that audience but it wasn't the usual crappy chick flick. It's based on two people who fall in love as teenagers (17), and it is real love. They are then to overcome obstacles such as separation and war and so forth. What's really original though is that it's told by an elderly Noah (Ryan Gosling) from a notebook to an old lady who has Alzheimer's. The whole thing is beautifully acted and the two lead roles really work well together. It gets you involved and sucks you into the story. It was shot very artistically and well. Overall I was just amazed and came out thinking it was an awesome movie. Don't let the genre fool you, this is really an excellent romance movie, rare for our times now.

My biggest complaint is the passion that is shown on the screen. I was mortified to be sitting through this in a group of people...it seemed pornographic. I can't believe this was only rated PG 13. The scene where she comes back to see him and they become passionate, should be rated R. They are so sexual, he throws her against the wall and grabs her breasts, they go up to a room and we watched the whole thing.

He often asked about his wife. He was very confused. These diseases are horrible, not only for the afflicted, but also for their loved ones.

It followed the book very well, much like the other Nicholas Sparks novels/movies. I did not see the point in adding the character of Martha Shaw, or a scene in Charleston, though. I thought the casting and acting was superb. James Garner was fantastic as Duke, the role fit him perfectly. I always enjoy Garner in a compassionate role such as this one. Gena Rowland also did a fine job as Allie Hamilton. Rachel McAdams blew me away with her performance. I had seen her in Mean Girls and Hot Chick, and was a bit skeptical, but she did an awesome job. Ryan Gosling's acting was also done well, just as he did in Murder by Numbers and Remember the Titans. The music was beautiful, and added much to the film.

","I'd never seen this director's work before, so I was kinda iffy about seeing it-even though from the previews I was in love with the plot, and I love Nicholas Sparks novels. I sat in a cold movie theater, watched it, and I was royally amazed.<br/><br/>The story you see in the previews is basically a frame tale revolving around a man and a very forgetful woman. He reads to her every day so that she will remember certain events.<br/><br/>The story the man tells her is about these two seventeen year olds, Allie and Noah. Allie is a city girl who is very concerned about pleasing everyone, and making sure that everyone is happy in the end. Noah is a hardworking man, who gets 40 cents an hour, but knows exactly how to get what he wants. In the film, he wants Allie from the moment he first sets eyes on her. To get to her, he dangles from a ferris wheel until she agrees to go out with him, though she later denies the whole thing. With the help of two of Noah's friends, they see a movie together and then walk and talk. After that they become inseparable.<br/><br/>Allie has to go to Sarah Lawrence in the fall, which is nowhere near where Noah and the others are. Before she leaves, the two get into a huge fight and ""break up"". Allie tries to find Noah to apologize, but he is gone. For a year after she left, he wrote her every day for an entire year, but with no response. He gives up, and becomes enlisted in the army.<br/><br/>During Allie's third year, she decided to be a nurse's assistant, where she meets Lon. She promises to date him once he gets better, and they fall in love and are going to get married. Allie reads a newspaper article about how her wedding is going to be the hit of the season, when she notices a picture of Noah with a house he refurbished. <br/><br/>You can find out the rest by seeing the movie. It is so worth the money, and an excellent date film."

","Nick Cassavetes' THE NOTEBOOK opens with a beautiful widescreen shot of a sunset, while Aaron Zigman's piercingly lovely score serenades us. It's the kind of opening for movies I normally steer clear of -- sun-dappled, lovelorn trash-romance-novel esque Hollywood crap. But, I was surprised by how effective the movie is. In doses. And how just about perfect the central relationship is. <br/><br/>Allie and Noah meet at the local fair. He jumps onto the ferris wheel, and dangles precariously in front of her until she agrees to a date. The next day when he comes to collect, she denies him, of course, but in a flirty way. She may have some wrong-side-of-the-tracks notion about the guy because of her upbringing, but she can't help but love the attention. <br/><br/>What worked for me about this story is that these two people are in love, and they know it. It's real, they feel it, no pretensions. No waiting till it's too late to do anything about. And, sure, overall the film is sketchy and quite saccharine, with too many _moments_ (he teaches her to drive; they dance in the street). It also doesn't know where to end. But, it put a lump in my throat. The scenes between Ryan Gosling and an extremely fetching Rachel McAdams (from MEAN GIRLS), where it's just the two of them exploring what it's like to be in love at 17, are romantic as hell. Even if it is only a Summer thing, and parents are going to eventually intrude (Joan Allen is a caricature as the unapproving mother), the courtship leading up to their first time together is wonderfully done. <br/><br/>McAdams handles the scene where her character is about to lose her virginity especially well; ""I wanted this to be perfect, and now I just can't shut up."" Gosling is terrific throughout; soft-spoken and understated, where most actors would overplay. The second half of the film has a moment where Allie comes up on something in the home that Noah has completely remodeled (""like I promised"") that stops her in her tracks. Anybody who hasn't already whipped out that trusty box of Kleenex may now do so.<br/><br/>The whole movie has a kind of a LIAR'S MOON feel to it, minus the incest and pregnancy. I didn't like the wrap around scenes as much, with James Garner reading from said notebook to Gena Rowlands. Whenever Gosling and McAdams aren't on screen, I wanted them back. <br/><br/>Still, for a film that lays on the sentiment thick, THE NOTEBOOK is a minor success. It comes the closest I think I've ever seen to capturing that intangible, mysterious feeling of being in love for the very first time."

","I saw a sneak preview of the Notebook with my girlfriends and we CRIED!!! It was soooo great and the setting and time period just make the movie even more romantic and believable. I truly and highly suggest this film for anyone who loves love stories. Warning: you will cry! But it is mostly a happy cry which is good. Ryan Gosling is extremely good looking and very good as the young Noah Calhoun and Rachel McAdams simply steals the camera's attention. Lastly, I read the novel by Nicolas Sparks and I really think that the filmmakers have done a really good job adapting the film from the novel. If anything the film answers questions left open from the book and the book answers questions left open from the film. So I suggest both the novel and the film (and consequently in that order as well). And of course Joan Allen and the actor who plays Noah's dad are excellent actors who play their role excellently.

","(Synopsis-Spoiler?) Based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, this love story stars James Garner and Gena Rowlands.   Garner begins to read to Gena from a notebook containing a love story of two teenagers, Noah and Allie, which began in the summer of 1940 in the resort town of Seabrook, North Carolina. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) sees Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams) at the carnival and gets a date with her.  Allie is from a wealthy family and Noah is a mill worker.  During that glorious summer, they fall madly in love. Allie's parents disapprove and leave Seabrook.  Noah writes Allie for an entire year, with no reply.   Noah joins the army when World War II begins. After the war, Noah returns to Seabrook, buys an old run-down house by the seashore, and begins to fix it up.  In the meantime, Allie has gotten engaged to Lon (James Marsden), a wealthy cotton broker.  While Allie is having her wedding gown fitting, she sees a picture of Noah and his home in the paper.  Allie returns to Seabrook to see Noah before her wedding.  Be sure to bring a tissue to the show, because this is one of those love stories that will leave the audience crying at the end.

My reactions of and during the film were the same of two friends who came along. Spark's story has brought forth a romance film so desperately needed during a season of body bronzer and car chases. <br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams prove to be a breath of fresh air next to films with stars who are true staples of box-office success. Gosling, who has usually leaned towards complex characters like a Jewish neo-Nazi in ""The Believer"" and a teen guilty of homicide in ""Murder by Numbers"" proves that he can more than hold his own in completely foreign film territory: romance. In a very Julianne Moore way, he has the power to convey pages of dialogue through simple looks and is surprisingly talented at finding comedy in certain lines and carries it off with a sort of accidental charm. Rachel McAdams, most known for her recent role as a teen queen in ""Mean Girls"" gives a truly charismatic performance and establishes a both multi-dimensional and personal character, which makes the viewer thankful that she beat out the likes of Britney Spears for the role.<br/><br/>All in all, Nicolas Sparks has provided summer movie-goers with a lovely story about first, enduring, and everlasting love."

","Ever since May 27th, I've been sitting on a wonderful little secret that you're going to be seeing and hearing an awful lot about this summer -and possibly, next February at Oscar-time. Like the ""Secret Love"" that Doris Day once sang about in Calamity Jane, which ""grew impatient to be free,"" my secret's become progressively harder to keep mum about as well, so today, three weeks later, the secret gets spilled. My 'secret' concerns one of the best films I've seen in a very, very long time, one which has me almost giddy at anticipating how the rest of the country will react to it, once it opens nationally on Friday June 25th. The wonderful film that has me all abuzz is the screen version of Nicholas Sparks' national best-seller, The Notebook, directed with immeasurable style and precision -and tons of heart and honesty- by Nick Cassavetes. It says here that it'll be the 'sleeper' of the year. Run, don't walk to see this movie as soon as you can, because the treat that awaits you in this well-crafted and beautifully shot combination of drama, humor and romance, is something that'll have you buzzing for a long time afterwards.<br/><br/>On a very hot and humid night in South Beach, not far from all the BCBG people flitting about Lincoln Road, I had the chance to see for myself what the folks from New Line could cobble together from a hugely popular novel and a most remarkable cast, with principals like Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Joan Allen and Sam Shepard. It's no exaggeration to say that the packed theatre in South Beach that night was absolutely BUZZING like a swarm of bees, during and after the movie, because of the quality of the film and the amazing individual performances turned in. This jibed perfectly with what I'd read about the film's showings in Seattle, during their film festival, and more recently, at Show Canada.<br/><br/>Over the past 15 years or so, I've gone to dozens and dozens of advanced screenings for films that were all over the lot: foreign & domestic, comedy & drama, usually more tricks than treats. I've seen Jessica Lange & Tommy Lee Jones create screen magic in Blue Sky, which earned Lange a much-overdue Oscar, though truth be told, I think she's still owed a few more. I've seen now-beloved films that were once thought to be quite iffy or long-shots, like Bull Durham or Field of Dreams, which have long since become so very much more than just films.<br/><br/>But, of course, there were also the times when I pressed my luck one time too many, like in 1996, when I walked into a darkened theatre with high hopes for Ed Burns' sophmore effort, She's The One, his follow-up to Brothers McMullen. Well, nobody hits a home run with every at bat. The elements that had seemed so fresh and appealing about his first effort, which struck such a chord with critics and film-goers alike, now seemed somewhat forced and off-kilter, despite how much I wanted to like it. (Or, maybe it's just my general dislike for Cameron Diaz.) Another case of curiosity killing the cat came in 199X, when I found myself literally stuck in the middle of a row at a cramped shoe-box of a theatre in Northwest D.C., trapped by chattering and immovable yentas at The Story of Us, arguably, one of the biggest wastes of talent on film in the past 30 years, with Pfeiffer and Willis left to fend for themselves. I felt like I'd been taken hostage.<br/><br/>Here's why I mention these hits-and-misses of the recent past: the last advanced screening I attended that came even close to blowing the hinges off the theatre doors like what I witnessed with The Notebook in South Beach was The Lion King, and much of that reaction was because the audience had no built-in expectation, other than another animated film from Disney. Who knew that The Lion King would change the industry forever? IF the word-of-mouth for The Notebook is anything at all like what I expect, based on my own extensive conversations with other audience members, there's really no limit to how HUGE this film will go theatrically, and later on DVD & Video.<br/><br/>There are 1,001 things about this film that compel me to STRONGLY RECOMMEND it to you, but I want to highlight just a few for reasons that will be self-evident once you've seen the film.<br/><br/>1.) In the central role of Noah Calhoun, Ryan Gosling shows exactly why he's one of the most talked-about young actors in the business today, showing a range of honest enthusiasm, intensity and self-confidence that is remarkable -and completely believable. To me, Gosling's characterization seems like a wonderful combination of the unique qualities we've always loved about three of the biggest film stars in history: Jimmy Stewart, Paul Newman and Gary Cooper. Gosling's Noah, a young man unafraid to dream big dreams and the hard-work required to make them come true, recalled for me yet another film character who was bound and determined to not just get the woman and the building of his dreams, but to do so on his own terms: Gary Cooper's determined Howard Roark in The Fountainhead, whose desire for both Patricia Neal and his dream of a skyscraper was palpable, and made that 1949 film so memorable. <br/><br/>Here, of course, Gosling isn't burdened with speaking in the stilted Ayn Rand-penned prose of Objectivism, and imbues Noah with the kind of gentle humor and thoughtfulness that makes him ideal as a friend to men, as well as a love interest to women.<br/><br/>2.) In the end, I think the individual most responsible for your seeing this film a second time this summer will be obvious to you within the first fifteen minutes: Rachel McAdams. As Orson Welles once so-famously said off-camera in introducing one of his young stars during the closing credits of Citizen Kane, ""I'll repeat that name so you don't forget it:"" Rachel McAdams. Rachel McAdams, well, she is, to use that old Hollywood clichÃ©, nothing less than a revelation in the role of Allie. It isn't just because she's 100% believable from the first moment she steps before the camera, though she is.<br/><br/>It isn't just because she looks like a vision of loveliness in the 1940's period costumes, as if she's stepped right out of our collective memories, though she is and does. No, more than any other individual quality that she brings to this wonderful film, Rachel McAdams brings that intangible quality known as ""IT,"" which allows some actors to take the audience into their embrace before they even know what's hit them -and never lets them go. And so it is here.<br/><br/>As was the case in seeing Ashley Judd in 1993's Ruby in Paradise, Reese Witherspoon in 1991's The Man in the Moon, and more recently, Scarlett Johansson in 2001's An American Rhapsody, Rachel McAdams is so amazing in her performance, that long before the film is over, you find yourself slack-jawed at the realization that she's not already one of our A-list actresses, sub-Thirty division, since from the moment you see her, you are completely invested in her. There is never a moment when she's on screen that you aren't completely aware of her and rooting for her to make the right choices in her life. Everything about her performance and personality absolutely screams ""Movie Star."" <br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is clearly another actor who's been working very hard for years so that some newspaper or magazine writer could now, quite foolishly, suddenly call her an ""overnight sensation."" However long it's taken, though, her moment to shine has clearly arrived, because in The Notebook, Rachel McAdams absolutely radiates charm, passion and intensity. You simply can't help loving her.<br/><br/>3.) Like me, you've all not only had the experience of attending high school, but since Fast Times at Ridgemont High came out and broke the mold, also had to endure lots and lots of bad films and TV shows about high school kids, many more notable for their soundtracks than the performances or story. One of the very best things about this film is something that's been completely ignored in the trade reviews I've read so far, but which struck me almost immediately as I left the theatre, prepared to do battle with the oppressive heat & humidity of South Florida. That is, the extent to which the people portrayed seem convincing and completely believable to their time and place, in large part, due to the wonderfully striking outfits they wear. More to the point, no character in the film is unduly precocious or prescient about the future and the events to come, in either their own lives or the wider world, a narrative shorthand I've always found to be the worst kind of foreshadowing on the BIG SCREEN. (If you've got a big screen, fill it with a compelling story full of characters we care about!) You know, kids who see the future so clearly that they muse out loud at the dinner table over mashed potatoes and meatloaf about what the Japanese move into Manchuria augers, or what the German annexation of the Sudetenland might bring forth. Meanwhile, the so-called adults are left to mutter lines like, ""Well, whatever happens next, it won't be good."" Then, as has been seen a million times before, CUE the shot of a plane dropping a bomb over The Arizona at Pearl Harbor...<br/><br/>Thankfully, that's missing here, and instead, under Cassavetes' calm hand, we get nuance, complexity and honest exploration of heartfelt thoughts and feelings -and wavering doubts. Despite the fact that we know we're watching a film that at its core must be romantic, Cassavetes never condescends to the audience by making things easy for the characters, which is why their conflicts and choices seem so very much more intense and palpable than is true with films where everyone's acting in the shallow end of the pool. Special kudos to James Marsden on that score, for making his character of Lon seem so much more fully-evolved than the one-dimensional caricature he'd be in the hands of many other actors. His character must ring true in order for Allie's choice to be seen as a real one, and not one made by default. James Marsden delivers the goods!<br/><br/>Based on what I've seen and heard for myself, this film has the potential to be a license to print REAL MONEY!!! Personally, I'd invest lots of real money to have some participation points on this film, because, quite honestly, it looks and performs exactly like a perennial, the sort of film that CBS-TV -that's your cue, Les Moonves!- could and should run on the Sunday night after Thanksgiving for the indefinite future, becoming what the Wizard of Oz used to be, and more recently, what A Wonderful Life has been for NBC-TV, once they made it exclusive to the Peacock network. The reps I spied at the theatre, presumably from New Line, were trying their best to play it cool, but clearly they know they have a potential juggernaut here because days later, in an interview with Martin Grove of The Hollywood Reporter, producer Mark Johnson spilled the beans: ""... I have to say that in testing it the men who have seen this movie rate it as highly as the women do. This is the highest testing movie I have ever had -- and that includes 'Rain Man,' 'Good Morning Vietnam' and 'The Rookie."" <br/><br/>I honestly believe that within the next two years, at least 5% of the country, and, perhaps 35% of all American women aged 15-45, will have at least one copy, DVD or videotape, of ""The Notebook"" in their entertainment center. That's how wonderful this film is.<br/><br/>Believe me, you will all be believers by the end of the summer<br/><br/>Enjoy!"

","Absolutely loved this movie. I had recently read the book and cried like a baby. Even though I was prepared for what I knew was in the book, I still cried buckets while watching the film. <br/><br/>The acting was superb! I've been a fan of James Garner & Gena Rowlands for years, but have become fans of both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. Their chemistry is unmatched!<br/><br/>I know that my teenage daughter will enjoy this film as much as I did, since she is a huge Ryan Gosling fan. In fact she was the one who told me as we were watching the trailer for the first time that we definitely would be seeing it! <br/><br/>The movie is very sweet and some might say predictable, but enjoyable nonetheless. <br/><br/>I highly recommend this movie to fans of all ages.

","First of all, I knew a movie with Gena Rowlands and James Garner couldn't be bad. I have to say that this is probably James Garner's best work that I've seen. He captured the essence of his character to the max and his emotions seemed so real. Second of all, Gena Rowlands doesn't do bad movie. She was incredible and while the part was understated, her performances were so powerful they were heartbreaking. I literally ached for her character.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were perfect in their roles of young lovers, torn apart by class distinction, war and doubts. Their story was pretty classic, boy smitten by girl, woos girl, wins girl, loses girl. But that's NOT the whole story, it's only the beginning.<br/><br/>I was impressed how the movie handled some life issues. Not to give anything away, but you will cry and you will see yourself in this story or at least someone you love. There is some suspense, definite fun and the drama is not over done at all. People actually clapped at the end of this movie; it was so good and so worth the price of a ticket! I cannot recommend this movie enough.<br/><br/>I think this is definitely Oscar material, especially for Gena Rowlands and James Garner. We'll see!"
"downinnewyork","9","0","0","15 June 2004"," Sleeper hit of the summer.
","Surprisingly (or not), I saw this movie like everyone else and his uncle--at a sneak preview on Saturday, June 12th. Why didn't they just release it then instead of the 25th? But, I digress<br/><br/>I'd read The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks a few years ago and frankly, I hated it. There was nothing wrong with the story itself but sentence structure and Sparks' use of metaphors were (I thought) simplistic and clichéd, and the characters never really got into my head. I didn't finish it, just skipped to the end to see who she chose and that was that<br/><br/>So suffice it to say, I didn't have the best of expectations for the film, and was really only tuning in to see just what else Ryan Gosling is capable of. He's a genuinely interesting actor who has done some exceptional independent films (think 2001's The Believer and 2002's The Slaughter Rule, my personal favourites) but here he is starring in a film by Nick Cassavetes of A Walk to Remember fame. I'll get to that in a minute.<br/><br/>The film opens to a shot of a man rowing across a lake at dusk in silhouette. It's a gorgeous scene marred only by the lazy swooping of a flock of swans that were clearly, painfully computer-generated, and made me wonder what I was in for. Thankfully, I soon forgot about them and lost myself in the love story. Overall, beautiful cinematography.<br/><br/>I won't get into details of the plot except to say that it includes some of the most romantic ideas ever put to screen, most of which were taken from the pages of the book, and very easily could have been unadulterated sentimental cheese if it weren't for the cast. Someone, somewhere, got it right when they cast Rachel McAdams opposite Ryan Gosling as the young Allie Hamilton and Noah Calhoun. These two have chemistry like hasn't been seen on-screen in the last 10-15 years and are far and away the best reason to see the film. Together they're intoxicating, three days later, I still can't get them out of my head. Their work is equally unpredictable, exciting and sincere, and it gives the film instant credibility.<br/><br/>Gena Rowlands and James Garner are legendary in their own rights, making excellent use of what comparatively little screen time they have, and it is their scenes that really pack an emotional punch. James Garner has one moment in particular that just wrecked me. I was curious as to how they would create the scene where Allie remembers again and, surpassing all of my wildest expectations, it remains the only scene in the film that made me cry (as opposed to just giving me a lump in my throat), including the ending.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but wish that James Garner had tried to mimic Ryan Gosling's mannerisms, speech patterns and body language because I didn't really feel that they were playing the same character. It's easily acceptable though--if I were of his stature, I wouldn't make a movie just to do an impression of an up-and-comer either. The Notebook also boasts arguably the *worst* war scene since EVERY war scene in Windtalkers, and I think the filmmakers could have increased the tension surrounding Allie's decision between Noah and Lon (James Marsden, under-utilized with only about 10 minutes of screen time).<br/><br/>Undoubtedly, there will be people who have nothing good to say about The Notebook because they detest love stories and are unable to understand why it will connect with a mostly female audience. They'll argue that love like Noah and Allie's doesn't exist in the real world--and for the most part, it doesn't. But when I watched this movie, I saw my boyfriend countless times in Noah, and I believe (even while I cringe at how corny this sounds) that there isn't a couple out there that can't find something to identify with too. That's why the whole Movie Love argument isn't valid here--there may *not* be one couple that ever existed in the history of time exactly like them, but they do exist, in their totality, through the 6 billion people on Earth. You can't argue with that.<br/><br/>After the screening, I watched the girl sitting in front of me lean over and give her boyfriend a kiss that spoke volumes. The Notebook made me want to run right home and give my boyfriend the biggest hug ever (and them some), so frankly, most men will not regret seeing this film if asked to by their girlfriends, and I think we all know what I mean. ;)<br/><br/>The one thing The Notebook really made me aware of though was my grandparents, and the countless other couples going through similar circumstances. To lose your memories, and forget everything that means anything to you is terrible, both for you and those who love you. The ending of The Notebook may be really corny, there's no denying it, but it certainly is a nice thought, to be able to make someone remember and to not be alone in the end. <br/><br/>This movie is going to be the sleeper hit of the summer. No magic wands, no spiders, and certainly no trolls. I'm going to see it again when it opens on June 25th, and I'll be first in line for the DVD (though I probably won't be reading the book again).<br/><br/>**** out of 5 stars, if only for the war scene, and a little James Marsden is always a good thing."

","This film is one of the greatest romance films of all time. One which will be cherished forever. The musical score, composed by Aaron Zigman, will encapsulate you into a time of wonderment & awe. Ryan Gosling is nothing less than mesmerizing, while Rachel McAdams puts you under her spell. The remaining cast members delighted me with their performances as well. You witness the seeds being planted in the beginning of the story. We, as viewers, are lucky to see the love of Noah & Allie blossom into an enormous rose garden. You can feel along with them, how full, their hearts are. >From the opening scene, until the very last, the cinematography is splendidly vivid, amazingly alive, & meaningful. We get a glimpse of how it is like to live with a partner with Alzheimer's Disease, in the scenes with the adult Noah & Allie, played by James Garner & Gena Rowlands. This is how Nancy Reagan lived with Ronald Reagan, the last few years of his life--she loved him forever. I enjoyed seeing true love prevail over power, prestige, & wealth. I'd rather be wealthy in love, rather than money. Besides, love does conquer all. Go see this film & bring everyone you know. This movie will make your heart smile."

"drudo_182@yahoo.com","8","0","0","14 June 2004"," overall, solid film.
","Hello,<br/><br/>I got a chance to see the new Ryan Gosling film, 'The Notebook' directed by Nick Cassavetes (John Q) Saturday night during its sneak preview this weekend. The theatre was sold out, which shocked me because I hadn't really seen it being plugged too much but the trailer for the film was really good and had me wanting to see it so I can understand why. And I'm willing to bet it's a big hit with the older crowd. They were in full-force.<br/><br/>Anyways, on to the film (spoilers ahead). It's a simple movie based off the novel by Nicholas Sparks (I haven't read it if it makes a difference). It begins with James Garner and Gena Rowlands and Garner reading to her from his notebook at a nursing home. He tells the story of Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) and how they fall in love one summer. This all begins at the carnival where Noah first meets Allie and how he MUST have her. Of course, they fall in love and they spend the entire summer together. But, this wouldn't be a drama if there were not a few plot twits. Namely, its Allies mother played by Joan Allen. After she is late one night and the cops are called out to search for her, she arrives home and gets in to a nice argument with her parents about Noah. He's trashnot for herblah, blah, blah. Noah then decides that maybe it should be over since she is leaving for New York for school soon and that is it. But before she leaves, she gets a chance to tell Noah's friend that she loves him. Noah then decides to write her everyday for a year and of course Allies mother keeps the letters from her. Three years go by, Noah's been to the war and Allies now engaged to Lon (James Marsdan) and the drama continues. There's another part of the story about Noah fulfilling his dream of rebuilding this home that takes place early in the film and after he actually does, he gets his picture in the paper. She see's it and comes to visit him. Sparks fly once again and they fall in love once more. That's the main part of the film and the 'twist' is revealed fairly early on but if you can't see it before thenor after watching the traileryou need to get checked out. It's fairly obvious. As for the good and bad<br/><br/>First, the good. The cast is great, especially Sam Shepard. While he is only in the film like five or so minutes, he is one of the more memorable characters in the film. He had some funny dialogue and the crowd really enjoyed it when he was on camera. Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams were also very good in their roles and Joan Allen did a good job as the ""villain' and she has a great scene with McAdams late in the film dealing with her lost-love and her current husband. It gives her a little more depth. James Marsdan was good as her fiancé but of course, no one wanted to root for him because Gosling just came off as a better guy. As for the older Noah and Allie, James Garner does a good job, especially later in the film when he is able to show more emotion but I did have a problem with Gena Rowlands, but I'll discuss that in the bad. Basically, the entire film fits into the good column. The script was enjoyable and strayed away from a typical 'magical' ending and the dialogue was fine. But there's always some critique<br/><br/>The bad mostly consists of two things. First off, some of the scenes were just too darn long and/or not needed. For instance, there is a scene where Allie and Noah dance in the street after they really hit it off and it drags for about two minutes too long. And after the story is told and completed, when we finish the film with Garner and Rowlands, some of it drags on a bit too long like Noah's third heart attack. It probably could have been deleted. My other beef was some of the scenes of Garner reading the story ruined moments in the film. A scene would be moving along nicely then be ruined because we have to go back to Noah getting interrupted because Allie needs to take medicine or go take a nap. It happened a couple times that really took away from some scenes. As for ending itself, the last shot of the film of Noah and Allie in bed together is a great way to end it properly. Nothing magical or fake happens which I really enjoyed. There's not much bad I can say about the film minus a couple small issues.<br/><br/>Overall, judging from the reaction from the crowd afterwards, this should be a semi-big hit. The audience was sniffling and sobbing so much at the very end of it all and it was weird because I had never seen a film where people cried this much. You would have thought we were watching 'Schindlers List'. But I do recommend it. Aside from some minor problems with certain scenes and some parts of the ending, it was a solid film and I hope it does well.<br/><br/>My grade: 4 / 5"

Then the ending came, and I was pretty drained. The whole theater was filled with crying eyes, and people saying this was the best film they've seen in years.

It is not however your typical boy meets girl love story. They fight as much as they love. This is unique because most of the romantic love stories show perfect couples that fight once with no passion or chemistry. These two (Ryan Gosling from the Mickey Mouse Club back in the day and a few other indie films and Rachel McAdams from the Hot Chick and Mean Girls)are incredible on screen and they truly draw you in as if you were witnessing it for real. So all you romantics be sure to go see it when it opens wide June 25th. It will stay with you for a long time after you see it. <br/><br/>-Sarah"

"gregsrants","8","0","0","14 June 2004"," Touching and poignant, this movie has a heart
","The Notebook is a chick flick.  I just wanted to get that out of the way rather early in the review.  So anyone who is thinking of seeing The Chronicles of Riddick and then sneaking in to see the Cassavetes new tear jerker, you should be told before hand that you are not the target audience for both films.  <br/><br/>The Notebook is a surprising, emotional powerhouse of a film that had the theatre in tears in the simple telling of how two people met, fell in love and lasted until the end.  Set in the 1940's, the story is about two young opposites as read from a notebook to an elderly woman who's memory is victim to Alzheimers.  The film chronicles Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams), a high-class, well-off teenage female who meets and soon falls in love for the wooing of Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling), a blue collar worker that makes forty cents an hour dragging and pulling bark off logs.  The two young-ins couldn't be more opposite and couldn't be more in love.  But love, as we learn can take time to reveal its destiny and the two are forced to deal with such obstacles and protective parents, war and eventually their biggest enemy, time.  Sob.<br/><br/>I was not surprised to find that writer Nicholas Sparks has penned two other hanky flagging films in the past few years.  A Walk To Remember and Message in a Bottle were both fluff, but fluff that can induce one to take a few extra swallows to get rid of the lump in your throat.  The Notebook stays true to this course.  The endings (I say it plural cause there was a fade away that could have been an ending only for one more tear jerking act to play out upon fade up), were heart tugging and had I had access to hammer, wood and nails, I would have started to build an Ark and get to of every animal on board quick for there was not a dry eye in the screening.<br/><br/>
Like any movie that tries to evoke an emotional response from its audience, we have to buy into the characters and their situations and it is here that The Notebook rises above Spark's other writing efforts.  Gosling and McAdams have true chemistry together and sparks fly from the time the two lie on the road to watch the street lights change color right to the ending that I can not bring myself to reveal in this review.  Their affection for each other is so real that a simple glance by Noah or a dimpled smile by Allie can relay to the audience more than any written word could express.  <br/><br/>
Brilliantly shot by Director Nick Cassavetes with the help of memorable visuals by cinematographer Robert Fraisse, the film takes us to a time of enchantment where hundreds of ducks can accompany a romantic boat ride or where a reading on the dock at sunset can fill one with nostalgia. <br/><br/>
This was Cassavetes next film after the misguided John Q with Denzel Washington in 2001, and like Q, Cassavetes throws a lot against the wall in this film in hopes that most of it sticks.  We are given scenes of war in Europe, an engagement, the re-building of a house, the death of a father and the revealing of secrets by a parent.  All this kind of makes you feel as if you were standing in front of a Schwarzenegger machine gun getting hit with just about every possible scenario or experience that two people could ever encounter.  But thanks to the great acting and the shifting from the young teenage characters to their elder selves, it allows us breaks every once and while to catch our breathes and savor the love that these two had for each other.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but think at the conclusion of the film that if this were a movie set in present day with a Jennifer Lopez type character in the lead female role, how awfully contrived and manipulating this movie would be viewed and I suppose this is the same realization the studio had to release the film amongst the summer blockbusters.   <br/><br/>For all its small shortcomings, The Notebook is a refreshing bit of air in a summer of Ogres and talking cats.  James Garner gives a touching performance as the elder man who reads the notebook to Gena Rowlands (Cassavetes mother in the factual world), and when his heart is broken at a relapse of her memory, we cry alongside his anguish.  <br/><br/>So I have to give a strong recommendation to The Notebook with just one word of advice.  That is to take lots of tissue or at the very least, buy a big bag of popcorn to hide your face from your date so she doesn't see you have a soft side.<br/><br/>www.gregsrants.com"

","I saw this movie last night at a sneak preview in Georgia with my friend who was obsessed with the book. I had seen the previews and had wanted to see the movie, so we got advanced tickets and then went to see the show. ""The Notebook"" was a great movie and I really enjoyed it. It was basically an average love story movie, but it was so good that it feels like you are being told a different story than you hear in every romantic movie. this movie was funny at parts, very romantic, and a tear-jerker. the ending was happy in a sad way (if you've read the book you'll understand). anyways, i really enjoyed it. plus we got free mini-posters so how could that be wrong? haha."

The acting by Ryan Gosling (such a nice change from murder by numbers) and Rachel Mcadams was amazing, and i thought James Garner and Gena Rowlands were great. It keeps you interested from start to finish and the moments of laughter added so much. Though I am sure not everyone agrees, I felt this movie was one of the better love stories out there and I really hope it does well in a summer of blockbusters.

","I am so glad that I saw this movie. The voice-over at the beginning of the movie given by James Garner sets the tone for all that follows, and is the starting point for breaking out the Kleenex. Throughout the movie there are choices for the characters to make, and they have a profound effect on the lives of all of the major players. To some, this movie has a fantasy quality because the love expressed between Noah and Allie is so absolute and is acted on so concretely. I disagree because there are people out there who have and will act like the two lovers in the film.<br/><br/>People watching this film who know this kind of love will recognize what I'm talking about. Through triumph and tragedy, the love of a soulmate will endure. Those who have never known this kind of timeless love may be in disbelief. I believe that the older you are, the more likely it will be that you will be deeply moved.<br/><br/>The casting was very well done, and I thought that James Garner turned in an exceptional performance.<br/><br/>Bring your tissues.

","This was one of the best novels I had ever read, so I was skeptical about it being turned into a movie. Fortunately, my fears were put to rest when I watched this movie. The story was well adapted and the message was properly conveyed. The cast was phenomenal and really seemed to put their hearts into their performances, especially James Garner. He was so touching in the end that it brought most of the audience to tears. I don't think there was a single person in the theater who was not crying at the end of this movie. I think part of The Notebook's appeal is that many people can relate to loving someone who has Alzheimers and must overcome the fact that the person has no recollection of some of the most important events that occurred in their life. The story of Noah and Allie is so inspirational to those who have found their soul mates and also for those who are still looking. Everything about this movie was spectacular, and people should definitely go see it for themselves."

","Saw this movie yesterday and was amazed by the acting job of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. From the moment they hit the screen to the end both did a fantastic job. The script was a gem for both to work with. They were natural together and played off each other well. The only problem was I felt they did seem to get tired towards the end of the movie. There roles required a lot of energy and perhaps it was hard to sustain it. The rest of the cast was wonderful though Joan Allen seemed flat. The script was well written and locations beautiful. Costume design is especially noteworthy. Though not a 10 the movie was extremely enjoyable to watch -- especially because of Gosling and McAdams."

Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams captured the love and angst of Noah and Allie perfectly. The story takes place in present day with James Garner reading to Gena Rowlands. He is narrating a story of love, and then we flip to 1940's and we see Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams portray a southern lumber worker and a well off city girl, who fall hopelessly and desperately in love with one another during an unforgettable summer. <br/><br/>I give this 5 out of 5 stars and anyone with a romantic bone in their body should go and see this movie.

","The Notebook was a really good movie.The two other woman with me loved it too. It's a love story set in the 1940's of a rich girl who meets a guy of humble means and they fall in love. From a nursing home the story of the young couple is being read out of a notebook and captured on screen by flashbacks. James Garner plays Duke who is reading out of the notebook to another resident of the home, Gena Rowlands. Of course there are the ups and downs of the rich family and their disapproval of the young man. This is a very heartwarming love story and will appeal mostly to females. I consider this a chic flick but it also would be a great date night for anyone young or old. Don't miss this one. This was a sneak preview I attended, coming out soon though."

","The Notebook is a film that epitomizes many people's hatred of chick flicks. It's a simple, prototypical story that you've heard a million times before.<br/><br/>Poor Boy meets Rich Girl. Poor Boy does something crazy to get Rich Girl's attention. Poor Boy continues doing crazy things, and convinces Rich Girl that there's more to life than being rich and doing rich guy stuff. Rich Girl starts doing crazy things; crazier than even Poor Boy would do.<br/><br/>Poor Boy and Rich Girl fall deliriously in love with each other over the course of two months, when Rich Girl's parents try to interfere with the young couple's love. (In The Notebook, Rich Girl's father has his villainy exacerbated by the presence of facial hair, a la Star Trek.) Rich Girl is torn away from Poor Boy. They lose touch, because someone has chosen to conceal Poor Boy's efforts to contact Rich Girl.<br/><br/>Poor Boy goes to war, and his buddy (who has received all of two minutes of screen time earlier in the movie) meets a tragic and sudden demise.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rich Girl forgets about Poor Boy and gets engaged to Rich Boy. Poor Boy comes home, his dad dies, and he goes nuts and bums around for a living.<br/><br/>Rich Girl becomes suddenly aware of Poor Boy again, and goes to visit him. A playful frolic in the rain leads to a steamy extramarital affair (poorly lit, of course... this IS PG-13, after all).<br/><br/>Rich Girl's mom decides to let Rich Girl know the truth about Poor Boy's attempts to communicate with her. Rich Girl decides to go with Poor Boy, ditching her fiancé. Everyone still thinks she's the greatest thing since chocolate covered gummy bears. Love predictably conquers all, and Rich Girl and Poor Boy grow old and die in each other's arms.<br/><br/>Utterly clichéd.<br/><br/>All of this is centered around Poor Boy's obsessive and maladaptive golden years. Rich Girl has succumbed to Alzheimer's, and doesn't remember a thing about her life until Poor Boy reads her the agonizing story of their lives together. She then comes to for about five minutes, then goes nuts because a strange man is caressing her and referring to her with terms of endearment. Poor Boy's children and grandchildren are at home, and they miss him. They have their wits about them, and they need him. Poor Boy insists that Rich Girl needs him, but she isn't even aware of who he is until late every night. He's just another stranger until that time. Why wouldn't he stay at home with the people who love and miss him, and visit Rich Girl every week or so? <br/><br/>On the day that we are so greatly blessed to witness, she wakes up in the middle of the night with all knowledge of her life thus far, then goes to sleep with her husband Poor Boy, and never wakes up.<br/><br/>It's depressing, immoral, predictable, and a hulking bore, yet it is promoted by most everyone as being a great and wholesome love story.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the people who recommend this.

All she says is that she loved/loves this bumpkin yet she still truly loves Allie's father. So this is the same lady that pulled her daughter away and hid letters for a year? Is she telling her daughter to go with Noah or not?? And if she is, shouldn't she had done that after she saw 365 letters??? That must mean something if a guy writes your daughter 365 letters.<br/><br/>FINALLY, the whole way the story was told from the nursing home and the ""Notebook."" This will sound like 50 First Dates, but here it goes.

It is a soap opera formula, certainly, but I feel the leads carried it well. The old clothes, the cars, etc, all quite well done.
The kiss on the lake in the pouring rain is one of the greatest movies kisses of all time. You can skip this film entirely, and just google the kiss. I bet it is on youtube.
Unfortunately, the part set in the present in the nursing home is very sappy, totally unrealistic, and predictable.

"SebaZava","8","2","5","15 June 2009"," A flawed yet emotional romantic drama
","I'm the kind of person who just loves to read novels, but I've never been an avid romance novel reader. I mean, how many guys would be? That means, of course, that I've never read The Notebook or any of Nicholas Sparks' novels. From what I've heard, some of them are really good, while others are either over-the-top or just silly. If I had to guess, though, I'd say the movie The Notebook was adapted from a novel belonging to the former category. That, or scriptwriters Jan Sardi and Jeremy Leven are really good at what they do. In any case, there's no denying that The Notebook is a compelling motion picture, and a very emotional kind of experience. It's what many would call a ""tear-jerker"" (an accurate description, considering how emotional the film is) but, at least in this case, calling it that it not a bad thing at all.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of Noah (James Garner as an adult, and Ryan Gosling as the younger version) and Allie. (Gene Rowlands in modern times, and Rachel McAdams during her younger years.) It's the year 2000, and Allie is suffering of dementia, something that is affecting her memory. With hopes of making her better, Noah is reading her from an old notebook, which recounts their story together; how they met, how they fell in love, and how they eventually ended up together. They met in America just before WWII; Noah was a working class teenager, while Allie belonged to a wealthy family. As most will be able to guess, their differences in terms of social classes became an issue, especially when Allie's mother (Joan Allen) found about their relationship. This lead to their break up, but fortunately for the both of them, destiny made them find each other again after the war, and just before Allie married an equally wealthy and undeniably charming soldier. (James Marsden.) If there's a reason why The Notebook worked so great for me, it's because it's so damned emotional. The story is predictable, as well the twists and turns the scriptwriters keep throwing at the audience, but the movie is presented in such a manner that it's not hard to feel for the characters and want them to end up together. Technically, it's brilliant - pre-WWII America is presented very accurately, and the film provides with such beautiful photography that it's hard not to fall in love with it. It's a beautiful-looking film, and as it's usually the case, it tells the story of two equally pretty people who just can't seem to be together. Their romance is pretty straightforward stuff - I actually thought at times it was too dramatic and that it resembled a cheap soap opera a little too much - but what made the story so compelling was the contrast between their early life and the situation in the 21st century. It may be due to my fears or to how I feel towards the topic, but the fact that Allie couldn't recognize Noah and that he just kept reading at her and loving her... OK, let's just say it's pretty powerful stuff.<br/><br/>If there's a genre that depends a lot on performances, it's the romantic drama; if your leads don't have any chemistry between each other, if they can't sell the romance to the audience, then your movie is pretty much screwed. Fortunately, that's not the case in here. Rachel McAdams is beautiful and compelling; she turns Allie into a charming, likable kind of character, the kind of girl you just want to be happy. Ryan Gosling is equally good, although I felt at times his interpretation of Noah lacked a little characterization, a little charm. In any case, he does have chemistry which McAdams, making every encounter between them bloom with passion. As the older versions of this characters, James Garner and Jena Rowlands are really good too although, at least for me, it was hard to believe those two were the same people who appear in the flashbacks. They just don't look alike or even feel alike.<br/><br/>Something that bothered me a little and that many critics have mentioned about the film, is that it feels a little restrained. Considering hat subject matter, and the fact that it's a very dramatic, slow-moving, emotional and occasionally sad, I don't think many teenagers would want to watch the movie. So why then the PG-13 rating? Every time Noah and Allie were involved in a sex scenes, tricky camera-work was used to make sure no nudity was shown, and the actors even are positioned in such a way that it looks forced and awkward, only to make sure, again, that they don't show any skin. If you're going to have a film that contains quite a bit of sexuality and that doesn't appeal to many underage viewers, it doesn't make any sense to restrain it. Many members of the audience won't even notice this, but it definitely bothered me.<br/><br/>As most of my readers may have already noticed, The Notebook is flawed, but a movie doesn't have to be a flawless masterpiece in order to be enjoyable. The Notebook is a romantic drama, and in order to succeed, it only has to do a couple of things: provide with solid romantic moments, have a believable leading couple and, if possible, make its viewers cry. I can say that this film achieved all three objectives, and that if you don't cry while watching it, especially during the last few scenes, you just don't have a soul. OK, so the filmmakers might be cheating - sometimes it's almost as if Nick Cassavettes and his team were trying to throw pepper-spray at the audience in order to make them cry - but the film is presented in such an elegant, compelling fashion, that you won't notice any of its flaws until well after the end credits."

","James Garner and Gena Rowlands and Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdam pay the same pair of lovers during the World War II years and up to the present day. All four of them and the cast assembled by director Nick Cassavetes present a wonderful romantic film that will bridge the generations.<br/><br/>We meet Noah and Allie in their old age at first. We see their story later unfold, but we learn that while they may have lived happily it was not ever after as old phrase goes. <br/><br/>Old age is a time of memories and if you're lucky enough to find your soulmate they will be shared memories. And that's half the enjoyment of memories, someone to remember the shared experience with.<br/><br/>But when one of the partners develops Alzheimer's it's devastating for the one who doesn't have it to watch the other deteriorate. And that's what's happening with Garner as he visits Rowlands in a nursing home.<br/><br/>On this visit he's prepared though. Garner has brought a notebook in which he's written down their story. The nurse introduces him as a stranger who takes her outside and proceeds to read their story as though this happened to two other people in an attempt to reach Rowlands.<br/><br/>And in flashback we see their story and as Gosling and McAdams we see the ups and downs of a poor boy/rich girl romance. That makes up the bulk of the film. Gosling and McAdams are most definitely each other's soulmates, but her parents do their best to keep them apart and both get involved with other people, Jamie Anne Allman and James Marsden.<br/><br/>The sad message is that even for the most right of couples, there's no such thing as happily FOREVER after at least on this Earth. I've had several two aunts with Alzheimer's disease and I could relate to what Garner was going through with Rowlands. And I have aunt right now who is 89 and in my last conversation with her I could see her memory going and how that must be affecting my uncle who is the same age.<br/><br/>The four leads and the rest of the cast are just perfect in their parts. Director Nick Cassavetes is of course directing his mother here and you know they were completely in sync. I cannot believe The Notebook got no Oscar nominations at all, it's a travesty how it was overlooked by the Academy. It did get several awards and nominations from other venues, but not from the Academy.<br/><br/>The Notebook is a perfect romantic story and the nature of it will appeal to all the generations we have living on the planet."

","The biggest problem with this movie is that it acts like it's better than it happens to be.

In college, I've seen it more than a few times and each time I'm more unimpressed than the last. How about a realistic romance film? They are out there, you know? There's no need to settle for this. The sophomoric dialogue, formulaic plot and moronic ""twist"" baffle me by its stupidity. Please, avoid this at all cost if you have any taste.

"dglink","6","2","5","24 July 2004"," ""Iris"" Redux
","One might categorize ""The Notebook"" as the ultimate ""chick flick"" since there is little in the story to appeal to male viewers.  Not much takes place that has not happened in dozens of other films.  A young man and a young woman meet, they fall in love, they face obstacles, they part, they... Well, if you have been to the movies sometime in the past 100 years, you can fill in the rest.  However, the movie does have a framing device that bears a striking resemblance to the recent bio film about writer Iris Murdoch, ""Iris.""  In the earlier film, however, the story balance was tilted towards the older characters, while in ""The Notebook,"" the younger players hold center stage.  The downbeat nature of ""Iris"" was bearable because of the towering performances of Judi Dench and Jim Broadbent.  Unfortunately, ""The Notebook"" is less distinguished.  While the older pair, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, are seasoned pros and do an able job, particularly Garner, the cast in the earlier scenes are just O.K., although paddling through a Disneyesque lake filled with thousands of white geese and keeping a straight face must require a great deal of acting discipline.  At times the entire film is as cloying as that treacly rippling-water scene despite desperate attempts to be moving and touching.  While ""Iris"" rose above its depressing subject matter with unforgettable performances that could break the heart of the most hardened stoic, ""The Notebook"" fails to evoke a single tear and turns a similar story into a sappy sentimental ""date film."""

","Zero stars . . .<br/><br/>Okay, I too saw THE NOTEBOOK at the Seattle Film Festival,and while I heard the sniveling, I have to say this was the most manipulative piece of sh** I've probably ever seen . . . and I've watched independent and mainstream stuff for over 20 years. In fact, I've been to chiropractors who haven't manipulated me as much as this film tried to do.<br/><br/>First off, the dialogue is as original as a romance novel - trite and insipid. Second, the main characters get what they want in a very easy manner . . . dream houses virtually build themselves . . . war injuries appear most conveniently while adding atmospheric melodrama . . . everybody is so Hollywood gorgeous regardless of the circumstances and can spout cute non-sequitors endlessly as the tearducts warrant. The film just screams ""LOVE ME . . . LOVE ME !!! . . . and check out the cute outfits I'm wearing in each scene . . . ""<br/><br/>And this is just the young romance part of the film. Cut now to 50 years later wherein Altzheimers ravages one of the protagonists, and now you get to the REALLY sappy heart of the story. She can't remember ANYTHING about their love life or family, and James Garner courageously reads their love story to her on a daily . . . I said DAILY basis. . . .while candle-lit, 4-star dinners miraculously appear courtesy of the ultra-nurturing nursing staff of the Altzheimer facility. What is their hope . . . that this 70 or 80-something couple will get it on one last time?? Folks, I've just helped an aged auntie get ""managed care"" from a nursing home who couldn't care less whether she lived or died from her heart surgery. Am I expected to believe an aged care facility cares whether or not she gets romantically connected and laid??????????????<br/><br/>God, this is so trite and manipulative, I cannot continue with my complaints.. <br/><br/>Yes, those wanting a Hollywood manipulative empty, cry-baby experience will get everything they want from this film - IF they haven't seen Ali McGraw in LOVE STORY or BRIAN'S SONG, neither of which are a better film - they're just older, exploitative films. And what really irks this film lover is that THE NOTEBOOK will most probably gross a truck-load of $$, while lesser-known foreign and independent films dealing with this subject matter in a more human, less manipulative fashion fall off the face of the earth."

I couldn't say the same about the past scenes. Firstly, the guy literraly forced the girl to go on a date with him, she did not like him at first. Secondly, her mother is such a terrible character, forces her quit her boyfriend and hide all his letters, but at the same time she keeps them as if she knew she will show them later on, come on, this is bad writting, it's the same concept as if you rob the bank, but save the money so you could have a chance to possibly give it back to bank later on... Thirdly, the girl is just so unlikable, she can't decide and makes a huge drama until she finnaly decides. To summarise, this could've been a fantastic romance film, but the whole past segment needs to be rewritten."

It may be a form of storytelling but it made me feel excluded, not part of the story, because I didn't feel to know the characters. And I must be honest, I don't blame just the screenplay, I think is also a choice of the director, and the actors are totally underused.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, it's a good movie, but is like a story about someone you've heard: it's interesting, you listen to it, but once it's finished your life go on, leaving few traces behind, totally not leaving a mark.<br/><br/>I watched and I kind of enjoyed, I didn't like the choices that were made, but I don't think are ""wrong"" choices, it's a good movie after all.

","The Notebook (2004) is a prequel movie based on the novel written by Nicholas Sparks. It won awards as MTV Movie Awards: Best Kiss, Teen Choice Award: The Best Movie Drama, BMI Music Film Award and some others.
The features ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""Textuality"" were inspired in this novel. Directed by Nick Cassavetes, who also directed the movies such as ""The Wraith, Blind Fury, Delta Force 3"".
The movie is about the young love of rich Allie (Rachel McAdams) and worker Noah (Ryan Gosling) from a family without financial resources. The setting is the 1940 decade in South Carolina. They meet in an Amusement park during the summer holidays and they stay desperately in love, but the young lady's parents don't approve of the dating because of their social differences. So, to avoid any approximation, her parents send her away.
For a year Noah writes to Allie every day but has no answer. Believing that Allie is no longer interested in him, Noah goes to World War II. Meanwhile Allie meets a charming officer when working in a Hospital. He served in the World War II, and belonged to a very wealthy family. So, when Noah returns to the small town years later, close to Allie's wedding, it soon becomes clear that the passion is not over yet. As her love for him still existed, she must choose between the fiancÃ© and her first love. Decades later, elder Allie suffer from AlzheimerÂ´s disease and lives in a nursing home.
A man visits her regularly and reads to her a notebook with ancient memories trying to bring back the moments that her illness is erasing. To find out who this man is, you need to watch the movie!!!
Those who like romance films, this is the movie for you. Very well directed, exploring a lot of chemistry and passion. The story involves you and has good dynamics. It's worthy to appear among the best novels of all time."

","The Notebook to me is the second best romance film of all time beaten out only by Ryan Gosling's 2016 masterpiece La La Land. The Notebook is sweet, romantic, and is a story within a story. The external plot of Duke in the nursing home is sweet and it allows you to sympathize with older couples as well as people who suffer from dementia. The beginning of the story is nice and Ryan does a beautiful job bringing emotion to Noah. Rachel McAdams also pulls off a convincing Allie that goes through a lot of character development. Noah spends the whole movie infatuated with Allie and it works. Allie however has the more interesting arc as her character starts as a prim rich girl who moves into a radical, fun loving, passionate, risky girl for the time period. She then is forced to go back to her roots only to end up back in his arms. The whole movie is filled to the brink with iconic and beautiful scenes that are constructed specifically to make your heart melt. Its ups are high and its lows are way down low but I think that that just adds to the experience."

I loved the chemistry between both Garner and Rowlands and between Gosling and McAdams. Their on screen love really does win the viewer over. The movie brings you into their story and all the complexities of it and makes you care about what happens to them in the end. We see the two fall in love when they're younger and we see them go through many ups and downs, then we see them years later when they're older, and your attention never strays. Not once. You don't lose interest because the actors and the writing is so well done. Nothing is boring or dull. If you like tasteful sweet sometimes steamy romance stories, then I definitely recommend The Notebook (2004). 8/10!"

","At first, I had to figure out what was going on in this movie, but once I figured it out, the main characters captured my heart. The movie had me soaring and crying at different parts, much like a roller coaster of emotions. Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands did a phenomenal job of portraying the main characters. Their story pulled at my heartstrings and touched me deeply. I have watched this movie several times and I know I will watch it again in the future. Brilliant piece of work. I would recommend it to anyone."
"leshyblog","9","1","2","18 July 2017"," The notebook
","The Notebook is a 2004 American romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes and based on the 1996 novel of Nicholas Sparks. The main actors are Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams who perform the role of two lovers who had a beautiful relationship. The film is a flashback because in the present the woman has Alzheimer, so the man tells her the story to remember her past. The positive things of the film are that it is based on a true story and it is very passionate. It shows the real love between the couple because the man always tries to help her and he stays by her side till her death. The negative things are that in the beginning you can suspect that the couple in the present is the same as the story which he is telling. To sum up, we highly recommend this movie because it's very realistic and makes you feel crazy in love."

","The Notebook has been considered for many one of the more best selling Nicholas Sparks adaptation films within the last decade and one of the more polarizing romance films. Opening back in 2004, the film was not as much of a hit back then but quickly became to be a bigger film as the years have passed. The first half of the film is quite shaky as we see the introductions of the characters, and the story settling in. <br/><br/>We watch it, knowing it must get better and as the second half approaches (about an hour in- once we see Ryan Goslin's character Noah with a beard), the film picks up a lot of momentum and becomes very entertaining and quite a thrilling watch. We can see why this movie has been praised by film goers through the years, though it does have its clichés although they do not get too much in the way of the story. Although predictable (as are most love stories), what works about the Notebook is the ending and the way the film is told within it's storytelling.<br/><br/>This film has been described by many as ""The Titanic"" of the 2000's, and that may be accurate as far as best selling/romance love adaptation book stories. Overall depending on your expectations, this film may not be as cheesy or lovey as one would expect. The chemistry and performances of the leads, along with the storytelling is what set this film apart from other films of the genre."

Even the enemies in this movie own and you hate them so much!!! Rachel Mcadms and Ryan Gosling will always be in the list of my favorite actors and actresses.

","I've seen The Notebook more times than I care to write. This movie is one of my favorites. The Notebook is one of the best romance films I've seen. It tells the story in flashback of Noah and Allie. They both come from very different backgrounds but that doesn't stop them falling in love. Of course Allie being from a rich upper class family,her parents discourage the relationship between her and Noah. They portray a love that every girl would love to have. It seems that no matter what paths they both go down they are always drawn back to each other. Noah never stopped loving Allie and vice a versa. I love it when they are both on the boat together feeding the ducks, it really is a beautiful scene. In the film you see Noah as now an older man reading to a woman who is now the older Allie,so it is showing that their love never died and they stick by each other til the end. I really think people enjoy this film because it really portrays true love and the true meaning of finding that one person you're destined to be with. Have the tissues ready!"

They fall in love but war and difference in social standing make them break up.<br/><br/>The story is beautiful and sad. So I always cry even if I've watched many times and I know the whole story. I think it is because we can empathize with Noah and Allie with two time bases. Maybe many people dreamed of love story like this, once. I can understand why this film won 12 awards.<br/><br/>And Allie's costume is very nice. She wears 1940s's clothes and it is colourful and rich.

I admit it was tedious, which means I feel like being manipulated within director's hands. It could not help Allie gave up with Lon because her mother, who also suffered from in the past in terms of marriage concealed letters from Noa. But it does not justify her action, right? It applies to Noa. I feel for him, but Martha was abandoned for their sake without describing that in detail. That point does not make sense. <br/><br/>I wanted to see psychological description of them. It was operated. It was not carnivalesque, <br/><br/>On the other hand, something bursts in me when I associate it with my life, in which I regret it in many points. It gave me many thoughts. It encouraged me.

","This movie is both beautiful and tear jerking in every way. It's a great adaption on the novel by Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are both very great at their roles in this. In the book Noah and Allie meet each other as teenagers in the 30's until they take a break from each other for 14 years and then reunite when Allie is engaged to Lon Hammond Jr and Lon Hammond lets Allie be with Noah cause he understood the love between them. Now in this movie Noah and Allie's relationship is both romantic and sometimes complicated. Despite their differences they were crazy for each other. Now the movie officially takes place during the 40's and that was during the time of segregation and Noah had an African American friend. Also when Noah and Allie were making love in Allies house, Allies parents come home and find them and Allies parents tell her to stay away from Noah and Noah had no choice but to leave Allie for a while. After that happened he goes off into war during World War 2 and he writes letters to Allie every day, but Allies mother hides the love letters from Noah and Allie meets Lon Hammond Jr and becomes engaged to him which is the worst mistake she makes. Then after the war Noah sees Allie again and they both have dinner together and go on a boat ride together until it starts to rain. Then they realize how much they've missed each other and make love in the house that Noah refurbished after it had been around since the early days of America. Then Allie realizes that she had to go back to Lon Hammond but Noah opposes this and asks Allie what her decision is and Allie decides to go back to Lon Hammond. When she goes back to him she tells him about Noah and their love for each other. At first Lon Hammond is angry about this but then decides to let Allie be with Noah. After this happens Noah and Allie get married and have beautiful children together and they also have grandchildren. Now they were living in a nursing home together cause Allie had Alzheimer's which is sad cause it happens to a lot of old people each year and one of the best ways to prevent Alzheimer's is to drink green tea. Every now and again though the Allie that Noah fell in love with and married comes around until the Alzheimer's Allie comes back and she loses her memory. Later that night which was their last night on Earth Noah crawls into bed with the sick Allie for he was dying as well since he had heart attacks before and to his very eyes the real Allie comes around one last time and this made Noah feel grateful. Then they both lie in bed and their souls descend into heaven. Indeed this is a very powerful and beautiful love story and one of the best love stories ever. Both sad and beautiful here."

I, along with almost every other person i have discussed the movie with, felt involved in the situations and the lives of the character- crying at the sad moments and feeling joy at the happy bits. in general, love stories are predictable and somewhat dull (in my opinion) yet this movie kept me guessing at the outcome, and delivered twists throughout the whole film.The Notebook was extremely well constructed and i would give it an eleven out of ten.

","As I'm a romantic person, I have seen a lot of romantic dramas and The Notebook has a very special resonance within me.<br/><br/>There are so many romantic movies in the market which feel redundant and not particularly bringing memorable souvenirs. But the Notebook is one of those films which is touching your deep soul because its story reflects what true, real love is and it can trump everything.<br/><br/>The Notebook tells the story of Noah and Ellie, two sweet souls who comes from entirely different worlds. He is a poor blue collar worker who lives in a small South Carolina town. She is a rich heiress from Charleston. They were never meant to be a couple but they fall in love and founded an amazing family despite the odds and their social ranks differences. Their story is told through an old man in an hospice in our nowadays era who is reading his own notebook to a fellow female resident struggling with dementia. It turns out that the old man is Noah, the female resident is Ellie and he is actually recounting their own love story so she could remember how much in love they are. They have 3 children and two grandchildren.<br/><br/>It's not the first time the theme of two people crazily loving each other despite their social ranks is used to make a movie but I felt transported by the grace of the actors and the feel good sensation transpiring from this sweet couple Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are forming. I could feel they shared some complicity even if I found out they were not very friendly to each other during the shooting but at the end they made it work.<br/><br/>There is no wonder this movie achieved a huge success and if you have the romantic fiber as I do, you will certainly cry especially at the end."

","First of all, this film is not a guide to romantic love, just as Saving Private Ryan was not a guide as to how to conduct a World War. Both films are originally based on a true story, but the charm of these stories is their exceptional nature. I guess we need miracles. Eternal first love is not just bliss in this film. Director Nick Cassavetes and his Romeo and Juliet, Canadian actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do depict the pain, heartbreak and misery that the stubborn lover cause each other and to others around them. The film really gets going when the former teen lovers of 1940 return from World War II, now adults. America has changed morally, their relationship is no longer quite as unimaginable and unrealistic as it used to be. For the viewer, the tension really builds up - something is bound to happen, and You will find yourself on the edge of your seat, biting your nails. The films is really well dramatized from the novel, the casting is perfect and Nick Cassavetes shows himself to be a masterful director. As a curiosity, she does direct her own mother Gena Rowlands here as well. The Notebook works on many levels. Even an old guy like me had to shed some tears here. However, the teen affair part of the film was a bit long and there were too many I love yous to merit more than 8 out of 10. Gosling and McAdams are great physical actors and pledge their love in electrifying fashion, there just was too much of a good thing here. This is an experience that will haunt you for some time."

A unsuccessful attempt imitation of ''Bridges of Madison County'' by Robert James Waller (and later film adaptation of Clint Eastwood). The film does not possess a fraction of sincerity nor the cognitive nor the emotional level. Acting on the amateur level, full emotional turns and worn-out cliché dialog. This does not mean that Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams do not possess remarkable acting talents! Simply, the lack of such a scenario has given this final product. What deserves praise are a lot of good shots of nature and solid costumes. We expected to 'swallow' what it is served on the big screen and to accept it as art.

","The Notebook is a brilliantly written intriguing story about two young lovers that most people can relate to. The movie describes how a summer love turned into a pure and inseparable love. The movie is filled with fabulous quotes and sentimental moments which makes people get lost in the story, and forget about their thoughts, or what is going on in the outside world.<br/><br/>The movie was adapted from the novel ""The Notebook"" by Nicholas Sparks. Nick Cassavetes directed the movie, making a great adaption. Ryan Gosling brings a great innocence to the role of Noah Calhoun in the film, one of the two main characters. Rachel McAdams plays the other half of the duo as Allie Hamilton. They both gave an astonishing performances along with James Garner who plays old Noah and Gena Rowlands who plays old Allie.<br/><br/>The old Allie has a disease called Alzheimer's which makes her forget about her old life, particularly her husband and the life they had spent together. The story unfolds as Old Noah reads her ""The Notebook"" comprising of their young love, how they met, how they fell in love, how their love grew.<br/><br/>Noah and Allie gave a remarkably convincing portrayal of a boy and a girl traveling down a very long road with no regard for the consequence of their unconditional love. Noah is a country boy, Allie is from city. Being from a wealthy family, she had the world at her feet while he didn't have two dimes to rub together. With Noah, Allie is a completely different person. She sees her life differently and does what she likes rather than what her parents wants for her. She is like a free bird flying high up in the sky, enjoying her life to the fullest. One of the narration of the movie says, ""The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach out for more, that plants a fire in our heart and brings peace to our minds"". That's what they gave each other and that's what people want in their life.<br/><br/>It does not matter whether you love romantic movies or hate them, this is NOT just a romantic movie it is so more than that. By the end of the movie you will feel a whole heap of emotions. It leaves it viewers to talk about the movie for a long time. This was one of the best movies I recently saw and would highly recommend to see this epic tale of love."
"chelseacowling","10","1","2","18 August 2015"," Truly beautiful
","I watched this film for the first time today, and wow, it is truly remarkable. The sincerity in Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel Mcadams) is astounding. The acting is beautiful and really makes you believe that they were in love. The plot is really quite simple but extremely affective, the old man Noah (James Garner) is reading a book to the old lady Allie (Gena Rowlands) about their life (due to her having Alzheimer's disease) to try make her remember the beautiful memories they shared as a couple. It really came as a shock to me when Allies mother revealed that she too was in love with a 'country boy' as that was unexpected from her being so against Noah and Allie being together but once that scene was presented it some how fell into place and made the story more understandable as to why she wanted her to make the 'right choice' afterwords. The scenes in the film which really tugged on my heart strings were when Allie came back to see Noah after realizing he'd made the house how she wanted and defying her fiancé just so she could be with Noah and reminisce on old memories. Although when they fought due to her fiancé looking for her and she chose to go see her fiancé I was in complete floods of tears thinking 'no!! How could you do this Allie he's in love with you' and all through the scene of her driving back to 'Seabrook inn' I was also in floods of tears with her until a sigh of relief wept over me when she returned to Noah. The final scene which really made me wail is the end scenes strictly focused on the old Allie and Noah, when Noah makes a recovery from the hospital and sneaks away to go see his wife and remarkably she remembers him, then when he lays next to her holds her hand and they fall asleep peacefully it is beautiful. The final scene is definitely the most upsetting of them all, the nurse comes in to the room to find Noah and Allie asleep together with Allie looking majorly pale she then touches her hand and it's evident that either Allie passed away or both passed away and that was it I just could not stop crying, this beautiful scene was the final piece of the story and it couldn't have been made in a better way. It summed up their love for each other. The only negative comment I have for this film is they could of made the scene in the war a little more sincere when Fin gets hit by a bomb, I don't think they spent enough time on it and jumped straight into Allie being in the hospital as a nurse. Overall this film is a romance which no woman or man should ever want to miss, but you should definitely get some tissues ready! 10 out of 10 it's truly beautiful."

Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect and give the characters such life, creating everlasting magic together.

We hope the love continues right up until the last minute, and in this story it does, strong and full.<br/><br/>I can't think of any way this movie could be improved.

","It took me a decade or so to catch up with this 2004 film, by which time its two young stars had carved out impressive careers: Ryan Gosling with leading roles like ""Drive"", ""The Ides Of March"" and ""The Place Beyond The Pines"" and Rachel McAdams with appearances in ""The Time Traveler's Wife"", ""Midnight In Paris"" and ""About Time"". In this early work of theirs, you can see why because Gosling as Noah and McAdams as Allie are utterly convincing as two immensely attractive young people crazily in love with one another in spite of the differences in class and personality.<br/><br/>The tale is told through the notebook of the title which, many years later, is read by Duke (James Garner) to a fellow inmate of his nursing home (Gena Rowlands) who is suffering from very serious dementia. It is a powerful story taken from the novel by Nicholas Sparks and ably crafted by director Nick Cassavetes, the son of Gena Rowlands and film director John Cassavetes.

The movie depicts one of so many Utopian conditions which broken hearted lovers would really prefer over their own sad endings. I really like Ryan Gosling's acting here. He can really maintain the calm character overall yet able to let go bursts of emotions. Rachel McAdams' performance provided the movie with the character in conflict well enough. But for me, I prefer that the character Allie can be played by other actresses who have more beautiful face than her. What's mentionable is that Gena Rowlands and James Garner, playing the older versions, can give acting performances which can balance what Gosling and McAdams have done and retained their characters. I like how this movie is even completed nicely even more with performance by Joan Allen, James Marsden, Sam Shepard, and Kevin Connolly"

Nowadays, almost every movie seems to be filled with an overload of CGI or some superhero/fantasy stuff (While I have to admit some fantasy and superhero films can be incredibly good, I 'm starting to become tired of the over-saturation of both genres)"
"TheFilmGuy1","7","1","2","16 August 2014"," Cheesy But Saved By Its Lead Performances
","The Notebook is a well known film. If you say ""romance film"", the first movie that pops into peoples minds is generally The Notebook. I would say they do because of two main reasons. The first reason being that it's written by Nicolas Sparks, the writer of tons of cheesy romance books, making it have some really cheesy elements to it, but I also believe that it's chemistry between its leads helps save this from falling flat. (Which is ironic because apparently Gosling hated McAdams when they were shooting and they didn't get along)<br/><br/>As I said, the film is quite cheesy. It uses many clichés that romance movies use, the biggest probably being the ""rich girl loves poor boy whom her parents disapprove of"" cliché. There's also a lot of unrealistically cheesy stuff with the whole Alzheimer's's thing, making it just seem ridiculous. You can tell a lot of things are written to be overly romantic or tug on your heart strings without much regard as to what makes sense. That's not to say there aren't good romantic things here. Sometimes love and romance can be cheesy in real life, that's just the way it is, so you kind of have to accept things to a certain degree. Moments such as the kiss in the rain or love scene really work, but I think that's all because of the chemistry between Gosling and McAdams. <br/><br/>This really is a film saved by its performances. Moments that would seem awkward or cheesy if done with other actors seem more believable between Gosling and McAdams, totally boosting the quality of this film. Gosling comes across as a really love struck guy who you feel for, and McAdams pulls off that beautiful and fun but slightly naive and unsure girl role perfectly. I honestly think this movie would be another stupid film to appeal to unrealistic female fantasies if it wasn't for these performances.<br/><br/>Overall, I think this film is well known in the romance genre for a reason. It's got cheesy moments but stuff that works. I do believe, however, that it's way more easily enjoyed by people who are currently in love or in a relationship or whatever, because if you haven't experienced it, you just won't feel the feelings that Gosling and McAdams wonderfully express in their best moments. If you're single and lonely... you will hate this film big time."

","I have to say I'm usually not so fond of movies about of this sort, so when I decided to watch this one I'd had many prejudices already, but I also have to say I took everything back as soon as I started to sob like crazy at the end. Before watching it, I read the Nicholas Sparks' novel, which I couldn't enjoy at all. Too short periods, way too many breaths to take between a sentence and another. I don't like his style at all, and this is the only movie based on his works I've watched so far, but in all honesty it is worth watching. We are introduced by a blood-red view of a lake where someone is rowing a boat in the distance. In the background a nostalgic music plays as a flock of birds flies over and we see an old woman looking at this scene from a window. We soon get to know that she suffers from Alzheimer and she can't even remember her name anymore. Also, we get to know that a cheerful old man, Duke, reads for her every day, something that she can't remember as well. They are both taken care by the staff of a nursing home. The two of them spend their time together in the beautiful locations of such structure reading the story about two young people who fell in love in the summer of 1940 in Seabrook Island, South Carolina. Those two are Noah and Allie, a country boy and a very wealthy heiress from Charleston. If you decide to give a chance to this movie, you'll see how they fell in love despite of their social gape and how they will (obviously) get separated because of her parents, who consider their a mere summer love which can only bring trouble. Also, you will see how they got back together after seven years, after the war and other events had taken place. The last thing I'll tell you, is that Noah and Allie are indeed Duke and his fellow patient, who will decide to do something extremely beautiful and heartbreaking at the end. I'm honestly too lazy to spoil everything, because I'm not that interested to do so, even if what I just wrote might sound like the description of one of the cheapest dramas ever. I assure you it's not like that at all, and I assure you you're going to cry at the end, maybe not for half an hour straight as I always do. Maybe yes, who knows. At this point, I don't even know what to write anymore. I just love how beautiful, touching, gentle and sincere such a story is told. I can relate on a ridiculously high level to the hardships Noah and Allie went through, and this may be the real reason why I rated this movie as ""excellent"", which at some point is not even enough in my opinion. The couple during its last last act is pictured with simplicity, flawlessly: James Garner and Gena Rowlands are perfect, credible. They don't need to enrich their performances with any useless effort, they portray two people their same age with affection, letting us feel the love that have bounded them together for so many years. Same goes for Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams and the great work they did as the same couple, as young Noah and Allie who met during that summer that changed their life forever. We don't just watch them as they simply kiss and have fun: she slaps and hits him when they have a fight, they yell at each other, he tells her she's a pain in the ass most of the time. They cry, they experience what a breakup feels like, they try to move on and never forget about each other and they finally decide to spend their lives together despite of all the regrets they might have in the future. And then they will write the final lines of that book together, as they have always been. What we learn from The Notebook, is the all-time-classic fact that ""true love never dies"". Yes, that's it. It's not like there's any other deep meaning in this story, there is nothing else apart from that one simple quote that can summarize it in a better way. But there is something else underneath, a warmth, an assurance, a light caress that whispers us not to be sad in the end. It tells us to fight, to be strong and have some good determination and stubbornness to get what we really want, to keep loving even if in doing so we may encounter every toughest difficulty. I'm still uncomfortable with the rate I gave to this movie because there are few details that don't convince me, situations that may give false hope in real life because you can only talk about miracles in those moments, but every time I try to hold back my tears in front of the bright screen, any doubt just goes straight to hell. I'd suggest everyone to watch The Notebook. Those who have always loved to see how such stories can be portrayed will definitely fall for this one and I bet that even the most skeptical will reconsider their opinion about the genre. Again, I'm wondering if I should ponder my judgement a bit more and go for a 9 instead of a 10. This really makes me feel uneasy, but then the last scene flashes in front of my eyes and an affectionate ""oh shut the hell up"" from my inner self echoes in my head."

","This movie is perfect for someone who loves to laugh and cry a lot! At the beginning of the movie it was a little slow but as you get to the Ferris Wheel part, it gets interesting! The whole plot of the movie is about a guy, Noah, who is trying to remind the love of his life, Allie, how much they meant to each other when they were in their twenties because she lost most of her memory as she grew older. This movie switches back and forth between seeing the old couple and seeing them when they were young. When you get to the middle, you will see Noah and Allie's kids. You will hear them asking if Grandma remembers yet. This part is very important because it shows that not only did it effect the couples relationship but it effects the entire family's relationship. If you want to find more about them and what Noah and Allie go through you have to watch the movie! You won't regret it."

","This is one of my all time favorite movies. I read the novel ""The Notebook"" by American novelist Nicholas Sparks based on a true story. The novel & movie compare greatly in my opinion, except for the endings. <br/><br/>Possible Spoiler! Depending on what you consider a spoiler! <br/><br/>The novel ending was OK, but the movie ending was the best ending for the story ever possible. They couldn't have made it any more awesome, in the movie, for this story! Loved the movie (& Novel), Love the cast, all extraordinary actors & actresses! Loved the time setting also.

","The Notebook is set in two time frames. There is the present day setting in a nursing home where James Garner is telling a romance story to Gena Rowlands who is a dementia patient.<br/><br/>The story he tells from a notebook is about a young country boy (Ryan Gosling) having a romance with a socialite played by Rachel McAdams. The social divide keeps them apart before World War 2 intervenes.<br/><br/>The past and present then mesh as we realise the fate of the characters. It is well acted, well have you ever seen James Garner give a duff performance?<br/><br/>For Ryan Gosling who may be one of the most edgiest actors in Hollywood at the moment, he plays probably his most normal character yet.<br/><br/>The initial flashbacks are a bit corny but once it gets going it has a charm of its own."
"rosshannahr","9","1","2","24 September 2013"," The Notebook is a romantic story about a young couple told by an elderly man in a nursing home. Twists and turns along the way make it a fantastic movie.
","The Notebook is compelling movie about an older man named Duke (James Garner) who reads the life story of a young couple to a patient who has Alzheimer's disease (Gena Rowlands). The movie is based on the whimsical tale by Nicholas Sparks that reached number one best seller. In film version, The Notebook is still worth the hype. It takes a classic love story and fills the in the lines with a little added spice. Making a series of events in the young couple's life a little more dramatic or humorous, the director (Nick Cassavetes) takes a simple novel and transforms it into a motion picture that will not be forgotten. What truly makes the movie a memorable experience is the terrific, developed plot that is enhanced by the extremely talented and animated actors, and the convincing nature of the film. The picture goes in and out from the perspective of Duke and the charming elderly patient to the story of Allie and Noah. While focusing on the nursing home, Garner really shows his talent, taking an upbeat and dedicated role. He shows his versatility as he goes from a fun loving man who narrates to a man sobbing, pouring out heartfelt emotion. On the other half of the movie, the story of Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams) and Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) follows the romantic journey of this young couple. The chemistry between these two actors brings the movie up to a new caliber. Through various stages in their relationship the audience experiences the emotional connection of the two. Even in a simple scene where the Allie and Noah just lie in the middle of the road together, McAdams and Gosling show the humor, romance, and differences in their relationship. The quote that sums up the scene is Allie asking Noah a question, ""What happens if a car comes?"" and Noah responds with the humorous answer, ""We die."" McAdams and Gosling put on such a fantastic show that the viewer cannot help but feel as if he or she were right there with them in the road as well as with the rest of the film.<br/><br/>The authentic feeling is carried out by the impressive scenery and brilliant camera-work. Director and cinematographer (Robert Fraisse) create an atmosphere that welcomes movie goers to be a part of Allie and Noah's life. Their talent is clearly shown in the lake scene where trees and swans surround the couple to bring a sense of peace and calm- a much needed with the growing tension from the two being apart for so long. Zooming in, switching between the characters at just the right moments to create an intimate feeling, the audience is drawn in at this critical moment in the lovers' lives. <br/><br/>The tale of Allie and Noah is not constant romance however, which is part of why it is such a good movie. Yes, there are plenty of moments that hit the heartstrings of women and men all over, but there are also rich dynamics to the film. The two struggle with staying together with various outside influences trying to tear them apart, and some do! Just as a crucial decision Allie is about to make, the director switches the focus back onto Duke and the elderly patient to reveal of twist in the story, keeping the movie intriguing and fresh. The Notebook is a phenomenal movie that makes the audience laugh, cry, and wish they had something like the complex and beautiful relationship of Allie and Noah."

"vincentlynch-moonoi","7","1","2","15 April 2013"," Boy, was I wrong
","I really didn't expect to like this movie. I didn't particularly like the cast, particularly Ryan Gosling and James Garner. And I sort of expected it to be a juvenile tale of young love.<br/><br/>Well, it is a tale of young love, but told in a very mature manner...and in a way that shows that all endings are not happy...yet in their own way can be fulfilling. And that alone earned it some extra stars in my eyes.<br/><br/>As time has gone by, I've begun to realize that I have to re-examine Ryan Gosling. He's not an actor I want to like, and I'm not enamored with several of the films he's selected, but every time I've watched one of his films, I've been impressed. And as much here, as anywhere.<br/><br/>I was also not very familiar with Rachel McAdams...but wow! She's tremendous as the young seventeen year old girl! I never cared much for James Garner...oh, an occasional role here and there. In this film he was charming, and perfect for the role as the story teller. But...I did have a little difficulty seeing him as the old Ryan Gosling...physically I can see no resemblance whatsoever. That was distracting.<br/><br/>I have never seen Gena Rowlands (as the old lady) more beautiful and poignant. Joan Allen is, in my view, a much underrated actress, and I wish we saw much more of her. More and more I see James Marsden as a dependable ""sleeper"" of an actor whom I respect. The one real casting error, from my perspective, was David Thornton, whom I just can't see as the father of the young lady.<br/><br/>A remarkably good and sensitive film. Highly recommended, and I bet it's found a spot on many a home's DVD shelf."
"binnydeman","10","1","2","15 February 2013"," Summary
","OK I am a guy and I absolutely loved this movie. I have never even met a person who just said this movie plain out sucked, because it is so genuine and amazing. The Notebook is the one romance I will actually gladly sit through. I sort of saw it with my sisters and mother as a young boy, but only remember the ""barn scene"", which happened due to natural reasons. However, after my friend convinced me to see this I was elated that I did. The movie is the perfect resemblance of young and first love, it is genuine and something incredibly special. Most summer romance are intimate, hot, exciting, and gleeful, however, they always lack enough time. I myself had a romance like this and many other have as well. It is a beautiful time, the sun is shining people are smiling and you're feeling in the moment. The Notebook is the perfect resemblance of what everyone once felt enjoying their summer romances. The effect of Allie's and Noah's rendezvous is incredible. Event hough, most people will not continue these summer romances or even see those people they have a special place in our hearts. Noah and Allie were the perfect actors, this movie pushed their careers into the great state they are in currently, which is especially true for Ryan Gosling. One of the reasons why Gosling's and McAdams's love explodes off the screen is because of their actual relationship outside of the movie. The vintage scenes with the cars, cinema, WWII, etc.. make this movie for me even a little bit better. It happens today, as well, but back then relationships were based on romance and pure craziness about two people, today it seems to be all about the sexual pleasures. The intermitting scenes with the old people house and Noah's and Allie's young lives build a beautiful connection and the last few scenes with lines such as, ""Our love can do miracles"", and ""I'll be seeing you"" are the first time since the Lion King and the Pokemon movie as a little kid that I almost cried. The Notebook is not the best movie ever because the acting wasn't Inception, Batman, or Shawshank Redemption like. However, this is the most genuine movie I have ever seen. Even as a guy living in a sex oriented world, I appreciate true love and long for such moments and connection as Allie and Noah shared. It also does not have the same story line as every chick-flick, but has something special to it. The Notebook is a wonderful movie, the best of its kind."

","The Notebook is a romantic drama film directed by Nick Cassavetes, based on the romance novel of the same title by Nicholas Sparks. It stars Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as a young couple who fall in love during the early 1940's. Their story is narrated from the present day by an elderly man played by James Garner, telling the tale to a fellow nursing home resident, played by Gena Rowlands.<br/><br/>The film's story revolves around Noah Calhoun's regular visits to a female patron of an area nursing home. Rather than bore her with the inanities of everyday life, Calhoun reads from an old, faded notebook containing the sweeping account of a young couple whose love affair was tragically put to a halt after their separation in the midst of World War II. Seven years later, the couple was reunited, and, despite having taken radically different paths, they found themselves unable to resist the call of a second chance.<br/><br/>Bland and sentimental, the movie is old-fashioned filmmaking aimed at an old-fashioned viewers.But nevertheless,It's hard not to admire its unabashed sentimentality.It is definitely too clumsily manipulative put tears into the viewer and good enough to rise above its melodramatic clichés."

","'The Notebook' is a lovely, sweet film based on the novel of the same name written by Nicholas Sparks. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams have a touching chemistry throughout this film that it brings tears to your eyes. Romance is not really my cup of tea, but I watched this with some friends once and did manage to cry a little. The story takes a while to get going, but once it's all set then it is worth following. The romance is tacked on for the majority of the picture, but the truth at the end of the film makes the moment sweet and touching. This movie is definitely one that any romance fan will want to see again and again. If you want a movie that can make your boyfriend cry, then check out 'The Notebook.'"

","I can truly relate to this movie as both my parents suffered from Alzheimers disease. My dad has passed away but my mum is in a nursing home. She has bouts of remembering who I am and at other times she does not know. It is a story that everyone should watch, as it can bring most people to tears. It is so full of emotion, and heartbreak for everyone that was in close contact with Ellie. I have the DVD and I can watch over and over. It is such a debilitating disease that it has such an emotional impact on close ones, and this is highlighted so clearly by the husband and the dramatic changes by his wife. I admired and appalled him for the support,love and understanding at the most difficult times that he gave to his wife. The fact that he never gave up and her and cared for her right to the final end. It is so true when you say your wedding vows, till death do us depart. I thing this movie deserves recognition in the fact that he showed how the disease can affect the human mind, it is uncontrollable,degrading at times and so heart wrenching for all involved in the process of loss of memory. In fact most people go through the grieving stage during the various stage of the disease and not after the person passing away. I have such vivid memories of this movie unlike any other movie that I have seen and forgotten after a certain period of time. I love this movie and will keep watching until my memory fades, which is a strong possibility as the disease runs in both sides of the family. I think a lot of people can relate to what I am trying to express. I hope day there is a cure."

","There are not a lot of movies that can awake powerful emotions within me, but this one certainly did it. From the very beginning I had a good feeling about it (just one scene with James Garner and I was bought). First of all, this movie has a marvelous tale. The way it develops is just magical. The shift from the past to the present et vice versa is done so well that not once have I regretted it. I was so consumed by the story that I simply didn't want this movie to end. The acting is superb! Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were brilliant in their roles. The aging of their characters for teenagers to grown persons, I had a feeling, was done without a bit of difficulty at their end. The characters they played simply fitted them in every way. But, I must say that Garner has, as had Gosling, magnificently played his role. The emotions. That is the most powerful asset of this movie. Happiness, sadness, love... It's all there. The movie touches one not because of the scene itself but because of everything one sees before the scene. The movie made me remember my love, and it made me cry. The only reason I gave it 9/10 is the predictability. Somewhere at the middle of the movie I just knew how it would end, but I did not expect the ending itself. Watch this with your girlfriend/wife/husband/boyfriend and remember that true love never dies."

","I watched The Notebook for the first time about 3 years ago (2008). I had never really fancied watching it before but it was on TV and I wanted to watch the film after it so I kept it on and watched the whole thing. It grabbed me right from the start. Sweet, fun Noah instantly falls in love with the organised Allie. He's poor. She's rich. Her family thinks it's just a ""summer romance"". But only they know it's real. I've watched it about 8 times and I still go through a couple dozen tissues and I whistle out of my nostrils. And I'm pretty sure my heart breaks a little every time I watch it. Needless to say, I always watch this movie alone, apart from the company of some chocolate or ice cream, because you can guarantee I'll be a mess. Every time I watch it I think to myself. There is no other man in the World quite like Noah. He loves Allie unconditionally even though she leaves for years without a word. Moral of the story. You never forget the person you love. The audience this film is aimed at is mostly women. Women who want love or has lost it. This film touches a part of you you never knew existed... Well it did for me anyway. It upsets me knowing that I will never have a Noah, but always go after the things you love the most. The characters you love and hate. Some you hate like the Mum, but then kind of understand her near to the end as she has been in Allie's shoes at sometime in her life so she know's what she is talking about. I give this film a huge 10/10. It literally is the only film that has made me think about life and love in a different way."

","I've avoided watching this movie for many years but I caved and watched because it was so highly praised among many females.I personally am not a romance,chick-flick, kind of movie-goer,but if a movie is given such high credit; I must watch it to see what makes everyone swoon. <br/><br/>The acting was decent.The cinematography was great.The script typical.<br/><br/>I will not bash on how cliché this movie was because I understand that it is a chick-flick.Wanting it to be more than that is like asking your car to cook you breakfast; it's just not possible.The film was created for women/men who like romance and if that's not you,it's okay,it wasn't meant for you.<br/><br/>My greatest predicament with this movie was that it was bland.There could have been more spice to it.There could have been more complications that the characters had to face to be together and not just distance or parental disapproval. <br/><br/>When the film was over and I sat in front of my television watching the credits roll, I had to ask myself, ""What made this movie so great to some people?"" Don't get me wrong, I found the movie to be enjoyable, partially because I had nothing better to do,but for many this movie is on their top 10 list of favorites and I just don't see why. There are films out there that accomplish what this movie did and much more but yet this film is put on a pedestal. <br/><br/>I give this movie a 3/10. 1 point for creating a way to make women fantasize about a dream guy who can't have another woman but you. 1 point for the execution of the setting;very alluring. 1 point for Noah's dad.(he was awesome)<br/><br/>I will not watch this movie again.

The saddest part for me was to see Allie suffering from dimension because as the movie progresses you really are able to connect with Allie as a character, and when it is discovered she has dimension its as if her whole life, beautiful story is gone. Amazing jobs by all 4 main characters Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, James Garner, and Gena Rowland's. They were brilliant at the roles, each portraying the character to the best that I had expected. I had read this book and expected like most, the movie to be horrible compared to the book because in most cases that is how it works. I was happily wrong, this movie beat the book! I loved the detail of the younger area of their love, and it seemed their was more passion in the movie then book. For example the scene when Allie chooses to go back to Lon, In the book it was very dry with no real emotion. But the movie Ryan gosling takes control and shows really whats at lose<br/><br/>I seriously suggest watching this movie, though it does make you expectations for men a lot higher."

I saw the film a couple of days ago on Oxygen and I remembered why I truly like this movie. With its era in time and the flash backs between past and present it creates a wonderful story line of true love that opens your heart to all the possibilities in reality. Though reality's story can never be as compelling as Noah (Ryan Gossling) and Allie's (Rachel McAdams), one can only dream. The actors in this particular film did an outstanding job at portraying the Southern classes in that specific time period and in creating an immense chemistry between the two characters. I personally have never read the book, but this movie conveys so much emotion and I can't fathom how much emotion is portrayed through the book.

","I know this is a late review for a 2004 film, but last night I finally had the pleasure of watching this movie, in company of the love of my life and I have to say this movie touched me in so many ways (good ways), that it is hard to explain the scope and depth of it, while masked as a typical romance, the story follows a young couple from very different social environments during the middle 30s, they are deeply in love with each other and there is such passion between them, the chemistry shown on screen is great, both Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling do a great job, the way they talk, the way they smile, the way they move and touch each other, it is completely believable. Though the longest portion of the movie plays as a standard romance movie, it has a sub-plot running in the background which I will not reveal, because it is by far the best part of the movie and at the very end it becomes very important and the most touching and moving part of the movie.<br/><br/>I must admit that is not a movie that will appeal everyone, this is a sweet, moving and at times very intriguing movie, the editing is amazing, the photography leaves you breathless and the art department deserves a special mention too, all the costumes are perfectly designed, the outfits are a delight to watch.<br/><br/>The sound department made also a great job, both the sound mixing and editing as well as the musical score are wonderful to hear, the score runs smoothly with the scenes without distracting you from what's going on, not for one single second.<br/><br/>I cannot recommend enough this movie if you enjoy romance and drama, especially well acted, beautifully shot and effectively directed romance and drama, you will find yourself laughing at the very clever yet simple humor and roughly half an hour later crying at a very emotional scene.<br/><br/>If you have any doubts about watching this movie, or if you haven't seen it yet but want to do it, do yourself a favor, don't wait any more and get it and watch it. But do yourself a favor and do it in company of your significant other, this is not a movie to watch alone, is a movie to share with the one you love.<br/><br/>10/10"

","I'll keep this short. I have never read a Nicholas Sparks book or seen one of his movies. But this movie was excellent. I don't get into chick flicks so I've avoided this movie, but this wasn't a chick flick as much as it was a movie that simply tugged at your heart through all the ups and downs. I'd never seen Rachel McAdams before and thought she was wonderful. I've seen Ryan Gosling and typically like his work. They were both powerful in their portrayals. I read one review that thought Gosling should have shown more emotion/passion in his portrayal but I thought he played it perfectly - embroiled with internal emotion while revealing very little of it. It is very much the way men tend to operate.<br/><br/>Excellent story line, breadth of characters and flow for the work. I'm a guy and I know it's a bit taboo, but if you don't cry at some point in this movie (esp. towards the end), you're just not human. :) Rent it, DVR it or buy it - any option is good, just see this movie. Probably in my top 20 all time."

","This film is so brilliant in every aspect and ranks at the Top of any list of great love story movies. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are superb in the role of two star-crossed lovers who experience all the joys and heartbreaks of unconditional love as do James Garner and Gena Rowlands as lovers in their twilight years. The rest of the cast is also top notch including Joan Allen, as a controlling, but penitent mother and Sam Shepard as a down-to-earth, caring father. The story is simple but it rings so true that it moves one's heart and tear ducts. The cinematography is stunning, the direction well-paced, the music score not to sugary, bland or predictable, but just right to add to the perfection of this film. All the chemistry is there on the screen and it just draws you in to the story almost immediately. Normally, I prefer unconventional love stories like ""Marty"" or ""The African Queen"", but this one strikes a perfect chord for me and I highly recommend it."

","This is a perfect love story beginning in an old folks home, where James Garner is reading a story from a notebook to a lady in the home. The story flashes back to a chance meeting at a carnival where Ryan Gosling meets Rachel McAdam and after a shaky start they fall in love. The acting from Gosling and McAdam is perfect, as is that of James Garner and Geena Davis. The film is totally engrossing and leaves the viewer guessing as to the outcome through the whole film. I wont spoil the ending as it is pivotal to the film. Suffice it to say that it had me moist eyed and not many films do that!<br/><br/>It is an absolute must-see if you are a lover of romantic films, for its excellent capture of the era and its faultless performances.

","A film that if you look too closely at you can find probably lots of things not to like, but James Garner and Gena Rowlands along with Rachel McAdam keep it going along very smoothly. Underplayed by the director and writer, the schmaltz is kept under control, even though you can guess the end and the plot from early on. It is meant to be a love story with lots of ups and downs, and the ride is worthwhile. The story is told by an old couple looking back (in flashbacks) to an old love affair. Plenty of clichés, but the parents trying to keep the young lovers - one rich one poor - apart are not over the top, plot twists are just about believable, and the acting envelopes you, except for the really cynical and those who want their bagel and cheese (eg let's have the whole family feel good, and not neglected!). What really saves this film and promotes it above the dross and cliché of others is the firm portrayal of Alzheimers' - Gena Rowlands only remembers herself in short passages, and when she regresses you see the impact on those around, especially her lover. It is cruel and very moving. Don't complain about the ending, it is not real, it is fantasy so that US audiences can have a happy walk out of the cinema. Surely it's obvious to anyone with a tenth of a brain!"
"grooveF111","Null","1","2","11 April 2009"," pretty sweet film
","I had no intention of EVER seeing this, but a couple of friends recommended it, so I thought I'd give it a chance. After all, it does have James Garner and Gena Rowlands in it, not to mention Joan Allen and Sam Shepard, the latter two coming as a complete surprise to me. I've loved James Garner from back in the Support Your Local Sheriff days, and I always enjoyed him in The Rockford Files. And we all know Joan Allen can do no wrong, which gave me hope that this wouldn't be a complete waste of 2 hours. To be honest, it wasn't nearly as bad as I always thought it would be. But in my opinion, it's Garner and Rowlands that make it watchable, not Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. McAdams is OK as Allie, but I have problems with Gosling's performance, and Gosling in general. It probably has something to do with the fact that I can't help remembering he used to be on that idiotic TV show Breaker High. I just don't agree with a lot of reviewers who see him as the second coming of Marlon Brando, although he does have that mumbling thing down pat. He was pretty good in Fracture and Half Nelson, although I didn't think he deserved an Oscar nomination. That should have been Jack Nicholson's. He also has a tendency to smirk at inappropriate times, which makes me want to give him a good slap. Anyway, the beginning of this movie definitely stretches the limits of credulity. OK, Noah falls madly in love with Allie on first sight. I can accept that. She's gorgeous. But here's how he goes about winning her heart. First, he dangles by one hand from a ferris wheel, and then he gets her to lie down in the middle of the street with him, which leads to them almost getting run over by an approaching car. Smooth! But the crazy thing is, it actually works. Before you know it, she's also madly in love with him! I'm sorry, but I don't buy it. If I was her, I would be getting as far away from that maniac as I possibly could. But then there would have been no movie, so on we go. It's pretty standard romance novel stuff. Girl's parents forbid her to see boy from wrong side of tracks, girl and boy fight, they break up, she moves away, he goes off to war, loses his best friend, becomes a man, returns home, eventually boy and girl get back together, and so on, and so on. It's not terrible, but it's really nothing special either. And I really think the story could have been written better. There's a point in the film where Garner calls Rowlands Allie for the first time, and then we see their children, and they're calling him Dad and her Mom. At that point, we know they got married and had kids, which took away some of the mystery for me. I have to admit there were a few scenes that got to me, though. Particularly the scene where Noah tells Allie that he wrote her all those letters, and also when she returns to find that he's renovated the old house exactly as she had described it. I do have a heart, I guess. But overall, not really my kind of movie, and at no time while watching it did I believe that Ryan Gosling could ever have transformed himself into James Garner, no matter how old he got!"

","One of the most overrated movies i have ever seen. I have no idea why people like this film so much. I find it to be over sentimental rubbish. I find this film is you either love it or you hate it. I for one hated it. If you want a proper romantic film watch stuff like roman holiday, Fabuleux destin d'Amélie Poulain, Le and eternal sunshine. This film was thrown upon me by members of my youth group saying to me 'you should see it. its so sad' well i did see it and i was totally disappointed.

","After putting off watching this film for many years, I finally bought the DVD earlier this year and decided to lose my 'the Notebook virginity' and take the plunge - now I have seen this film way more many times than I care to count, and am still loving every moment of it.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Allie Hamilton, a fun loving, hard-working, 17 year old girl from a very rich family, who, during a summer holiday at Seabrook, falls deeply in love with Noah Calhoun, a poor boy who loves her back with all his heart. But summer romances cannot last forever and eventually Allie's mother, Anne Hamilton, decides to interfere, telling her daughter that she was not born and brought up to waste her life on trash like Noah. The family leave the next day and return to the city, and although Noah writes to Allie everyday for the next day, not one of the 365 letters reached Allie because her mum, Anne, would hide them away. Eventually, believing all is over between her and Noah, Allie falls in love with the rich, intelligent and successful Lon Hammond Jr, and agrees to marry him, but her destiny was inter wined with Noah's, and it won't let her escape that easy.<br/><br/>The film is a romance, but whilst that category often induces terms such as 'cheesy, soppy, predictable, clichéd' etc, 'the Notebook' breaks every one of them and gives a refreshing and different account of a story told too many times over for many, many years. The script is incredibly well written (except for a few awkward parts) considering it's genre, and the parts acted brilliant by all involved. Stand out performance must go to Rachel McAdams and Joan Allen (as Allie and her mother), although Ryan Gosling, James Marsden, David Thornton and Starletta DuPois probably all deserve a mention too.<br/><br/>(slight spoilers in this paragraph) One of my main faults with this film is that the Noah we see in the present time (the old Noah) is a completely different person to the Noah we see in the story. There are no similarities between the two characters, except for their undying love for Allie, and although I understand that this may be to prevent the first time viewers from guessing the ending, it also takes away from the film by making it seem far less genuine.<br/><br/>I do love this film, but it is by no means one of the greatest films ever made. It is a beautiful tale of love, and the film grows on you and continues to surprise you on subsequent viewings 9which really is the mark of a good film), but being in the genre of romance it is rather limited, and although a very heart-warming and sad story, it will not be one to change the face of the film industry for years to come, but instead will be a film that many will enjoy, though no one could claim it to be the greatest film ever to be made."

","I have to admit, it is OK to watch to a degree. The story isn't too bad in trying to tell the story of a young love. However, it is easy to pick up early on that the old man telling the story is the husband of the woman is having memory lapses repeatably.<br/><br/>The story is rather corny to some extent. Its a love than can't be contained by social standards and norms. That is apparent during the love story with the servants of African descent. But having any servants shows prestige. The man is from a construction family. They aren't the elites, but many construction workers make rather good money with enough experience.<br/><br/>Anyway, the ending is fitting for the couple, but it isn't all to surprising considering the condition the film shows both of them to be in. And lets not forget, both of them broke hearts and family relations to be together. They certainly caused pain for their love. But, overall its average. I wasn't disappointed, but I wasn't thrilled.

","Regarded by many as one of the greatest chick flicks ever made (many would say the best love story), 'The Notebook' has become very widely-viewed and popular. It has many flaws. The acting of the younger lovers is not too great, and the sappiness can be exhausting at times. On top of all that, the film goes on far too long.<br/><br/>BUT... If you can allow yourself to look past all of that, what you will find is a genuinely touching love story. Indeed, you probably have a heart of stone if some scenes don't honestly move you. Trust me, I'm not one for dumb cheesy Hollywood romances, but the older pair of this film is lovely. Gena Rowlands deserved a Best Supporting Actress nomination for her smaller role.<br/><br/>The best way to watch 'The Notebook' is by forgetting inhibitions and letting yourself become absorbed in the emotion of the story.

","All I'd heard of this movie was ""It's so good,"" and ""even guys like it, it'll make you cry."" Well all of the parts designed to make me cry caused me to laugh uncontrollably. Everything that was a flashback was cheesy, but the good cheesy that you'd expect from a romance movie. The characters were likable (loveable even), the story was engaging, and it had a good pace. But it was completely ruined by the parts that took place in the present.<br/><br/>The old people parts ruined this flick. I'm sure it was fine in a book, but come on! You've got to stunningly attractive young people (McAdams, Gosling) that become the creepiest looking old farts. Did you see their children? MUTANTS! MUTANTS, I tell you.<br/><br/>Come on, you're telling me that sexed up Allie and Noah's are going to produce a litter look like they just fell of the short bus on the way to the mutant registration office. Did you see their son?! RIDICULOUS! It was a seemed more like a weak plot device to have them get old and die together rather than an integral part of the story. It didn't do a damn thing for the story or the characters other than point out how horrible it is to get old. It was like they didn't have anywhere for the movie to go after Allie chose Noah over Cyclops. It should have ended there with Allie painting naked on her balcony and Noah drinking beer and being pensive or whatever it was that he did. WEAK! <br/><br/>Really, I understand that the movie is called ""The Notebook"", but they could have found a more original/interesting/less predictable/better way to incorporate that. How about cast a couple of kids that looked like they would have been the offspring of two hard-bodied, sexpots, and have them read it after the death of their parents? Or just show Noah as an old man writing it down reminiscing after the death of his wife. Her crackpot dementia turned this movie from what could have been a good romantic flick to having it go down like a geriatric 50 First Dates (which sucked in the first place).<br/><br/>Also, did you notice that Noah only had a southern accent when he had his little cap on? It was lost as soon as he took it off. That was kinda weak too.<br/><br/>Take my advice, read the summary on the back of the box, imagine feeling lukewarm for about an hour and a half then being disappointed, then rent something else. Alternately, have your finger on the Fast Forward button and zip through any scene that has old people in it, believe me, it will be better this way."

","After being told time and time again by my female friends to ""watch The Notebook, you'll cry soooo much!"" I finally did it, alone, in the privacy of my own home, so that if it was too terrible I could deny ever having seen it later.<br/><br/>It was almost exactly what I expected it to be. Boy from lower class meets girl from upper class, separated by parents, reunited by chance years later, girl has to decide between the man she loved at 17 and her fiancée, who represents the world she ""belongs"" in. Sound familiar? It should, it's a plot that's been worn thin through overuse, and a charming performance by Rachel McAdams is not enough to give it new life. Nicholas Sparks, known mostly for for his even greater offender on the sentimental scene, A Walk to Remember, seems more interested in constructing a tale that entertains due to its predictability and tried-and-true appeal, not its originality or the freshness of dialogue, setting, or character. Despite showing a few impressive chops, Ryan Gosling fails to break out of the stock underdog role, and achieves his distinctive moments only during the moments where he's pitted against McAdams in their frequent fights, not during the love scenes themselves.<br/><br/>The real charm of this movie, for me, was the structure that the story is set against. An old man reads the story of the two young lovers to an old woman suffering for the last stages of Alzheimer's, a routine that we are given to understand happens every day. This elderly act of love is a thousand times sweeter and more convincing than any part of the story he retells--though Sparks can't resist tossing in further cheap sentiment by constant references to an expected ""miracle"" that will cure his companion's disease.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is impressive. The sets and directing are generally above par, but cannot save the movie from being a typical chick-flick tear jerker. It has redeeming qualities, certainly, but after watching it I felt the hype it's received as ""a perfect and enduring love story"" was not fully deserved. In a few years, it will still have its fans, but it will be regaled to two copies in Blockbuster's that get rented perhaps once a month, replaced by similar movies that are again declared ""beautiful and heartwarming"". The acclaim it's earned popularly is, in my opinion, only earned because the lovers of this film loved the story before they even entered the theatre, and were thrilled to get exactly what they expected."

"jblack-14","8","1","2","29 March 2005"," Romantic Love Story
","I watched this movie last night and enjoyed it very much. As stated in some of the other reviews, this is a fairly typical boy from wrong side of the tracks meets rich girl, boy and girl fall in love kind of movie. What makes this story somewhat different is the way it is presented: an old man reading the love story to an old woman in a nursing home. It was the two senior citizens and their relationship in the movie which touched me the most. The main characters were wonderfully cast and make the story come to life. The setting in a small southern town makes for some lovely scenery. I found the movie to be somewhat predictable on the whole, and also a little unrealistic but still a wonderful love story."

","This movie was so wonderful in every way! It's hard to put into words just how much I loved it. The actors were amazing (not to mention easy on the eyes!), the story was amazing, the scenery was amazing! I totally escaped into this movie, to the point that I felt what they might be feeling...butterflies in my tummy and all! I have never seen Ryan Gosling or Rachel McAdams, and I was blown away by their performances. What perfect casting! James Garner and Gena Rowlans were wonderful, too. But it was Ryan and Rachel and their incredible chemistry that really stands out in my mind. I think a lot of guys might pass on seeing this movie, considering it to be a ""chick-flick"". I think they would be missing out. This is a beautiful love story for both men and women. I recommend it to everyone who has ever been in love! Or dreams of falling in love...The only thing is, this movie may change your standards! This movie is a definite must see!"

","This is one of those beautiful, simply romantic films that takes you out of your own life and drops you full force into the lives and dreams of the characters. While it does follow the path of a typical romance storyline, it is so well-cast, and well-written, that any sort of cliché tends not to matter....You just like the characters that much. I just finished watching this film and hope to watch it again soon. It's worth seeing more than once. Beautifully acted, lovely cinematography and great casting... Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling were wonderful together. And Gena Rowlands and James Garner were fabulous. Bring your tissues and let yourself get into The Notebook. Let it take you away."

Many many thumbs up to the cast of this movie as they all did such a wonderful job allowing us to connect with them and feel the things that they are feeling. You almost are living the story along with them. Feeling every emotion they are and enduring all of the twists and turns that life seems to throw in their direction. An outstanding movie!"

I recommend everyone to see this movie! the way the characters were portrayed, really fit the way you would expect them to act. at times you can even laugh with them, cry with them, and you can almost feel the emotion and pain and happiness they go through. at the end, i felt like i wanted the film to continue, just so i could go deeper into their lives and explore more. you will find that you can relate to the things in the film, and you feel that you KNOW what Allie and Noah are going through.

And let me tell you it was worth it and I would pay 10X more for it if I had to. This movie, all of it--the writing, the characters, the chemistry, everything is superb. The most captivating aspect is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams. I'm not sure if I have ever seen better chemistry between two people.

","Once in a while a movie comes along that truly becomes a part of your soul. This is the one for me. Everything about it. Right from the beginning. ""I am a common man, I've lived a common life, there are no monuments in my name and I will soon be forgotten. But I have loved another with all of my heart and soul, and that is enough."" I was in love with this movie from then on. Just the whole story, watching Noah and Allie fall in love. It really captured me. They were both so funny and beautiful. Noah is the perfect guy. I mean, how could you not love that guy!! And Allie is absolutely beautiful, how could you not love her?? I thought the way he fixed the house for her was just too much. How could you not come back to him?? All the money in the world could not buy that kind of love. I honestly saw the movie only recently and really regret missing the impact of it on the big screen. I can't wait to buy the DVD and the book. It is truly an amazing work of art and I loved every second of it."

I was bawling like a baby... Rachel McAdams delivered a flawless performance as did Ryan Gosling.. They lit up the film and were well paired for this film.

"pinkerbell526","10","1","2","23 February 2005"," The Notebook was the best love story literally of all time. It was written ingeniously and this ""chick flick"" even appeals to men.
","I saw the Notebook at the movies with my boyfriend the day it came out. At the time me and my boyfriend had only been going out 3 months and we were a summer love that were both planning to go away to college. We both went to college, but stayed together. Saturday, February 26th will be our 9 month anniversary and he just bought me the DVD for Valentines Day. This movie honestly and vividly depicts the best life-long love story that stems from even summer flings. It shows that love is a result of fate. Love is the most wonderful feeling, but can also drive a person crazy when it is taken away. When you respect, honor, and cherish love the way i is supposed to, you will never regret a second you spend with your soul mate. If you haven't seen this movie... you're definitely missing out and should go buy it immediately... not rent it because your going to buy it eventually because its that good and you would waste 4 dollars by renting it first."
"scottyt","6","1","2","23 February 2005"," Notebook a little disappointing
","yes, i'd heard some interesting things about this movie & surprisingly I've always quite enjoyed a romantic tale if done right. Don't get me wrong I enjoyed The Notebook but many issues of the film let me down. The transitions between the flashbacks and the present were messy I couldn't help but feel as though I cared little about the older characters. Such transitions are better suited to a book where there are defined chapters, i would have preferred the director/editor to create a more unique way to link in the two concurrent stories. Also, I couldn't really engage into the older characters, granted the tale of forgotten love and losing one through memory loss is a harrowing and deeply sad situation, I just felt as though for whatever reason, this issue was dealt with kinda cheesily by the film. A lot of this rests, I believe, with the older character of the husband, I found him to be very wooden and a poor fit for the younger character, the relationship between the characters as their younger selves and the older selves felt very forced and not at all as a singular flowing tale. The final issue that griped me was the abrupt end to the younger tale. I would have preferred to see a little more of Annie's transition into her chosen path in life, instead we were left to just leap onto the tale of the older characters which weren't nearly as engaging. That being said however the tale of the young loves carried enough weight for me to suitable engaged and still enjoy the film."
"ani_haze","10","1","2","22 February 2005"," The greatest love story... EVER!
","I saw this movie twice in theaters and three more times when it came out, I absolutely love this movie with all my heart! I think it is the greatest love story of all time because it is so human, and so heart-felt. It's one of those deliciously well-written and well-acted movies that make you laugh and cry and think and feel so many emotions all at once. I loved the story-line and the plot, and I think it has to be said that there was not a single ""bad actor"" in this entire movie- my boyfriend agrees and he's very picky about his movies. I laughed when Finn asks, ""Do you two love each other?"" the night they go to the movies and dance in the street, I laughed when elderly Allie comments about how many pills Noah takes, ""How sick are you?"" I loved the down-to-earth fun that young Noah and Allie had, like riding their bikes with friends and swimming in the river. I think it's the kind of romance, even if it is fleeting, that we all want to experience. It made me so mad the way Allie's parents reacted to Noah just because he was from the ""wrong side of the tracks"" (so to speak). I bawled when Finn died, I bawled when they broke up (I wanted to kill both of them for breaking up when it was so obvious that they were in love, but I knew what Noah meant, and what prompted it, when he said that fancy things and nice things weren't in the cards for him, he wanted what was best for her and he didn't think that he was it), I bawled when Noah's father died (He was the jolliest person in the movie, I love Sam Sheperd's character!), I bawled when Allie left Seabrook, I bawled when her mother wouldn't give her the letters, I cried during the entire movie. I laughed at the story of how Noah used to stammer and poetry was the only thing that worked. I also loved how the movie reveals so much about the characters but leaves just enough for you to wonder about, like for example, does Allie's mother really understand her feelings for Noah? does she regret what she did? does she really only want what's best for her daughter or is she trying to prove a nasty point by showing Allie the man she almost ran off with, who's still in Seabrook and still labors for pennies a day? Or how about Martha? Does she understand, does she feel happy for Noah? Is Allie jealous that this is the woman her man has been spending the past seven years with? Sometimes it was just so aggravating, like Allie going back to talk to Lon after the few wonderful days she spent with Noah. But it just added to the story and made it that much more real. I thought for sure that Allie was going to be hit by that truck when she was leaving Noah, and that's why she couldn't remember, and when Allie said that she knew she should be with Lon and it went to the scene of elderly Noah closing the book I was outraged because I thought that Allie stayed with Lon (because in the nursing home they called him Duke. I finally realized that it was for Allie's sake, so she wouldn't get worked up with him being there because she couldn't really remember who he was). I think everyone can relate to this movie, whether it's because they've loved someone so much or lost someone, or for the lucky few who have actually experienced that kind of passion like in the movie. I think the acting really sealed this movie as the best in years (in my opinion), even though we all know it's just a story the way the actors present what their character is feeling is so moving, like the night in the mansion, the look in Allie's eyes as they are undressing in front of one another and the way she says that she's OK after she won't shut up and Noah asks. Her swig of beer after learning that the room they are eating in now is the one they were in seven years ago. All around this movie is great, I love it! I can't think of one bad thing to say about it, and everyone should see it!"

","I must say that this film really moved me like no love story ever did. Perhaps it's because there's so much to identify with. I'm male and no youngster and something true rang when I watched this film. Maybe it's because I am older and have experienced so much of it. The relationship between the older Noah and Allie really ices it. Rachel McAdams' portrayal of the young Allie got to me like she was my own sweetheart. Her youthful exuberance is absolutely captivating! I hope that many young men and women get to see ""The Notebook"". It could really do a lot to help sensitize a generation that might not so likely to indulge in ""old fashioned"" feelings;or to display them."

This is good that this movie follows the pattern of intro, body, and conclusion. It is not real jumpy, but extremely entertaining. This movie shows a lot of what this society is missing today. Passion, commitment, and a devotion of what love really is. It is set back in the older years, but it really shows the difference of what life was like then compared to now.

","If you want to get into a romantic mood, this is definitely the film to watch. In my humble opinion, it's one of the finest movies done in a recent while. I loved the direction, I loved the storyline and the build up of the mystery and its final conclusion.<br/><br/>Looking up the credits of the writer, it turns out that Nicholas Sparks also wrote ""A Walk to Remember"" and ""Message in a Bottle."" I cried and was inspired with the former and heard good reviews about the latter. I can't wait to watch that second movie now.<br/><br/>Sparks is a romanticist women must love and most men fail to comprehend. He's certainly a sensitive individual who is able to capture concepts in the printed word. He's mastered an art form so lacking in our present crop of Hollywood junk.<br/><br/>I cannot reveal more for the sake of those who haven't watched the movie but if you've lost the fire of hopes and dreams, this movie will certainly rekindle that flame."

I think every girl just dreams of that kind of love some day. Not to mention that Ryan Gosling is gorgeous. And Rachel McAdams is so adorable in this movie, she is so full of life. you just wish they were together in real life. I would love to grow up in the South during the 1940s. Life was so simple back then. Our generation sucks. So much technology and everyone is so worried about their appearance and money status. Life was so simple for them in this movie.

"hawkshotlips1","10","1","2","10 February 2005"," An elderly gentleman reads to a female companion from a notebook.
","I had read the book and was anxious to see the movie version of this wonderful love story. As it came nearer I found out who was in the film and so with the words from the novel in my head and as I watched this became real for me. James Garner has one of the best narratives that you ever want to hear. I felt I was the recipient of this telling and got involved in it. What was it about teen love? To win the heart of another? Get them together is what and who cares? Even with all of the films now and what you expect is happening in them, this is one that will get to your heart. The different backgrounds, the not so approval from the parents, what do we do kind of thing? And so these young lovers part and have to move on to live their lives. The war is going on and all and then Noah goes to make something of himself. Allie finds out he has restored a plantation and she goes out of curiosity to see him and finds that she still loves him. But she is engaged to be married and he has been dating a young widow. But things have way of working out and due to misunderstanding and parental protection of not getting some letters to her, she has to choose over two men. The present day meshes nicely from the flashbacks and you think that the older Allie isn't remembering her past, but she does and then she realizes the man reading to her is her husband Noah. She is pleased to discover he went with her wishes of reading to her in her state of dementia and for a few minutes she is normal again. But with her illness she is scared and gets panic attacks and doesn't know the man. He is broken up and suffers a mild stroke and is gone for a while, but she looks for the man who befriended her. She is asleep and he comes to her room and tells her he loves her. She remembers him and they are together against the rules but what is love? To have this love forever... and Noah cherishes the times she knows him in the place they are and he isn't leaving her. The promise was to read to her to have her remember. It's sweet and the actors make you feel you know the characters.. it's mushy and it's teary and it's straight forward and it's wonderfully written and directed."
"maryhelenmac","10","1","2","9 February 2005"," Excellent
","I cried and cried and cried, etc. For the hopeless romantic. Even though I have never had that experience, it's nice to know some people have, even though these were fictional characters. Love can and should feel that way. Marriage has it's ups and downs, but if there is genuine friendship, passion, and trust, it is the makings of a long lasting relationship as depicted in the movie. I saw this movie with my 3 kids (my son included). All of us got something out of it. My daughters learned that love must be about that, money dwindles down to nothing eventually without love. My son learned tenderness and compassion. This movie struck a cord in my heart of something I long for. Maybe never, but a beautiful feeling at least."

","i work in a video store and the anticipation for this film was almost unbearable -- its just so real and fantasy like at the same time, it makes you laugh at the similarities of your own relationship and yet cry at how sad and crushing their story was. It makes your heart leap at moments and then fall the very next -- its just an amazing movie and the powerfulness of it is just incredible....its perfect!!! I absolutely fell in love with the story of Noah and Allie - the ""will they/won't they"" is just so heart wrenching when you understand the obstacles that they had to face in order to be with one another and then the after-math that follows in the midst to their happily ever after love. The powerfulness of the ""notebook"" itself in the story - that someone would document their love in a book -- and the inscription "" read this to me, - and I'll come back to you"" -- gives me chills just thinking about it. The characters couldn't have been chosen better. - You can almost feel Noah's pain as he tries to move on without his love. -"

It also has a beautiful soundtrack, when you listen to it you picture the movie in your mind...James Garner and Ryan Gosling are the ideal men for me and will be for you. The lengths in which they go for love is remarkable! Perfect to watch for Valentine's Day with a loved one. The two loved birds (Rachael Mc Adams and Ryan Gosling) are perfect.

"Grlyq12","10","1","2","27 January 2005"," This is the number 1 movie of 2004
","I was in love with the Notebook when I read it by Nicholas Sparks. Normally, I wouldn't go to see a movie that was first a book, only because the books are always so much better, but I fell in love with the trailer for the Notebook the moment I saw it. The song Tonight and The Rest My Life by Nina Gordon amplified the love scene that is shown in the trailer, after I saw that I couldn't wait to see the movie. The First time I went to see the movie I saw it with my parents, my 24 year old sister, her 24 year old fiancée, and my best friend who's 18 like me; and by the end of the movie we were all crying. That covers a couple of different age groups, and both sexes. The second time I went to see it in the theater was with my boyfriend, who's 18 and he also loved it even though he thought he would hate it completely. When the movie was over we were both crying (well he was tearing up even though he wouldn't admit it) and he couldn't stop telling me how much he loved me. Now, I've covered 3 different age ranges, 2 sexes, and 2 races. The third and final time i went to see it in the theater was with my other 2 friends, who were also my age and also loved it. Every time I saw it I loved it. I cried and laughed all three times I saw it. After I saw it the third time, I decided that I would have to wait until it came out on DVD to see again, because i couldn't spend the rest of my summer in the dark theater, even though i would've if i could.. but no matter how much my boyfriend, friends, and families loved the movie they wouldn't allow me to see it again and again. So i ended seeing it 3 times in the theater and now i have to wait one more week for it to come out on DVD and I am fiending for it."
"lucykirwin","10","1","2","30 December 2004"," Wonderful old-fashioned love story
","Having heard very little about this film, I ended up seeing it purely by accident, and was very glad that I did.<br/><br/>As 2004 draws to a close, I can say without doubt that it was the best film I have seen all year, if not ever.<br/><br/>Although it has been criticised for being unrealistic and clichéd, I don't find these accusations particularly helpful. It is true that it follows a fairly traditional and predictable romantic plot-line, but I think this is part of its charm. As you might expect from an adaptation of a novel, it's the story that carries the film, rather than special effects or comedy.<br/><br/>The actors were well-cast, and I liked the fact that the young stars (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) were relatively little known, compared to other, big-name actors - it made the story more accessible somehow. Balanced by the excellent Hollywood stalwart James Garner's scenes with Gena Rowlands, the overall effect is highly watchable and convincing.<br/><br/>The romantic drama of 'The Notebook' also makes a refreshing change to the stream of distinctly average ""rom-coms"" that have hit our screens in recent years. It manages to hold a poignancy and emotional impact where the run-of-the-mill money-spinners fail. Although films like 'Love Actually' have poignant scenes, they are but moments amongst the general light-weight schmaltz. It takes a lot for a film to move me to tears, but this one managed it.<br/><br/>It might not be a masterpiece in the eyes of a serious critic, but in terms of being able to tell a poignant, old-fashioned love story in a no-frills, beautifully shot film, this one wins for me every time."
"CovDuo","8","1","2","26 December 2004"," This film was a surprise!
","I saw this film while on a flight from Paris to Los Angeles. I was a bit upset because our plane did not have the small screens with the individual movie choices on it. There was only one movie choice per cabin ""if you want another movie, get on another plane."" Reluctantly (in rebel mode), I started watching it without having the headphones on. Believe it or not, even in silence, the film won me over. I was quickly drawn into it and soon could not stop watching it! Not long after my initial resistance, I put on the headphones. The only negative was the embarrassment I felt for sitting there sobbing on the plane as it is a very moving story. The characters came across with authenticity and were compelling. I also felt the way the film went back and forth between past and present got the message across effectively. At first I did not realise there was a connection between the two characters and as the connection starts to become evident, you become more drawn into their story. I highly recommend it as a movie I would definitely choose to see even if one is not a 'captive audience'."

","When my roommate and I first arrived at the theatres to see The Notebook, the people coming out of the theatre who had seen the movie before us were all wiping their eyes. This movie is a real tear jerker, so you have been warned. It is the story of 2 young adults who meet at a carnival: Noah, a poor boy who works at the Lumber yard, and Allie, a rich girl who is on summer vacation with her family in Seabrook. All summer long, the 2 are inseparable. But Allie's parents don't approve of Noah (because he does not come from money) and forbid her to see him again. This complicates things between the two, and soon Allie is leaving Seabrook to go back to Charleston. Noah writes to Allie everyday for a year. 7 years later, Allie meets and falls in love with a handsome soldier named Lon, and soon he asks to marry her. During their engagement, Allie notices that in the paper on the same page as her wedding announcement is a picture of Noah standing near a house he rebuilt for her. She then must go back to Seabrook to see him before marrying Lon, and is flooded with old feelings for Noah. Allie is then forced to choose between the man that was her first love, and the man that her parents want her to marry."

","The movie was great. This is one movie where you really get the meaning of true love. Yes true love does exist for some, yet we strive all our lives to reach it, and these two found it. <br/><br/>It is a movie where all ages can relate to. The young audience has dreams of obtaining this kind of relationship. The older audiences have this kind of relationship.<br/><br/>The cast's performance was spectacular. These roles that the actors play are so believable and they are someone you can relate to. They capture the moments and bring it directly to you, they challenge your feelings and outlook on life with every scene. They have the ability to tug on your heart strings, make you think about relationships, and get insight into the loving relationships that we have,but take for granted everyday. <br/><br/>The movie gives you the insight necessary to pull this one off. The whole movie is filled with passion, love, understanding, compassion and hardships that pay off. The determination of the actors are president throughout the movie. <br/><br/>The overall movie rating is a MUST SEE, you will not be disappointed."

At least 50 from 80 people in the cinema watching this movie cried as soon as the credit title showed up. <br/><br/>As the matter in fact, the story is so simple. No surprises in its plot line. The acting is normally good (but they built a strong chemistry). It's Hallmark way of beauty pictures provided to the audience. And I can tell it's a low budget movie. But yet, the film captivates much strongly than the big budget ""Titanic"".<br/><br/>It's the heart that would make this film different. This is the kind of film that touches your heart and emotion deeply in a strange way. I can't describe why I give this movie 10 out of 10, but somehow I feel that I must give it. <br/><br/>Maybe it's love. Unending, unselfish love that's maintained during 2 hours of this movie.

","Based on the best selling novel by Nicholas Sparks.<br/><br/>It is the 1940's, and we are introduced to Allie (Rachel McAdams), who lives with her well-off parents. During a carnival, Allie unexpectedly meets Noah (Ryan Gosling). After this encounter, they become very close, and fall in love. Though as they keep seeing each other, Allie's mother, Anne (Joan Allen) disapproves of the relationship, and tells Allie to break it off.<br/><br/>Several months later, Allie meets another, Lon Hammond (James Marsden). This soon becomes serious, but Allie still keeps Noah in her heart. Eventually things between Lon and Allie become serious, and become engaged. When Allie reads about her up coming marriage to Lon, she also happens to see a picture of Noah. This leads to Allie spending a couple of days apart from Lon, and visiting Noah.<br/><br/>When seeing Noah again, it brings back memories of what they once shared. Will this lead to Allie choosing Lon, or will she be true to herself, and choose Noah?<br/><br/>My opinion...<br/><br/>I have read the novel, but it has been a while. My sister and I took our mum to see this movie for her birthday, and she really enjoyed it. But this is not just a chick's flick, as our dad also enjoyed the movie also. I have to admit, I did cry twice towards the end. I had heard that you needed tissues, so was well prepared, we all were. I thought the cast did really well. Rachel McAdams had on-screen chemistry with both Ryan and James. I always seem to listen to the music in movies, and this was no exception.

","I adored The Notebook. The two leads had the most amazing chemistry and were completely believable and realistic for the whole movie. The love James Garner(Noah) showed for his beloved Ali was breathtaking. The scenery was very beautiful especially the scenes with the birds on the lake. This movie was nothing but class from start to finish. I believe it showed how two people (complete strangers) can become one and that there are definitely soulmates in this life. Ryan Gosling was outstanding as the young Noah with his piercing eyes and sensitive nature. Rachel McAdams was a breath of fresh air as Ali and connected physically and spiritually to her costar Ryan. I have also read the book and highly recommend it as well."

She sat through that disaster known as Van Helsing with me (which she seldom lets me forget) so I owed it to her, and I only hoped that it wasn't going to hurt too badly or be too boring. I was quite pleasantly surprised, and must admit that the end of the movie left me in tears.<br/><br/>I've read other reviews and have seen the words sappy, sentimental, manipulative, and shallow, and that some of the situations are hopelessly unrealistic. And yes, all that is true, but done in such a beautiful and sincere way that it didn't bother me that much.

On the other hand it had been castigated by others as shallow and manipulative.<br/><br/>Having seen the film, I think I can understand the contrasting responses.<br/><br/>On the one hand I would have to agree that the movie is fairly shallow and manipulative, but it is done with such panache that it carries you along.<br/><br/>The film is framed by an old man reading to a woman with alzheimers the story of a young man from the lumber works and a young woman from a rich family falling in love, being separated and then meeting again years later when she is engaged to marry another. The relationship of the two older characters is explored as the story from the notebook progresses.<br/><br/>With the ""notebook"" story, the film-makers and actors make it easy to understand why Ally fell in love with Noah. They are not as successful in capturing the contrary aspect (other than her beauty, which was not sufficient to explain the degree of obsession shown).<br/><br/>What is well established is the dilemma she faces when she discovers that Noah still loves her but she also loves her fiancÃ©.<br/><br/>This is a movie that I recommend seeing with someone you love - but probably only once, because further watching may bring some of the flaws into clearer view."

This movie sweeps you off your feet, breaks your heart and leaves you expecting more out of life and love.

"philip-106","Null","1","2","7 September 2004"," Predictable, sappy (spoilers)
","South Carolina, 1940: young Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) is a working guy who's willing to put it on the line for the girl he loves, wealthy debutante Allie Nelson (Rachel McAdams). Boy meets girl, boy loses girl, World War II comes and goes and the couple reunite years later. Present day: feisty old man Duke (James Garner) reads aloud this maudlin, predictable love story to delusional and vacant Allie (Gena Rowlands) as though it's some kind of extraordinary mystery. As you can predict, the two couples Â– young and old Â– are one and the same as any four year old could tell you, yet the film makers treat the connection like an alarming emotional revelation.<br/><br/>Alas, the film makers' condescension for the audience doesn't stop there; the film is clumsy and would've seemed terribly sappy even sixty years ago. The young lovers are never developed into credible characters so in lieu of their developing relationship we're treated to a series of improbable, Hallmark Card-pretty make-out scenes, utterly devoid of emotion or sexiness.<br/><br/>McAdams twinkles her alluring, knowing eyes and flashes her dimply smiles but her Allie is about as sexy as a squid. In what's supposed to pass for reckless passion she crushes her mouth against her co-star like she's trying to resuscitate him and wraps her legs around him like a crazed gymnast. At one point, Allie and Noah disrobe revealing their nakedness to one another. But director Cassavettes flinches and sternly depicts the encounter from shoulders up.<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the 1940's milieu is repeatedly shattered by clunky dialogue loaded with anachronistic contemporary vernacular and concerns.<br/><br/>The splendid Gena Rowlands (mother of Director Nick Cassavetes) tries bring some depth to this material but there's simply nothing there for her. Interestingly, James Garner comes off the best. We don't for a moment believe that this jocular, chatty old man is really the aged version of quiet and proud young Noah but at least Garner wears his role effortlessly.<br/><br/>I suppose young people brought up on a culture of vapid video games might find this PG rated romance involving. But if you're looking for a quality romance try renting 'Bridges of Madison County' or have a look at the superb 'Room With A View'."
"lvscott","7","1","2","5 September 2004"," Barely misses The Mark
","OK, I normally will not comment about so called ""Chick Flicks"" but I feel this one here had great potentional, even Academy award potentional, but falls short because of 2 factors, The cons;<br/><br/>1. Ryan Gosling; a poor choice here to play Noah. First he gives a dull non inspired performance here. His ""Younger Noah"" does not match up with the older one AT ALL!! Simply stated he has no spark and no reason to be seen as "" a special guy"" that could invoke a ""special love"" His performance leaves me wondering; ""why does Allie fall for this guy?""<br/><br/>He really does not seem to be in love, well not in ""Great Love""<br/><br/>Colin Farrell would have been my choice here to play Noah<br/><br/>Gosling seems better suited for a love interest on a soap opera, and he is the main reason this film misses the mark to greatness..<br/><br/>2. The film felt and flowed like 2 separate films, with the first half of ""The Romance"" making no real sense. There is no character development and we know little to nothing about Noah AS A PERSON; which as per the above is mainly due to Ryan Gosling's boring and dull performance portraying Noah. Where is his passion? He really does seem like a typical red neck future drunk loser and this disconnects from the older Noah.<br/><br/>We are supposed to understand why Allie would fall for this guy beyond the simple ""he is from the wrong side of the tracks"" scenario. I understood why Noah could fall for Allie, but not the other way around!!<br/><br/>Many people are from ""the wrong side of the tracks"", SO WHAT? WHATS MAKES ANY ONE OF THEM STAND OUT, err CHARACTER, PASSION, UNIQUENESS? Gosling beings none of these to this lead and he almost ruins this film for me.<br/><br/>Pros;<br/><br/>1. The story of the older man reading to the older Woman who is suffering from Advanced Dementia is touching and original, especially when we find out why. Both Gardner and Rowlands are great here in these roles and this made the film in my opinion watchable and interesting.<br/><br/>2. James Gardner, Gena Rowlands, and Rachel McAdams.<br/><br/>The first 2 mentioned here are simply very good in their perspective roles. Where I was very surprised was the performance by Rachel McAdams. She really carried her part of the film. I have read where people here say ""she and Gosling really had good chemistry"" well she has good chemistry with James Marsden as well. Its not because of the male leads in my opinion, its because McAdams really shines here, and I had a lowered expectation of her going in to this film; ""Hey, isn't this the girl from The Hot Chick and mean girls playing a serious lead? Common she cant act.. haha I was wrong!!!<br/><br/>McAdams is the scene stealer every time and she out acts Gosling about 10 to 1. She gives you the sense of the passion thats supposed to be here Between Noah and Allie when Gosling fails at it, She carries him in this film and Mardsen. although Mardsen does give an acceptable acting job.<br/><br/>Her portrayal of the 17 year old Allie is wide eyed, spunky, and right on the mark. Her portrayal of the 24 year old Allie is mature, tamed and right where it should be, again hitting the mark.<br/><br/>It seems to me McAdams has a nice future in film and it goes to show you that some actors when giving the chance CAN REALLY ACT,(Nicole Kidman comes to mind finally getting good roles and shining in them) while others given the chance STILL SUCK!! (Gosling, well as a romantic lead err, SUCKS!!)<br/><br/>The premise for this film is original, and 3 out of the 4 leads act very well. This film is not as ""Diabetic unfriendly"" as some people would have you believe, but is not sugar free either. What bothers me is we don't have enough character development, again with Gosling's portrayal be first and foremost lacking.<br/><br/>If we were able to change that, then this film would be an academy award nominee, A good film in spite of its flaws but not a great film. Remember people, because a film makes you cry don't make the film great. I've seen people cry watching Soap Operas and Hot Dog eating contests as well!! scores as follows;<br/><br/>1. a take a date to flick  2. originality= 7 (10 for the premise) 3. acting = 8 (would be 10 but Gosling takes away allot) 4. Kleenex needed? YES BRING A BOX!! (and save it for the very end)<br/><br/>finally; Academy award nomination potentional?<br/><br/>Supporting actor=Gardner=Maybe excellent acting Supporting actress Rowlands=Maybe= excellent Lead Actress= McAdams;<br/><br/>I'd say yes if she had a good leading man(Like Colin Farrell) to have worked with. Simply put, she just really carries Gosling too much, all the chemistry is from her, for this reason, she won't get a nod which is too bad, This lady has the potentional to be a top actress.<br/><br/>Movie=NO Director=good job but no. Other awards, possibly (cinematography is excellent, set design and costume)<br/><br/>Rasberry ward for worse actor? YES FOR GOSLING!!<br/><br/>over all 7 out of 10, Recommended highly for the 3rd date to 5th date scenario, but not a first date scenario!!"

Allie is supposed to be a very intelligent young woman yet she is portrayed as a ditz. The movie strays a little from the book, which I read a few years ago, and I hate when movies don't capture the brilliance from the literature.

Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) were the perfect actors for their parts. They had a lot of chemistry, which is necessary in this type of story.

","This film has the ability to change the world by changing the way people live their lives. If more of us were this committed to our relationships, loved without superficiality, and pursued our goals with such devotion, the divorce rate would be much lower and the world would still be a decent place to live as it was long ago. In today's society we are consumed with materialistic things and insecure enough to be influenced by what others think we should or shouldn't do. The reason ""The Notebook's"" impact on me was so profound is because it does not sugar coat true love in a way that misleads viewers into thinking that a relationship with one's soulmate is without its share of rough spots. It is realistic in the way that it portrays two lovers who quarrel and have difficult obstacles to overcome in order to stay together. The film openly admits that it takes work every day to make a relationship a success. Unfortunately, we live in a world dictated by convenience, therefore, the minute our relationships require extra work we give up because we'd rather look for someone else who has a lower set of standards that are easier to meet. In closing, I would like to say that Noah & Allie serve as an example that we should all aspire to."

As Allie and Noah, the beautiful Rachel Adams and handsome Ryan Gosling do it justice. The cinematography is well done with two scenes involving birds that are outstanding, if a little over-the-top. I found the picture entertaining and wasn't disappointed by the performances. I was glad to see that Ms Adams can act as well as look gorgeous. Ms Rowlands accurate portrayal of the devastation of Alzheimer's disease is especially poignant with the recent death Ronald Reagan.

"Atreyu_II","7","2","7","28 December 2007"," Great book, ""so-so"" film
","As a fan of Nicholas Sparks's romantic novels and being ""The Notebook"" one of my favorites, I had to see this movie. Now here comes the time to share my feelings about it. In my opinion, this is a reasonable, emotional and romantic movie, but the book is slightly superior. Without getting into the differences between the book and the movie, at least I've got to tell that I personally find the book deeper, more sentimental, more intense, more beautiful, more emotional and certainly more romantic.<br/><br/>The book is one of the deepest and most beautiful love stories of all time and touched me like few romances did. Apart ""The Notebook"", only ""Message in a Bottle"" had the same impact on me - another one of the best books by Nicholas Sparks.<br/><br/>Back to the movie ""The Notebook"", it isn't bad but it's inevitable to compare it with the book. Anyone who saw the movie and is familiar with the book, knows that the book is more complete (the same happens with ""Message in a Bottle""). As a movie, ""The Notebook"" seems somehow like a forced adaptation in many parts.<br/><br/>About the actors, both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are good in the roles of Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton, but I'm not sure if they are the best choice for these roles. I don't know who would I cast for Noah, but for Allie I'm sure that Jennifer Love Hewitt or Sarah Michelle Gellar would make a perfect Allie (any of them).<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best thing about this movie is probably its beautiful landscapes and backgrounds, especially that enormous lake/swamp where Noah and Allie are crossing by boat and the lake scene with ducks flying at the beginning (by the sunrise or sunset time)."

","This movie goes back and forth between two connected stories, happening at different times. One is happening nowadays and isn't particularly good, but at least has some originality and resists the worst temptations (although it yields to several of them). The other story (which takes most of the movie) is really terrible: after the first 10 minutes, I already had the impression I knew where the movie was going, but hoped I was wrong (""They can't be doing just this, this story is as old as Adam and Eve""). Unfortunately, my hopes were vain.<br/><br/>The acting and the score are nothing to write home about, the photography is nice (you have some really pretty pictures) but it is used to further sugar-coat a story which drowns you in honey from the first to the last shot.<br/><br/>All in all, I regret going to see this movie."
"ALB","4","2","8","3 August 2004"," Unreal characters in an idealized, sappy romance
","The main thing you need to know about this romantic would-be tearjerker is that it's based on a novel by Nicholas Sparks, he of ""Message in a Bottle"" and ""A Walk to Remember"" fame. Like those films, this is more interested in portraying an idealized romance than real love. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are the two lovers, one rich, one not. It's supposed to be the 1940s, but you'll barely notice--even World War II barely intrudes. An ultra-thin plot device prevents them from living happily ever after well before the film reaches feature length. Meanwhile, in the present day, James Garner is an ever-faithful husband who can't let go of Gena Rowlands. She's got Alzheimer's and only rarely recognizes him. The end reveals the none-too-surprising connection between the two stories, though the events of the intervening 40-plus years are entirely missing. All of the fine actors play essentially fake characters, with no real characteristics other than a certain tenacity and, of course, an unwavering dedication to their partners. To those who thought ""A Walk to Remember"" was sappy, this will seem even more so. Those who found it touching will perhaps be able to stomach the corny ending here, which implies that love can literally transcend biological reality. Oh, that it were so. ** out of ****"

","The Notebook was a film released in 2004 where a young worker Noah Calhoun who is played by Ryan Gosling a girl named Allie who was played by Rachel McAdams fell deeply in love but her parents seemed to not approve of Noah. Noah was then sent to fight in the war and the relationship seemed to be on hold. Noah would write to Allie every day and would not receive any replies from all his letters. This is mainly because of her parents hiding the letters that were sent. Allie would soon meet another very well off man named Lon Hammond Jr who was played by James Marsden. This was obviously approved by her parents as he was very wealthy and were ecstatic when they become engaged. <br/><br/>Soon after Noah returned home from the war he would then return to his home and attempt to fix his home in an effort to pursued Allie to want to be with him. When Allie hears about him attempting to fix the house she visits Noah in the town on Seabrook where they have dinner. This is where Noah finds out about her engagement. This is where Noah is not sure on the authenticity of their relationship and wants to see her again the following day. The next day they go rowing at the lake and after they remnant over their memories of spending the summer together Allie asks why she had not received any letters from Noah when he had left for the war <br/><br/>This is where the next day Allies mother admits to hiding all the letters that Noah had written in an effort to let Allie find a wealthier man. Allie would at that point chose to leave Noah and pick to be with Lon. When she goes to Lon and confesses all the things she has done with Noah. Lon forgives Allie for all the things she has done but in the end, she ends up picking to be with Noah. The Notebook is written by Nickolas Sparks who also wrote another love story called Dear John (2010). This is similar to The Notebook as it also was similar in showing how war can affect relationships. Throughout the film there were many types of techniques used in order to show the theme of the movie. Some of the widely-used techniques included lighting and the angles of the scenes. Low levels of lightning were used for sad scenes where there were tough decisions made and sad moments. The film also excelled at using bright lighting for the parts of the film where there was happiness. This was to accentuate the scene and show the level of emotion that was being portrayed. There are many types of camera angles that were used in the film. The main styles of angle include close up and wide angle. There were many serious points of the movie where close angle shots were used to show intimacy between the characters. Also, the wide angle was used to show the environment in the scenes. The film is a wonderful love story where Noah and Allie find a way to love each other even when there are a lot of factors that are preventing them from being with each other."

","The Notebook is, by all accounts, the greatest love story of all time. I have yet to see anyone top this movie in terms of romance. It is a necessary date night/Valentines Day/anniversary movie to remind us all that true love can yet be imperfect and in fact does exist. When I saw this in theaters, I was crying very hard. At the time, I was NOT a person who cried during movies (that is completely opposite now). Its not just about the way it makes you cry though, it teaches anyone a deep lesson about how even the greatest love has flaws and that it has to be worked on every single day, and is always worth it in the end. I can't imagine that this movie will ever be outdone in this century, and I firmly believe that it is the new Gone With The Wind...minus the extra 2 hours. This is the one and only time I think I will ever say that the movie is better than the book. What the book lacked, the movie changed for the better and did a flawless job with it. 10/10"

I guess when you have loved others and you know you aren't in what you could have had or perhaps you are or think you are then this movie will rate super high for you.

A friend recommended it ...so my husband and I sat down, watched the movie. And I cried. Yup, like a little sissy. The tears just ran down. In all honesty I can say that I was surprised and really inspired by this film. You don't find that many love stories that you can truly relate to. But you can with ""The notebook"". Anyone can understand the characters and basic trauma of their lives because they are ordinary. Most films are based on a platonic and ideal love, but in this story, we can actually relate with the characters and their relationships. That's why it's special. Anyone can understand it.

Then again, this is based on a novel, which I unfortunately haven't read yet and which could mean the difference.<br/><br/>The complex storyline has us staying with two characters (James Garner and Gena Rowlands are genuinely fantastic and the center piece/gravitas of the movie), while we listen to a story that is being told. While that means, we have a few characters that we have to follow and different stories that we have to stay on focus with, we never lose touch with any of them. Which is a great achievement of the book (I guess), but also of the director and the cast. Although it just has it's 5th anniversary, I consider it a classic (and I don't use that term often)"
"aimers_4","9","1","3","14 July 2009"," Never Give Up on the One You Love
","""The Notebook"" is one of my favorite love stories of all time. In the beginning of the film there is this elderly couple who is living in the nursing home in different locations in the facility. The husband, Duke (James Garner), is living in a part of the nursing home where the nurses can keep an eye on him because he has problems with his heart, and the wife, Allie Calhoun (Gena Rowlands) is living in the Alzheimer's ward. Duke comes over to her room everyday and reads a little bit from the notebook that he wrote of their life together when they were younger, because Allie couldn't remember anything from their past. The director Nick Cassavetes delivers a message in ""The Notebook"" to never give up on the one you love. Cassavetes shows this when Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) were young and in love, and they were pretty much forced to break up because her parents made her move. Then seven years later she realized that she was still in love with him after she seen the picture of the house in the paper that he promised to build, so she went back and they fell back in love. Nick Cassavetes also expressed that by showing how Noah never gave up on his Allie while she was struggling with dementia. Noah was doing everything that he could think of, for example, reading the notebook of their past, so she could possibly regain some of her memory that she had lost from the disease. <br/><br/>""The Notebook"" is the most romantic movie I have ever seen. The costumes that they wear in the movie were perfect and beautiful. When the couple breaks up because of her parents and her having to go away to college after the summer ends was heartbreaking. My favorite scene in the movie is when Noah and Allie went out on the pond, and there were dozens of geese on the pond, then it started to rain when they were on their way back to the house, and that was when they had realized that they still had strong feelings toward each other."

"clivy","7","1","3","22 September 2008"," A film with the potential to be a real heartbreaker let down by sentiment and melodrama
","Channel 4 here in the UK heavily promoted UK ""The Notebook"" over the weekend, and I was attracted by the trailer into watching it last night. The cinematography was excellent, especially the scenes of the geese on the river. The movie wonderfully captured a sense of place: I smiled at the scenes of the riverbanks and Spanish moss, and I could feel the warmth of the summer nights. I've never spent much time in South Carolina, but I spent several years living in North Central Florida, and the film does justice to the beauty of the Southern wilderness. <br/><br/>However, the script lets down the love story. ""The Notebook"" has the potential to be a shattering film about the power of love. The flashbacks to Ally and Noah's youth, aside from the cinematography, are nothing special. They tell a story told many times before in other films and books: rich girl meets poor boy, boy loses girl, boy meets girl again, girl must choose on the eve of her wedding whether to marry for security and love or just love. It's the framing story that delivers a punch: what happens when a couple who have overcome great obstacles to be together face a terrible obstacle that can not be defeated, that destroys them not just by attacking their bodies, as old age does, but by obliterating one partner's memory and mind? The film reveals how Duke dedicates himself to his wife, living in the same residential home, reading to her from the notebook she compiled, sparking whatever residential memories remain of their life together. The contemporary scenes show the pain of their children, who Ally greets as strangers, and the torture of Duke as he continually tries to help his wife emerge from her perpetual cloud of forgetting, even for a few moments.<br/><br/>If the film ended with Duke's witnessing Ally's confusion and terror as she struggles against him, believing him once again to be a stranger, it would be heartbreaking. Unfortunately ""The Notebook"" is diminished by melodrama and sentimentality. I'm not a medical expert but I have seen documentaries about Alzheimer's and I've read several books by Oliver Sacks: they state, as the doctor in ""the Notebook"" does, that once brain cells die, once memory begins to deteriorate, there's not much hope of it ever returning. Duke battles against the disease, as did Ally herself when she wrote the stories of their lives that he reads to her. I cried when he read his beloved Whitman to her: ""Nothing is ever really lost, or can be lost"". Whitman's lines are a tribute to Ally and Duke's lonely struggle: <br/><br/>No birth, identity, form--no object of the world. Nor life, nor force, nor any visible thing; Appearance must not foil, nor shifted sphere confuse thy brain The body, sluggish, aged, cold--the embers left from earlier fires, The light in the eye grown dim, shall duly flame again<br/><br/>But the film's portrayal of dementia is more like the Keeper in Babylon 5: a force that suppresses a person's mind, that can be subdued for a few moments so that the personality can emerge intact and free for a precious short time. Indeed Ally asks how much time they have and Duke replies that the last time it was for 5 minutes.<br/><br/>""The notebook"" would be much more powerful if it showed a flicker of recognition on Ally's face, a scene that shows she understands what Duke means to her: not an inner teenager peeping out of a aged body to yell yoo hoo before curfew kicks back in. It would also be much powerful if it resisted the maudlin ending. I could believe that Ally would remember Duke reading to her, that she would miss him, that even she was again her old self for a few moments. But their dying hand in hand and the CGI geese were slush.<br/><br/>There's a heartbreaking story within ""The Notebook"" but the laspses into sentiment and melodrama make it another four handkerchief weepie, perfect for a Sunday afternoon matinée. A pity, because the real love story is glossed over: Duke and Ally's struggle to preserve their love in the face of oblivion."
"KBFan1","10","1","3","14 September 2008"," Breathtaking!
","Come on, what girl doesn't love The Notebook? It was just so touching and sweet, and all around lovable. Rachel McAdams is a fabulous actress anyway, and she nailed her part in this movie, as well as Ryan Gosling. I can't believe it actually has a lot of haters though! Come on people, it was wonderful! I cried my eyes out of my sockets, and some people on this website actually have the nerve to give it a 1? In my opinion, The Notebook sets a great example for the whole Romance genre, and everybody should give this film at least one chance, for when you do, you're bound to love it, though of course if you're a frownie face, stay away, unless you can lighten up, then MAYBE you'll enjoy it."
"bobsgrock","7","1","3","19 February 2008"," A touching story.
","The best part about The Notebook, just like Message in a Bottle and A Walk to Remember, is the story taken from a Nicholas Sparks novel. Sparks is so good at taking simple love stories and expanding them to mean so much to us that they become true tear-jerkers. While I didn't cry during this film, I was truly touched by the story of two people trying to come together with every obstacle imaginable trying to stop them. Ryan Gosling is strong as the head romantic man and Rachel McAdams is so beautiful and charming and lovable as Allie, it is hard to look at anything but her in every scene she is in. However, in my opinion, the young lovers' scenes don't compare to the power and emotion of those with James Garner and Gina Rowlands, playing the older Noah and Allie. As Allie got older, she began to lose her memory and now Noah is trying to help her remember who he is and what they used to have. The scene where she goes to a frightened rage because she doesn't know where she is is truly moving. Still, the best part is the last scene, where they die on the same bed together holding each other's hands. That is the perfect picture of true love. They had differences and complications, but they loved each other; it was that simple. It may not pack the emotional wallop some are looking for, but it is still a well-worthy film to see and one of the best love stories in modern film-making."

","What can I say about this excellent flick.The plot goes so smooth like the smoky mountains on a snowy day or the Florida beach on a sunny day or simply savoring the last dew drops of the wine.I wish it lasts longer than expected.It has every emotion represented in its true sense without loosing the essence of a romantic movie.The greatest part lies in continuing the romance mellowing with age and still remaining fresh and more stronger than before.A true lesson to learn for a life time.The movie starts like every guy's first crush or the simple infatuation of a teenager,builds up with subtle response from either family,continues with the responsibility of a doting father towards a son and that of a true lover towards his beloved,a damsel lost from the path of love for a while before realizing and reinventing true love in a much broader sense,ends up with making the right choice that stays with you for a life time,may be even beyond death.Watch it and I can assure you that you will never regret."

They share their summer of love, but, as expected, Allie's parents don't agree their daughter relationship. The years pass by and, just before Allie's wedding with a fine young healthy gentleman, the odds bring back Noah in her attention. - This is a story and old man reads to an old woman suffering from Alzheimer's from a notebook in the present times.<br/><br/>The acting is also outstanding. Ryan Gosling plays wonderfully and Rachel McAdams is so full of life it makes you feel young no matter your age."

","An old man comes to visit an old woman in a nursery home. She suffers from Alzheimer disease. He sits her down and begins to read a story to her. It's a love-story. It's the story of a dirt-poor but highly strung young man and a rich girl who has the perfect life until she meets Noah Calhoun. They fall in love but of course they cannot be together right away. It takes years before they will actually be together. Well only a stone-hearted person will not be moved by this great little movie. There's no action, there's no special effects. There is just a wonderfully acted heartwarming story about a love that conquers ( almost ) all. All actors are great especially Ryan Gosling though who is totally convincing as the lovestruck young man. Very, very highly recommended. Keep some tissues at hand though."
"gavin6942","7","1","3","29 August 2007"," One of Those Love Stories That Will Go Down in History
","Noah Calhoun sees Allie Hamilton across the fairgrounds and falls instantly. He persuades her to date him, and before long a summer romance blossoms. But can a love survive class differences, a world war, an evil mother and years of time? If you believe in love -- true love -- this is a film you have to see.<br/><br/>I watched this movie for the wrong reasons with the wrong person, and liked it anyway. The wrong reason was because of the persistent rumor that you could not watch this movie without crying. Especially if you cried during ""A Walk to Remember"". Well, I streamed tears pretty heavily during AWTR, much to the amusement of my girlfriend at the time. But I did not cry at all during ""The Notebook"". Though the person I watched it with was a bit moist in the eyes. That person was my good friend Kenn, which I think made the film less sentimental because he's not exactly the person I ideally wish to cuddle up with.<br/><br/>I loved Ryan Gosling in this film, especially with the righteous beard. I'm not so sure about the casting of Rachel McAdams, though. I'm quite certain her character was supposed to be as air-headed and annoying as she is, but I just didn't find her likable or attractive. Gosling could have done so much better. (But I'm a Mandy Moore fan, so I'm a little biased.) The basic elements of love are here: don't listen to your parents, don't worry about money. Follow your heart. True loves conquers all. It's not a new story in any way. Sure ,you don't find many films with guys who climb moving ferris wheels, but the basics are here. The other plot, of a woman who lost her memory, is very emotional, but not very riveting for me. I just didn't really care about her (which is probably another reason I didn't cry). But yeah, even ""The Incredible Hulk"" has a love story, so it's not like this is unique.<br/><br/>When it comes down to it, if you need a romance movie and you want some sadness and heartbreak and a good cry, I guess you'll want to watch this. Don't be expected to be blown away like others would tell you. Critically speaking, it's not a dynamo. But emotionally, if you're the sort who loves a timeless story of true love, this ranks up there with ""The Princess Bride"" (though it's not nearly as funny)."
"comediclead","10","1","3","31 July 2007"," Absolutely Romantic
","I loved this so much. It's a super sad but also so romantic. When Allie (Rachel McAdams) was caught in the love triangle between Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Lon (James Marsden), I knew she was perfect for Noah, but I wanted her to stay with Lon because her parents had approved of him but they never liked Noah. I just could never understand why she said she knew she should be with Lon but she went to Noah.<br/><br/>And I loved the chemistry between James Garner and Gena Rowlands, too. They loved each other so much that old Allie didn't realize it. And it's too bad she never remembered those times that she had with Noah.<br/><br/>See this movie on DVD.

","For years I've avoided watching this movie because the previews made it seem like just another typical romance movie where you could predict the beginning, middle, and end. Till a bunch of friends of mine suggested it to me. So, I decided to watch it (although I kept putting it off cause I didn't believe it).<br/><br/>The storyline was great. I am getting a bit tired of this rich girl loves poor boy storyline, but this one worked out nicely. As everyone says it is about a sugary sweet romance turned sour. I really bought their love. The performances and writing were just as great, I kept forgetting I was watching a movie. Just the most adorable way to fall in love (a way many women can only dream about).<br/><br/>The one thing I really just did not like about this movie was when it would cut to old Ally and Noah in the nursing room. I mean, yes, this story is about forever love, but is it really necessary to constantly go back to them. he main story is about when they were young and in love. I think that a simple 5-10 minute beginning of them and a 5-10 minute ending of them would have been much better.<br/><br/>What I'm trying to say is that rather or not you enjoy sugary love stories, you should at least give this one a try."

It's seems to be everything you know. I use to be lost in the story of love. I believe love is based to trust somebody or to begin everything. I've got many lesson about love when I've watched this movie ""The Notebook"" about the power of love. When you think one don't deserve another one of two lovers to get started for the future of being couple of life. It is not fair or love.

","Not since SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS has a love story so rich and tender touched my heart as THE NOTEBOOK--although, when reviewing it, I must confess its length is the main weakness. Surely, some editing would have improved the overall impact of the love story.<br/><br/>It's the rich girl/poor man kind of tale with physical attraction being the glue that holds them together at the beginning until their love deepens and it seems inevitable that theirs will be a lifelong bond. Then the girl's wealthy parents disapprove of the affair heading toward the altar and scheme a way of separating them by sending the girl off to New York and leaving her love behind in the mid-west. His numerous letters to her are kept from her and gradually she comes to believe that their love has died out and is wooed by another, wealthier young man (JAMES MARSDEN) who is serious about cementing their relationship.<br/><br/>But the love story is framed by a flashback technique that has the man, Noah (JAMES GARNER) telling the story to an elderly lady in a nursing home (GENA ROWLANDS) who encourages him to tell it, telling him she likes ""this kind of story"", before she realizes, at the end, that the tale is about her own relationship with him. She is a woman in the early stages of Alzheimer's and at one point suddenly turns on him and says, ""Who are you?""<br/><br/>It's an unabashed tear-jerker, the kind I thought they didn't make any more, and it's a well crafted one with shimmering color photography of outdoor locales and extremely well acted by a more than competent cast that gets every nuance out of the complex characters.<br/><br/>RYAN GOSLING as the young Noah is outstanding, perfectly capturing the enormous feelings he has for the girl, and RACHEL McADAMS is wonderfully sweet and sassy as the girl who has to decide which man she will spend the rest of her life with.<br/><br/>For anyone wondering if they still made tear-jerkers in this jaded and cynical age of hard-edged films, this one fills the bill. Not since NATALIE WOOD and WARREN BEATTY went through all the triumphs and tragedies of bittersweet love in SPLENDOR IN THE GRASS, have I seen a romance as touching and poignant as this one."
"The_Core","8","1","3","2 November 2006"," Good chemistry all around...
","Every different genre of film requires something different to make it special. Science fiction needs intelligent storytelling, war films require moving/agonizing drama. And of course, love stories need good chemistry between whoever's supposed to be in love. I thought this one had it in spades, with all concerned. It did get slightly melodramatic at the end, but nothing that anyone who enjoyed ""Somewhere in Time"" (another movie that many love story fans are fond of) couldn't handle... in fact, the former was quite a bit more sappy or melodramatic, and in my opinion this one leans toward realism more than the average. I just saw it ""cold"" on a cable channel without knowing anything about it, and was basically riveted to the screen the entire time. Recommended for fans of the genre, and others should at least dip their toe in and see how it strikes 'em. 8/10."
"russem31","8","1","3","17 September 2006"," True romance.
","""The Notebook"" (2004) is a wonderfully romantic film directed adeptly by Nick Cassavetes. While the script is somewhat predictable (I mean who can't figure out the elder couple played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands is really the younger couple as told when they were younger in the 1940s). But it is the acting from the aforementioned veteran actors and the younger couple themselves - Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams - which really make this picture work. It's a pleasure to watch these four interplay throughout the film - thereby making the predictability okay in my book. On top of that, the cinematography is exceptional and mesmerizing. All in all, a wonderful 8 out of 10."

","This movie to me anyway was the best romantic movie I have seen.It was so touching I actually had to hold back tears.I watched it a good couple times and I still don't get tired of it.The message is simple true love never dies no matter how hard you to try to move on and forget it.And even though you forget it there is someone there to remind you of it.One part of the movie that made me angry was the mother hiding the 365 letters Noah wrote to Alli.Money over love is total bull**** in the end love is triumph and I couldn't believe she put through her daughter through that pain thinking she was doing her good.Why not let her live her life make her own mistakes?Who knows she might come out happier in the end.In which she did she had a life filled with endless love.The ending was good,I felt that it was better they both died together.Noah wouldn't have gone on without Alli and Alli would have forgotten who she was.Thats how love today should be not tainted but society.I believe love back then and love now are totally different.It seems more real and less complicated at times.If you haven't watched this film I would highly recommend that you do.It maybe a chick-flick to some but it was truly touching and worth the time."

The narration and going from present to past really kept me interested and trying to figure out what was going on. In the back of my mind I thought something would happen, like Garner being Noah but I was still surprised when it ended.

We had to choke back tears at the end.<br/><br/>I was especially impressed that, before she had completely gone into her own world, Allie had written a note asking Noah to read the story to her when she could no longer remember the events. She was completely lost in the plot each day when he came to read to her. I wanted to believe that she would eventually find her way back to reality, as she did, if only for a short time.

I myself, know nothing about 'true love,' find myself caught in the weave of the film.<br/><br/>Although the opening was well photographed, it was not a good choice, because it is just boring. Some parts of the film could be enhanced by music, instead of just dialogue, and some of the dialogue was a little cheesy, but hey, its a love story.<br/><br/>Performances by Ryan Gosling, and Rachel MacAdams are extraordinary. James Garner is as always amazing as well.<br/><br/>The movie begs the question; what is the nature of true love?<br/><br/>My advice, if you haven't seen it, DO.

"Ginidancer21","10","1","3","3 February 2005"," Why others should see The Notebook
","People receive different emotions by watching movies. Some make them cry, some make them laugh, and some fill them with suspense. The Notebook is a movie that combines all of these feelings. It is also a movie that grasps your complete attention from beginning to end. I recommend The Notebook to women of any age because it's a love story filled with mixed emotions and because there is never a dull moment.<br/><br/>Many emotions arise while watching this movie. In the beginning you laugh at how Noah tries to sway Allie and never gives up until she finally agrees to go out with him. You then smile when you see how deeply they fall in love. You cry when they have to leave each other. You are filled with suspense when Allie meets another man and gets engaged, but you are left with a smile on your face at the end when Noah and Allie finally get back together.<br/><br/>The Notebook is also a movie where there is never a dull moment. Their love for each other keeps your attention throughout the movie as well as the suspense of whether or not they will end up together in the end. Noah and Allie have to overcome many obstacles to be together, but their love gets them through each one.<br/><br/>In conclusion, any movie that gives you a series of mixed emotions and grasps your attention from beginning to end is a ""must see."" The Notebook is a perfect example of this type of movie. So, for those of you who have not yet seen The Notebook, I highly recommend you do."

","I haven't read the Sparks novel, but this was clearly a fictional story -- romantic and a sentimental tearjerker (an old man to my right couldn't stop crying through much of it) complete with flights of white geese and swelling orchestra music in key moments. A great subject for consumption by the aging baby boomer population as it tries to sentimentalize aging with Alzheimers'. A great wish-fulfillment story that had the phrase, ""Yeah, Right!"" running banner headlines through my mind through most of the final hour of it. This is not a bad film to see if you enjoy Disney-movie style happy endings though. The cinematography, script, etc all look like a major release picture and the younger stars are quite captivating and convincing. The acting by James Garner and Gena Rowlands however left something to be desired.<br/><br/>Update in 2020

"filipemanuelneto","4","1","4","13 September 2019"," Another ultra-romantic movie with a forbidden love story. The good acting make it interesting, but almost everything else is quite ordinary.
","This is the typical dramatic novel that comes out of the mind of Nicholas Sparks, the young teen's favorite author. The story tells the romance between Noah, a young poor man, and Allie, the daughter of wealthy parents who do not approve of this dating and decide to marry her with someone with more money. Their love story began in 1940 and continued through time, coming to us through the mouth of an old man, who reads an old diary to an equally old lady, who is already suffering from dementia.<br/><br/>Usually, sugary and melodramatic novels are not to my liking but this movie has been reasonably digestible, largely due to the satisfactory performance of the main cast. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were able to create a good chemistry together, and that went into the scenes where they are together. There are some dialogues between them that are so sugary that they seem to have been taken from a Brazilian soap opera, but the actors commitment is genuine. Gena Rowlands gave life to an elderly Allie quite well, but it was even better to see the performance of charismatic James Garner as old Noah.<br/><br/>Nick Cassavetes has done a satisfactory job as director, keeping a good pace and achieving a serious, elegant and balanced end product. The soundtrack is quite good, taking good advantage of the rhythms in vogue in the Forties and Fifties. Photography and filming is regular, denoting careful post-production and editing work.<br/><br/>Although this movie sometimes exaggerates in romance and sugar, and it pisses me off a little, its usually a satisfying movie, that gives us an interesting, though very common, love story, very similar to a million of forbidden love affairs already told in soap operas, leaflet novels, cheap literature and B-movies."

Ryan Gosling is the main character Noah, a laconic salt-of-the-earth manual labourer type, and Rachel McAdams is the girl from the upper classes of the American south, with whom he falls in love. The story, set in the 1930s and 40s, also has a framing device in the modern day, featuring the two of them as pensioners in a retirement home, played by Gena Rowlands and James Garner.<br/><br/>The performances are all decent or better, although McAdams was a tad too smiley for me, slightly undermining the worst of her misfortunes. In particular, Gosling is very good at the strong but silent character, internalizing his emotions so he seems dumb to the other characters, while still making his feelings clear to the audience.<br/><br/>The whole is far from perfect - the filming is capable but largely mediocre, the portrayal of dementia is fundamentally different to that experienced by real elderly people, and when it comes down to it, it is all so clichéd that it ends up totally predictable, sapping some of the drama - but one must be wary of being over-critical. Despite what I said above, I found myself looking for reasons not to like The Notebook, because it felt like the kind of film I should not like, as a bloke.<br/><br/>There is actually a fair amount to like. As I said, the acting is all solid, McAdams and Gosling make a nice couple I can root for, and the clichés are at least arranged and assembled in a seamless way with good narrative flow. There are even a couple of really nice photographic touches: the opening sequence has lovely art direction, and there are some World War II scenes that are handsomely mounted. The setting also provides a welcome opportunity for some great swing jazz.<br/><br/>The fact is that I enjoyed it, in an unchallenging, easy-watching kind of way. What's wrong with that?"
"Haynoosh","9","1","4","23 June 2010"," A Classic With A Lot Of Class
","There are some films that can't be classified as artistic or commercial... The moment they open they become a classic, such is Nick Kassavetes's Notebook.<br/><br/>Maybe it is because of the era it depicts, late thirties of the twentieth century, maybe it is the theme of first love which usually is at first sight, but while watching the film I really forgot that it was made in our times, so believable, so authentic was the ambiance. It seemed that the film had already passed the test of time.<br/><br/>Another reason is maybe the naiveness (in the good sense of the word) ,the honesty, the pureness of the characters, both at their old age and while young.<br/><br/>In our days , with the sexual revolution and postmodernist approach to life ,where there are no hinders getting in the way of couples, when first comes the sex , before developing an emotional attachment , which sweeps away the mystery and the innocence, it seems that love, like it used to be , exists only in novels and films,the classic ones of course.<br/><br/>Films like this make us realize the compromise we have made in our hectic journey towards progress , it is not just the memory of the characters which shakes , ours does too. If the past relationships were doomed by convention ,ours are doomed by this anarchistic liberty which like a strong flow of water makes the flower wither before it blossoms. Films like this evoke a sense of nostalgia for ""the good old days"" , despite of the horrible war and losses , from which the film quickly passes.<br/><br/>Casting Ryan Gosling is one of the smartest choices made in a film . His performance stands out the most,after all it is his character that initiates their encounter and pours fuel to the whole faculty of their love.It is his perseverance, his incurable romanticism in believing in what he wants, however impossible it might seem , and Gosling's understated but sensitive and elegant portrayal of Noah,that contributes to the realization of his dream, their dream.<br/><br/>Equally impressive are Rachel McAdams , Gena Rowlands and James Garner in their interpretations , which engage us in their story and convince us through the pages of their Notebook , that we need our memories to define who we are , and in spite of everything we've been through, there are pages definitely worth living , reading and remembering."

","This is the best love story movie. Not only is it just lovy-dobbie but it also shows things that could relate to reality now days. Its not just a simple, she meet him, princess and prince story but it as well shows reality. This movie is great, sad, happy and actually can relate to reality and situations that we have seen in todays life. Love does not always last but we should just follow our heart and do what we believe it is best. We as well should think about when we get older and actually ask ourselves if we see each other with this person? What if something happens to either one of us, are we willing to sacrifice our lives to meet the others standards and so on... this was a little bit long but it was definitely worth it.

","Alright, this is by far the best, as well as most moving movie I have ever seen. I'm a 15 year old male, and the first time I watched this movie, I watched it because a ""popular"" girl, at my high school recommended it to me. I wanted to watch it just because of that. However at 2AM when I was finished watching it, I was in tears. Something I've done before with movies, but not commonly. The whole plot of the movie, the characters, the music. It was amazing. It made me feel like a whole new person. I know, that probably sounds like it's impossible, because it's just a movie, but it really did. The exact moment the credits were over, I just started the movie over again. I couldn't help it. There was not one moment in that whole movie where I was bored, or not thinking about the plot. I felt like, I was shown the true meaning of love or something like that.<br/><br/>About a month after watching it for the first time, I went out and bought 'The Notebook' the book. For me, that's crazy. I hadn't bought a book, ever before that. I've read a lot, but never bought one for myself. It was even crazier because it was a Literature Romance. Something no one that knew me would've expected. I was expecting a lot from the book, and I got way more than I expected. It was one million times better than the movie, and if this was the best movie I'd ever seen, then the book obviously has potential. The book was a page-turner. I didn't want to sleep, and when I woke up I just wanted to read it. I finished it pretty fast, in about a night and a day. All I did was read it. By the end of the book, I was also full of tears. It was absolutely heartwarming. Two months ago I never would've thought I'd be crying over a book about love. However I was, and the book has helped me through a lot. I know it sounds pretty weird, but it has. It always makes my heart grow, and help me re-believe in true love. I don't know, nor do I want to know what kind of person I would be without 'The Notebook'.<br/><br/>Now, since I bought the book written by Nicholas Sparks, I've bought all of his books, as well as ""Leaves of Grass"" by Walt Whitman, which is mentioned in ""The Notebook"" movie, ""The Notebook"" novel, as well as ""The Wedding"", a follow-up to ""The Notebook"". I'm enjoying poetry, nature, and plenty of things I'd never have thought I would before. The Notebook has truly changed my life, and how I will form as an adult.<br/><br/>I just truly, from my heart wanted to thank Nicholas Sparks for creating such a wonderful, heartwarming, touching story, and thanking the actors, actresses, and directors for creating such a touching film. It implements a new section into your daily thoughts, and changes your outlook on life. It sounds like a whole lot coming from just a movie\book, but that's because it is a whole lot. And it's all true.<br/><br/>Definitely 10/10."

","I personally cannot stand romance movies. I think they are all very boring and predictable and I would much rather watch a horror flick or dumb, pointless comedy. But, for some reason, I absolutely loved this movie. The Notebook is a very cute movie. The acting is great, especially Ryan Gosling as Noah (even though I couldn't stand looking at him with a beard), and Rachel McAdams as Ally. The man and woman who played older Noah and Ally were great, too. I didn't think this movie was sad...Well, I did think it was a little sad but I didn't cry or anything. My mom did, though, so I would recommend to keep a box of Kleenex nearby if you decide to watch it. All and all, this movie was very good and I give it *** out of **** stars.

","Everyone has been in love at least once in their lives, so why on earth is it difficult to craft a respectable love story? Over the years, it becomes harder and harder to find a good film about love and all its consequences. Even Titanic, the ultimate chick flick, is a disaster for multiple reasons. The romantic drama is a genre with a bad reputation because the genre always gets riddled with movies full of clichés, predictability, bad acting, bad dialogue, and the inability to tug at your emotions. For every Beauty and the Beast, you have three terrible romantic movies. For every Ghost, Sleepless in Seattle, Princess Bride, you have dozens of monstrosities. Enter The Notebook. <br/><br/>The Notebook is a successful adaptation of a best-selling book by Nicholas Sparks, who is also responsible for A Walk to Remember and Message in a Bottle (the man apparently knows how to appeal to the females). Becoming strongly notorious for bringing out the lovey-dovey in every couple and even more notorious for emotionally destroying females everywhere, The Notebook easily stands as one of the greatest romantic films within the past decade. Becoming everything Titanic wishes it was, this movie is coupled with excellent acting, good dialogue, nicely woven plots, good direction, and good cinematography. Equipped with a good score, nice jazz songs, and a satisfactory ending, this movie will reach out for your heart and will force you to hold a box of tissues throughout the two hours. The surprise success comes with very good reason, for it is a movie that all of those losing faith in love should watch. We all know how difficult love is, especially nowadays in this seemingly cruel and twisted world. <br/><br/>It is actually two stories in one. The first is an elderly man named Duke reading a book to this seemingly depressed elderly woman by the name of Allie who looks like she just wants to spend the rest of her life away from everyone else. The story Duke is reading is about a couple (Noah and Allie) whom have to separate after a perfect summer because of differing futures, the parents of the girl, and their social class differences. Both of them move on, but neither of the two ever wants to move past their love for each other; even when they are seen with other people living different lives. The ultimate test occurs when one of the two is actually about to marry. The Notebook switches between the story and what is going on with Duke and Allie. What keeps this movie fresh and different from the others is that it's actually two stories in one, and both are equally heartbreaking and touching. While it could have benefited from releasing more details about certain elements in the movie, the screenplay was excellent and moved at a respectable pace; all thanks to Jan Sardi and Jeremy Laden. <br/><br/>Directing and acting are the two strongest portions of the movie. Nick Cassavetes (Alpha Dog, John Q) does a wonderful job progressing the story without being too slow, or too fast. He focuses less on the physical aspects of the relationships and more on the dialogue, more on the emotional aspects, which is a rarity and ends up portraying a much more realistic couple. Complimenting the directing is the cinematography, which shows some beautiful scenery, most notably a scene at a lake full of elegant birds. Rachel MacAdams and Ryan Gosling seem pretty much meant for each other. Their passion towards each other, and their anger towards the cruelty of the environment around them is nearly flawless; every line is delivered well and never crosses into cheesy. The supporting cast is also delightful, most particularly James Garner as the very friendly and patient Duke. <br/><br/>Many themes of love are explored here: which includes never forgetting your first love, how love can and will prevail through all obstacles, and how love brings out the best and the worst in you. From the mental and physical breakdown of Noah in the later years to the bitterness that follows the mysterious Allie, love can build you up and tear you apart in a matter of seconds. A major rarity shown in The Notebook is that love is imperfect, and that is shown through the constant arguing between the main characters in the story. Finally, The Notebook isn't as predictable as other romantic flicks, even though they did drop far too many clues and the ending is revealed before it can come and shock you. Nonetheless, the movie ends in a very bittersweet note, so save plenty of tissue paper for the final scene. <br/><br/>Bottom Line: Instant classic romantic movie, because they are so hard to find. When you find a movie that can make you smile, cry, waste tissue paper, and hold your loved one for moments longer afterwards, you've found a good movie. The Notebook has very few flaws, it is indeed a very good movie. The love amongst the main characters is far from cheesy and clichéd. This along with Eternal Sunshine (excellent 2004 romantic drama, totally recommend) stands as the perfect 1-2 romantic drama punch of the decade; they are the best love stories in recent years. A package of good acting, good writing, good directing, and good musical score makes this a must-own if you love these kinds of movies. Breathing some life into the dying genre, The Notebook succeeds as a total tear-jerker; whether you are a male or a female, whether you are single or taken, and whether you have a heart or not."

","The last time I cried this much was when I saw ""Steel Magnolias"". I am not one for depressing movies but my 17 year old saw this and said it was the best she had seen. I think she liked the love story part. James Garner is great as Noah and Gena Rowlands as an older Allie and the love story of how they met was very deep. Rachel McAdams is an absolute knock out and was fantastic in her portrayal of young Allie. Fortunately I never read the book and people I have talked to said you cry more when you read the book, so I guess I was fortunate. Alzheimer's is a wicked disease that tricks the mind and as much as I have heard about it, it wasn't until I watched this movie that I began to see how awful it really is. So as much as I liked some of this movie such as the love story, I really hated the ending."
"nicholas.rhodes","10","1","4","19 September 2004"," THE EPITOMY OF ROMANCE !!
","I discovered quite by chance that this is currently running in my local cinema and was originally attracted to it by its plot ! I was not disappointed, it was an excellent all-rounder. I am assuming the director had prior knowledge of the films ""You're the Cream in my Coffee"", ""Blue Moon"" and ""Splendor in the Grass"" as this film would appear to include elements and themes from all of those.<br/><br/>Picture quality and soundtrack are amazing. I was especially touched by the beautiful photography, the attention paid to lighting effects, the use of slow-motion bird flight, the setting sun. Each scene seems to have been filmed with thoughtfulness and artistic beauty in mind.<br/><br/>Although the film clocks in at over two hours, I could not find one boring or slow moment ! Incredible, as I usually prefer shorter films. Of course we can guess from the beginning the correlation between the older couple and the young one, like in ""BLue Moon"" but this film is far more emotional because the idea of illness 'Alzheimer""s"" is introduced. All the actors give a magnificent performance and, as amply stated elsewhere, a large box of Kleenex is necessary to accompany you to the film.<br/><br/>It is no use narrating the story, but suffice it to say that this is a HIGHLY ROMANTIC film, on a par with the great classics but not quite as sad as some. Although the sexual scenes are not explicit, they are nevertheless erotic without going over the top ! So beautifully is the whole thing filmed that its purchase on DVD is a must ! <br/><br/>This is a film for those who are obsessed by passionate deep love and romance. Some viewers may well be able to relate to what happens between Noah and Allie ! It is not a film for lovers of violent or action-packed thrillers ! The violence is present, but in the strength of the love and chemistry between the principal actors. If you are a true romantic at heart you should NOT MISS this film !!!"

","""The Notebook"" has a script and dialogue that even my die-hard teen girl and fellow crone chick flick fans tittered and gagged at a recent matinee. <br/><br/>
While I am in general fed up with stereotypical high-school romances being pictured as the Love of One's Life story line, this brief teen summer fling turning eternal was ridiculous, but I haven't read the original Nicholas Sparks book to know what was faithful or changed as the central characters have zero on which to base a relationship.  <br/><br/>But there are salvageable elements.  <br/><br/>I came out of curiosity to see Ryan Gosling as a big budget romantic lead, as opposed to his tortured misfits in indie films like ""The Slaughter Rule"" and ""United States of Leland.""  While it strained credulity to the utmost that this carpenter from the wrong side of the tracks reads aloud from Whitman to entertain his dad (who prefers Tennyson, but then he's played by Sam Shephard), he is undeniably captivating eye candy. <br/><br/>
The surprise was how good his co-star Rachel McAdams was.  She lit up the screen like an old-fashioned movie star discovery so that you know that they're meant to be together just because the chemistry is much more electric than any suspense (though I am curious to see how Sparks defined ""waiting for you for seven years"").  Kudos to director Nicholas Cassavetes for casting McAdams - perhaps inspired by his mother Gena Rowlands, both as a life example and for the plot. <br/><br/>It's the kind of movie where I had plenty of time to think about why talented young actresses have been missing from romantic roles for so long, whether in chick flicks or action movies - even the MTV ""Best Couples Award"" is tending to go to same-sex buddies.  Instead, we have had to endure wooden acting by models with little or no acting talent across from young guys whose attraction does put my fanny in the seat.  Which led me to consider several theories about why those with little non-visual talents are getting cast and how this movie and Cassavetes are different: <br/><br/>1) the casting couch is still in play and these women are doing traditional auditions; <br/><br/>2) the male directors have zero conception of what constitutes male/female chemistry on-screen because they play for another team;<br/><br/>
3) the male lead is an egotist who doesn't want his light diminished, not realizing that a great pairing is synergistic; <br/><br/>4) TPTB think the movie can be marketed to men and so the women on the screen can just be wallpaper.  <br/><br/>While the hair and costumes seemed to be modern interpretations of '40's styles and simply did not look authentically like an old Bette Davis movie, the cinematography by Robert Fraisse was lovely.  <br/><br/>The flash forwards to James Garner and Rowlands together in the literal sunset of their lives added much more poignancy and weight to the film than this usual kind of story generates."

These two summer-time lovers sometimes fight and quarrel but manage to come back to each other moments later everytime, except once, and that's when they loose each other seemingly for good.<br/><br/>Although the story has many comic bits, the story does tug at your heartstrings towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams, Ryan Gosling, Gena Rowlands and James Garner all give Oscar-worthy performances; you can see the pure emotion each character give in every scene. <br/><br/>It's an absolutely fantastic adaption of the book.

","For years I've lived with my second Wife and as time goes on I've truly learned the real hidden meaning of love . It's something you can't describe in words but the effects are there. As a youth my judgement was clouded with looks and lust. How much does love at first sight really work. I tried that once and was awestruck by this girl who worked in a store across the way. I wanted her in the worst way . There she was a vision of loveliness in tight jeans and those gorgeous eyes. I walked over to the store where she worked the counter. Each step closer was like an eternity as my legs felt like lead weights pushing forward. I reached the counter and there she was . I was so nervous and petrified. If she says yes what do i do? What if she says no? Anyway I boldly introduced myself and she was insensitive to my presence. I said some stupid things, ""Do you work here? Alot of weather we're having lately."" I was rambling out of nerves as she was getting perturb. I cut to the chase and said my peace. ""Will you go out with me? A mediate response of no came out and I was crushed . My response was ""Why?"" I wouldn't take no for an answer. I started to panic as things went from bad to worse as I said, ""I must have you and we are meant to be together."" She said, ""Get lost smuckie!"" Over a three year period I tried many attempts to sway her. Each attempt ended in predictable failure. The movie the Notebook struck a cord for me in many ways and conjured up old memories of lost loves and Ill health. First the comparison to the part of lost loves. We start at a retirement facility where we see an elderly bespectacled distinguished man named Duke (James Garner) who asks the aid if it's a good day to read to this elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) . A picturesque sunny day is the setting as Duke sits down and opens his notebook as he reads the story of two young people in the late 1930's. We don't know the relationship between the two retirees at first. As Duke reads; the film flashes back in time. Noah (Ryan Gosling) a tall,lanky fellow who works the lumber mill in a sleepy seaside town somewhere in the Carolina's sees the vision of his dreams on the street. This vision is the young and lively Allie Calhoun (Rachel McAdams). Noah pursues her as he climbs the Ferris wheel at a carnival and wants to date her. Allie finally caves in and the two bond quickly. All is not right in the social corners as Allie comes from a wealthy family and Noah is just a poor lumber worker. Joan Allen plays the snobbish mother of Allie and explains that Noah can't possibly give her the life she's accustomed to. Periodically the movie shifts back to the present day on the nursing home lawn where the Gray haired woman wants to know more. Duke reads on as Ally and Noah break up over a war of words. Allie goes off to school in New York as Noah deep down wants to rekindle the relationship as he sets out to write one love letter a day for 365 straight without a response from Ally. A distraught Noah has bigger issues as fate would have it. Noah and World War II sidetrack our story. War ends and Allie meets another man who is wealthy. Noah has a significant widow for company but he still has Allie on his mind. Noah purchases a dilapidated old mansion and fixes it up sparkling new. This house renovation brings the two lovers back together again. The scene on the lake with the ducks reminds me of the night I proposed marriage to my wife. Now the connection on ill health. We learn that the gray haired woman has the beginning s of Dementia, Alzheimer disease and has sporadic memory issues . Some heart wrenching scenes with Garner and Rowlands as her memory comes back but fades quickly. I remember the old days of a young dashing confident James Garner playing the gambler Bret Maverick on my old black and white TV. Nothing stopped in his way but today we see an older version of Garner popping pills and telling his friends ""I keep trying to die but they won't let me."" But in this film we see a caring, sensitive, vulnerable man in the autumn of his years reading the love story of yesteryear from his notebook to his Woman. I think back to my own personal experiences with my Mother-In-Law and her mental deterioration. From the initial phone calls from her office as to why she isn't doing her paper work to wetting herself or opening a car door while in motion. Then lashing out violently hitting my cousin and smacking my daughter for no apparent reason. Then finally lost, not knowing what to do next. The success and following of this film touched many viewers. From Love at first sight to the realities of mortality. But sustainable love between two people and a life time of affection for each other is the real hook in this romantic journey. After films end I'm wiping the tears from my face."

","The movie is nice to watch. I think it deserves a 7 because it is relaxing and moving.
There were some things that bugged me and I would like to state them:
1. In the movie, I felt that Ryan Gosling looked at least 3 years younger than Rachel McAdams, which contradicts the plot.
2. I didn't like the acting of McAdams. Gosling, on the other hand, is great. But she is superficial and I can't feel any chemistry coming from ""Allie"" towards ""Noah"", although ""Noah"" looks very in love with Allie.
3. It is unrealistic in many aspects. How did Gosling pay his mortgage if he wasn't working? Did the scriptwriter just kill Noah's father just so Noah and Allie would be free to fool around in the whole house? Why was Allie so submissive to her parents? ... and much more.
If the movie had a better leading female and was more realistic, it would have deserved a better score. It is a good movie, but the holes in the plot and McAdams's acting and the fact that she look older than her lover really bugged me."

","In real life, an autopsy would be performed, to make sure it was not a murder-suicide. The nurse meant well, but would probably be fired for willingly permitting him to enter his wife's room unsupervised, and (if it had been murder-suicide as in an overdose) the nurse possibly arrested for negligence. <br/><br/>Also, the film shows the depressing state of a nursing home, even one as perfect as in the film. The opening scene that shows patients lining up for their morning meds made me especially angry - people treated like prisoners, their only ""crime"" - growing old.

"Horst_In_Translation","8","0","1","2 January 2017"," The ending makes more than up for occasional weaknesses from the previous 90 minutes
","""The Notebook"" is an American 2-hour movie from 2004, so this one is also already way over a decade old now. It is considered to be a defining movie of the 21st century when it comes to romance, heart-throb and cheering for the characters to become a couple. Lead actors Gosling and McAdams were a couple themselves back then and their performances in this movie made it possibly hard to believe that they split up sooner than later. Many still remember that kiss at the MTV Movie Awards as something truly special that no other awards show from that year had to offer. But first things first: The director is Nick Cassavetes and he is the son of Gena Rowlands who plays a major supporting character here. Another major supporting character is played by the late James Garner. He received an SAG Award nomination for his portrayal and this may have been the closest he ever got to becoming an Oscar nominee, at the tender age of 75 and after almost 50 years in the industry already. The four actors I just mentioned are probably what you can consider the core of the film, the heart and soul. Connolly adds some solid scenes in the first half, Schaff in the second half. These 120 minutes are certainly the most known work for Cassavetes as well as for the two writers Leven and Sardi, even if one of them received an Oscar nomination for the Oscar-winning ""Shine"".<br/><br/>So yeah, this film here is really really famous to this day. It was not as much as a box office success as you may think, but still made roughly 50 million more than it cost. I'd imagine it to be a huge magnet for couples, but apparently many of the guys refused to join their girlfriends and it is definitely a movie that is appreciated more by females than by males, possibly because the concept of eternal love and mastering all the hurdles on the path to happiness is a plot subject that female audiences appreciate more with their approach to romance. Anyway, I quite enjoyed the watch here. I do believe the first 90 minutes of the film had occasional struggles in terms of coherent and realistic story-telling, but there were also scenes that made more than up for it, for example the meeting high up in the air when he asks her for a date facing somewhat playfully the danger of suicide. This was one of my favorite scenes from the Gosling/McAdams moments. The short inclusion of war was a bit random as it was too much of an important subject to be rushed in, even if something crucial happens there and it's fine I guess as the story is about love and not politics or war. And besides, it helped putting the film into perspective in terms of what time we were at what point in the movies. There were other good and not so good scenes and it probably depends on your personal preference which ones you like more and which ones will do nothing for you. For McAdams, it has been a pretty good year recently as she managed her first Oscar nomination and Gosling seems on course to winning his first Golden Globe this year, which means the protagonists in this film are far from forgotten.<br/><br/>And this especially includes the previously mentioned James Garner, who left us a very touching portrayal of an old man struggling with his place in life now that his beloved wife seems to forget him because of dementia/Alzheimer's. These moments when she remembers him are still what he has that connects the two (apart from the children of course) and what makes his life worth living in the face of his own health problems. I personally do not think that the plot twist about who the old people are is what the movie is about because it can be understood and predicted quickly anyway. It is much more about who they have become and the glorious and happy moments take place in the years that we do not see on screen. What we see is just how they got together / are together. So yeah, the last 20 minutes or so have to be among the most touching stuff you will see from the 21st century. Garner shines and Rowlands plays her part very well too. And the story will certainly make your eyes wet. Nicholas Sparks at his best (apart from A Walk to Remember possibly, one of my favorite films of all time). What can I say? You have to experience it yourself to feel the pain, but also to feel the positive moments that make love the best thing in the world. I also believe that these final moments of the film show us how good the flashbacks were and that they did leave a mark for sure, even if you may not have felt it as strongly while watching these scenes from the 1940s and 1950s for example. You may not be amazed by what you see there, but it's essential to really appreciate the ending. Overall, I think this was a film that is good throughout the entirety and turns great at the end, which makes it one of 2004's best. Of course, I connected especially strongly with the film as I find Alzheimer one of the saddest things ever, but still it was an extremely rewarding watch and it's impossible to not feel anything while seeing it. I highly recommend to see it (if there's still people out there who haven't). And make sure you have your girl next to you and lots of tissues."

","The Notebook<br/><br/>The Notebook features James Garner as Duke, Gina Rowlands as Allie Calhoun, Ryan Gosling as Noah Calhoun and Rachel McAdams as Allie Hamilton. The theme of The Notebook is you have to do what makes you happy instead of always trying to please others. We compromise our own happiness to avoid hurting others. You cannot help who you fall in love with despite your differences. Love will always be with you until the end and beyond, while material things can be taken as easily as you get them.<br/><br/>Duke and Allie Calhoun, a married couple living in a long term care facility. Alzheimer's disease has robbed Allie of her memories of the love she once shared with Duke. Duke reads Allie the love story of Noah Calhoun and Allie Hamilton every day. The story is a book that Allie has written once diagnosed with Alzheimer's. Allies parents disapproves of this ""summer love"" (The Notebook, 2004) due to their difference in economic status. One summer night Noah takes Allie to the Windsor Plantation, a historical house that he hopes to purchase and restore one day. The next morning Allies parents take her back to New York, one week earlier than planned. After 3 years Allie meets an injured soldier that is from old money. The two start dating and eventually Lon proposes. While Allie is out buying her wedding dress she is looking in the paper at who is attending her wedding. She opens the paper and sees Noah in front of the Windsor Plantation that he now owns and restored. A flood of feelings come start taking over Allie. She goes back to Sea Brook to see how Noah is doing. The love affair is rekindled. Allie has to choose between her wealthy fiancé and Noah, the love of her life. She chooses her own happiness over her family's, Noah. The Notebook and Titanic share a similar story line. Rose (Kate Winslet) is from a well to do family and her family wants her to be with a man of the same economic status. Jack (Leonardo Dicaprio) is a poor struggling artist who was lucky enough to win tickets to get on Titanic. They fall I love and naturally her parents disapprove. The lighting in The Notebook changes when the mood of a particular segment changes. High key lighting is used in the scene with Allie and Noah on the Lake. That particular lighting is used to intensify the rapturous passion between the two. The scene where Noah takes Allie out on the lake to see the snow geese, long shots, medium shots and close up are all used. The long shots show the isolation between Allie and Noah, everyone else and all of their worries. The medium shots indication the intense feelings to come between them. Close up shots enable the viewers to fuse to the actor's feelings. Love trumps all."

","I'm a teenage girl, so the fact that I haven't watched this until now is a miracle. But oh boy what an anti climax. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, a lot of things are really good in this film. There's nothing wrong with the acting, to be honest I actually think I fell in love with Noah, and the story overall is nor too bad. The main problem is the plot. I'm usually not too good at foreseeing a plot, or at least I try to ignore it, but that was just impossible with this one. It is so obvious what's about to happen, both scene by scene by also the main plot itself. I'm a little disgusted by these really sugar coated kind of love stories but they wouldn't have to take that away, just give the story some mysteries and questions, please!<br/><br/>Everyone should totally watch this though, Gosling is cute as ****"

","""The Notebook"" qualifies as one of the better Nicholas Sparks' romantic dramas. Ryan Gosling plays the young Noah Calhoun, and James Garner plays the elderly Noah. The love of Noah's life Allie is played by Rachel McAdams during her younger years and Gena Rowlands in her later years. Tragically, Allie suffers from dementia and winds up living in a nursing home. Noah enters the same nursing home so he can be with Allie, and he reads to her every day. She loves the story that he reads to her and constantly wonders how it is going to end, never realizing that Noah is her actual husband. Allie has bouts of memory loss, but Noah never forsakes her. As good as Gosling and McAdams are as the carefree, reckless lovers, Garner and Rowland anchor this amazing love story. Director Nick Cassavetes shifts back and forth between the young lovers and the elderly lovers. The only problem with this otherwise memorable film is that he slips up and reveals the identity of the Garner character too early while the younger Allie is trying to decide if she wants to marry for wealth or for love. This is a genuinely touching romance. Nobody gives a bad performance, and there is nothing trite about it. The last scene is guaranteed to make women cry."
"eli_lifeisbeautiful","10","0","1","15 March 2015"," A Beautiful Story that Pulls your Heartstrings
","The Notebook is a movie that is eye caching because it is a fantasy of love that many couples certainly dream about. The love story of Noah and Allie is not altered by difference between social classes, remains a strong love even when challenged by an incurable disease, in this case Alzheimer's. The acting is realistic causing the audience to almost feel the chemistry between the two lovers. Ryan Gosling acts as Noah and Rachel McAdams acts as Allie; both of them became actors to look out for in the future after such performances in that movie. Appealing to the audience of teens and young adults, it won many awards at the Teens' Choice Awards the year after the movie was released. Some examples of the awards the movie won were Teen Choice Award for Best Movie Love Scene (2005), Teen Choice Award for Choice Date Movie (2005), and many more. The Notebook is a great movie because of the quality of acting, unique plot, emotions of the story, scenery, and runtime with no way to improve on it. The story may seem like a cliché story of two young lovers who fall in love and belong to different social classes, yet the thing that adds a twist to the story making it unique is the addition of Alzheimer's. One of the lovers begins to forget their relationship, but the other to help his sweetheart remember, writes a notebook to remind her of their story, remaining with her till their death. It is a story that can move some to tears since it appeals to emotion. Noah always being there, waiting for seven years for her, and building the house that Allie always dreamed off causes the audience to fall in love with his character. To him that house meant that there was still a chance for them to be reunited, even when the odds were against him, showing an undefeated hope. Later, Noah's love is challenged again, and James Garner did an amazing job portraying senior Noah. They are defied, and James portrays beautifully the emotions of a man that is not willing to give up, even to an illness that has no cure and everyday becomes worse. His wife losing her memory and forgetting even the love she has for him, to fight this he wrote in a notebook their story, and read their story to her to help her remember. His acting is so realistic, making the audience wonder why do they have to suffer again. Gena Rowlands, acting as senior Allie, was a wonderful performance that seems as if she is exactly like her character, a person who is nice and struggling to keep those special moments in her memory. The scenery helps the movie, adding to that romantic atmosphere. There are some sceneries that are common, such as parts of the movie in front of the beach, the waves splashing, and many birds fly through the air where the couple acts playfully in the water. One of the scenes that by itself makes the atmosphere dreamy is when Noah and Allie are in a canoe floating on the middle of a lake that is surrounded by trees. The water is being moved gently by the white ducks swimming in many directions, the light of the sun gently hitting the surface of the water, and a breeze moving their hair softly. Other places become romantic because of the actors. For example, when Allie and Noah are walking on the street at night and by doing little things, such as dancing under the stars in some street, there is no need for anything complex. A street and them humming a song while dancing is enough to create a moment that would be normal into one that becomes a special moment that would be enough to sweep some women off their feet. The runtime of 120 minutes does not matter that is long since every moment there is a momentum builder, making the viewer wonder how everything would be settled. Allie's development of Alzheimer's condition builds anticipation of the outcome. A movie that does not only show the sweet side of love where everything works out, the characters feel butterflies in their stomachs and romantic moments are shown. This film also shows the time where there are challenges, and the other person is there to support them, no matter what may be the result. The main characters struggle. Noah is strong when Allie's condition becomes worse to the point that she does not even remembers her grandchildren. A first love that will not die no matter how big the challenge is. There is never a dull moment since the actions of their love are harmoniously shown throughout the entire movie. This movie is characterized by a matchless plot because of that twist creates curiosity in the viewers. The acting is exceptional, draws audience into the story making the viewer see the main protagonists' power of will and love that is eternal. Emotions that are so powerful that seem to flow from the screen and be transmitted to the audience. Sentiment that make the audience sigh, smile and even move some of the viewers to tears. Those beautiful sceneries create moments that are almost magical. The run time is flawless, since the moments that normally would be simple, were transformed into opportunities to show how this couple with little things showed their love for each other. Also there was anticipation build up on how their destiny would turn out to be. The story of these lovers gives hope to young couples; proving that even when a relationship may face different types of problems, if they are both willing to work hard for that relationship, then their love will be able to defeat all those challenges. A movie worth the time of the audience for how wonderfully it was put together."

","I wish I could redirect every person that thinks 50 shades of Gray is a good love story/movie to this. This is a genuinely great love story that has enough of a plot to keep you entertained throughout the movie. It does go with the very popular cliché of the bad boy country boy chasing after the privileged girl and the family doesn't approve but imo not so professional opinion it was well,written, well put together, well acted. The list goes on and on <br/><br/>The on screen chemistry between the 2 stars (Ryan and Rachel) was fire hot and it stayed to the very end. James Garner does a great job with his story telling and showing so much compassion to his sick wife, showing he was willing to do what ever it took to stay with the love of his life. Yes might have been a sappy love story for women, But even from a man's perspective I thought it was very well done."

","In a nursing home, Duke (James Garner) reads a romantic story to an old lady (Gena Rowlands) with dementia. The story starts at a carnival in 1940. Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) meets young heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) spending the summer in Seabrook. Noah won't take no for an answer. She eventually let her guard down and spends the summer with the lumber yard worker. Her parents do not approve but let the summer fling go on. Near the end of the summer, they visit an abandoned house called The Windsor Plantation. They are interrupted by Fin (Kevin Connolly) who tells them that her parents had sent out the police for them. He wants to let her go, they fight, and break up. While attending Sarah Lawrence College, Allie's mother (Joan Allen) kept all of Noah's letters. Noah goes to enlist to fight in WWII and Allie volunteers as a nurse. She meets wounded soldier wealthy Lon Hammond Jr (James Marsden). Noah decides to rebuild the plantation house hoping that Allie will return to him.<br/><br/>Nicholas Sparks has made a living writing these melodramatic romances. This one has slightly more depth. First there is the power of the Rowlands Garner pairing to give it weight. Their performances keep this grounded and show what real acting is. They are so good that even cheesy dialog sounds great. But what makes this movie stand out is the chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. These are two charismatic personalities and they put a lot of energy into their characters. Gosling has the mischievous cool while McAdams has the adorable spirit. I love that they fight harder than most sappy love story. The fighting generates so much passion. Rowlands' son Nick Cassavetes is directing and he does a good job. The fact that James Marsden isn't playing a douche allowed more believable chemistry between Lon and Allie. I like that the choices aren't laid out as good and evil. <br/><br/>I don't particularly like that Noah saw Allie and Lon together. It's too coincidental. It's one of many things in this that is too written. Why 365 letters? Couldn't he write one more? It's another cheesy poetic turns that Sparks like so much. Overall, this is a traditional romance done very well staring two very photogenic big personalities."

","Never in my life have I seen such a creative and accurate masterpiece. The story is just heart-breaking but so creative. The acting was perfect and I love how Noah and Allie form their relationship. How they are both from different classes of wealth and not even caring. Movies like this show you what real love is. Because this movie is based on two late teens right? It was so real, unlike seeing teenagers today who date for showing off and then breaking up after like what? A week? Not even taking their love seriously and real? After watching this movie, it made me feel as if it's important to wait for your first love and that it will happen unplanned and out of the blue. This movie will be enjoyed by anyone really. Not everyone, especially the male population would enjoy movies such as this since they call romantic movies ""chick flicks"" but I guarantee you that they would really respect this particular movie and at least like it themselves. Give it a try boys. You'll be surprised."

","A classic tale of love between a small time but very honest and straightforward guy who falls in love with a rich maiden. The first thing that stood out about this movie is the casting which was simply brilliant. Ryan Gosling plays the character of a town boy with perfection and his character portrayal made him look more sophisticated than some of the richest folks around him in the movie storyline. A girl who has literally been in an invisible golden cage all her life falls for the charm of what reality and its exuberance is all about, experiences what its like to be free from all worldly affairs. And as if this wasn't enough, the story has been rounded off with the most stomach crunching tales of selfless love with the two souls literally dying in each other's arms. A source of inspiration for many movies. OK, the best scene in this movie the where the two love birds lay down in the middle of a street crossing, depicting the freedom that people often miss to even notice by being busy in their day to day lives, a freedom which only comes by being completely drowned in a crazy eternal feeling called love!"

The passion and the chemistry that the characters that was showed able to be felt through the movie. The elderly Noah and Allie who was played by James Garner and Gena Rowland, took the parts and ran with them. In my opinion the director, Nick Cassavetes, choose right when he cast the role for both the younger Allie and Noah and the older Allie and Noah. The character's made me think that the movie was real and there was no way anyone could tell me wrong. To me this movie is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.

","Producer: Lynn Harris and Mark Johnson Director: Nick Cassavetes Rating: 8/10 Distributor: New Line Cinema Running time: 123 minutes<br/><br/>The film is based on a book written by Nicolas Sparks. Nick Cassavetes directed the movie. Besides beginning a good director, he is a good actor as well. In the same year, he made this movie, he received a Daytime Emmy Award for a television special ""The incredible Mrs. Ritchie"". Another great and successful movie is ""My sister's keeper"". This movie as well as ""The notebook"" are tearjerkers, but they are not just tearjerkers, they tell a great story too. The movie begins in a nursing home, where a old man called Duke reads a story to a old woman, whose memory is slowly fading. The story is about a country boy, Noah, and a city girl, Allie. They meet at a fair, it was love at first site for Noah. After a special night where Allie also fell in love with him, they were together the whole summer. At the end of the summer Allie's parents took her back home, so she could go to college. At first she wanted to go, however at the end she wanted to stay with Noah. Although Noah wrote a letter every day, Allie never received one. After seven years of heartache Allie met a rich soldier Lon and got engaged. One day, before she got married, Allie saw a picture of Noah in a newspaper. She wants to see him and went back to the village to spend some time with him. Allie didn't want to leave, so she had to choose between the rich Lon and Noah. The part of Noah was played by Ryan Gosling. He started acting when he was 13 years old. He doesn't just act, he writes music and has a band ""Dead Man's Bones"". This year he started to write a script ""How to catch a Monster"". Ryan played the role very well, he's nonchalant way of playing brings the country boy alive. He's co-actress is Rachel McAdams, is playing the role of Allie. Just as Ryan she began acting at the age of 13. In 2004 she played in the movie ""Mean Girls"". For her role in this movie she got the award for ""Breakthrough female performance"". Duke was played by James Garner, a very famous actor. The old woman was played by Gena Rowlands. This movie won 11 prices and was nominated 7 times. One of the prices was for the best kiss. Maybe this was due to the fact that the lead actors had a affaire during the making of the movie. This is a great example of a romantic drama. It is a love story, but with ups and downs. At first she is not very fond of him, he has to persuade her to spend time with him. A good example is the following scene: He climes on the Ferris wheel to ask her on a date. He hangs on a bar and pretends he's gone fall unless she says yes. I found it a very good movie. It is not just a typical romantic movie, the story could also be reality. It is not all fantasy, summer love happens in real life. You are dragged into the story because the persons are very sympathetic. The movie shows us how people can care for each other, like Duke reads to the women every day. So I recommend this movie because it just a simple movie and not a romantic cliché. You don't always need to have special effects, simple can also be good."

","This is definitely the best movie I have ever seen. I totally love Rachel and Ryan, and the sparks between them are so natural so real. It is a great romance story that made me cry and the feeling was everlasting. But there is more I want to say.<br/><br/>When Allie has to make the choice between Lon and Noah, she tells Lon that she loves him but she feels like an entirely different person with Noah. (Here I should say I don't doubt her feelings for Lon. Actually I think Lon is a great guy and Allie truly loves him.) The point is clear. With Noah, she paints all the time, she lives in a dream house, and she does things she truly wants. Allie finds her true self only when she is with Noah. There is this scene with Allie saying ""I don't paint any more"" ""I used to paint all the time"" and Lon responding by ""So paint"" in a tone that clearly shows he doesn't care much. But when she comes back to Noah, the surprise for her is her own room and a beautiful balcony for her to paint. That is the difference between Noah and Lon. Noah represents a life that Allie has always truly wanted. Lon represents a life that is secured but clearly lack of some key elements. She ended up choosing Noah not only because she loves Noah more, but also because she loves herself more when she is with him.<br/><br/>I learned very important lessons from this movie. Every time when you are making a difficult choice, just ask yourself, what do I want? What do I really want? Don't care about what others think, just ask your heart. The choice is never easy, but your have to give it a try, and you have to overcome all the difficulties with a brave heart. And try to picture yourself in 20, 30 years to see if it is the life you want.<br/><br/>If any of you happen to understand Chinese I have a great review on The Notebook to recommend.<br/><br/>http://movie.douban.com/review/1549231/"

"jerry-root","9","0","1","12 December 2013"," The Notebook as a metaphor
","The Notebook a story of Cognoscente Love While on an airplane I saw the The Notebook. When I watch a movie I like to watch passively in order to fully and uncritically enter into the world developed by the film. Rather than thinking critically at first—there will be time for that later—I want to give the story-teller his due, let him do his best artistically in order to create a coherent world that invites me in. After the film I like to revisit the story and ask critical questions about it. I like to ask, was there any point in the film where I felt particularly moved emotionally? If so, what might have been going on in the film to stimulate this. There was such a scene in The Notebook that moved me deeply and brought tears to my eyes.<br/><br/>I must put the scene in context. The Notebook begins when an older man—played by James Garner— enters the room of an elderly woman (Gina Rowlands) at a nursing home. She seems confused and a little standoffish. A nurse reassures by saying, ""Its OK, he comes every day to read to you."" In this moment one surmises that this woman has dementia of some sort and this kind man volunteers at the hospital by reading to the patients.<br/><br/>The film goes back and forth between this elderly man reading to this elderly woman and flashbacks from the book being read. The story is about a young man (Ryan Gosling) and a young woman (Rachael McAdams) who, against all odds working against them, fall in love. The young woman is from an upper class family; the young man is relatively poor. The woman comes from sophistication and refinement; the man is unrefined but tender hearted. The man has a high school diploma and likes poetry; the woman is educated in the best schools her parents can afford. The woman has a controlling mother and father; the man's mother has died and his father is present but somewhat distant. The young woman lives far away and only comes into proximity with the man when she happens to be summering in the town where he lives. There is so much distance between these two: socially; economically; geographically; educationally; and, to compound matters World War II breaks out and adds another degree of separation as the young man goes off to war and the young woman working as a nurse begins to fall for a patient more of her class and sophistication. With all the odds against them, this man and this woman do fall in love and marry.<br/><br/>About two-thirds of the way through the film the viewer puts it together that this is in fact the old couple's story. The man reads to the woman he fell in love with so many years before. Near the end of the film as the day is drawing nigh and the story nearly read, the older man and the older woman are eating a nice dinner by candle light. A single rose in a vase adorns the table and a phonograph is playing the music that has contributed to so many of this couple's memories together. The entire atmosphere is shouting out to the woman trapped in the deep recesses of her dementia. As the story ends, the woman says, ""That is the most beautiful story I have ever heard; and it sounds so very familiar."" In that moment cognition washes across her face and her expression moves from the vacuousness that once characterized it to an expression flush with perception. She looks at her husband and says, ""It's our story isn't it?"" He says, ""Yes."" She asks, ""How much time do we have?"" He answers, ""Last time it was about five minutes."" She asks what any mother would, ""How are the children?"" He says, ""There fine. They were here to see you today."" She asks, ""Tell them I love them,"" and he assures her that he will.<br/><br/>Then, as the music is still playing, she says, ""Hold me, can we dance?"" He stands and takes her in his arms and they begin to move slowly to the music. Then just as quickly as cognition came to her so her oblivion returns. She finds her self in the arms of a stranger and screams. The orderlies rush into the room and find it necessary to sedate the old woman in order for her to calm down. James Garner's character is standing, watching it all, biting his knuckle, and weeping. It was that scene that moved me so deeply. In fact it moves me now as I type this. Why? What was it that was so touching about that scene? Of course it has all the sentimentalism of a great love story between a man and woman; magnified by the triumph of their love to reach across the many things that sought to separate them even at the end of their lives. But, as I thought about it I realized there was more to it than that.<br/><br/>I believe the story is a kind of metaphor or analogy that explains something of the quality of every human story. For certainly, all of our lives consist in God telling each of us, perpetually, about his love story with us. He tells of His wooing and loving us. He has placed us in an environment that, one way or another, cries out to us His great love for us. Most of our lives we live as with dementia. Then moments occur when cognition of His love occurs and we respond. Then as easily as we fell into cognition, in a moment, we fall out. In Garners' tears and the biting of his knuckles, I think I saw something analogous to the love of God for us. He cannot love us any more than He does. Infinite love has no capacity to increase. The question is will we be cognizant of that love or not?"

","It is a very touching movie, I could feel the kind of love they wanted to transmit, It showed me that sometimes your first can be the truly one. everything about this movie can apply to real situations and experiences in our daily life and you have to find the strength to go for it no matter what, but most important is that you have to fight for your happiness, and be honest with your self and the people around you.It also showed me how a person can feel what is like to be in love and how secure you have to be before made a decision and to be honest about that .How much you can discover from that person to know if is the rigth or not. I also learned that when the chances are for you and no one else, you have to take it ."

","The Notebook is one of my all-time favourite movies. Its a constant, and classic love story that makes you feel as if you are there watching it.. as if you are one of the characters, which makes the impact of the story just that much more real. There really are no words to describe how this movie makes you feel, but one thing is for sure... It will make you feel. After watching it, i've often just.. sat where i am and just thought about it. It's just one of those movies that you will think about 30 years after watching it, and still get that same feeling in your heart.. and you'll know that it touched you in one way or another. If you haven't seen it, you really are missing out... Its a classic!"

","I just watched this movie again for the second time and watched it from a more technical point of view. I am not a big fan of romantic movies. I am however a fan of very good acting and I would have to put Rachel McAdams performance in this movie in my top ten. I am surprised she was not nominated for more awards for this roll but I suppose chick flicks are not really taken all that seriously in the big leagues. It seems like a role that would require some very delicate balance to get it right. My thought is she got it just right. Over all I think she makes this movie - her costar Ryan Gosling I know has also gotten some acclaim for his performance but it was just good IMHO not sensational as was McAdams performance."
"bbewnylorac","7","0","1","17 August 2013"," Not as bad as it could have been
","I stumbled on this movie on TV late at night and thought: 'Oh, no, this looks really cheesy.' But I kept watching (there wasn't much else on) and I think the acting really elevated this to something meaningful. Gena Rowlands, as Allie, the elderly, southern belle with dementia, is a real standout in her role: one minute sharp and wise, the next minute not recognising her own children. It's a really meaty role and Rowlands really runs with it. Rachel McAdams, also, throws everything into her role as the younger Allie, who must choose between two lovers -- whether to follow her heart or her head. It's a role that, under a lesser actor, could have been really pedestrian. But McAdams reacts and acts, rather than just reciting the lines and looking pretty. The scenes are sharply edited and the music isn't too overwhelming. The scenery is gorgeous and the costumes beautiful. Apart from the raunchy love scene, it's quite an old fashioned movie. Overall, it's good entertainment, and I even found myself bringing out the tissues at the end."

","The Notebook IMDb Review<br/><br/>The movie starts out in a nursing home with an elderly man, Duke (James Garner) reading to an elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) from a notebook. A love story which so happens to be their own love story. <br/><br/>Staged in the 1940's this romantic drama showcases a poor boy, Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) who has fallen in love with a rich girl, Alison (Allie) Hamilton (Rachel McAdams). Although in the beginning, when they meet at a carnival, Alison wants nothing to do with Noah, it's only a short time before their summer romance is in full force. Noah's had to work for everything his whole life and Alison has the world at her feet. Noah and Allie are separated by her parents at the end of summer when they move away. Noah writes Allie everyday for a year but Allie's mother intercepts the letters which leads Allie to go on with her life and eventually fall in love with Lon Hammond (James Marsdon). While engaged to Lon, Allie runs across a newspaper story that features Noah and his completion of the Windsor Plantation that he had promised her he would do someday. After passing out from the surprise of the article and continued contemplation, she decides to go back to Seabrook to make sure Noah is OK and find closure with their relationship before she gets married to Lon. As a result, she is faced head on with the feelings that never went away, and found out the truth about Noah's letters. As they take a few days to reminisce about their true love, they end up making love to each other. Although Allie is confused she ends up choosing Noah over Lon, as she knows that is where her heart is.<br/><br/>Back at the nursing home, elderly Allie (Gena Rowlands) has dementia and as Duke (James Garner) reads the story to her, she is able to remember the story and fall in love with Noah all over again, but only for a few moments before she is stricken with her memory loss one again and forgets everything. In the end, they both die peacefully together holding hands.<br/><br/>This film has a similar theme to that of Dear John and The Vow. Love Conquers All.<br/><br/>The lighting in the movie was fantastic. I loved how the lighting was warm and showed off the summer romance. I also enjoyed the the passion and laughter in the movie and how it was all set in the 1940's with the costumes and the music. It made me wish I had lived during that time."

","The Notebook is based off a Nicholas Sparks novel(so technically this is going to be a tearjearker as some of his novels got turned into movies like A Walk To Remember which is my favourite live action movie of all time,Dear John with Channing Tatum as a US Marine and its quite similar to another movie called The Lucky One with Zac Efron as a marine,and The Last Song with Miley Cyrus and her real life boyfriend/fiancé Liam Hemsworth).<br/><br/>The story of The Notebook is about an elderly couple both played tremendously well by James Garner(no his no relation to Jennifer Garner I thought he was one stage but his not)and Gena Rowlands who live in a Nursing Home together as Rowlands'charcther has Dementia,and Garner's charcther has heart problems and he won't leave his wife's side as they are so loyal together. So every day he reads her a story about this young couple called Noah and Allie(both played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) who are sorta like Romeo and Juliet. They fall in love at first sight when Noah met her at a carnival and wanted Allie to go out on a date with him and she wouldn't but she then accepted,Allie's parents are stuck up millionaires who thinks Noah is trash and not perfect for their daughter(especially her mother who is a real pain in the butt),and of course both Allie and Noah break up for a while only for faith to bring them back together again.<br/><br/>Problem is however Allie is engaged to some pilot played by an unrecognizable James Marsden(from Enchanted and 27 Dresses)who was injured when he met Allie working at the Hospital where she is qualified as a nurse and Noah is heartbroken.<br/><br/>But what does there story have in common with James and Gene's charcthers????<br/><br/>WARNING THIS IS A SPOILER DO NOT READ ON ANY FURTHER IF YOU DON'T WANT THIS TO GET RUINED.<br/><br/>Its actually THEM that he is talking about to his wife as they are Noah and Allie in their old stages of life.<br/><br/>Bottom line: When I first saw this on TV I thought I wasn't going to like it so when I got this for a bargain in Golden Discs for 6 Euro,I had to get my hands in it because I'm a sucker for a good romantic drama and my favourite romantic drama of all time has to be(actually I have two; Titanic and A Walk To Remember because they both got incredible stories and the cast was brilliant in both films).<br/><br/>Here its the same: The cast was brilliant especially James Garner,Gene Rowlands,Rachel McAdams,and Ryan Gosling,the story was so beautifully well told,even the setting was great as its set in 1940s America during the War. The music was depressing as hell,but hey it has to have depressing music since after all this is a tearjearker(so you have been warned,if you are up for a great love story since Titanic then look no further with this film).<br/><br/>Overall: The Notebook is a heartbreaking love story about a low class boy and a high up girl who are thrown together by chance and fall in love with each other.<br/><br/>Bottom line I have nothing bad to say about it other than the depressing music but for that its a 10/10"

","An old love story – the boy from a poor family, the girl, a rich one. Her parents want her to marry the rich boy for security, instead of the poor one for love. Although the plot is old, the story is told exceptionally well - very engaging for the audience. The actors are outstanding. Each brings his/her character to life believably. The fine actors draw us into the story making us care about all the individuals involved. The plot also involves an old woman in a nursing home who suffers dementia. The movie tastefully requires the audience to ponder dementia, and the man who loves this woman. Normally dementia would be an unpleasant topic, but again, the fine acting makes us care about the woman and those who love her. This would be a 4-star film were it not for the immoral behavior of two young lovers. Too bad we can't replace that with honor, restraint, and selfless love."

","Once every generation there is a romantic movie that just works. In the 80s it was ""Somewhere in Time"". In the 2000s it was ""the Notebook"". There is an epic sweep of time and passion that feels real. The leads are convincing and moving. Rachel McAdams is a luminous expressive actress and every emotion of joy and sadness is shown on her face. Ryan Gosling's understated passion is a perfect counterpoint to Rachel's performance and the chemistry between them is undeniable. He is right for the underdog part. The niceness of the characters is refreshing. Supporting cast is well chosen from Joan Allen to James Marsden. The older characters are good played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands although they look nothing like the younger ones.<br/><br/>The music used and score are appropriate for the time. The filming on location in South Carolina is beautiful and evocative adding much to the charm of the movie.<br/><br/>It isn't a perfect movie - some of the dialog isn't well written. Although the past and present story lines are what makes this story unique, some of the flashing back and forth is distracting and the dementia is a little overwhelming. The class difference thing is a bit clichéd. But in the end it doesn't matter. It's not just the ultimate chick flick date night movie. It works as a whole and remains the most poignant and deeply felt of the Nicholas Sparks stories."

","I didn't expect a lot, I just borrowed the movie from the library and thought it was a good film, because the cover looked great. The trailer I watched represented the film a little bit like an old love story, which it also is, but it is more than that. I expected a better end, but this is also OK, it shows that nothing has a totally perfect end. «The notebook» is a drama-romance-story. It's a dramatic love story. The message is that love can last forever, no matter what you're going through. In the film, a passionate young man, Noah falls in love with Allie, a young woman in summer, at a carnival. They come together and are totally in love with each other. During the summer, they spend a great time together and experience a lot. Allie's family, who is wealthy doesn't want her to go out with Noah, because his family is poor. After the painful breakup, Allie leaves and goes at a university in New York. After the death of Noah's father, Noah, desolated, has a plan, to build the house that he promised Allie. During that time, Allie works as a nurse in a hospital and falls in love with a wealthy handsome guy. When they are engaged, she sees a report in the newspaper of Noah with the wonderful new house. Because of that, Allie goes to Noah and they talk together about everything. Then Allie has to decide, Noah or her engaged guy. It's very difficult for her because she loves both of them.<br/><br/>The main characters are Noah and Allie. Noah (Ryan Gosling) is a poor young man, who lives with his father in a nice little house. He works in a wood factory. He's adventurous and totally in love with Allie. Allie (Rachel McAdams) is a rich lovely young woman, who lives in a big house for summer. She's beautiful and interesting. I find, they are both really good actors. All the actors in the film grew absolutely in their characters. This film is represented in a straightforward manner. It has a few very powerful scenes, for example the scene, where Allie and Noah are in the boat with all the swans, it has a magical effect and then a little later in the rain, they fell in love again, from which the cover is made. The scenes are all very special and make you feel being in another world. The film «The notebook» is one of my favorite films. I really enjoyed it. I don't like very love story, but this movie is a special love story. This film is one of the most beautiful and romantic films I have ever seen. It is pretty sentimental and romantic. I was impressed by the main actors, they act really well. I already watched the movie ten times and could watch it ten more times. It just has a powerful effect on me; it brings me in another world for two hours. In my eyes, every scene is good, just the last scene is a little bit sad, but that's like it is. The scene in the boat is my favorite, with all the swans, after seeing each other for a long time, Allie and Noah fall in love again. It is a powerful and beautiful scene. One of the first scenes, where Noah jumps on the big wheel at the carnival to ask Allie out on a date, is also one of my favorite scenes. These scenes are special and have some unexpected lovely effects. I would recommend this exciting film to everybody, especially to girls and woman who like exciting beautiful love stories, because the movie is an adventurous romantic story. This movie is beautiful and popular. You should go and see it; it's a film, which should be seen. This movie isn't really comparable, it's unique. It's one of the best films ever. So, go and see it!"

","The Notebook is a classic love story, you fall in love with the characters and become so intrigued you feel as if you were there. This romantic tale of two lovers split by their differences is not like any other love story. The story feels as if you are reading Allie and Noah's personal diaries, it is so intensely detailed but yet always keeps you questioning. It is not one of those stories where you can predict what may happen in the end. You are constantly questioning what is going to happen, at some points you are almost upset with what happens where you almost believe that is Allies final choice. The movie really draws in its audience, from beginning to end you just can't stop watching.

Unconditional love, sacrifice, freedom, pain, tears, happiness, passion and moving moments, all of that is shaped in 123 minutes and at the end you wish there was more. Ofc, don't judge me to fast, I believe in love, but this kind of story is pretty unrealistic and in my head is more like some science-fiction movie created specially for some romantic souls. This fact don't reduce art factor of this creation, but in contrary tells how powerful can be and effect on you, if you ever shared such emotions with someone or maybe, didn't, but wanted to express them.<br/><br/>All that I say above is just invitation to enjoy in one really beautiful movie that will not change your world, but for sure will touch you deeply. <br/><br/>Closest looking movie: It's pretty hard to pick one, but if I need to pick one probably it would be Titanic >> Art factor: 3/5 Acting factor:3/5 Fun factor: 5/5 Plot factor: 4/5"
"clancyfrazier","10","0","1","16 November 2012"," Not-so-typical Love Story
","Every girl dreams of having the perfect romance story to tell to their loved ones. She meets her prince charming, they fall in love and go off and get married. This predictable plot line is repeated in the American media countless times, yet people still go crazy for these types of stories and films. The Notebook is your typical love story yet it comes with a twist at the end. Spoiler alert: it ends the same way every mushy love story does, together forever with an unrealistic setting and the audience dramatically sobbing their eyes out. But hey, isn't that why us women die over great love stories? I'll admit, I am a sucker for these stories as well. This movie makes you feel as though you were flashed back to the early 1940s in North Carolina with the rich and beautiful Allie Hamilton and the poor yet attractive Noah Calhoun. They share an idyllic summer fling that eventually turns into something so much more. The young love grows and endures through countless wars and parent disapproval. The overall plot reflects Romeo and Juliet, but it is presented with fresh and different scenery and exciting charisma that makes the movie not as predictable as one might think. There are two main reasons this movie is truly a good love story. The most important reason is the drop dead gorgeous heartthrob, Noah Calhoun. He will cause all women's hearts to melt. He makes this movie come to life. He is the ideal Prince Charming; strong, smooth, and dashingly handsome. Since this movie is intended for women mainly, he will definitely help reel in viewers. He is easily likable with his humbleness and steady, hardworking hands. He sweeps Allie off her feet, making all the ladies in the audience wish it was them. In my opinion, looking at Noah Calhoun for almost two hours during a movie is definitely worth my time. Another thing that makes this movie so romantic and powerful is the setting. North Carolina is one of the most beautiful, serene settings in the United States. With its natural flowing rivers, classic colonial architecture, and wide open meadows, the setting really does set the mood for falling in love and creating memories, making the movie seem even more magical.<br/><br/>The main purpose of this movie was just to entertain an audience, majority of them being female, with a solid, memorable love story. The characters are very likable and it has a lighthearted, uplifting mood that comes along with it. The movie takes you on an emotional roller-coaster that is the ideal love story while still being as realistic as it can be. It is probably my favorite movie due to the fact that it leaves you wanting more when you are sitting there bawling your eyes out at the ending scene. The story is very compelling from the opening scene to the end, and it is a permanent movie in my collection."
"erin1595","8","0","2","16 November 2012"," The Notebook is FANTASTIC
","From the best-selling novel by Nicholas Sparks this movie, like the book, truly captivates your heart. To those who haven't seen it I hate to sound corny but you must understand this movie makes you cry real tears. The love story is one of a kind. The effect offers something for anyone who has ever been in love, yearned for love, or has two hours to kill on a rainy night. I saw the movie before I read the book and was actually, in this situation, quite pleased because the actors they picked for Allie and Noah were absolutely spot-on and I pictured them as I read the book. Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are definitely easy on the eyes and their chemistry on screen made you believe that Allie and Noah were head over heels in love with one another. I will go head and answer your question yes , it is a tad mellow-dramatic with a theme of love conquers all, yet you somehow look past the sappy and get hooked into the story. <br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT To the ones who have seen this movie, WOAH I know weren't expecting to find out the old couple in the beginning were actually Noah and Allie! I love that surprise attack that just pulled your heart even more. Nicholas Sparks really made me raise my standards! To have a man like Noah as a husband ooh baby sign me up. I really don't see any flaws in this movie what so ever. I do hate the fact that she doesn't remember Noah and her children and their wonderful years together but hey what else do you expect from Nicholas Sparks? He never fails to add that depressing edge. <br/><br/>This movie touches on so much. The southern 1940's setting, her parents who are wealthy and want someone for Allie that is of their ""class"", separate Noah and her because he just isn't of their social position, Allie's mother keeping heartfelt letters from Noah away from Allie for a year knowing in her mind that she too once loved a man that worked in construction, and watchers also falling for Lon even though you want Noah in the end because Sparks just strives to keep you on your toes.<br/><br/>Now, guys you might be standoff-ish, because this movie is a proclaimed ""chick flick"". But I did watch this with my boyfriend and he thoroughly enjoyed it. Not once did he roll his eyes or fall asleep. I will be the first to say, a guy definitely will have to be in the mood for a slower romantic movie, but he won't regret it after it is over. The Notebook is interesting to watch because of the time period and the fun loving relationship Noah and Allie have and how they find each other after so many years still so in love with one another. It wasn't your typical predictable love story. The twists and turns the ups and down were exhilarating to watch. I could sit down and watch this movie once a week and never once be bored. That's saying a lot for a two hour movie! I know exactly what will happen and the lines out of their mouths but it never fails to make my heart sink when it starts to rain and the booming thunderstorm just sets the tone and  you know the rest. I have spoiled this movie for you if you haven't seen it but like I said I watch it over and over and still cry every time. It is well worth it to watch The Notebook and be taken away for two hours into a magical love story."

","The movie, ""The Notebook"" was an inspiring movie to that teaches you to peruse the ones you love. The meaningful script and the amazing actors/ actresses. The actors in this movie highlight the meaning in the book that it was based off of. Nicholas Sparks had a detailed description of the characters intended for depicting into the cast that was casted. <br/><br/>The great storyline left tears rolling down checks and a longing for a lifelong partner that would stand by you through everything. ""Sometimes we need to be apart to understand just how much we truly love each other,"" is one of the beautiful quotes that shows how strong Ali and Noah's love is for each other. <br/><br/>The meaningful script made the connection between Ali and Noah seem unbreakable. Meaningful lines such as the one stated below, force you to think if there is anyone that would ever speak those words to you; if you have so to speak a 'Noah.' Emotional moments like this make you stop and think; to have compassion. """"My Dearest Allie. I couldn't sleep last night because I know that it's over between us. I'm not bitter anymore, because I know that what we had was real. And if in some distant place in the future we see each other in our new lives, I'll smile at you with joy and remember how we spent the summer beneath the trees, learning from each other and growing in love. The best love is the kind that awakens the soul and makes us reach for more, that plants a fire in our hearts and brings peace to our minds, and that's what you've given me. That's what I hope to give to you forever. I love you. I'll be seeing you. Noah,""<br/><br/>Although the movie is full of emotion as any chick-flick is, the storyline and compassion behind the words are overwhelming. The thought that one would wait his whole life for one girl is phenomenal. When you decade your whole life to someone when they have moved on is a risky thing to do, but Noah took that risk. It states in the movie that he fixed up the house in hope that Ali would come back to him. Whim less hopes should not be dwelled on, but when they come true, like in the movie, it is all worth while.<br/><br/>The great actors made the movie enjoyable to watch. The facial expressions show the compassion that the actors have for the words spoken. The actress that played Ali, Rachel McAdams, and the actor that played Noah, Ryan Gosling, made it seem like they were madly in love. <br/><br/>When a movie inspires you to peruse the ones you love, then only love is worth fighting for. When this movie touches you will want to write your own notebook."

","At a modern-day nursing home, an elderly man named Duke (James Garner) begins to read a romantic story from his notebook to a fellow patient (Gena Rowlands).The story he tells begins in 1940. In Seabrook Island, South Carolina, local country boy Noah Calhoun (Ryan Gosling) is smitten with seventeen-year-old heiress Allie Hamilton (Rachel McAdams) after seeing her at a carnival, and they share an idyllic summer love affair. Noah takes Allie to an abandoned house, which he explains that he intends to buy for them. Later that evening, she asks him to make love to her, but they are interrupted by Noah's friend Fin (Kevin Connolly) with the news that Allie's parents have the police out looking for her. When Allie and Noah return to her parents' mansion, they ban her from seeing Noah, whom they called ""trash, trash, trash"". The two break up and the next morning, Allie's mother announces that the family is returning home to Charleston. Noah and Allie have no choice but to move on with their lives; Noah and Fin enlist to fight in World War II and Fin is killed in battle. Allie becomes a volunteer in a hospital for wounded soldiers, where she meets an officer named Lon Hammond, Jr. (James Marsden), a young lawyer who is handsome, sophisticated, charming and comes from old Southern money. The two eventually become engaged, to the delight of Allie's parents, but Allie sees Noah's face when Lon asks her to marry him. In the present, it is made clear that the elderly woman is in fact Allie, who is suffering from Alzheimer's disease and cannot remember any of the events of the film so far. Duke, the man who is reading to her, is her husband, but Allie cannot recognize him. Back in the forties, the day after Allie arrived in Seabrook, she and Noah renew their relationship. Allie's mother appears on Noah's doorstep, telling Allie that a jealous Lon has followed her to Seabrook. In the present, Duke asks Allie whom she chose. Becoming lucid, she remembers that the story Duke was reading is the story of how they met. Young Allie appears at Noah's doorstep, having left Lon at the hotel and chosen Noah. Elderly Allie suddenly remembers her past; after finding out about her illness, she herself wrote their story in the notebook with instructions for Noah to ""read this to me, and I'll come back to you"". But soon Allie relapses, losing her memories of Noah. She panics, not understanding who he is, and has to be sedated.<br/><br/>The best thing about this movie was the depth of the plot and the actors playing their characters so well. The soundtrack was very subtle but it was appropriate. There's lots of fade in and fade out like the memory suppresses or the moment is over. It was filmed entirely in Charleston South Carolina. the scenery gave it a romantic summer feel. Even after they broke up the high angles of the water and trees were very pretty. The only drawback was Allie slapping and pushing Noah around. I could've gone without that, that's a Gosling trait I've noticed. Everything was very convincing, the place and time they were in, every ones mannerisms. The narrative definitely made the entire movie.<br/><br/>At the heart of this film the couple represents the love story that is being told by James Garner's character. He reads from a book, the story of the two lovers as they go through everything life has to offer. Gena Rowlands plays the lady that he is reading to, and she gets as wrapped up in the story as we do, as he progresses from chapter to chapter in the novel he is reading. Garner was perfect for this role, and shows his narrating skills as he explains how the two of them live. Gosling always gives such a real acting job you know he must fall in love with all he female cast members. The supporting cast was good, and James Marsden deserves a mention for managing to pull of a hard role as the ""rich man"" well. Another plus point about this movie was the great script, and you did not see too many ""clichés"" which is always a good sign in a Romance movie. The story is so genuine and Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie prove their golden status in future acting (Gosling definitely more than McAdams) The story has a great feel to it because of the setting<br/><br/>The scene of the rain on the lake where Gosling says how he wrote 365 letters and nobody can resist the last scene where they die holding each other's hands. I never cried in this movie. But the most heartbreaking and touching part was when Rachel McAdam's when she relapses into dementia and has to be sedated. James Garner was so in love with her already and it was like in the earlier scenes when they were falling in love. When he lost her he sat there crying and it was really touching and showed his acting capabilities.<br/><br/>Watching this movie makes you feel many things. Sadness is one thing experienced by this great love story. However what made me sad after watching this movie is just how our life just passes by and eventually reaches an end. At the end of this movie the old couple have a lot of trouble with sickness and dementia , its just like they're waiting to die and the view of the lake at the end just gets u thinking that they were once young, in love having fun and looking for great things ahead in their lives. When they die its like all their love, all their life would just be forgotten and the sad part is this would eventually happen to all of us."
"blondeems-452-74374","10","0","1","19 August 2012"," Beautiful, romantic love story
","The Notebook is one of my all time favourite movies, for lots of reasons. I'm a sucker for anything romantic, and the beautiful love story of Noah and Allie is one I will remember always.<br/><br/>I first watched this movie with my elderly Grandma, who had been happily married to my Grandfather for fifty years. My Grandmother caught Polio when she was in her twenties, and for almost fifty years my Grandfather cared for her, loved her, worshipped her, until it was out of his hands and she passed away. But when we watched the movie together my Grandma turned to me, crying, and said softly ""I'm so glad they made a movie that shows old people can still be in love"". This is so true. Many people write off old people as slow, boring, and at deaths door. I hope this movie changed some opinions. My Grandma and I cried buckets, long after the credits rolled.<br/><br/>Noah is the type of man every woman dreams of, almost too good to be true. The love that he had for Allie was just beautiful, after watching this I set my standards pretty high and luckily found my Noah. The two leads had so much chemistry together it was outstanding (and they went on to date for years in real life after the movie).<br/><br/>The lake scene was by far my favourite scene. Like Allie said ""it's like a dream""."
"kingtype","8","0","1","24 July 2012"," Sentimental Journey
","Shamelessly sentimental, The Notebook is as predictable as a dimestore romance novel—it is based on the bestseller by Nicholas Sparks—but director Nick Cassavetes pulls it off.<br/><br/>The story of enduring love is told in evocative sequences set to Billie Holliday's and Chopin's music. The effect offers something for anyone who has ever been in love, yearned for love or, through the movie's tear-jerking narrative involving an old couple (James Garner and Gena Rowlands), watched loving parents grow wrinkled and gray.<br/><br/>After a carnival courtship that's so corny you expect the cast to break into a show tune, mill worker Noah (Ryan Gosling) and aristocratic Allie (Rachel McAdams) spend their pre-World War II summer days in Technicolor, skipping through small town streets, dancing with Negroes on the back porch and vowing undying devotion under the stars. Though modern sensibilities creep in, the design, the score and especially Karyn Wagner's costumes keep The Notebook in its 1940s Southern setting.<br/><br/>Cassavetes tenderly recreates romantic moments, letting still waters, creaky houses and booming thunderstorms set the tone, and The Notebook works best when indulging its sense of suspended time. The lovers are separated as implausibly as they were enjoined—through the clichéd rich parents—and the story follows their lives through war, work and maturity.<br/><br/>Sparks' lovers are intended as the warm-up for something more resonant than a youthful romance, and The Notebook's couple is too plain to be fully engaging, despite an outstanding performance by Gosling, who's as sincere as a wide-eyed prom date fixing his lady's corsage.<br/><br/>It's the older players, particularly Gena Rowlands, under direction by her son, Cassavetes, who breathe life into the Hallmarkish saga. Transitions between present-day narrative and the past are tenuous, but the hokey lovers envelop the audience in their gauzy world long enough to build momentum for The Notebook's climax—a formulaic manipulation that Miss Rowlands, Mr. Garner and a fond performance by Jennifer Echols as a nurse play to the hilt.<br/><br/>The script is more romantic than real and consequently less dramatic than it might have been. Friends, fathers and fallen soldiers are forgotten, dialog is stilted and characters are riddled with inconsistencies, especially young Noah and Allie, whose tribulations ring false. Several cast members stand out, including James Marsden (Cyclops in X-Men), wasted as Allie's rich suitor in a role that deserves more screen time, Joan Allen as Allie's mother, and Jamie Brown, who delivers a memorable scene as a war widow.<br/><br/>This sweet Southern romance, ripped from Jimmy Durante's schmaltzy ""I'll Be Seeing You"" and anchored by Ryan Gosling and Gena Rowlands, plays its love story straight and Nick Cassavetes, cast and crew and New Line Cinema have created a poignant if sappy movie about two people in love for a lifetime. In an age of death, doom and destruction—on and off screen—that's worth something to talk about"
"shamontielvaughn","10","0","1","22 July 2012"," Worth all of the hype
","Yes, it was worth all of the hype. I'd heard of this movie, but I'd never seen it. Even when my mother bought it and said it was because of all of the stuff she'd heard about it, I still didn't want to see it. I didn't know anybody in the film (although someone told me a guy who asked her out looked like Ryan Gosling. I looked him up and thought, ""Yeah, he's really cute""). It just wasn't on my radar. I even added it to Netflix and five minutes later removed it. So guess what got me to see the movie? The constant mentions of ""The Notebook"" in ""Keeping Up With the Kardashians."" Then I finally decided to see why in the world this movie was supposed to be so great and oh boy WAS IT EVER! It's a girl's girl kind of movie. Yes, it was borderline creepy for Gosling's character Noah to hang from a Ferris Wheel and be so disrespectful to her date, completely ignoring him while he asked Rachel McAdams' character Allie out. You've heard this plot before. Poor boy meets rich girl. Rich girl isn't interested in poor boy. Poor boy chases rich girl. They fall in love. The parents don't approve. The couple tries to stay together regardless of parents. Girl meets new rich boy. Girl falls in love with rich boy. But what happens when poor boy and rich girl unite by accident?<br/><br/>Nothing about this movie is unique, but the actors playing the roles are what sold it. I watched the movie three times in a row and paused during certain scenes just so I could squeal and watch them again. When it wasn't overly romantic, it was funny (the water yelling scene cracked me up, the house selling scenes were even better). The only drawback was Allie slapping and pushing Noah around. I could've gone without that, and he seemed to think it was perfectly normal. If it had been the other way around, women would be screaming about how abusive Noah is. That's the only part I don't like in girl's girl kind of movies. Sometimes there needs to be a brave guy to step in and say, ""Take that out of the script."" Other than that, loved it."

","The Notebook is one of the rare movies that have an impact on you and stay with you long after watching them. This is a romantic movie but is very different from the routine pop-corn flicks, in that it is not clichéd and predictable. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are so perfect in their roles that their romance is not just limited to the screen, the audience can feel the chemistry between them.<br/><br/>The relation between Allie and Noah is very beautifully showcased. Their romance, silly fights, their conversations, serious fights, etc all are depicted very naturally. The initial phase of their relation is beautiful and pure. They are mad for each other and are kissing for most of the time(and even got awards for it). Slowly as the conflict arises we cant help but feel for these poor couple. Every part of the story keeps us engaging and has a suspense element to it.<br/><br/>The only complaint I have is with the length. Had it been less lengthy it would have had more impact. Rachel McAdams has shown that she is a fantastic actor. I ve become a fan of her after watching this movie. James Marsden's part, though short has an important role to play in the story. The conflict that Allie faces intensifies as we move closer to the climax. The ending of the movie is very heart touching and very original. I wish I had a love story like that.<br/><br/>On the whole The Notebook is not just a movie but a very heart warming experience."

","The Notebook is a movie based on the best-selling novel by Nicholas Sparks. The movie is about Noah Calhoun (James Garner) visiting a female (Gena Rowlands) living at the assisted living home that he is also a resident of. He connects with her daily by reading an old, tattered notebook that tells the incredible journey of a young couple (played by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams) and their journey of love and loss. The story starts as a summer romance and takes you through them falling in love and then being torn apart by unapproving parents. From then on their lives took incredibly different paths. His life leads him into World War II and hers takes her through more of a privileged life of going to college and becoming a nurse for the injured soldiers of the war. They are separated for many years until fate appears to step in and bring the young man back to his hometown where he puts everything he has into restoring an old farm house. The young woman preparing for her future finds herself longing to go back to the town where she spent that incredible summer. They both then find themselves torn between their past and their futures unable to resist the temptation of a second chance. The movie is definitely one for the record books as one of the great love stories of our generation."

It was poignant and sometimes funny and should not be missed. Ryan Gosling was excellent at portraying Young Noah Calhoun.

"esteban1747","9","0","1","14 March 2012"," To be remembered for ever
","It is a plot full of freshness, very alive, real, passionate and sentimental. An unforgettable film, with good performances of its cast and a brilliant narrative. All the time the spectator is anxious to see what will happen, the development of a relation almost lost, of a love flying between two opponents. The sincerity and the real love are the winners at the end of this novel. The film shows once again the false values of some rich, but also how those opulent people can succumb to the real love of the poor ones. Ryan Gosling was superb in the role of young Noah, his way of looking well expressed his desires and his human feelings. Rachel McAdams played also at the same level, she was young Allie, naive, beautiful and with plenty of energy for love. Experienced Joan Allen gave a nice performance as Allie's mother, while Gena Rowland and James Garner were as usual very effective and complemented very well the whole story of this film. Nick Cassavetes directed a film to be remembered for ever, a film which gives guidance of how to make good materials full of fragrance and dreams without the need to include violence in its scenes."

","This movie seems to be postcard perfect, a lesson straight out of the director's guide to romantic movies. Boy meets girl at a carnival, love from the other side of the tracks, a date by the water, etc. And yet the wonderful thing about this movie is that it takes what seems like a story you've heard already (at least in bits and pieces) and still moves you deeply. It really speaks about love in a way that most romantic movies miss by speaking in cliché or over shoot by adding in numerous complications to dramatize things. There have been other great movies to comment on love in recent years (Eternal Sunshine, Lost In Translation jump to mind) but this movie fills a need that those other movies miss: the need for a straight, sweep you off your feet romance. Too bad there can't be movies like this every year..."

"gordonm888","8","0","1","18 December 2011"," Some flaws but best film ever at depicting ""love until death do us part""
","Let me confess: I am a guy, a husband of 23 years, reviewing a chick flick. And I've watched this film twice and read a large fraction of the viewer's comments, trying to think about and reconcile the two polar-opposite views of this film that viewers seem to have. So here is what I think.<br/><br/>1. The Notebook is the most touching and most accessible film ever made at depicting a romantic love that endures even through the gruesome trials of extreme old age -until ""death do us part."" If you don't get it, or don't think this is the way relationships are then I suspect it is because this is not the way relationships have been for you personally so far. But this type of love does truly exist -just as heroism truly exists. There are thousands of movies about heroism,even though many of us never experience ""action heroes"" in real life. There are very few movies about an ""unselfish love"" and how it persists beyond the courting and newlywed phases of life.<br/><br/>And,as a depiction of an enduring unselfish love, The Notebook is a very successful and powerful movie. In fact I cannot think of any popular film that is as good as the Notebook in this regard. It has moments of brilliant film-making -such as the beautiful turning-point scene on the river, and the way that Allie (Rachel McAdams) laughs after the lying-in-the-road scene when she admits ""that was fun!"", and the moment when James Garner says ""As long as my wife is here, this is my home."" <br/><br/>But lets not argue individual scenes because here is the bottom-line: As my wife and watched the last 20 minutes, I had to hold my wife in both arms as she cried loudly and her body shook. Eventually, at the ending scene, I started crying myself. I'm sorry, no matter how clunky one or two scenes may be, any movie that can elicit that strong of a reaction from some of its audience is a very well done movie. <br/><br/>2. Yep, I agree with the criticism of some of the scenes and acting: I thought the scenes with the Ferris Wheel and Noah and Ally lying on the road showed Noah as having an unattractive recklessness. Also, I wish Ryan Gosling had shown a bit more range, more of the softer, sensitive side of a man in scenes in which Noah and Allie were together. Gosling's acting depicts young love only as an overwhelming urgency to be together, but otherwise depicts little tenderness and is weak on ""chemistry."" <br/><br/>Many viewers said that they did not like the constant arguing between Allie and Noah, and I agree that some of the arguing seemed a bit...theatrical. But here's another truth: people in love do argue. Showing the arguments goes against the grain of most romantic films but I think it helps to make the Noah-Allie relationship more realistic - because it is not a phony ""immaculate relationship."" <br/><br/>And, there are many spot-on scenes that compensate -such as when Allie's mom takes her daughter to view the man she almost married earlier in life. The scenes with James Garner are almost all superb. The several scenes with the ""widow from the next town"" also rang true. And, the various looks on Rachel McAdams' face as she breaks the news to Lon near the end of the film were realistic and convincing. <br/><br/>So, altogether, this is not a flawless film - not a Godfather or Schindler's List - but it is enormously successful at doing what it intended to do and enormously satisfying. And if you, as a viewer, ""just don't get it"" may I suggest that you wait 30 years or until you have a bit more living under your belt - and then, please, view it again. If you do that, I suspect that you will cry -and that if you listen closely, you will hear the crying of the million and one viewers that came before you. I know, I hear a million now."
"ujoelyn","10","0","1","28 November 2011"," Amazing Movie!
","Based on the novel by Nicholas Sparks, Nick Cassavates' 2004 The Notebook is the classic story of two teenagers of different classes who fall in love one summer. Allie is the typical southern city-girl, while Noah is a hard-working country boy. As the summer comes to an end, as does their romance. Allie has to go to school in New York, while Noah has to stay home and work. They try to keep their romance alive by writing letters, but are stopped by the mother, who hides all of Noah's letters to Allie. But at last, they find a way back to each other and eventually die old together. <br/><br/>The story may be seen as a cliché to some, but it did succeed very well in delivering its message, true loves conquers all. This statement has much truth to it, and has been told in numerous films in so many ways. But it also depends on your personal beliefs and views; I personally believe that it is true. This film showcases that love has no bounds. After so many years two lovers who haven't seen each other in years, since they were teenagers, still felt the same way and were able overcome everything and all the changes that both of them have made over the years.<br/><br/>Both Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling fit their roles beautifully. Rachel, who plays young Allie, has a young face and does a southern accent very well. Ryan, who plays young Noah, is a smooth character and is able to transition well into an older character. Both are very good actors and portray their roles well. James Garner, who plays the older Noah, also is a very moving character; his love a devotion to his wife is very admirable. James brings a lot of emotion to this film, and his scenes help to further communicate the message. This film is also successful in conveying the time settings. The movie was filmed in South Carolina, where the movie actually takes place, this helped give the film a more authentic 1940s feel.<br/><br/>Nick Cassavates attempts to influence our idea and beliefs on the idea of true love. He is not trying to necessarily change our actions, but more so beliefs. The story's message is universal and can relate to anyone of anytime. There are countless stories and films about summer romances, but none quite like this, the story goes far beyond that. The message of the movie is very relevant to everyone of any time or generation. Everyone can relate to some point of the movie; the lovers who are separated but find a way back to each other, the lovers who overcome all, and of course, the summer romances. <br/><br/>Overall, this movie succeeded very well in communicating the message and a very good story. But of course we must give some credit to Nicholas Sparks, who's 1996 novel inspired this film. Nick Cassavates delivered a moving story and an amazing movie. I give this movie a 10/10."

","My 10 vote it looks like a bug comparing to what this colossal movie is. It is so good, so epic that even if you're in one of the saddest moments in your real life it will make you smile. We have a romanian song called ""Even boys sometimes cry"" and this is one of the movies that doesn't take care of gender, manhood and everything that makes us men different from women. It will make any guy cry foreshure or at least will make your fellings and perspective of life change. Another good thing of this movie, besides the beautiful love story, is that it places the scene in times were social differences create huge abysses between human race. It did not matter if you're smart, good looking, creative or hard worker, if you came from a poor family, with little education, you had little change of living a love story with the person you'd consider, at least for that moment, THE ONE. For me this is the best love movie and my words express very little. Truly epic."

"StevePulaski","8","0","2","23 October 2011"," The cinematic romance that tests reality and fantasy
","Maybe I'm just too cynical for the subject matter, but I didn't shed a tear during The Notebook. I watched what is said to be ""one of the saddest films ever made"" dry-eyed. And I'm an emotional person. I've cried probably to more films than you, the person reading this right now. I don't think it's necessarily a bad thing to get very emotional during a film. I think that shows a sign of good filmmaking.<br/><br/>I personally have a strict rule where if I cry during a film I must give it some sort of a positive review. That means the film actually made me feel for its fictitious characters and their story and struggle. Therefore it is a film not to be missed. Whether I cry tears of joy, happiness, sadness, calamity, or frustration, the film will get some sort of positive review.<br/><br/>And now I'm faced with The Notebook, apparently one of the saddest films in existence and I didn't get emotional once. Something must be wrong. The film stars young actors Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams as two, and I use this term effectively, star-crossed lovers who meet in South Carolina during the summer.<br/><br/>Gosling is Noah, while McAdams is Allie. This is the forties so when a guy likes a girl he really likes a girl. Noah and Allie meet at a carnival, and soon enough, thinks sparkle and they become in young love. Noah is a local boy, while Allie derives from a rich family who is said to have ""more money than God."" They fight a lot, and sometimes can be extremely physically and emotional abusive. But what love is perfect? The story is told by an elderly man talking to an elderly woman in a nursing home. This is where the film's first major problem comes in - you can see the ""twist"" coming a mile away. I won't spoil it, but it seriously goes without saying. The elderly man is played by James Garner, who comes with a strange presence, and Gena Rowlands as the elderly woman.<br/><br/>The man continues to tell the story of the lovers, who eventually part ways and then reunite years later. The first half of the film is well-written, extremely well acted, and comes with enriching photography. Then the film just becomes a little cliché and somewhat unbelievable as it wraps up.<br/><br/>It doesn't state this blatantly, but The Notebook is a strong romantic-fantasy. Perhaps one of a teenage girl's imagination. Things happen in the film that stretch the line of reality very, very far. The chemistry is believable, but the story is only about half. I don't believe a girl I know would stick by a man so emotionally abusive to a woman. Not to mention in the world we live in today.<br/><br/>This cinematic romance is cute, but nonetheless predictable. I mentioned Allie comes from a rich family, and boy does she occupy every characteristic of it. From the controlling mother, to the ""everything she wants but a man"" personality, she truly is the carbon copy of a rich female. Noah, on the other hand, is your typical local boy with his mind on working and girls.<br/><br/>The Notebook is cute, yet I think more shallow then people see. I believe the idea of it, to a female, overshadows how far-fetched it truly is. It's every woman's dream - to find a man who is so willing to be with this woman he devotes half his life to doing things for and about her. The problem is something that is hard to explain. As a cinematic romance fantasy it works. As a realistic love story it doesn't.<br/><br/>Romances have come a long way. It's strange, but as a male I really do appreciate them. I think I like the ""invisible guy gets the dream girl"" type films more than the true cinematic romances. But that doesn't mean I can't appreciate these types of films. The Notebook is truly a good film, but many women should be aware this is about as far-fetched as a love story can be from the twist to the very end.<br/><br/>Starring: Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Sam Shepard, James Marsden, and Joan Allen. Directed by: Nick Cassavetes."
"retroguy02","8","0","1","19 August 2011"," An unabashedly romantic and unadulterated love story that gets it right
","Classic love stories that lack grit or are ""grounded in reality"" are rather rare to come by in mainstream Hollywood in the 21st century. The Notebook is a throwback to the days when ""serious"" love stories were passionate, optimistic affairs devoid of any realist pretences, and this sincerity is by far the movie's biggest draw.<br/><br/>The plot is narrated in flashback by an elderly man at a senior home to an amnesiac lady friend (who happens to be his childhood sweetheart), and the story isn't terribly original – wealthy teenage girl falls in love with a modest but charming local boy during a summer vacation in rural South Carolina, her parents force her to move away, the boy and the girl carry on with their lives until they cross paths years later as adults and rekindle an old flame. The straightforward plot works because this is a movie that knows exactly what it is – a classy sweep-you-off- your-feet romance about two people, and a very solid one at that.<br/><br/>The lead actors are attractive and look the part, while the cast in general fills out its shoes adequately – there isn't any standout that leaves a long-lasting impression, but the same could be said for the characters they're given to work with. The much-needed chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams is there (heck, they hit off a real-life romance once they met on the set, I can only imagine what it must have been like) and their passionate make-out scenes probably justify watching this movie for most folks.<br/><br/>The movie sometimes does feel a bit out of touch with the era it's supposed to be set in if you think about it – after all, I'd expect more than a few disapproving looks if someone publicly made out with his girlfriend before marriage in front of his family and friends back in the 1940s – but it's only a minor gripe. This is also a very beautifully shot film, evoking all the right nostalgia of the classic Hollywood era – making out in the rain, canoeing in a scenic river with swans all around, drives around the lush countryside and, of course, losing virginity in a dilapidated farmhouse (that last example might be a bit tongue-in-cheek). The rich, striking cinematography of the outdoors is also thoroughly soothing and contributes wonderfully to the lovestruck, tipsy mood of the film.<br/><br/>The Notebook is an honest-to-goodness romantic drama that won't disappoint if you're in the mood for watching an all-out love story. And do watch all the way through – the last scene is quite a tearjerker."

He tries all he can to be with her. While he is fixing up her dream house, her mother keeps the letters that he wrote her secret. She believes that it was just a summer romance and that he has forgotten about her. She moves on and finds a man that her parents will approve of.

She has to decide on who she will be with, the man she has always loved or the man who can provide for her.<br/><br/>In the movie we can feel the love between the two actors. The movie watcher can put themselves in the place of the actors. We see the conflict in the decision that the female actress has to make. Most women and men can relate to the story line because at some point in time we all deal with it. We can see the struggle that everyone feels in the story line.<br/><br/>The way that director Nick Cassavetes portrays the way that the actors dress shows us what class they are in without the need to say. The rich white girl wears bold colors and fancier cloths. The poor white boy wears dull colors and cheaper cloths like overalls and torn cloths. The music choice makes use feel the love in the scene. The way that the Cassavetes ends the movie with a twist is makes use think about the whole movie over and makes use want to see it again. The flashbacks between the story of the people in love and the two in the nursing home, makes use see the point of view of both the old and the young."

The film starts off quite weird as there is two older characters and one is telling the other a story, we later learn who they are. Allie and Noah are two people, who come from very different backgrounds, when they first meet at the carnival, Noah sees something in Allie, Allie on the other hand doesn't want to be involved with a labouring man. After a while, they get to no each other and fall in love. But when Allie's parents become unpleased with the situation,they move away. Noah and Allie still love each other, but they were never meant to be. Noah writes Allie a letter, hoping she will write back, Allie never receives the letter, as her mother hides them from here, we later learn why this is. Noah doesn't give up, and sends Allie a letter everyday for a year. Allie, then meets a wealthy gentleman and soon she falls in love, and they plan to marry. Then one day, Allie sees a picture of Noah in the local paper, standing outside a house,of which he had built. Allie then visits Noah and things are unveiled. This brilliant film will change your view on love, and shows that you always find a way back to your true love in the end. I would totally recommend this film to anyone."

","A love story for the ages; a weepy romantic drama; a timeless love story. All the exhausted clichés apply, but ""The Notebook"" manages to turn them into something substantial—emotionally at least, if not intellectually. Everything in this movie is beautiful and it's easy to get wrapped up into the story.<br/><br/>Noah (Ryan Gosling) loves Allie (Rachel McAdams). That's basically the entire story, but conflicts arise when Allie's parents insist he's not good enough for her, and Noah has to spend the rest of his life winning her back. I love both Noah and Allie. Allie, because she's the type of girl that every girl can realistically see themselves as; she's emotional, but smart and passionate, and adorable in every way. And Noah, because he has this boyish charm that he never loses. Gosling has this incredible ability to play men at any and every point in their lives.<br/><br/>Because the characters are just so captivating, the story is able to invoke emotion. You'll fall in love when they do, you'll be heart-broken when they are, and you'll cry when they do. ""The Notebook"" is beautifully shot, beautifully told, and most importantly, beautifully acted. And it's for those reasons that it is able to rise above the rather tired and painfully predictable plot. You won't even notice that because you'll be crying and falling in love."

","I have watched The Notebook at least four to five times for only one dull reason : To return the faith of love within my emotionless heart. Yes, even tho people are denying existence of cold-heart, it does exist, indeed. However, this movie, at least for a one moment, returns the faith of the kindness to me, and I am thankful. <br/><br/>The Notebook sets story of two young in love, fighting against those who do not believe in the bond between the poor and the rich; 'He's a good boy, but he's not for you.'<br/><br/>Based on the book by Nicholas, they actually adopted movie at their best. Movie does what no other romantic movie of now-days does : It returns faith to our hearts; faith of the kindness that truly exist in each and every human being, even tho that kindness is lost deep because of the coldness and cruelness of the world. It could be said that this movie has a elements of fantasy, classic fairytale; yet it's not. It is possible for the love to win everything if it's real - it is truly the greatest weapon among all.<br/><br/>I've said a lot, but nothing about the movie itself. Well, movie is, if not the best, in top 3 romantic movies ever made. Plot, acting, dialog, chemistry ... It stars with beautiful view upon the sunset and the lake; it truly starts magnificently. 'Do you want to dance with me ?' - so honest and respectful, so innocent and naive, yet so honorable. I could've never think of myself that kind a approach to the girl I'd sometimes like. <br/><br/>Movie really brings an truthful picture of love, kindness, struggles, rewards, hate, naivety and honesty, and the rating does not do the justice to this movie.

Nice dresses, shoes, girls, boys, everything is so natural, genuinely etc. When you watch movie you just want to live next to Noah or be Allie's best friend. Everything is perfect actually.

When I was watching The Notebook I didn't think about that. But when I was done with watching I really figured out that perfection was too big. Noah really built that house.

The Notebook begins with an older man reading a diary/notebook to a woman affected with Alzheimer's that he regularly visits at a retirement home. He reads this story hoping that the women will remember and realize that they are the characters from the love story. In the movie when the older man reads the notebook, his words bring to life his story about how he met a girl at a carnival and they feel in love, but the young lady's parents disapproved of him because of his financial state and tried to separate them. In the end, World War II evidently separated the two lovers, and after seven years haven taken different paths they then were passionately reunited. They feel in love once again and got married and had children. At the end of the notebook the old women remembers who he is, as she does every time he finishes reading the story to her. At the end of the movie the old man was so happy she remembered her and the end up dying together in their sleep. I would strongly recommend adding this movie to your romance collection."

","Sometimes I like to watch a romantic film by myself which is one of my guilty pleasure and ""The Notebook"" is basically the epitome of a romance movie. I first saw it I thought it was okay but isn't anything that special, after a second viewing I can tell this is a heartfelt movie. Which maybe sort of brings homage to the movies back in the old days where young teens or couples go to watch a romantic movie. On the downside this film is formulaic and goes in a pretty narrow direction. Sometimes it feels like it's moving along too slowly and the development of the relationships seem a tad bit too quick, with some more development in some areas would have made the plot movie more in a fluid manner. The dialogue is a bit too cheesy at times and the story when it comes to the love aspect of it, isn't all that original...Even when this movie first came out. It's just the character direction could have been more explored, it seemed like the some scenes got cut out because of the length of the film. Even if Noah is a bit of a awkward name Ryan Gosling played this role really well and Rachel McAdams did a good enough job of acting like a girl during the time period the movie takes place. Although it's a mix of her true personality into it as well, although some part of the movie where she was playing a 17 yr old I found ridiculous. And there were few scenes that somewhat tugged on my heartstrings while watching it, although it was probably because of the music and the atmosphere of the scenes. The poor guy falling for a rich girl has been done before numerous times, this film has it's own charm to some degree. And like I said it isn't a clever romance movie and generic at times but it's a touching and heartfelt love story. If your somewhat like to watch romantic movies or movie for couple's, this movie is worth seeing. I also say the scene with one of Noah's quote ""Would you stop thinking about what everyone wants? Stop thinking about what I want, what he wants, what your parents want. What do YOU want? What do you WANT?"" and other dialogues during that scene left a big impact. It was simply some very good dialogue in a romance film. Which is why I am giving this movie a higher score than I thought I would over a hour and thirty minutes into it. It's a simple love story but well done.<br/><br/>7.8/10"

","Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are great in this romantic film about a love that lasts a lifetime, crossing a huge divide between two families. From the very start, Ryan Gosling, who plays the role of Noah, falls head over heels for the girl who becomes the love of his life, Allie, played by Rachel McAdams. The two go their separate ways when their summer love affair comes to an end, with the intervention of her parents, who are unable to accept the fact that their daughter has fallen for someone who only earns 40 cents an hour in a lumber job, at the dawn of World War II. The broken-down house that Noah dreams of building into a home becomes a driving force and with some help from his father, Sam Shepherd, and a lot of work, the dream becomes a reality. The ever-competent Joan Allen, Allie's mother, hides the letters that Noah writes while he is overseas during the war, effectively snuffing out the romance, but only for a while. They reconnect seven years later and find themselves drawn again to each other. Despite her engagement to a man she cares deeply for, Allie finds herself in a bind and is forced to decide between the two. Her mother confesses to a similar relationship that she was involved in and abandoned her first love for a secure future but she does return the hidden letters. In a parallel story, an older couple played by two veteran actors - James Garner and Gena Rowlands, whose talents shines in this film, show the tenacity of their love as they reach old age. As an aside, the director of the movie is Nick Cassevetes, son of Gena Rowlands and John Cassevetes. He has made a very beautiful and sentimental movie that shows the power of true love. As with many love affairs, adversity makes the bond of love even stronger. A great love story is always a powerful symbol of good in our universe."

The other is of an elderly man named Duke (James Garner) who is reading this story to a present day Allie (Gena Rowlands, mother of director Nick Cassevetes). But how are these two stories connected.<br/><br/>The answer is of course fairly obvious, and the movie wisely doesn't try to hide that fact. The film's real focus is the romance between Noah and Allie, and everything that comes between them.<br/><br/>The film works because of the strong performances and the equally strong direction. To say that Ryan Gosling is an unconventional leading man in this kind of a film is an understatement. Gosling burst onto the film scene in a riveting performance as a Jewish neo-nazi in ""The Believer,"" and went on to play two other creeps and killers before landing this role. Gosling stays true to form and does not approach the role in a conventional way. He's not a model and doesn't pretend to be, but his subtle free spirit energy works, and makes him quite literally impossible not to like. Rachel McAdams is equal to him. She's a rich girl that spurns off his random advances, but Noah doesn't stop, and when she finally humors him, she realizes that, gosh darn it, she actually likes the guy.<br/><br/>Gosling and McAdams are supported by a strong cast of noted character actors. James Garner couldn't possibly be more endearing, willing to give up everything to be with Allie, who is slipping further and further into dementia. Likewise, Gena Rowlands is terrific as the elderly Allie, who is revisiting this story for the first time. Joan Allen is wonderfully wicked as Allie's conservative mother, who is trying to keep Allie from seeing Noah. It's a clichéd role, but Allen imbues it with so much life that the character becomes just as three-dimensional as everyone else. James Marsden is surprisingly good as Allie's new lover, rich boy Lon Hammond. Unlike many romantic complications, he's actually likable (in fact, one could make the argument that he's more likable than Noah at times). Marsden's range is quite limited, but this is his best performance. Sam Shepard is also on hand in a small role as Noah's father, but it's a good performance nonetheless.<br/><br/>Nick Cassevetes has done the impossible: he's made a weeper that will appeal to those who don't prefer to watch movies with a tissue at hand. He does this by taking the melodrama as far as it can go without going overboard, and by establishing a nostalgic tone for the film. Watching the movie is like watching old home movies and revisiting fond memories of the past. The film is photographed by Robert Fraisse, who gives each beautiful shot its dreamy tone.<br/><br/>Sometimes guys must be dragged by their girlfriends to see romance movies. Although they may put up a fight to see this one, they will probably like it as much as I did (whether they will admit it is open to question)."

You can feel the passion from start to finish, it shines through like a new coin. At the beginning it brings a warm-hearted smile and at the end brings, a warm-hearted tear.<br/><br/>It's a summer romance thats surely one of the greatest movie romances of our time.

"SilensMortea","10","0","1","11 July 2010"," Unlike anything else
","I've heard so much about this film, and had always planned on seeing it. I was bored one day and decided to put it in.<br/><br/>This movie is the one and only movie to ever make me full-out cry. I cannot and will not watch this film with anyone else as I just can't control myself. I know it's coming; I know what and where, but it tugs at my heartstrings so badly there is no way I can resist. Sure, other movies have made me tear up (the other version of The Little Mermaid, where she dies at the end, the end of AI, parts of Legends of the Fall...)but with this one, I found myself fully weeping as if it were happening to me.<br/><br/>I'm a sucker for love stories, and people who love each other. I myself have had nothing but bad luck with my love life, and have searched long and hard for ""the one"". Not able to find it, 3 marriages later, I like to watch love movies and wish I could find someone with that kind of love and dedication for me. It becomes a very personal matter, so it hits me pretty hard when cheating or reunions or whatever come up.<br/><br/>I found the story of their meeting and separating very realistic and heartbreaking. Everything that happened to them seemed extreme to me, and I wanted to take the characters and just help them out. Get together! Love each other! Don't go away! You know what I mean...<br/><br/>The ""twist"", if it was truly meant to be one, wasn't a twist at all to me, but that doesn't change the emotional impact that comes with it. It's such a depressing and sad story, it stayed in my head so long I always want to watch it- but then again I want it to be fresh, because if you lose the feeling you lose the entire essence of the movie itself. So I stay away, and just remember it.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of truly deep love stories, love stories to put all other love stories to shame, then definitely pick this one up. Not a good idea to watch in front of others if you're a crier, or ashamed of it."

This movie will make you impressed. It describes pure love story. And every teens sympathize with this movie, may be. And I like this movie's characters too. A girl is so cute and A boy is so cool.

","I can proudly admit that American Beauty makes me cry almost every time I watch it. At the plastic bag. Yep. It's a new definition of – something. Je ne c'est crois. But everyone cries at triumphant/tragic love stories. Everyone cries when they see The Notebook. I don't wanna admit that! But it's true. It got me. The damn melodrama got me. It is really, really good.<br/><br/>Maybe it's because I watched Married Life so many times I fell in love with Rachel McAdams (young Allie). Maybe it's all the amazing costumes from anywhere between 1920 to 1965 that never cease to make me drool. Maybe I was in a moment of weakness and in the overwrought string orchestra got under my eyes. <br/><br/>It's not though. What sets this movie apart, and ultimately puts it at the top of its class, is the all encompassing melodrama of the plot. Seriously, what I said about Bill and Ted being the pinnacle of stoner comedy? This is the be all end all of romantic melodrama. James Cameron, eat your heart out, Titanic only comes kinda close. I'm yet to read the novel Nicholas Sparks wrote that this movie is based on, so I don't know if the book is this tight, but the plot has all the stops pulled. He does not stop with their meeting(See Serendipity). Or their marriage (Sense and Sensibility), or even their first kid (The Young Victoria). It stops at the end. Sparks does not shy from his heroes, Noah and Allie, having rough patches and fights and other relationships. He doesn't preserve one in pristine good looks (see Titanic and Love in the Time of Cholera). Sparks and Carravetes declare that bad stuff happens and that a love preached about in romantic comedies can not only prevail, but champions over things and even knows the perfect time to quit. I live in contempt of movies that preach ""great love"" and then never show it to me. As much as I will watch Pride and Prejudice over and over, I feel cheated. No such loss of pain and loss of gain here.<br/><br/>So, plot. Each set piece eats the heels of the one before in sparky timing (sorry, I had to. I dedicate this review to my friend Faith, and she would appreciate a good pun). If ever there seems peace between the characters we can always flash forward in time to see the couple old and her gone with dementia. The heart strings get a-tugged lickety split. What's even better is we aren't told this right away, in fact we don't know factually she is Allie until she ""meets"" her children, and don't hear Noah's name until the third or fourth false ending, but if you haven't got that figured out within 15 minutes you have never interacted with Story. Normally I'd call the director out on this sort of easy tension, but here, there are so many tiny scenes building the characters that even I, the eternal cynic, thought Allie might choose The Guy Who Plays Cyclops. The Guy Who Plays Cyclops is a totally likable guy. She even loves him. Narrator tells us so. <br/><br/>(I could go off on a tangent here about meta narratives – turns out our narrator is Allie herself writing the title notebook so Noah can read it to her over and over until she remembers, and Noah is the one telling the story and so we don't know if she really did or if she is just writing that to make everyone feel better about her difficulty in choice between the two handsome men, but! This is a plot movie, it does not call for analysis. And I'm afraid analyzing it would ruin this warm feeling it gave me...)<br/><br/>I could yell about the intrusive music, or the sap upon sap, but I can't. It's not just the writing. The acting is great. I mean, they aren't finding new ways to express pain or joy, not really, but McAdams and Ryan Gosling (Young Noah) manage the gamut of emotions demanded by a life (short of the tragic loss of a child or something. Noah comes close with his best friend getting shot in the war, but it's not that sort of drama). Now, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, they find new ways to express those emotions. And damn are they good. <br/><br/>Also good about these characters is their roundness. Noah is not John Cusack or Tom Hanks or any Strong Romantic Lead. He's a lumberjack who reads Walt Whitman – more like Will Hunting, but without succumbing to cliché. Allie is a little closer to ruin. She's a manic pixie dream girl to be sure, but somehow stays fresh as a real person. She grows up, chooses things grown ups choose. She's not a stunted Natalie Portman in Garden State or Kirsten Dunst in Elizabethtown. <br/><br/>Sparks gives each a dream, a fear, and each a parent or two for developmental purposes. Most surprising is the lack of Noah's mom. Normally a writer would jump on that, exploit it, it's not even mentioned. I am now going to read this book and if it's in the book I'm going to be disappointed, but here, its spare and touching in a way that mentioning would have just gummed into soap opera. This, and many other details are all that harnesses The Notebook from being just another tearjerker with new actors. It is a fully functional romance unafraid of where the love it preaches may wander – in sickness and in health. Finally."

","No words can describe how good this movie is. No words and no love can describe or be compared with the love Noah and Allie had. This is the best movie I have ever seen, not only the most romantic movie but the best movie overall! The love story is so good and you get the feeling right from the start. There are many love stories and movies about love but in my opinion I think this is the original love story movie and absolutely the best one. I LOVE Titanic but I must say that this movie top that one. There is even a verb ""Notebooked"" when a girl makes a boy emotional and sad after watching this movie. That must say something?! Well well, this is a movie for everyone. Everyone must see this movie before they die and before they're looking for 'the one'. Or maybe not because you will keep looking and looking because finding someone like Noah is like one in a million. I also recommend the book, it's just as good as the movie! Love conquers all!"

I love the passion and the sad emotions transmit by those young people in love with each other. The settings such as the beach and the abandoned house express the feeling of liberty in love. Noah and Ellie are two great actors who give the audience the desire to follow each steps of their love story.<br/><br/>The end of the movie is for me the best part. They find each other and decide to stay together for the best and the worst. Then, there are two old people in a medical house reading a notebook every day.

I some how missed this movie in the theaters, but was fortunate to find it while browsing the video's at my local Blockbuster. It was Rachael McAdams' beauty that caught my eye, and made me want to watch this movie, but as soon as I started to watch this film, I was reminded of one of my past loves that I met, and had lost and only wished that It was I in this film as Noah kissing the very beautiful Rachael McCadams. <br/><br/>Rachael plays a young teenager named Allie, who spends the summer with her family in a small town, and meets a young local boy who she eventually falls in love with, but is forbidden to see by her mother who wants her to marry a man who is wealthy and has a high social standing in society. Ryan Gosling who plays Noah, writes to her every day while Allie goes off to college, but Allie never writes back to Noah, and she believes that he has never written her, and he must have been using her.<br/><br/>Finally they both move on with their lives until Noah decides to sell his home that he had promised Allie that he would some day buy, and restore. <br/><br/>Allie by chance reads about Noah's home for sale in the newspaper, and realizes that she still has feelings for him, and although she is engaged to be married to a dashing and handsome soldier who comes from a wealthy family, has doubts and wonders why Noah never wrote her or ever tried to find her. <br/><br/>This story also has an interesting twist when the older Noah who is played by James Gardner is reading a story to a an older woman who has Alzheimers that is in a nursing home.<br/><br/>Each actor in this film gives a great performance, but the passion between Noah and Allie makes you feel just how much your first love will always be special to you no matter how much time has passed since you both have been with each other, or any other relationship that you each may have had in life's many twists and ironies.<br/><br/>The Notebook is a modern day classic love story that you can watch with your children over and over again.<br/><br/>Jose F.

","I enjoyed this film but certainly it was not magnificent. The film was for the most part a basic love story. Wonderful acting performances, wonderful vintage feel to the film with costume,settings and general atmosphere. The setting for a good film was ripe. I felt the film did become too predictable and overly sugary. This was cliché to say the least. The movie got me gripped from the get go, which I suppose is a good thing. The film just seemed too flat at certain junctures.Yes , there were some tearful moments, but there were also moments of yawning. I do believe Noah and Allie truly did have that once in a lifetime connection that culminated in a fine story. I also believe that the writers were too safe with this script. Tastefulness is always fine, but sometimes a film can be too tasteful , and this was the case with this film. Other than some cute wooing antics, that boys will be boys will succumb , there was not much in the way of risk. This film was too vanilla. In summation, It was a good film, but never reached that higher plateau, which is quite sad. Worth a watch anyway."

","This movie was beautiful, romantic, and moving. While there were a few bits in the movie that was nonfactual or unrealistic, I fully enjoyed this movie. If you're not into ""romantic, mushy, or emotional films"" this is not the movie for you! As I read some of the 1 star reviews, I find myself almost laughing. A 12 year old girl rants and raves about hating chick flicks and yet she watched it anyway. It's annoying when people write reviews for things that they are utterly disinterested in. Anyway, back to the movie! One thing that I found that was nonfactual was the condition of Ally's disease (Alzheimer's). She seemed to have moderate Alzhiemers, yet throughout the movie she switches from the mild stages of Alzheimers to the severe stages. And while it was absolutely wonderful when she remembered that she was Ally and that the man was her husband Noah, a woman in her stage of Alzheimer's would never have been able to remember that fact. However, this movie was still well done. After hearing that Rachel McAdams was playing Ally Calhoun, I was thinking, ""Regina George? The super mean clique leader from Mean Girls?"" and then ""That skinny nerd from Remember the Titans?"" But these two actors had great chemistry together and portrayed their characters beautifully.

This is a love story that allows you to feel the power of Love and the everlasting passion that love can ignited between two people. The Notebook is about a couple that come from two different backgrounds, Allie is a child that was born to a wealthy family and Noah comes from an underprivileged family. They meet one summer night at a carnival, and Noah knows from that point that Allie is his one true love. They two spend the summer together and build a strong bond in their relationship. Unfortunately Allie's parents were not accepting of the relationship due to Noah's lack of wealth that, they moved Allie away to keep her from him. Allie waits for Noah to write but never receives word no thanks to her family. Allie later meets a wealthy soldier and gets engaged. Shortly after her engagement, Allie sees a picture of Noah in the local newspaper where he is standing in front of his newly remodeled 200 year old home. She is reminded of the love they shared that summer and feels obligated to check up on him and give him the news of her plans for marriage. The two are drawn to each other and their feelings toward each other are once again ignited that they stand for their love and are brought together again. Throughout the movie they have so many barriers against them but in the end their love prevailed. The Notebook has a lot of sentimental scenes and moments that will definitely move you deeply and bring you to tears. It speaks about love and the power love gives us when we allow ourselves to feel compassion and devotion for one another. The movie is definitely powerful and inspiring and is a good example for marriages today.

"heatherntv","Null","0","1","14 November 2009"," Best movie ever!
","I went into this movie with the misconception that this was just another typical romantic movie, but I was very impressed by this story which I've ever imagined. The Notebook establishes Nicholas Sparks as a classic storyteller with a unique insight into the only emotion that really matters. It tells the story of Noah Calhoun and Allie Nelson; they met in 1935 and were separated by Allie's parents.<br/><br/>Like a puzzle within a puzzle, the story of Noah and Allie is the beginning. Noah, a poor working class guy who falls in love with Allie, a beautiful rich girl who is staying in town with her family on their summer's vacation. The relationship is not well received by Allie's parents which leads Noah to make a decision that he feels is in both of their best interests. The result of a hastily made decision leads our main character down a road that first shuts out true passion as he tries to forget his past hurt. But, a stint in the military, where he experiences loss as well as his loss at home following his service in the military, leads him right back to his heart. The story is deep and bittersweet, but ultimately rewarding. It doesn't get any better than this. <br/><br/>I loved the novel the Notebook, and the tender moments and the fundamental changes that affect us all. Overtime through I have accepted the flaws of the movie and have grown to truly love it as well. I totally love the on screen chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel Mcadams they really fit their parts of star-crossed soul mates amazingly well. It left me speechless at the end of the movie."

The scene at the plantation where the couple shyly remove their clothes is in fabulous contrast to the later scene in the film where they eventually make love for the first time with intense passion.

The story in itself is nothing new, nor original (though I wonder whether there is still something new to be said in the field of love). What stands out is the way, in terms of simplicity and naturalness, which which the romantic story gets to the viewer. No melodrama, no pathetic script, sentimentalist excess is carefully avoided: this is just a simple, moving love-story, plainly narrated through the pages of a diary. It is so easy for the viewer to get involved, both with the juvenile passion, and then with the mature affection, between Noah and Allie, whose story simply testifies that attraction cannot be the only engine of love, and that without mutual, constant and loyal dedication and respect even the most powerful chemistry is doomed to fall miserably. The young actors playing the boy and girl are magnetically well paired, we can feel, sense the passion exploding from their bodies and souls, in the same way as James Garner and Gena Rowlands can communicate high sentiment in a superb way. Also Sam Shepard, as Noah's father, hits the sign, and proves how talented actors, used to more demanding roles, can offer highly professional performances also in lower-level movies and contribute to make a difference. So congratulations to movies like Notebook, which, although not being masterpieces, obviously (but they do not aim at being so considered) have that magic capability to let you go to bed with a soothing and delightful sense of trust, hope, or simply with the momentary illusion (but how much do we need it, sometimes!) that there are still sincere, honest and loyal men outside. And judging from the number of users' comments, both positive and negative, I infer that people are still attracted by romantic movies: in the end, all we need is love?!"

","Well as a person who for some reasons has movies as the only form of entertainment, i would like to say that this movies was one of the best love movies i have ever seen, and this is not because as per many critics its a so called TearJerker, which i do not agree as the affection and love displayed in this drama was true, Ryan and Rachel had such a chemistry between them that it was hard to separate the movie from reality, Director did an excellent job from scenes to locations to costumes to dialog everything was perfect however the older part with Noah old and Allie old i guess could have been better, though both did a good job however true love is like sunshine in darkness which the older part could not display properly. However i know one thing that movies like these do not come so often and i really enjoyed it so many years after Titanic. Anyways Heads Up to the Cast and Crew and special regards to Ryan and Rachel, you displayed something that is precious and you did it beautifully."
"voxhumana","8","0","3","30 April 2009"," Will long outlive the critics who scorned it
","Now by all rights, this film should have been awful.<br/><br/>On paper the plot seems fairly trite, there are so many clichéd and terribly two-dimensional characters (eg Allie's father, Lon), some extremely predictable moments such as the confiscation and subsequent return of the letters by Allie's mother (on a side note - why do people always save these letters rather than just putting them in the trash?) and some very heavy handed attempts at creating suspense (gee... is Duke meant to be Noah or Lon? Like you didn't already know.)<br/><br/>Consequently, when the Notebook was released it was absolutely savaged by film critics for all of the above reasons. It was also condemned for trivialising Alzheimer's Disease, for being ""poorly directed"" (a common theme in many of the reviews) and for any number of other faults.<br/><br/>OK then, so if this film is just so awful, why does it have an 8.0 rating here on IMDb? Why does just about every female in the western world own it on DVD, (not to mention the many men - like myself - who have observed its uncanny ability to get girls ""in the mood""?) <br/><br/>My answer: it is quite simply the perfect love story, told perfectly and (despite what the critics said) delivered at a perfect pace. It is intensely passionate yet quite unhurried, just like the best examples of another activity that I'll leave to your imagination.<br/><br/>It is timeless, and it gives substance to the dream that love can endure above all (a dream which - face it - we all buy into to some extent, even if we will never publicly admit it).<br/><br/>Like ""The Shawshank Redemption"", this is a film which has survived critical scorn and has earned its elevated stature in the public arena the hard way.<br/><br/>The simple fact is that people just keep buying it on DVD, people keep shedding tears to it, and critics everywhere are secretly retyping their original reviews (while fervently hoping no-one digs up what they wrote the first time).<br/><br/>And for the record, I'm a ""man's man"" who watches lots of sport and rides a motorcycle. But that scene where Allie realises that the story is actually all about her had me weeping as much as that time when I was 5 years old and Bambi's mother died.<br/><br/>This is a beautiful, heart-rending yet sublimely uplifting story, told with the utmost delicacy and gentle sweetness. The critics be damned."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","0","2","10 March 2009"," Romance executed at its finest: Beautiful images, beautiful story
","There is no brighter gem in movies than a love story told right. That is ""The Notebook."" Romance is central to hundreds of thousands of films, but few are told as well as this film tells it. Between Nicholas Sparks' heart-wrenching story, director Nick Cassevetes' attention to setting and mood and the acting brilliance and universally good looks of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, a bigger emotional punch is hard to come by.<br/><br/>The film is a period romance taking place in the late 1930s and 40s about a teenage couple that meet and fall in love over a summer. It is told to us by Duke (James Gardner) as he reads it from a notebook to an old woman living in an elderly care facility. Noah (Gosling) and Allie (McAdams) are from two different backgrounds: Noah is a working class guy living by his means and Allie's parents are loaded. Despite their undeniably chemistry they split ways after the summer. Although their lives take off in different directions, you can tell they're destined to come back into each other's lives.<br/><br/>A good love story draws you in to the main relationship, connects to you emotionally some way. ""The Notebook"" does this in numerous ways. The first is, well, the attractiveness of Gosling and McAdams. They are beautiful human creatures and their chemistry is impeccable both physically and in terms of their acting. They also have a believable romance, which the entire film hinges on. They actually act like young people in love do. Anyone who has been in love will identify with their relationship: the constant affection, the silliness -- even the fighting. It's incredibly honest and though the script isn't immaculate, all those other elements cover up the rough patches of dialogue, which the usual cheesy romance never accomplishes.<br/><br/>Cassevetes plays a crucial role adding beauty to the film. Working with French cinematographer Robert Fraisse, each scene has distinct colors, beginning with the rich red of the opening sequence that more or less tells you everything you need to know about the film without more than a line of dialogue. The way the love scenes are lit and the way the outdoors scenes are full of life bring out the tenderness and the youthful energy of Noah and Allie's romance and their re-connection.<br/><br/>Romance is about execution, finding a way to avoid clichés or create an emotional pull so strong that clichés seem to evaporate seconds after they happen. Despite its reputation as the chick flick of all chick flicks, just try not feeling invested in what's going on and caring about what happens to the characters. It's hard."
"MoveyGurl","8","0","1","30 January 2009"," What a pleasant surprise!
","OK - I got this movie on Netflix....and when my husband saw it, he immediately thought I was crazy.<br/><br/>Well, I fooled him! Outside of a few corny moments spurred on by the musical score, this movie was quite a touching tale of love found, lost, found, lost and found again. This wasn't your average tale of love though - but I won't spoil your viewing experience.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed it and think that others will definitely think others will too. It will make you yearn for a burning love or it will make you think of that one who got away or maybe the love that slipped away. Either way, it will melt the toughest heart in the room. Grab your popcorn and your honey and cuddle up with the remote for this one.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams really nailed their roles and it was evident that they will have long careers ahead of them."
"hitchcockthelegend","9","0","2","22 January 2009"," A beautiful, evocative and textured picture.
","We are in the present day and in the company of a gentleman named Duke. On a daily basis he visits Allie who has sadly gone senile, regaling her with a romantic tale from a well worn notebook.<br/><br/>I'm choosing not to write too much on this smashing romantic film because personally I feel that first time viewers are better served not knowing too much about it. It's not a cop out or any form of laziness, it's that the impact of the piece will be far heightened without prior knowledge of the films basic plot structures. What I will write, though, is that the film is adapted by Jeremy Leven and Jan Sardi from the hugely popular novel by Nicholas Sparks, it's unashamedly sentimental and its intention is to pull your heart strings and to tap those tear ducts.<br/><br/>Very well acted by Ryan Gosling, Rachael McAdams {superb in fact}, James Garner, Gena Rowlands, Joan Allen and Sam Shepard, gorgeously photographed by Robert Fraisse {I swear a swan lake sequence is heavenly in its execution}, and directed with almost an uncanny awareness of the required pace by Nick Cassavetes, technically the picture stands tall and proud. Really though, it's the story {and the story within the story} that lifts it to the higher echelons of romantic films past and present, I'm not doubting that you need to be in the right frame of mind for such a sentimental picture, but for anyone who has been in love, is in love, or just wants to find love, The Notebook is an essential viewing, so don't let the naysayers tell you any different. 9/10"
"JimmyZappa","9","0","1","18 January 2009"," Notebook Delivers
","Where a lot of romance movies fail, this one delivers. I think the reason why this is so is because of two simple things: 1. The character chemistry interaction usually seems superfluous and fake.<br/><br/>2. The reason why THAT is so is because we don't experience growth between those characters through interaction.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are perfect candidates for this movie. McAdams is not only beautiful, she doesn't act like an airhead like you find in most romantic movies (think Disney channel sappy romance). As childish as she acts in the beginning, we realize she's young and wants to experience all the things teenagers do: fun, excitement, and love. As a guy, I didn't roll my eyes when I saw her whine or crushed. I felt for her. I sympathized with her. I don't see her portrayal of Ally as some throwaway stock character, I see the Ally character as a human being. A fictional character literally brought to life. Once you get that sense of authenticity, it's not game over. It's one base covered.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling's character, Noah, is the second base covered. He's a charming, wild, crazy, yet likable person. For anyone who's been in love or at least knows what it feels like, we can understand why he does the things he does with McAdam's character in the beginning. It's a little stalker-ish, admittedly, but for a movie it works. Like any romance novel, he's a rugged good looking character whose really in love. But like McAdams, Gosling's physical and verbal expressions feel authentic. He's not the typical guy who hates the girl at first then falls in love, nor is he just there for a few minutes and then suddenly there for the traditional happy ending. On that note, he's not cheesy. I think that's important to note. It's real easy to be cheesy in these type of movies, but it doesn't happen here. The dialogue is another factor to this. It hits the appropriate notes and doesn't add any to make it seem artificially mushy to get cheap ""aws"" and earn rolled eyes. It talks about the most important thing in life and all the conflicts that try to separate it, but fail. These conflicts are from Ally's mother who doesn't want her to see Noah, Ally's later fiancée, and even Ally herself. Luckily, all these are explained in the movie. They are not throw away plot devices and that was a major plus for me.<br/><br/>My personal favorite scenes were the ones dealing with the letters, especially when Ally gets then back from her mother, and the older Ally finally remembering who Noah is. If I had to gripe, I would liked to have seen Ally's desire to paint emphasized a bit more (plus ""sneak"" into the story better) and see the young couple have a final sendoff for the viewers before we see the remainder of their lives in photos.<br/><br/>We are taken to small destinations like the fair, the old house that gets rebuilt, and a very brief walk through World War II. But the destinations are really only background and filler, only enhancing the mood when the story feels appropriate. The scene where the 20 something year old Noah and Ally rekindle old ties in the lake then fall in love all over again when it starts to rain is a perfect example of that.<br/><br/>All in all, what carries the story on its shoulders is the side story: the older Noah and Ally. Halfway through the movie, we finally realize its the older versions of the characters in the main story. Noah tells Ally, apparently every day, the story of how they met and came to live with each other even in an elderly home. Unfortunately, Ally suffers from dementia and doesn't remember him. She forgets but we remember. That's the most powerful element in the story.<br/><br/>By the end, we don't feel like we just wasted our time and money. At least I didn't anyway. In my opinion, this is what movies like Titanic should've been like. We see two different stories about how true love can come to anyone, no matter the circumstances. A lot of it centers on Ally and for good reason, old Noah is telling it to her to get her to remember. Both stories go happily hand in hand with each other. The authentic portrayals, appropriate direction, and wonderful writing made a perfect romance film that both guys and girls can enjoy (that is if the guys can tolerate a love story)."
"eneao","Null","0","2","18 January 2009"," The notebook
","This movie is one of the best time piece romantic films I've seen in a very long time. Gena Rowlands and James Garner fit like a glove, as do Gossling and McAdams. The lighting was perfect for the present and the past parts in the film. The transition of those time periods made me curious, and begging to watch more. The colors in the film are simply stunning and the natural scenery certainly helped with that, for sure. I think the car that the actress Rachel McAdams drove herself was the most beautiful blue I've ever seen. I give this a thumbs up for anyone who loves to laugh and cry all at once. I can't wait to see it again and I just saw it last night! Oh, and I loved the beard Gossling has in the movie--a true lumberjack!"
"down-emily","7","0","1","2 January 2009"," a bit overrated, isn't it?
","Whilst I found this movie nice and somewhat inspiring, I had to face it, it was nothing new or innovating. But I guess that wasn't the aim of the movie itself. It was meant to be a heart-warming romance drama and it was just that. The problem is that if you make this kind of movie where you have two parallel stories going on, you have to be able to make them blend. Now, I think here the direction didn't do such a splendid job, since I felt the stories were cut and didn't connect. Also, the acting was a bit wooden when it came to some characters. Rachel McAdams...is as usual a cute, interesting presence; nevertheless, in some scenes she tries to hard to act either like the victim or the American femme fatale and it doesn't work for her. Ryan Gosling however, really shows some acting props with this movie, because he basically keeps this movie going. I have to hand it to him; this is a chick flick but he turned it into a real adaptation. If it wasn't for him, this film would probably collapse at one point from the sappy pressure points. His cool demeanor mixed with a flaring angst really convinced me he was not only in love with her, but was also trying to treasure that love. The chemistry between the two is OK, not perfect, but it works for the early 20th century. I find it interesting that two completely different people get to have this kind of connection. The guy who wrote the actual book, Nicholas Sparks...OK, now this writer gets on my nerves sometimes because all his books are about these kind of things. Don't get me wrong, the man writes nicely, but overusing the same themes tends to put off some readers. Returning to the movie, I found the symbol of the notebook a nice touch and the tender relationship between the elderly couple really great. That was a lot more convincing than the youthful version of them. I'm giving it a seven because it did have a lot of potential, but that was lost sometimes in some unimportant scenes, or worse, skipped completely. People who love romantic movies and especially tear-jerkers should see this one since it will satisfy their expectations."

Mr. Gosling and Ms. McAdams never seemed (to me) like they would age into characters like those essayed by Mr. Garner and Ms. Rowlands. Many times, the younger lovers appear to be modeling, rather than playing, their roles. The older couple is more enjoyable. Garner's performance, and narration, is particularly strong. James Marsden (as Lon Hammond) and Joan Allen (as Anne Hamilton) have interesting, underdeveloped roles. (Ms. Allen may been channeling Ellen Burstyn's ""Lois Farrow"").<br/><br/>The ""teenage"", and later, undressing scenes are very funny. And, some of the characters' implausible actions (the 365 letters, for example) could be explained as embellishments and/or enhancements made by Rowlands' character, in her ""The Story of Our Lives"" account. It is interesting that the lead characters write, at different times, a prolific amount of material to be read at a later time.

I have never managed to be more drawn into the middle of the movie. Katherine Hepburn who plays Audry, an autistic teenager portrays a dis-normal childhood into a slightly parodic type to which anyone can relate to. Michael Keaton who plays the childs father is heroic in the sense that he can hold a job as a lawyer while still managing to cure Audry's illness. The mother who is played by Kathlene Turner is anything but funny, a serious and mischievous woman who gains satisfaction, when she wins the lottery at a local RSL and learns that there can be happiness from money if one wishes for it hard enough. This romantic yet dramatic real life story can only be described as confusing yet relatable in it's self confusion of today's world and economy.<br/><br/>The scenes are beautifully done in exotic Africa and Hungary, mostly from a small farm in Brazil, containing beautiful images of young and old and doctors who try to cure glandular fever.<br/><br/>I would rate this movie to be one of the years top films, well done Hiroshi Wu for directing this film and to all the support from leading charities who contributed to this film from Hong Kong."

","I heard a lot about this film from the leading stars, I had a vague idea of what to expect, besides the film plot, but I knew it might be a bit of a cheesy and tear-jerking film, but that's what it makes it good. The story sees old Duke (James Garner) staying in the nursing home with Allie Calhoun (Gena Rowlands), and reading a story, from a notebook naturally, about two characters named Noah Calhoun (Half Nelson's Ryan Gosling) and Allie Hamilton (Mean Girls' Rachel McAdams). Noah was instantly besotted by Allie, but it took a while for her develop true feelings for him, but they were inseparable when she did, sure they had their disagreements, but they were crazy for each other. Unfortunately one argument becomes too much and they separate, Noah writes to Allie everyday, but her disapproving mother Anne (The Bourne Supremacy's Joan Allen) obviously stopped her getting the letters, so he gives up writing on #365 with a fair well letter. Allie has found a new love interest with Lon Hammond Jr. (X-Men's James Marsden), who the parents like a lot, and Noah meanwhile is rebuilding the old house that would have been the ""dream house"", not only to live in, but because he promised Allie he's finish it. Allie is to be married to Lon, but she feels like she can't go through with it until she checks up on Noah, after seeing his face in the newspaper, and he is very happy to see her. She spends a few hours there, including a boat trip across the near lake, and obviously the subject of writing to her comes up, and when she knows the truth, they kiss, and (surprisingly) she loses her virginity. They do have another argument, about the marriage, and she feels she has to go back, and you wonder if she'll come back, and thank goodness she did. Oh, and by the way, they got married and had kids, Duke and Allie are obviously them older, but the love disappeared when Allie developed memory loss, caused by dementia and Alzheimer's, and it's really sad when she does remember it, but her memory goes again, only returning in the end again, when they die together. Also starring Kevin Connolly as Fin, Home Alone 3's David Thornton as John Hamilton and Sam Shepard as Frank Calhoun.

Though with imperfections and complications along the way, the plot drives itself away from the norm, to deliver a sweet and realistic approach to relationships.<br/><br/>The direction helps achieve a good realistic approach but also dives into a fantasy genre to, none more so than the rowing into the swan lake scene. This particular scene is really romantic and the direction and slow approach makes it feel like a complete romantic fantasy and will instantly make you smile, whatever age or gender you are.<br/><br/>The acting by Gosling and McAdams (Mean girls) is a beautiful on screen partnership, which will make you really associate with their characters, but the pairing of Garner (Murphy's romance) and Rowlands (a woman under the influence) is one of the main reasons to watch this film. Very soft and sentimental in their respective roles, the pair create a sadness but an excitement within their difficult environment, and the ending, though I didn't cry, is praised for its sentimental value, which is very understandable.<br/><br/>Too many current films are romantic comedies which run on clichés, but the Notebook focuses strongly upon the dramatic side of relationships, and is made as memorable as Titanic, with heart wrenching moments.<br/><br/>The plot is extremely slow moving, to capture the mood of the character's personalities, so if you're up for fast paced action as well as romance, put Titanic on.

We get to see how they fell in love, how they almost lost each other and how their love would never die; and Duke (aka Noah) believes this with all his heart. In the final scenes we learn that the ""Notebook"" of their love story is written by Allie herself. She wrote it upon learning she would start to forget, she wrote it for Noah to read to her so she would remember; and she does.

","The best thing about ""The Notebook"" is probably its simplicity. There's nothing complicated about it. It's all about the love shared by two very different people who have built a life together in spite of their differences, and who face their declining years together, with all the challenges those declining years bring. It's sweet, it's romantic, it's emotional (and, yes, at times it gets a bit too sappy) - it's probably the epitome of what we think of when we speak about a ""chick flick."" And it's very good. The premise is - as I said - surprisingly simple. Allie (Gena Rowlands) is confined to a nursing home because of dementia. She can't remember anything - not even her family. Her husband Noah (James Garner) is fiercely devoted to her, reading everyday from a notebook, in which Allie penned the story of their love, a story that just every now and then drags her back to reality. We move back and forth from the present day (in the nursing home) to the story of their early love. In their earlier days, Allie and Noah (played by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling) overcame lots of challenges and pretty long odds to be together. In their declining years, they have many things to overcome to stay together.<br/><br/>It's a pleasant movie - sometimes sad, sometimes hopeful, and always passionate in a loving sense. McAdams and Gosling portrayed the young love brilliantly, but the most powerful scene (in my opinion) belonged to Garner, when - after a brief few minutes when Allie had snapped back to reality and they had shared a dance - is suddenly horrified by the fact that she lost everything in an instant and had to be restrained and drugged to be brought under control. It was the look on his face in that scene that stood out for me. The ending of the movie is both sad and happy, and completely appropriate to the story. In the end, the power of love triumphed in spite of all the odds against it. 7/10"

","Remarkable film! <br/><br/>I have to say, get the tissues first before you start watching this, because films never make me cry but i've never had so many tears from just the one movie! It truly was touching, mostly for people who enjoy watching that type of genre. I can't think of any bad points about the film although when I began to watch it, I thought it would be dull and I was totally wrong in thinking that because now I feel it deserves more credit. I liked how the story was told, it was very different from the usual romance stories you get, but it made it even more better realising it was Noah telling Allie the story of their love life, love never dies! I would definitely recommend everyone to see this!"

","I've never seen such a beautiful film, and beautiful is the only word I can find to describe it! The portrayal of the love Allie and Noah share was truly breathtaking, and left me wanting to have what they have! When it reached the end, I was crying like I have never cried before at a film. The ending although it was sad, left me feeling so happy I'd seen it, and I think the way the director conveyed the tragedy of their love was amazing. After I'd watched it I was left UNABLE to watch any other films! It was all I could think about. I could feel my family just getting annoyed with me talking about it but I couldn't stop! I recommend this film to anyone. Its not just a chick flick.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a long film, and at one point I kept checking to see how much was left, but as soon as you reach the end you forget any doubts you had about it before."

","The Notebook would have to be the most beautiful, touching romance film to be released in modern times. I was a skeptic at first, feeling it could not possibly be that good, but it is. It is unusual for a movie released after 1980 to make it in to my top ten films of all time, but this film has slotted right on in to the top of my list. What is so special about this film? Everything. The casting is perfect, I couldn't imagine any other girl being able to play Allie and do a performance as realistic and adorable as Rachel McAdams. Most women in romance films are extremely irritating and annoying, yet even in her indecisiveness in the film Allie is still totally lovable, and you can understand Noah's infatuation with her. Noah, likewise, is perfectly cast, not the typical smooth, suave lead male - he also is realistic and highly appealing. The older actors playing Noah and Allie are also sensational, they make the film so much more special with their achingly beautiful scenes. The romance in this film is perfectly crafted, not overdone, just exactly right. It is powerful and passionate, and something everyone can relate to in regards to your first love. There is a scene where Allie's boyfriend proposes to her, and she accepts, and the voice-over says that in the moment Allie said yes, ""Noah's face came into her mind."" It just is such a sad, nostalgic moment that I cry every time at this line. The film is also humorous in parts, and the conflicts are perfectly acted. I really think it is having the couple as elderly people looking back on the past that really makes the film that much more special than other romances. The only teeny tiny problem I had with this film was in the way Noah and Allie first meet. The ""love-at-first-sight"" that Noah shows, to me, is silly and pretty unrealistic as he hasn't even spoken to her. But when they get together, everything is beautiful and really easy to relate to. The notion of time in this film also sets it apart - years pass, and it just makes their reunion that much sweeter. And the final scene? Devastatingly beautiful, could not be any sweeter or more touching. I also love the use of I'll Be Seeing You, the song played a few times in the movie. It is so appropriate and so, so touching. Absolutely gorgeous movie, one of the best I've ever seen and extremely hard to contend with. If you haven't seen it, do it. It is not just a girly romance - men also love this film. Definite 10 out of 10. Perfect."

","I'm not a fan of romantic movies especially those titled around the youngster's puppy love but this movie did win my affection. The entire idea of getting old & looking at the past, is rather touching. The acting is definitely good & so is the script. It does portray the younger generation of today & the need to have faith in the people they love. It's a semi-rebellion that many parents & families face today with their children in relation to marriages. Im sure a lot of youngsters can relate to the roles displayed & would like their romances to have the same ending, but that's less common. <br/><br/>Overall its a good watch for one time."

","Watched this movie last night after months of procrastinating on the grounds that it would be just another love story. I could not have been more wrong. The film is wonderfully enchanting, just vague enough to keep you guessing and true to its genre through to the end. I'm a young male and as a rule don't enjoy movies such as this an awful lot but this is a definite exception to this rule. I enjoyed watching it immensely and its the closest I've come to tears at a movie sine watching Bambi at age 5. I would recommend this to any and all. No matter how little you tend to enjoy stories you cannot help but become enchanted with this, a movie that will stay with you for a very long time."

","Notebook, The (2004) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>An elderly woman (Gena Rowlands) has lost most of her memory due to Alzheimer's and is currently living in a nursing home where she is visited by another member (James Garner) who spends the afternoons reading to her. The book he reads her deals with a teenage couple (Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams) from opposite sides of the tracks who fall in love one summer. She's a rich girl and he's a poor boy and of course this doesn't sit well with her snobbish mother (Joan Allen) who pretty much ends the relationship. The young people are deeply in love but due to various circumstances, the two go years without seeing one another until fate steps into play.<br/><br/>Being a major film buff isn't always the easiest thing in the world because quite often you find yourself watching the same thing over and over again. There's always an interesting debate whether current films can hold a candle to the older classics and I'm somewhat split in this conversation. On one hand there really isn't anything new that can be done with films today. No matter what you watch, there's a very good chance a film, of some type, has been made before it. The Notebook really isn't anything new and it really doesn't tell anything we haven't seen before but it really doesn't matter because in that tiresome debate, it really doesn't matter when a film was made. What matters is what the filmmakers do with that story and in the case of this film director Nick Cassavetes has created a masterpiece of innocence, love and fate. As a film buff, I've seen countless love stories but I'm in no way hesitant to call The Notebook one of the most touching and romantic films ever made.<br/><br/>I think the key success to the film is the word innocence, which runs throughout the film and it's the one scene that anyone could connect to. We've all felt innocence in our life whether it be from our first love to our first sexual experience. Both of those issues are dealt with in the film and the director brings so much energy and passion to both segments that it's never too hard to connect to the characters on screen. There's no doubt this film is meant to be a tearjerker, a term which is overused in today's cinema full of bad films but it's the highest compliment here because the film is full of innocence that we can put to rest any ideas of seeing this stuff before and the viewer can simply go along with the ride, witnessing and falling in love for the first time just like the two characters.<br/><br/>A lot of love stories today seem to rely on actions more than words. Quite often we get love stories that are rush jobs and by saying that I'm referring to films that go from point A to B without any motivations. Throughout the film there are several innocents lost, sex for one and losing your heart for another. Quit often these big moments come and go too quickly but the screenplay is smart enough to realize that words can speak a lot more than any actions. Half way through the first sex scene the two stop and the girls asks the guy what he's thinking at that moment. How many films would stop a sex scene so that a honest question could be asked? How many times do we get to know how the characters are feeling or even thinking? In all honesty, the problem I have with most current films is that it appears characters are never thinking. Opening the mind with thought can do a lot of good and that rings true here because these characters thoughts are a strong part of their emotions, which is what the film is about.<br/><br/>The performances are what really brings the film up to another level. The older couple is played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, both giving superb performances, which were unfortunately overlooked at the recent Oscar announcements. Garner is a very confident actor and he always comes across as looking so natural on the screen. It appears his acting talents have been overlooked for quite some time because we see him appearing so calm and collective on screen that it appears he's making it look too easy. Rowlands has always been given her credit by playing hard edged characters so it's charming to see her in a more quiet role. This was my first time seeing Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams but both really caught my eye. The two of them, again, bring a certain innocence to the screen that it's not hard to follow their story and feel for them in each and every scene.<br/><br/>The one problem I did have with the film are the final ten minutes, which I felt were a bit too ugly for a film like this. I guess I'm going back on my earlier word were realistic was a good thing but I do feel some of this ugliness could have been cut back but this might have taken away from the final shot, which is one of the most beautiful and heartwarming scenes I can remember. The Notebook is your typical love story but every single moment rises to a different level, which is really what makes this film give the true meaning to a tearjerker. The poetic beauty and heartwarming fantasy is something we all look for in our own lives and to see it played out so perfectly on the screen is something very special in this day and age."

","I was really prepared to not like this picture. I had seen the trailer and read about it and it just seemed so.....predictable. But when I finally got around to getting the DVD and watching it, I was pleasantly surprised. This is just the kind of story that grabs you even if you feel yourself resisting it. It was also interesting to me because it's one of the few movies in a long time that my mom and could watch together, and I guess that's a good thing. She liked it more than I did and I think it made her think a lot about some things in her own life. I thought Rachel McAdams was really amazing -- there is something about her looks, the way her skin is so translucent, that you feel like you can really feel everything she feels and understand her character better than with other actors. Ryan Gosling was also good -- hot without trying to hard to be a ""hottie"". And James Garner -- what a cool old guy. My mom made me watch him in his ""Maverick"" days and I'm glad I did. It made the character he plays here seem more understandable and compelling."

"Alycen86","10","0","1","12 June 2007"," I'm not one for romance films, but this was just wonderful
","As a major movie buff, you'd think I would have seen this movie earlier, like, when it first premiered. I finally saw it last night, and I completely fell in love with this love story! Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are particularly brilliant and have wonderful chemistry as a young couple in love. I couldn't believe how a romance could unfold in a way that it was watchable and could be related to. What most modern films miss is the ability to capture a relationship in a way that you become engrossed in it and wish that maybe, just maybe, it could happen to you-- The Notebook allows you to hold onto that notion. James Garner and Gena Rowlands also play their parts well (they reminded me of my grandparents), as endearing and emotional characters. Everyone in this film evokes so much and it makes it hard for any viewer not to add this film to their favorites list. Expect to tear a little bit, but be glad that you did. The Notebook is a classic film, and an excellent adaptation from print to the big screen."
"lucky_star_1","8","0","1","8 June 2007"," 'The Notebook' is, quite simply, a truly beautiful love story. More convincing than 'Titanic's' romance
","Three quarters of the movie shows the relationship between young lovers Noah and Allie, played truthfully by Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams, who generate sizzling chemistry and share a romance ten times more beautiful, believable and fulfilling than Jack and Rose in 'Titanic'. When drawing comparisons, you always sensed that the tragedy of the ship sinking would tear Jack and Rose apart forever, whereas in this movie, every moment Noah and Allie are not together, you long for them to be and know deep down they will be again. Also unlike Titanic, The Notebook focuses solely on their unconditional and passionate love and isn't overshadowing any other story going on in it. This makes you root for the lovers to be together even more.<br/><br/>Even though you hate to admit it, you end up not completely hating the two main obstacles in the way of them continuing their relationship. Firstly, there is Allie's mother, Anne, played with a strong sincerity by Joan Allen. At the beginning, her ranting about the 'unsuited' couple makes you assume she genuinely just looks down on Noah because he's not good enough, however by the end of the movie, the audience learns there is more to her objection than she initially shows. Secondly, there is Allie's fiancée Lon, whom she has met 7 years after her break-up with Noah. Now because he is played so sympathetically by handsome actor James Marsden, when Allie is left to make her decision between the two guys, you end up feeling sorry for him because he seems genuinely in love with her despite knowing she spent a weekend with Noah. Nevertheless, you never get the sense of him being her soul-mate, at all. In spite of his love for her, he just always strikes you as the guy who the girl's parents approve of and is very wealthy. Whereas in the first half of the movie, you're desperate for her to stay with Noah because they learn a lot from each other, can be free when together and she continues to love him despite parental objections. Moreover, considering Allie's unfaithfulness when she visits Noah, she's lucky that Lon expresses any sort of loving feeling for her at all after he finds out.<br/><br/>James Marsden didn't get a lot of screen time but still made a decent subtle impact when he had the chance, although like I pointed out before, Lon's love for Allie doesn't compare to Noah's and Noah does so many things throughout the movie to prove the depth of his feelings. Sam Shepard brings some comic relief into the role of Noah's father and David Thornton has a very limited role as Allie's father but still impresses and doesn't play the character with straightforward hatred towards Noah. A special mention goes to Gena Rowlands (the director's mother) and James Garner who star as the older Allie and Noah, and generally act in the scenes where you need to reach for the tissues the most. My only concern is that neither one, James in particular, struck me as an older version of Rachel and Ryan! But their heartbreaking portrayals overshadowed this problem.<br/><br/>And last of all, the best thing about this movie is the undeniable chemistry between Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. I mean seriously, they weren't even dating until the year after they made the movie, but their moments together felt so natural that I actually believed it was the actors falling in love, not just the characters. Ryan does a complete turnaround from his sinister brilliance in 'Murder by Numbers' and is flawless playing the devoted guy who wins the girl's heart. You would seriously think he'd played romantic leads beforehand, he is such a gentleman in this movie and very sexy, so it's not hard to believe that a lot of girls along with Allie fell in love with him watching him in this movie. Rachel brings a stunning beauty to the screen and like Ryan, pulls off changing from a sweet lovelorn teenager to an older, more serious person. Memorable scenes are the ones showing Noah and Allie dating through the summer and they can't keep away from each other, and of course the scene in the rain set seven years later.<br/><br/>To sum up, there is amazing acting from everyone, stunning cinematography, a heartbreaking developing story and two very gorgeous leads playing an unforgettable movie couple - perhaps the best couple ever screened. I was impressed, and hopefully you will be too! A can't stop watching the DVD it is that amazing!"

","This movie kind of reminds me of Romeo & Juliet. It pretty much has the same plot. The typical couple where Allie is on summer vacation and meets her love, Noah. Allie's parents don't approve of her love because he's poor and whatnot. It seems as if Noah and Allie have an unconditional love for one another. Until one night Noah and Allie get into a fight because she didn't tell him that she was moving to New York for College. They say they want to break up but they know that it's just another fight and they will reconcile until both find out that Allie is moving back home the very next day. Noah writes her every day for a year, but Allie never gets the letters due to her mother keeping it from her. Allie goes onto become a Nurse where Noah goes into the army, when Noah comes back he finds that his father sold the house and got him a loan so he can purchase his dream house which he promised Allie that he would re-build. Allie meets a wounded soldier who asks her out on a date, they fall in love and he ends up asking her to marry him. One day Allie sees in the newspaper that Noah and Her ""dream house"" has been re-built and she decides to visit him. Both Noah and Allie reconcile and now Allie has to decide who she wants to be with. The thing that I didn't like about this movie was this whole movie was a story being told my Old Noah to Old Allie at a retirement home. Near the end we want to know who Allie chose, Noah or Lon and this is when the viewer (us) finds out that the old man telling the story all along was Noah and the old lady was Allie. This was HORRIBLE in my opinion because it shows no footage of WHAT Allie did and HOW she ended up making her decision. It just showed her saying she loves her soon to be husband and next thing we know she shows up at Noah's house with her suitcase. Then the last 10 minutes of the movie is Old Noah and Old Allie dancing and Old Allie who now has some mental disorders ends up having some panic attack, it was just a mess of an ending. Anyway the way it ends is Old Noah and Old Allie die in the bed together, credits roll. This movie was a 10 the whole way until the awful ending, which in conclusion I give an 8. Would've been an AWESOME movie if it didn't end in a result of a story being told and just played out as a movie."

","As another proof that some of the recent award recipients have nothing to do with quality, here comes an assured and delicate piece of film-making that will probably not be honoured in the fair manner it deserves in next year's awards' frenzy. Just the other night, I had the pleasured to see an accomplished film for the second time: ""Inside Man"", and my jaw dropped when I realized that it was mysteriously absent in any ""best of"" celebrations. Regardless of what happens in about one year, audiences should not deny themselves the transcendental experience from seeing a movie that recognizes the beauty inside families and how their relationships are a mixture of inner and external pressures; only to all boil down to one word: Love.<br/><br/>As the title indicates, most of the storyline originates from a very peculiar name, and how it seems to affect the main protagonist. As the plot unfolds, we become involved in a sophisticated, almost flawless, and touching, without being maudlin masterpiece. With stunning camera work, a spiritual and moving score, and astounding performances by the entire cast, we learn to identify the universal values that this marvelous film highlights.<br/><br/>What is truly miraculous in the film is how its director weaves a story from the incongruities between two cultures that couldn't be any more different from each other, and yet, they are mirror reflections of each other. We all cry, feel happiness and disappointment. As our characters grow and change, we feel their sense of wonder, joy, and grief. Seeing them celebrate breaks down any resistance we might have to whatever foreign quality this movie might be. It's exotic, inviting, showing us that we share more than we think. In ""The Namesake"", a Russian name becomes essential to some of the tribulations of a Hindu American young man. It anchors the love that originates between a mother and her children. As Ashima adjusts to her new surroundings, she manages to hold on her traditions, as she learns to cope with the changes that she can't stop. In the end, she delivers one of the most inspirational speeches in movie history, and we can't do nothing but witness a superb dramatic performance come full circle. Many in Hollywood might feel a tinge of envy as her is an actress that charms us in spite of apparently not trying very hard. Her character is lovely, strong, and sometimes reads like a collection of the best moments in every female great role in the last century. She embodies the best of Scarlett O'Hara, the pain and frustration of Sophie in ""Sophie's Choice"", some of the regal qualities of Helen Mirren in ""The Queen"", and she can even sing and makes us laugh, all when a screenplay that addresses the lives of one regular family in New York.<br/><br/>""The Namesake"" deserves every single of the kudos people decide to give it. It's a brilliant film, based on an outstanding piece of fiction, and that one that never struggles to be anything else but faithful to its source material, and whose heart never stops beating, with a real and magnificent heart.<br/><br/>Run and enjoy some of the best moments of your life."

","The Notebook is a romantic comedy, i'm sure every girl would fall in love with it, and Noah is just so sweet and what he does for her is truly romantic, it has been my favourite movie ever since i rented it out on DVD, i fell in love with it and i can't wait to buy it, i would watch it a million times and i would never get sick of it, the notebook shows that love exists, it shows that love at first sight exists, it has a good storyline, it's the type of movie that draws you in. it would be really strange if a girl didn't like it, i don't think think guys would like it though because its too romantic and they don't want to get into the juicy romance stuff, but thats guys for you lolz, anyway i absolutely looove the notebook, and i recommend all girls to watch it!"

","I have to say that The Notebook was a film that really changed my prospective for life.The acting I consider simply brilliant and the story is just breathtaking.Love is presented in a unique way,never seen before in Hollywood history.About the actors...,well there is nothing to tell-they really got me convinced,maybe because Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were actually together in life.I recommend this film to all people,and mostly to those who don't like love movies.I guarantee to them that they wont be disappointed.The Notebook has a unique charm that wouldn't stay hidden for them.Love has never been so bitter-sweat before!"

","I can't put my finger on why I was so taken with this film. The framing device used to tell the story is quite appropriately like Princess Bride's, considering the condition of Gena Rowland's character. I haven't come across a film that uses Alzheimer's so effectively to further its plot and mimic the character of the couple's relationship. It seemed obvious to me who the old couple was from the start, but the final scenes still swept me away. In fact, many scenes were contrived or hokey but given the context they didn't bother me. There were some holes in the plot regarding the young couple's time apart, but the performances of everyone in the film are so fantastic that they can be overlooked. Garner and Rowlands have exceptional chemistry in their scenes, and it was nice to see such a rich opportunity for mature actors to exhibit their talent."
"selenedm999","8","0","1","4 February 2007"," unabashed sentiment--contains possible spoilers
","I waited a long time to see this movie, because I'm not much for sentiment, in fact I can pretty much do without it. If I were to list my favourite movies for you, you wouldn't find a ""real"" romance in the bunch (Pulp Fiction, What's Eating Gilbert Grape, Taxi Driver, etc.). However, what draws most movie buffs, and I'm no exception, is a deep love of narrative, interesting characters, and masterful writing. The Notebook delivers all of these, and much more.<br/><br/>The Notebook is the simple story of two lovers (Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdam) who meet in the late 1930s (the actual year isn't given), then break up, and meet again seven years later. It's offset by the narrative structure of a man reading to a woman with senile dementia (played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands). Although the star-crossed lovers are sympathetic because they're young and beautiful, I found it was the older couple who really drove the story. Even now, with so many big-name actors reaching their ""Golden Years,"" it's still rare to see actors who look their age, acting age-appropriate parts. While second to the younger couple, Garner and Rowlands turn in two of the loveliest performances I've seen in years--tender and compelling, and over-the-top sentimental, yet still sadly, wonderfully human.<br/><br/>Be sure to keep a big box of tissues handy for this one, but it's well worth it."

","First off, I want to say that I am not a very big romance movie fan at all, and at times I am rather annoyed by that kind of stuff. However, when i saw this movie, I loved it. To tell you the truth it actually kind of touched my heart a bit because of the plot. To tell you the truth, this does make you feel a bit mushy inside. The plot is very nice and a classic plot in my opinion, the actors did a very good job of portraying their characters (especially Ryan Gosling playing Noah Calhon), and the writers wrote a very good script.<br/><br/>Anyone who is a fan of romantic movies has to see this movie and I will guarantee that if you like romance movies, you will love this film."

","Such a simple story, but told in such a brilliant way! Unsophisticated and emotional, yet permanently keeping you wanting to see more, every time the old lady is asking ""And what happened next?"" <br/><br/>I think the beauty of this movie can't thoroughly be expressed in words. The recurring image of the lake filled with swans is perhaps defining for the magic of this film. As the story unfolds, the beauty of the scenery mingles with the beauty of the feelings and of the characters. The film makes one start caring for the two from the very first moment we see Noah and Allie in the park and wraps us up with melancholy as the past and present scenes alternate. The acting is at its best and moves a string of emotion in one's heart at most of the times. Allie's exuberance and passion, the quiet yet burning look in Noah's eyes, the old lady's lost and fearful look, old Noah's endless devotion and hope.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen this movie, I think you should give it a try and expect more than from a typical romantic story. Romantic or not, I believe this film will wake up emotions in anyone's heart."
"Poseidon-3","Null","0","1","21 December 2006"," Attractive, enjoyable, but unsurprising, love story.
","A surprise hit in this day of high-adrenaline adventure, lewd comedy and seedy crime films, this unabashedly romantic, yet startlingly conventional, romance has amassed a sizable following. Garner plays an elderly man who visits a elderly woman (Rowlands) suffering from dementia. Part of his therapy for her is to read from a notebook which tells the story of a pair of kids in the 1940's who find love and suffer separation, in part due to their different social backgrounds. Gosling is a poor, but nice, boy who dreams of restoring an old local mansion. McAdams is a wealthy, at times petulant, reasonably-cultured girl who has her future as a college student mapped out for her. When they meet up and fall for each other, her stern parents make sure to nip the romance in the bud, eventually causing her to fall for Marsden. Garner reads this story to Rowlands as the love affair is shown in flashback until finally, it seems as if Rowlands may know the participants of the story and begin to remember the situation. The film is lovingly crafted and beautifully shot. Garner is excellent and Rowlands is solid as well, even if she looks like no other dementia patient on God's planet, immaculately dressed, coiffed and made-up as she is and living in a fairy tale nursing home. Gosling is an appealing presence and McAdams gives a breathless and fresh performance. Neither of them go very far in suggesting the time period in which their characters live and they turn in very contemporary-tinged portrayals. (Some extra hot loves scenes were trimmed somewhat for the release print to at least preserve some small amount of decorum in the flashback story.) Excellent support comes from Allen, as McAdams' tightly-wound mother. Thornton, as her father, is a jarring caricature who does everything but twirl his moustache. Shepard plays Gosling's simple, but caring, father adeptly. Marsdon is attractive and likable in a fairly thankless part. Garner's children are portrayed by three of the least charismatic and compelling actors imaginable. Their very brief scene wounds the film, though not fatally. There are many romantic, funny and swooning moments as it attempts to display the great love between the youngsters. At times, this comes off as a dry-docked ""Titanic"" - minus the disaster, especially when Gosling sits down to dinner with the ritzy set. The chief issue with the film is that it seems bent on protecting a big secret (which couldn't be more obvious!) while the audience tries to wonder whether some other surprise will come about, since the ""big reveal"" becomes clear long before the alleged revelatory moment. Any bit of mystery or dramatic suspense is dissipated as what was painfully obvious is uncovered to be just what it seemed like. Still, lovers of love stories will be satisfied, even as the overlong film limps along to an even less rewarding climax. Romantics will appreciate the bond between the lovers while cynics will wonder what the point of the film even was.... Based on a wildly successful novel and directed by the son of Rowlands and experimental director John Cassavetes."

","I've seen this movie at least twenty times. The first time I saw this movie was in the Spring of 2006, my mom was watching it and I came in at the carnival scene.

So we watched it and now she's just as crazy about it as I am. We even went online to find posters, changed our wallpapers on our computers to The Notebook, everything we could possibly think of. We are pretty much obsessed with Ryan Gosling, he's adorable. Even with the beard. This is, by far, my favorite movie EVER."

","A summer romance that lasts forever. Magnificently performed by the entire cast. Separated by war and parents at the end of the summer, the young couple's love does not diminish and eventually they are reunited. The story is recounted from a 'Note Book' by James Garner to Gena Rowlands (the older romantic couple) in flash backs. Rachel McAdams as the young Allie practically steals the show with her high and passionate spirit. Her talent is on a par with the generation of Renee Zellweger and a generation back Merril Streep. But the other performers are equally brilliant including particularly Ryan Gosling. Jamie Brown as Martha and James Marsten as Lon are both unforgettable. The scene with Martha, Allie, and Noah meeting at the door is superbly played by all. The emotions evinced by the actors is so convincing with so few words. One reason I particularly cared for this story is that it brought back memories of the summer romance of my wife and I more than 5 decades ago. Our romance ended more happily in that the summer ended with our engagement and marriage 3 months later."

Of course life really never is as wonderful as people make it in movies. Love is a complicated thing or emotion. Allie and Noah loved each other but sometimes love works and then it doesn't. The Notebook is a beautiful tale and it gives people who watch it a whole different meaning of how two people are so different but yet so in love. Never get mixed up in LUST or LOVE! You know if you love someone when you hold them or they hold you that you could stay in that place/spot with them holding you till the day you die.

","The Notebook is one of my favourite movies. Not having seen it in cinema, and not having heard anything about it, it caught me off guard. It seems like this is just another summer romance, the age old battle between rich and poor people. I bought the DVD, preparing for a movie that put a smile on my face.<br/><br/>But, The Notebook did more than that. It made me cry, made me laugh and made me fall in love with all the key characters. The acting is amazing, James Garner and Gena Rowlands did an amazing job, as did Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams. McAdams, whom I knew from her performance in Mean Girls, blew me away with her portrayal of a girl who is torn between two loves and thus two lives. She is a very promising young actress and had a lot of chemistry with costar Gosling, who also did an amazing job. The producers & director of ""The Notebook"" should be proud, they made each and every character in this movie likable, which is tough. Yet they did a terrific job! I feel that everyone should give this movie a chance, because it will certainly find its way into your heart."

","Allie Hamilton (played by Rachel McAdams) is the daughter of a wealthy, southern USA family. The time is 1946 and Allie's parents have moral and social codes common to that era in North Carolina. The parents and Allie are visiting their summer home on the coast for the summer. Allie is seventeen when the story opens. She meets Noah Calhoun (played by Ryan Gosling) a local young man, about the same age, of many good qualities. They date each other throughout the summer and fall madly in love. Allie's parents are alarmed by the young lovers relationship because Noah's family is poor and he has no likely prospects for improving his condition in the future. At summer's end Allie's parents force her to return to their regular home therefore separating the young lovers. Allie and Ryan are kept apart by the scheming of Allie's mother. They now begin separate lives; however, they meet again in seven years. Allie is engaged to be married to a prosperous southerner and Ryan, still unmarried because of his love for Allie, has improved his fortunes somewhat after numerous adventures. The resolution of their love for each other is always in question until the end of the movie. <br/><br/>Parallel to the story of the young Allie and Noah is the story of the aged Allie and Noah. The young and the aged scenes interlaced throughout. It is now 1994 and they are elderly. Their human condition finally reveals what happened to their lives and reveals the resolution of their ""summer romance."" <br/><br/>This movie is beautifully done via the wonderful book by Nicholas Sparks, the movie script by Jeremy Leven, the wonderful cinematography, and the super direction of Nick Cassavetes not to mention the great location for the movie. The acting by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling is of ""Oscar"" quality. In this writer's opinion Rachel and Ryan are the hottest young actors in Hollywood. Rachel is absolutely one of the most beautiful women I have ever seen on the screen."

","First of all, I must say that this movie is the most romantic movie that I have ever seen! I recommend it to everyone, who loves the romantic movies with happy endings. I was really touched by this movie and it inspires me a lot. So, if you ever watch it, try keeping a tissue box near you. ""The Notebook"" is about this young couple that meets in North Carolina, but yet gets separated by Allie's family, because they think that Noah isn't good enough for her, so they part and then came the World War II. Sometime later Allie sees Noah in the newspaper with their dream house in the background and Allie decides to meet up with Noah. At that time she was already engaged with a wealthier soldier she met, while she volunteered for first aid help. When Allie visits Noah the love starts to spark again. The best scene is when they are on the lake and Allie is confused why Noah never wrote to her for seven years.<br/><br/>I don't want to say much more, otherwise the whole movie would be revealed. But what I can tell you is that it has a happy ending.<br/><br/>So, that's that. I hope you'll watch the movie and really enjoy it as much as I did. 10 from 10!!"

","This is one of my all time favorite movies. I have watched it a zillion times and I am drawn into it each time. The casting of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams was brilliant. They made me want to be 17 again enjoying the emotions of first love. However, there are some aspects that drove me nuts. As much as I love James Garner he is obviously not what Noah would have looked like as an older man. To show pictures of a younger James Garner and Gena Rowlands to represent Noah and Ally was absurd. Who thought of that? It was like a different movie at that point. Some of the editing and script were inconsistent. When Noah asks Ally what she does for fun he says that 'I 'always' thought...he just met her....how could he 'always' think of her as anything? When Finn sees her in town the day after the carnival he says to Noah 'look isn't that the girl from the carnival'....he was the one who told Noah at the carnival that her name was Ally and her father had more money than God...why would he say 'that girl' when he knew her name? The battle scenes were totally irrelevant. Maybe I'm being picky but it was so good and could have been so much better."

","The Notebook has now become my favorite film of all time. I'll admit, I love a love story. However, most end either with the lovers parting or with them finally together after some conflict, ready to begin the rest of their lives together (which the audience will never see). The Notebook shows us a couple whose love for each other is as strong in their later years as it was when they were young. Although we don't see all their years together portrayed in the film, the visit from Duke's children and the photo montage gave me a good enough glimpse of their lives. In that photo montage, I was sure I saw one actual photo of Gena Rowlands with John Cassavetes (instead of James Garner). Since Gena Rowlands and John Cassavetes were married, and the parents of director Nick Cassavetes, I thought it was touching. Can anyone confirm whether there is such a photo in the montage?"

","I love this movie - that's as simple as I can put it - and I'm usually not into typical love stories with either happy or sad endings - and no in between. But this movie was touching because it puts the spectator into a kind of reality which is far different than the existing reality that we are familiar with. This, for several reasons: the love story at hand is one which would hardly ever take place in real life, it's too perfect and fascinating. Other than that, the way in which events occur and take place is very far-fetched, but not at all in a negative way. Like I said, in the course of watching the movie, the spectators zone out into that imaginary reality, and I guess it's a good way to reach and basically experience these sentiments indirectly. A definite must-see, I think."

","Many movies or TV shows have made me cry because of the absolutely hear breaking scenes within them, but none whatsoever (in my opinion of those movies that i have seen) can even hold a candle to 'The Notebook'. When you realise the circumstances and truth behind why the old gentleman is reading to the old woman it breaks you heart. What we first see is an old man by the name of Duke who comes to the nursing home to read a story about two young lovers to an old lady. <br/><br/>The story of the young lovers Noah & Annie itself is beautiful, passionate, tense and SO emotional and the characters of the young lovers are outstandingly played by Rachael McAdams and Ryan Gosling (who are a couple in real life now after meeting on the set of 'The Notebook' - i feel this makes the whole romance between them so much more believable and intense). It's the classic 'poor worker boy meets rich girl, they fall madly in love but it can't last' story, but is SO much more. It was heartbreaking to watch them have a massive argument because they thought that breaking up would be easier on them both and then realising they loved each other but they couldn't find each other in time before Annie left. <br/><br/>Throughout the story we see Duke reading to the old lady and she tells him she thinks she remembers this story. <br/><br/>Noah (Ryan's character) wrote to Annie (Rachael's character) every day for a year but never received a reply (it turned out that her mother kept all the letters)<br/><br/>(to her mother)""You watched me cry myself to sleep for months and months and you never said anything. How could you do that?""<br/><br/>For me, the moment that was most shocking and began the onslaught of tears that could have filled the Atlantic, was when we found out that Duke was actually Noah and the old lady was Annie. Annie developed senile dementia and doesn't remember Noah or her life with him (or their children), but all the while he reads to her the story of their life hoping that she will remember. <br/><br/>It physically hurt when Annie remembered who she was and says to Noah; Annie: What happened to me? Noah: Nothing. You just went away for a little while. Annie: How much time do we have? Noah: I'm not sure. Last time it was no more than five minutes.<br/><br/>The fact that he knew Annie would come back to him but they only have a matter of minutes till she will forget again was so emotional. The moment when they are dancing and without warning she suddenly asks ""why did you call me Darling? I don't know you"" and becomes panicked, the nurses rush in and Noah breaks down on the bed crying.<br/><br/>The final scene when they are lying in bed together and she remembers who she is... my GOD i was having trouble breathing... it was such a powerful scene and i defy anyone not to cry at that final moment when we see the shot of the birds flying away.<br/><br/>Noah sticks by Annie no matter what, even though she doesn't remember who she is he stays by her side. ""I'll be here. I'll never leave you"" and to me, this is why this story is the most epic love story i have ever seen."

Ryan Gosling is perfectly cast as the handsome, shy young Noha as is Rachael McAdams as the beautiful Alli. James Garner and Gina Rowlands just seem to get better with time. This is a stunningly beautiful film to the eye and a feast as well for the heart and mind. I you like to be moved emotionally watch this film. You will carry the spirit and emotion as a gift long after the last scene. Thank you Mr. Cassavetes."

","This movie is so cute!! I never saw it in theaters, but all of my friends were telling me how sad it was and how i need to rent it. I'm not a huge fan of sad movies, but i decided to give it a shot. I was compelled into it by the first scene!! Rachel McAdams does an amazing job (as usual) and has great chemistry with Ryan Gosling. The movie made me laugh, cry, and want to see it again! The only thing I didn't like about this movie is that I had it figured out early. I like movies that I can't figure out the ends to, and this one was fairly predictable. It's pretty close to the book (I read the book after seeing the movie), but I personally liked the book better, as I usually do. Overall, if you're a sucker for love stories and don't mind sobbing in front of your friends, this is the movie for you. I gave it 9/10 stars."

","This is easy a top 5 of all the films that I've seen. Then of course I'm a sucker for great romance. But in this film everything is perfect, the lines, the scenes, the plot, the characters, (Rachel Mcadams is absolutely astonishing, man she really got a hold of my heart ;D, of course her acting is also very good). I really think you should see this picture, the movie really eats you up in its story and your sitting there routing for Noah that he gets his long lost love as the time is flying away. Its not just a cheesy chick flick, it is just great love at its best!<br/><br/>Mac"
"DanisDayOff","10","0","1","24 September 2006"," You won't just watch this movie, but feel it deeply. It has so much heart.
","I loved The Notebook, because it is one of the very few movies that touches you as deeply as if the story had happened to you. It has so much heart and depth and a funny and realistic portrayal of teenagers in love. The actors are amazing, you can see the genuine love in Ryan Gosling's eyes, and then his dark sadness and emptiness without Ally.<br/><br/>It is so sad that life kept pulling them apart, but you can only marvel at the little difference it makes to their love. Believe me, this is not just a boring, romantic love story... it keeps you interested, smiling and also sad the whole time, and you may find yourself stopping the next day and just thinking about them. That's how real the story feels.<br/><br/>The start is my favourite part, when they are young and Noah tries to get Ally's attention, and then at the start of their relationship. It's such a happy and cute part that you can relate to, and a lighter part of the movie. I encourage everyone to watch it, and with an open mind."

"orittele","10","0","1","23 September 2006"," A love story - but not a cheesy one. AMAZING.
","I've never wrote any review on IMDb, but this movie touched me so much that I had to. Why? It's little hard to explain. On surface, this movie would be one that I'd completely hate: a love story, which - based on my experience with all the crap that I've seen coming from this genre - would have turned out to be a cheesy movie, with stupid dialog and a predictable ending. Also, most of the movie takes place in the 40's and 50's, and the characters are dressed accordingly, which is another thing that I usually find not really flattering or interesting. However, ""The Notebook"" escapes from all the obstacles gracefully. The writing, directing, acting, music et Al are all spot on, and they add up to a wonderful, delightful story that you're being drawn to from the very beginning. It has funny, sweet, painful and dramatic moments. It's a love story read from a notebook by an old man to another woman, and it's told in both the past and the present. At the course of the movie you get to see all the stages of this love story. Words can't really describe - you'll have to watch in order to appreciate it. Very recommended."

","I think a lady friend of mine wanted to rent this a few months ago and I passed on it. Then I saw part of it at a relative's house and the same day rented it and watched it with the same lady friend! I thought the performances were all very natural and believable. Nothing was forced or overly dramatic, and there was a lot of humor. My favorite scene is probably when Allie is a nurse and first meets Lon who is wrapped in a body cast. He asks her for a date and says ""Before you say no, I'll have you know I'm an excellent dancer and my intentions are entirely dishonorable."" Lon is such a likable and confident guy that you can understand why it's a tough choice for Allie ... despite what Noah claims, it really isn't about the money and the security for her. Lon is every bit as great a guy as Noah is, he's just different.<br/><br/>Even though they're very different films, this movie kind of reminded me of ""Murphy's Romance"" (which also featured James Garner). Both movies have a kind of easygoing quality to them while still packing an emotional punch. The Notebook definitely has a more ""epic"" quality to it, though.<br/><br/>Would have rated it a 9 but I did have a little issue with the casting. I didn't think the woman who played Allie in her 80's looked anything like Allie would have looked at that age. She did do a good job though. James Garner didn't really look much like an older Noah either, but, well, he's James Garner.<br/><br/>Other than that, a very good film.<br/><br/>EDIT:<br/><br/>You know, after reviewing the negative comments about the film, I have to admit I can't disagree with many of them. This film really was flawed in a lot of ways, but somehow it still worked. But the more I think about it, the more I want to downgrade my rating. I now think I'd put it at a 6.5."

","Cast, production etc were excellent, it's the story that makes this film though. <br/><br/>I'm a 6'5"", 230lbs, Rugby playing 22 year old male brought up on the Internet and generally as cynical as they come. However I can freely admit I cried at the end of this movie. I can only hope that I some day find a woman I love as much as Noah does Allie in this story.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams is wonderful on screen; a true delight to watch in anything she does but in this film she really shines. James Garner and Gena Rowlands are both exceptional in their roles, limited by screen time but pivotal in their impact. James Marsden produced an adequate performance, though I get the impression that the writers were trying to keep the movie below 3 hours so had to cut some of his part up, you really don't care that much about his character in any way, apart from how he affects the lives of the main two. Ryan Gosling was good; you really want him to get the girl though I suppose that is the minimum for the role he plays in the film. He was better as pre-war Noah than he was as post-war Noah, maybe the beard didn't allow him to express himself as much, maybe it's because the emotions are harder to express, maybe it's because he's playing the part brilliantly by showing an outer shell that appears impervious to emotions. I don't honestly know, you can make a case for all 3 but really it doesn't matter, his performance works.<br/><br/>This film appears to have been overlooked for awards apart from ""Teen Choice"", and that really is a shame. I've certainly seen worse performances win a best actress academy award than Rachel McAdams' in this film. I guess that the year this would have been in for is the 2004 awards and Hilary Swank was very good as Maggie Fitgerald in Million Dollar Baby, but I can guarantee that very few of the also-rans can compare to her performance. The film is also very well directed, the music suits the movie perfectly and the supporting cast isn't half bad. Why this film has received so very little industry recognition baffles me.<br/><br/>In conclusion, watch this movie. It's not a brain turn off movie by any means, so if you're looking for an easy ride it may be better to look elsewhere, but make a concerted effort to watch this movie, as and when you can."

The characters of Noah en Allie are perfectly casted (they are a real-life couple now). Rachel McAdams is a very talented actress, Ryan Gosling I remember from a TV-show called Breaker High. And he sure grew up to be a hottie! So if you like movie settings in the '50, great acting and a good love story, watch the Notebook. I'm hooked on it.

","What does a movie need to be magnificent?What does it need to earn the title ""Greatest love story of all time""? The answer is pure simplicity-a great story.And this is what this movie is all about.The simple,but greatest love story we have ever seen.A story,which captures you from the very beginning and never let's you go.This feeling,which you get,while watching the movie-this is what it makes it the best told story about love and commitment. A lot of people can easily say that the plot of the movie is too simple to be a masterpiece.But does a great thing need to be complicated in order to captivate your mind forever?I think not.And I am sure that a lot of people would agree with me.The simplicity of the story makes it so emotional for everyone,who watches the movie.The fact that a love like that is not impossible,but as easy as it looks it still it is a task,which lies ahead of everyone and it is not a easy one.But once you succeed in it and see the fruit of your everyday care and love-then you will know it was all worth it. What else can I say about this movie?The actors were as great as they could be.They are one of the main reasons why the story gets inside of everyone's hearts.A extraordinary piece of acting by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling,and everyone else from the crew of the movie.Great directing,although we see things we have already seen is other movies,but not presented to us like this.Not with the same excellent love story of Noah and Allie.The story that will always remain in my heart and memory.The greatest love story of all time."

"MeloDee","7","0","1","14 August 2006"," Pretty good for a romance film.
","I'm definitely not an expert on romance movies, because I tend to generally avoid the romance genre- in both films and books. To avoid cheesiness, predictability, ""syrup"" and endless stereotypes I've always found it more tasteful to combine romance with another genre. That way, you avoid a story's unrealistic obsession with the two main characters. That's not to say that I hate the romance genre altogether- there are some exceptions and times when a story seems to be built at least half-realistically and can actually move me.<br/><br/>In this case, although I'd put on my ""skeptic glasses"" I at the same time had a lot more expectation than I usually would because I'd heard so many great things about the film.<br/><br/>At first, when I see Noah, I think ""What's the matter with this guy?"" and was about to write him off as a caricature, but his character made me laugh and with a little hesitation I accepted him as actually being realistic. I related to Allie's reaction to him maybe a little more than most because I would've treated him exactly the same way! Through the beginning of the film they kiss...a lot. Again my skeptical goggles are on, and I'm starting to suspect that this is another cheesy romance based on lust carefully- or perhaps, not so carefully- disguised as love, and patiently wait for the characters to mature. On the other hand, I think, they are teenagers, and just because they're horny doesn't mean they don't know what love is. Additionally, I would expect a bit more than that from the intelligent and sometimes sassy Allie and the bat crazy but pretty down to earth Noah. (No, seriously, he's crazy).<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie continues on. I don't know if I'm particularly enthralled by the plot, but the actor's and actress's performances are flawless as far as I can see. Especially Ryan Gosling's. The way he looked at Rachel McAdams was a perfect combination of awe and longing, and it made us really believe that what we were seeing was real.<br/><br/>Back to the plot: Some of the morals in the story are questionable, but when I say things like that I always battle with question in my mind of whether or not the actions of the characters are always meant to teach us a lesson, or whether or not some of the time they're simply there to display reality. Yes, there are times when Allie could've been more sensible, but really, how many of us haven't been insensible from time to time? As for whether or not true love could've sprang from Allie and Noah's ""summer romance"" is questionable as well. Perhaps even the intervention of Allie's mother in their relationship wasn't as detestable as some might immediately begin to think. I loved this movie in that it didn't take advantage of pathetic stereotypes and create supporting characters just MADE to be hated. It didn't have the ""tunnel vision"" that some romances have, where they almost force you to root for only the two lovebirds by making everyone else a total jerk. Instead everyone had some depth in them, and even though we didn't ""vouch"" for them all the time, we could understand and relate to them.<br/><br/>Either way, sometimes they say ""the end justifies the means"" and the ending of the movie was what really touched me. No, I'm not going to spoil it for you, and no, I didn't shed any tears- I very, very rarely do over movies- but this really made me think somehow.<br/><br/>This wasn't ""the best romance ever made"" for me- or even really close to it- but it was an enjoyable enough film to watch and it had some pretty emotional moments to it. It even had a little comedy in it (though I must warn that I tend to laugh a lot at films). Again, I must repeat, the performances of Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were flawless and actually very amazing, and that was the main enjoyment for me."

"Boba_Fett1138","7","0","1","11 July 2006"," Very professional and well made movie. Cast & crew overcome the movie its clichés.
","""The Notebook"" is better than just your average romantic movie for a couple of reasons.<br/><br/>The first and foremost reason for me was the look of it. It had an obvious high budget (at least for its genre) that was well spent. The did a good job at recreating the '40's, with lots of nice looking sets, cars and costumes. The cinematography was beautiful and made the settings of the movie really come forward into the story.<br/><br/>As for the story itself it wasn't really anything new and was filled with the typical clichés you could expect from a movie about a boy and a girl falling in love, of which one is from the 'upper-class' and the big city and the other of the 'lower-class' and from a small town. Take away the movie its good actors and budget and you'll have your average romantic movie. The story certainly is not strong and thick enough to carry the entire movie on its own. Sure, the movie does have its original moments, especially in its non-linear storytelling but it on its own is not good or powerful enough to make the movie really any interesting.<br/><br/>The cast consists out of some really impressive names, mainly the supporting cast. Actors such as James Garner, Sam Shepard and Joan Allen help to make the movie an extra respectable one and they add a certain bit of extra. Really great in this movie was James Marsden. Lots of people criticize him for his part in the X-Men movies, in which he is quite boring but when you watch him in this movie and others you'll notice that he is actually nothing less than a greatly talented actor. The leading actors Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are obviously not just mainly cast for their acting skills but more because of their 'natural' style and look. Every guy should be able to identify himself with Noah and every girl should be able to identify herself with Allie. They deliver their lines in a very natural way and the help to make the story more believable than it in fact really is.<br/><br/>Still I feel that the romance in this movie is flawed. It never becomes obvious what it is that makes Allie so great and perfect for Noah and vice versa and why their love is so much more special and powerful than anyone else's. It never gets fully obvious or explained in the movie, at least not to my satisfaction.<br/><br/>But for most part the professional cast & crew overcome the movie its clichés and weaknesses, until the ending. The ending was completely unnecessary, over-the-top and just mainly totally unlikely and unbelievable. You can say that it sort of ruined the movie its romantic and powerful feeling for me. I would had seriously rated this movie a 8 out of 10, right until the last couple of minutes. The movie should had ended earlier on and abandoned this crazy, unlikely, over-sentimental ending.<br/><br/>Still I feel that due to its professionalism involved, I'm talking about both cast & crew, this movie is still way better than just another cliché filled romantic 'chick-flick'. Even if you aren't into these sort of movies (like myself), this movie is worth seeing and worth your time. It's beautifully made and really no bore to watch, despite the obvious moments and stereotypical clichés. <br/><br/>See this movie for the whole package, not just the story.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"ejev","9","0","1","8 July 2006"," More than romantic love
","I saw the previews in the theater, realized the twist, and also that neither my husband or daughter would want to go see it. So I finally caught it on cable and was blown away. It's a beautifully constructed story, set in a South that doesn't exist any more, but with enduring themes that aren't dependent on a particular era. The part that really impressed me, aside from the rock-solid performances of James Garner and Gena Rowlands (and the others) is the way her illness is handled, and the way that feisty love plays out to the very end. My mother was not able to communicate verbally after brain bleeds, and for 2 1/2 years I talked, she listened, she nodded, squeezed my hand, and we figured out how to speak to each other. Even so, I don't think she knew who I was, or if I was even there, in the last year of her life. Just as Gena Rowlands came to see the staff as her family and caregivers, my mother did with the staff at her nursing home. But I could feel for James Garner's character, knowing she was there, and might give a flash of recognition. That dedication and love that lasted to the end was what can still call up tears as I think about certain scenes."

Ryan Goslings portrayal of Noah is so moving i was in love with him by the end of the movie. this film is perfection personified. please watch it! you are also not short on eye candy with Ryan and the gorgeous James Marsden. hmmm. i now order you to watch it!go! if i could id give it 100 out of 10!"
"snehum143","10","0","1","7 July 2006"," The Notebook left me speechless
","I bought the DVD of The Notebook today, since it was on sale at the mall. I was persuaded to do so by friends since it was characterized as the ""best movie ever."" I therefore decided to take a chance. After watching it, I am happy to say I was not disappointed. This movie was the ultimate love story. It was not a mushy piece of crap like some other love stories that have no chemistry, emotions, plot, and so on. I was so moved by the movie, and even caught myself falling for Noah. His character has a love for Ally that all girls dream about having. It was pure and real. There was more to it than physical attraction, there was true emotional depth. This depth was portrayed to viewers throughout the movie. I even wanted to ring Ally's mother by the neck a couple of times, because I was so into it. The acting was phenomenal and the story itself was wonderfully captivating. This is definitely not a movie I will be leaving on the shelf to collect dust!! If you feel like renting a movie, I highly recommend this one... or you could take a chance and buy the DVD like I did. If for some odd reason, you actually dislike it, there are a hundred of your female friends who would love this movie as a gift. Trust me! Most likely though, you will love it!"

","I am going to say right off the bat that I am not big on chick flicks, but I watched the movie as an outside observer and not just as someone thinking, 'It's a romance; it's bound to be good.' And I did get caught up in the tricky love triangle, though I didn't cry once. I guess I found her decision a bit predictable, the way it was filmed. We got to see a relationship grow between her and Noah, and suddenly she was with someone else, a stranger, and it felt wrong for the audience.<br/><br/>There were times when Ryan Gosling, especially with his scruffy goatee, reminded me of Dominic Monaghan from abc's hit show Lost, and anyone who knows whom I'm describing can see where I stand when I say Monaghan is probably not first pick of romantic leading man. Not to impugn Gosling, as he did a brilliant performance in this film, but I guess I was just a little turned off.<br/><br/>I couldn't help but think, ""She's going to end up with the poor guy."" I mean, who wouldn't pick love over money? Okay, aside from the mother in the movie? And then, (*gasp!*) there she was, hitting the sheets with him. Quelle surprise! I just thought it was a lot like the Titanic romance.<br/><br/>The best scene was when the two of them were lying out in the street. It's been said that love is stronger if you hated the person first, and I can't explain why, but this fact has been proved, and this movie shows it-how her jaded disgust for this man soon morphed into unfailing love. The Notebook, though its plot has been used before, is a lovely flick."

It was beautiful and amazing. I will watch it over and over again. I actually got the movie for my birthday in March and never watched it. Its still in the wrapper. But I caught it on TV tonight and I will most definitely be opening it and watching it A lot. I know that its a movie and I don't believe that people love like that anymore, but it feels good to see it on a movie.

"matt-2061","10","0","1","1 July 2006"," I was caught off-guard!!
","Let me begin by saying that I'm a 38 year old man that NEVER intentionally watches romantic movies. It's just not my thing usually. I happened to catch the last half of ""The Notebook"" one day while flipping channels late-night. I checked the listings on my digital cable and found that the flick was going to be shown again the next day.<br/><br/>I watched the whole thing. I actually taped it and have since watched it 5 more times!! Well, Let me tell you, it is the most intense, passionate and realistic romance movie you can imagine! It reminded me, simultaneously, of my High school girlfriend AND my wife. It was (and IS) a VERY personal movie to me. The intense feelings that Noah and Ally share, and the problems that confront them are very familiar to me. I'm sure that they are familiar to millions of people.<br/><br/>It is a VERY realistic movie as far as the relationship between Noah and Ally. Their relationship is NOT perfect. They fight often (just like real life!) and there is serious doubt about whether or not they will be, or SHOULD BE, together.<br/><br/>The performances by Rachel McAdams and Ryan Goesling, Gena Rowlands and the guy who played Jim Rockford on ""The Rockford Files"" (who's name escapes me, SORRY!), are excellent. The visuals are Phenomenal, especially the ""Duck"" scene. The movie as a whole is FAR better than most.<br/><br/>I HIGHLY recommend this film. In fact, I'll offer the following advice: WATCH THIS MOVIE!! If it doesn't Immediately remind you of someone from your past or present, you probably haven't loved!! And if you KNOW you haven't loved, then watch this film to get an idea about what love is. Seriously."

The way the Nicholas Sparks (the author)used his words, you could almost feel their love. But nothing beats the movie. It was casted and played perfectly. You can see the love between Noah and Allie. It takes you through the ups and downs, the good the bad, and everything that goes on with two people who are truly in love. The love the have is the type of love people dream about. The head-over-heals-can't-spend-a-minute-away-from-each other love. This movie makes you want to fall in love, and spend your life with your one true soul mate."

","Everyone seems to like this movie-- I don't get it.<br/><br/>I could go into detail about how predictable, and pathetically sappy this film is.. I won't, nobody seems to agree anyways.<br/><br/>I will say this though, The Notebook is the quintessential romantic comedy of the 21st century. Let's see, first of all, the plot leaves nothing to the imagination. Rich girl, poor guy drawn apart because of meddling parents and a burgeoning class system? Where have we seen this before? It's EVERYWHERE, (including the mother of all bad movies, Titanic). <br/><br/>And the plot turns. Like oh my GOD, first Duke is some random man reading a book.. then he's NOAH.. then Allie has some sort of bizarre, (totally Hollywood) memory problem.. (Oh gee!) Then Noah has some sort of health problem that is killing him... yadda yadda yadda, ""our love is strong enough to create miracles,"" pardon me while I throw up in my mouth a bit.<br/><br/>Why is this the quintessential movie of 2004? It requires no intellect or artistic merit to enjoy this film. You are given a very overdone story line (with a few extra punchy twists and of course, different names) and nothing but extra cheese.<br/><br/>Reading the past few movie reviews for this film have made me lose faith in the human race. Thanks."
"theshadow908","6","0","1","25 June 2006"," One of the better chick flicks.
","The Notebook tells the same old girly movie story. A poor boy falls in love with a rich girl, who doesn't really like him at first, but they develop a relationship and become inseparable. When she has to go off to school and he goes off to war, they lose touch, and she ends up engaged to another man. After reading about her first love in the newspaper, she goes to see him, wondering how he's doing. They discover that there's still something there, and they fall in love all over again. This is just another chick flick, but it is one of the better ones.<br/><br/>The problem I have with chick flicks is that they're always so depressing. One of the main characters is always dying, or ill in some way. Something always ends up going wrong in the end, and it's done purposely to make teenage girls cry. This movie is different. There's no terminally ill characters, and the main characters end up happy. However, this movie does have the same old formula of rich girl/poor boy. That's a story I'm starting to get really tired of.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. I had no complaints about how cheesy the acting was, which is also new for me. As a guy, I only watched this movie because Rachel McAdams is hot, but she did do a really good job.<br/><br/>Overall, it's still got its corny moments, but it's the best chick flick there is.<br/><br/>6.5/10"

Romance your loved one with this movie, especially after you both have overcome your next obstacle.<br/><br/>True lovers will find connecting and relate-able points of fulfillment or hope - perhaps both - in this classic.<br/><br/>The official website for this movie makes for a worthwhile bookmark."

This movie deals with death in a sensitive way that we all need to see. Let's admit it we are all scared a little bit of it, but after watching this, it helped a lot. I think it wasn't exactly because they found true love, but rather they were true to themselves. How many people can actually say that about their life? Not many, I sure hope I can when I am older.

","Basically all romantic films I've seen have been annoying because it didn't seem realistic and there wasn't the magic in the air that I always hope for. This film was all about the magic of romance that hasn't been created in movies.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams were fantastic in this movie, the chemistry was believable, and a good plot line lay beneath it all. I had seen a music video by Nickelback called Far Away for The Notebook. I watched it and it made me want to see it so badly. Unfortunately I looked up internet spoilers on the internet, and saw how it ended. was dreading the ending because it was sweet, romantic, and overall sad. There is also humor in parts of it too.

Would have been nice to see how they progressed in life and to see how the wife contracted her illness. Awesome movie otherwise and a tearjerker x10. Goes to show you how real love should be between 2 people. Maybe if there were a lot of couples like that, the world would indeed be a better place for us all.

"shockzey","9","0","1","17 June 2006"," a real take on love
","Totally enjoyed this one! a love drama(with good humor)that deals with falling in love and relationships in a totally realistic sense(according to me) i enjoyed watching the passion and interaction between Noah and Allie. They fought,they kissed, they played,they yelled at each other(screamed sometimes) ,there even the one scene where he says ""..i'm not afraid to hurt your feelings"".they were real with each other.And they enjoyed it.They knew it wasn't going to be all Rosy and easy all the time and they were going to have to work on it everyday-but they wanted each other.They truly liked each other and challenged each other(in my opinion).<br/><br/>I also like the fact that the other guy wasn't made a ""bad guy""(as is common in movies) just so her choice would be sooo obvious to the...world. She had to choose based on what SHE knew and wanted.I liked that.<br/><br/>They were not perfect, but seemed perfect for each other(clichÃ©,but truth)and being able to watch a love story in comfort of its realis-ticness is a treat and relief.<br/><br/>I also like the first 'love- scene' earlier on in the film. Now that was good dialog.Truth.<br/><br/>My vote is off by 1 point because of my inability to believe that an elderly man would do that for his wife. That was a bit too fantasy/fairy tale like...or to put it more diplomatically-RARE.I don't think a person can or should be your absolute EVERYTHING to that point.<br/><br/>In this movie buff's opinion- its a simple and nice love drama to watch on a rainy afternoon(or not) with pizza and a blanket and someone you can debate with afterward."

","The Notebook is not only one of the best portrayals of love I have ever seen on screen, it is also one of the best films of any kind that has been created. The whole movie holds you in captivity and suspense, watching time move forward in another's life while wondering where it all meets up to in the end. Each actor/actress IS the character, and the film is directed and filmed perfectly. As things begin to reveal themselves, you feel the frustrations of the characters while at the same time admiring their courage and strength, and you hope beyond hope that things play out 'properly'. I can say that a more perfect ending could not have been scripted for this film. I absolutely recommend it!"

Rachel McAdams is one of the best newer actresses and has really proved herself in this film. Her chemistry with Ryan Gossling is fantastically realistic. I love a storyline that can make me cry.

And what makes it so good also is the main characters, Rachel Mcadams and Ryan Gosling. They could not have picked anyone better then these two people. First of all I'm tired of seeing the same actors playing all kinds of different roles, then it dosen't seem as real, especially when they have more then one movie out at a time. Rachel and Ryan have such good chemistry in this movie that I hoped that they would be together in real life. And when I found out that they were, I was so happy.

It is based on the love an old couple still endures for one another, with four wonderful actors portraying it. Gena Rowlands and James Garner(in their older years), and Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gostling portraying the younger version of Allie and Noah. With all the trials they had to go through to be together, they surpassed it. This movie has really inspired me to find love as they did.

Another think that was really important in the beauty of this movie is the fact that the action takes part in 1940, when the people were different in many ways....but good ones. In that time, the love stories between people were more powerfully, romantics....in our days is more hard to find a person like Noah or Allie.....that's the amazing think in this story:their sincerity and their kind of love.... i'll never see a movie like this never and i want to graduate all the team that realized the movie especially the actors....you rock!!"

"ggrodzinsky","8","0","1","30 April 2006"," Decent Tender Movie
","I have seen several movies with similar plot elements in the love story, the old house rebuilt by a poor man for his beautiful love interest (including It's a Wonderful Life which includes a beautiful love story), poor vs. rich, forbidden love, even some of the lines. However, what wins me over in this movie are the tender moments between the characters, both when they are old and when they are young. The love scenes and the female character's nerves in the first one and the respect and support of the male character are tasteful, and tender as I have ever seen and foreshadows the support he gives her in his advanced years. The whole courting starting from the dance in the street to ""I love you's"" is very sweet. The only weakness I saw in the courting was a fiddle dancing scene at Noah's home that I thought just looked silly and unnecessarily stereotypical of the south. In contrast, painstaking efforts were made to make this period piece an accurate representation of the times and it reaped dividends. I agree with the goof section that South Carolina is very hot and humid in the summer and seeing your breath even in the middle of the night is not common unless it is foggy. It implies that it is cold and it is rare for temperatures to go below 65 degrees at night. The other aspect of this movie is how they deal with dementia and Alzheimer's, a disease that I dread ever getting. How does one deal with a love one who cannot remember you or may never again return the love that you have given? This is even more compounded by the fact that in this case the love is as intense as one can imagine, where the emotional honesty of the couple is healthy and where they constantly feed off of each others emotions, feelings and opinions. You are losing your partner in life, the other half of your soul, the person you can open your heart to every day, what do you do? The dedication by Noah to his deteriorating wife even with his own health problems and the strength of their love is what touched me the most. This type of problem affect millions of couples in the US alone and the tenderness and the brief ""returns"" of Allie brought tears to my eyes. The last scene seemed a stretch, but illustrates what couples with intense relationships do when one can not be with the other. When one dies, the others dies shortly thereafter. As for relating to the characters, I cannot personally directly unlike other critics, but I have parents, and other people of my parent's time who had to deal with issues such as these. One was a couple where one married another in forbidden love because they were from conflicting cultures, and their love was clear and intense, then one got MS, the other got cancer. In their case the woman with MS had to take care of her critically ill husband. When he died she got the same cancer and died a year later! My folks said it was love at first sight.<br/><br/>They did a great job. I give it an 8 out of 10 only because of the minor criticisms I had that got to my pet peeves.<br/><br/>Acting comments: I got to see the Rachel McAdams interview for the part of Allie with Ryan Gosling reading the lines. Pretty amazing how she could get in character with no set, no direction. So much so that she was crying for real after she was done. That's talent."

I'm glad to see that is a recent movie, because it has been a while since we weren't spoiled with a great love story. Allie and Noah make you turn back in time, when we used to treasure much more devotion, and pure feelings. Even if it is a romantic movie still keeps you in suspense, specially when Allie makes the choice between the two men in her life, her first love, Noah, an impossible love, from her parent's point of view, and the ""perfect"" husband for her, the one she almost got married with. The choice changes her life for good, but with no regrets. Really a great movie. Perfect to see it every time when you doubt that love can be the most beautiful thing in this world..."

I loved watching Noah and Allie when they were young, not so much when they were old. But this movie shows the power that love has on people. It made me smile too see Allie and Noah love each other so much, and just be in the moment with each other. The real test for them is with Allie's disapproving family and once they get separated by WWII. But something brings them back together, always. The few complaints about the movie I had were like I feel they could of shown more of their lives while they were separated. They only show Noah in WWII for like 2 minutes. Also I just thought the scenes with Noah and Allie as older people just slowed down the film, and tryed to be too lovey dovey.

More of course with the family of the patient but - my job was giving families respite from the sufferers and I saw a lot of the confusion that comes with the disease. The patients had forgotten the recent part of their lives first, so the children were the first to be forgotten. Then the spouses etc. The patients would look at photos and ask me who these people were and wonder where their parents were etc....... heart-wrenching to watch. Not only was this portrayed well in the film - the couples 'story"" itself was great. Acting was wonderful as was the cinematographer. Lastly - how DID they get those ducks to stay put?!"
"PeachHamBeach","10","0","2","14 April 2006"," Wow, I was surprised!!!
","Back when THE NOTEBOOK was just a book written by author Nicholas Sparks (I almost always get him confused with Nicholas Evans)I heard critics saying things. They weren't really mean. They weren't even snarky. They were kind of playfully saying that Sparks and his work were ""unabashedly sentimental"". I tuned into the movie starring Ryan Gosling, Rachel McAdams, James Garner and Gena Rowlands last night, expecting a mediocre, and very sentimental romantic drama full of hearts and flowers and moosh.<br/><br/>Boy I was surprised at how much I enjoyed this film!!! It was very romantic, full of sentiment and sweetness, but it wasn't full of fake mooshy slobbery sentiment. It felt real. Even the end, which I won't reveal, in all its heavy emotion and absolution, felt real, not overly sentimental. I'm certain some felt it was trying to paint a picture of flawless, perfect love, but in fact, their love and relationship was flawed and in need of nurturing just like anyone elses'.<br/><br/>The performances of Gosling and McAdams as the young 1940s couple were terrific, but the heart and soul of the film are Garner and Rowlands as a present day pair of friends in a nursing home for people with Altzheimers. All the heartbreak of this affliction and how it destroys memories was compelling. The real meaning of love and commitment in married life and how you stay with your mate through good times and horrible times was beautifully realized here, as one party reads to another from a sacred story notebook in hopes of resurrecting precious memories, even if the disease snatches them back over and over.<br/><br/>I plan to read the book soon. Sometimes sentimentality is good."
"Sunnygirl10139","10","0","1","12 April 2006"," The Notebook, A Classic
","The only reason why didn't like it was because they focused more on the past of their relationship rather than in the book (which was excellent) I didn't like how they both died in the end, but it was still romantic in a sense. I really liked it because Rachel and Ryan are so cute together!!! OK I feel the Notebook the movie is going to be a classic. It will go down in history just like Casabalanca. The ultimate love story! I read the book as well. I believe that there both equally good. There both good in there own sense. Tuck everlasting is also a great movie and another recommendation if you loved the Notebook. This is all i have to say. <br/><br/>KIKI MCGEE"

I saved this on TiVo so it's there when I want to watch it, and when I find it on DVD I am going to buy it. The young new actor who plays NOAH is the best new player I've seen in a long time. The setting was beautiful and the cinematography is excellent. The story along with the great music leaves you wondering where your 2 hours went. It a 'four hankie' movie!

"sparkling_diamond_88","10","0","1","28 March 2006"," Amazing film!!
","I absolutely loved The Notebook. It is possibly the best love story I have ever seen!! I think a great film is one that makes you think about it after you have finished watching it, one that you can watch many times and never find boring and one where you wish you were in the film or that your life was like that! And I think The Notebook has all these great features. The chemistry between Noah (Ryan Gosling) and Allie (Rachel McAdams) is amazing. I still find myself crying when it has finished and i've now watched it about ten times!! No other film has yet done that to me! Each scene is done fantastically and when it has finished you just want to start it all over again. If you haven't already watched this film, then believe me you are missing out! Watch it!"

","I have never cried at a film until now. I sat up and watched this film. I found myself in Allie and how she handled everything. I watched this film at 12 at night and I must have cried at 50% of this film it touched me so much. I even bought my mother it for mothers day and she sat and cried. I have watched this film 100s of times and I still cant stop crying.<br/><br/>Rachel did so well in this film. Its a different role from her mean girl character and this role suites her a lot better then her mean girls role.<br/><br/>I have nothing but praise for the writes and actors and everyone who was involved in this film. It truly touched everyone. I know someone who saw it in the cinemas and even grown men where in tears. I would like to see more movies like this in the future.<br/><br/>Keep up the good work."
"cwrdlylyn","7","0","1","23 March 2006"," THE NOTEBOOK: Above-Average Romantic Drama, But It Becomes Trite When It Tries Too Hard...
","THE NOTEBOOK <br/><br/>Normally I avoid any movie that is overly romantic or seems especially geared towards females... no offense to those that enjoy them but for me they usually come off as annoyingly trite. However, the hoopla that revolved around THE NOTEBOOK made me curious to see what all the buzz, hype, and admiration was about.<br/><br/>THE NOTEBOOK tells the love story of Allie and Noah... two people from opposite sides of the tracks who fall deeply in love over one summer. The story is bookended with older versions of the characters, played by James Garner and Gena Rowlands, sharing the story of their love... however, in her old age Allie has lost her memory. Noah, known as Duke when he's older, tells her their love story every day in the hopes of bringing the love of his life back to him. The idea of bookending the film with the older versions of the characters gives the film a unique approach... but in the end, for me, it just got in the way of what is a truly great love story.<br/><br/>THE NOTEBOOK is only truly alive when it focuses on the story of their young love, played wonderfully by Ryan Gosling and the always magnetic Rachel McAdams. Though their courtship and trials are often clichéd, the romantics are elevated by the wonderful performances of these great actors. The scene in which they first fall in love walking down the streets after seeing a movie is truly wonderful.<br/><br/>Romantics work best for me when they are played in a very honest, and believable way. As soon as contrivances and over-sentimentality creeps into the picture I become disinterested or overwhelmed. The story of their young love is grand and perhaps not completely realistic... but the performances are so honest that it manages to keep the film grounded.<br/><br/>Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling have a dynamic chemistry together whether they are fighting, playing, joking around, or making love. Every emotion and every up-and-down of their relationship is beautifully realized. McAdams continues to impress me (has anyone seen anything besides a great, engaging performance come from her... cuz I haven't) and Gosling was great as the male lead (it helps that he's not traditionally good looking or overtly ""charming"" and ""suave""). The supporting work from Joan Allen is very strong as well as Allie's overprotective, oppressive mother. Her scene with Allie in the car at the end is wonderfully played.<br/><br/>However, despite valiant efforts from the great Gena Rowlands and James Garner... the bookends ultimately cap off the picture on a bad note. I won't give away the full ending, but something about it was just wrong. The editing and cuts in one scene especially felt incredibly awkward and out of place. And the whole situation in the end really felt far too contrived and emotionally manipulative for the audience.<br/><br/>I'm someone who shuts down emotionally as soon as a film feels like it's trying to make me cry as opposed to just letting me go along on a genuine emotional ride. This is what ultimately hurts the movie. The manipulative aspect of the bookended structure.<br/><br/>Still, the film is better then your average romantic drama. It has enough genuine moments to give the film some merit (all provided in the flashback portions, which thankfully make up most of the film). I can appreciate the heights that THE NOTEBOOK aspired to reach, and it truly does in some moments. But Nick Cassavettes, the film's director, should be carefully of reaching too far... b/c he makes that mistake a few times in this good, but not perfect film.<br/><br/>... B- ..."
"PernillaP","10","0","1","21 March 2006"," a good story, well told
","The Notebook seemed like a boring movie when I read the summary on the back of it, but after seeing it I must admit that the summary was the best lie ever told. The Notebook is a beautiful story of love and hope through the ages, and the contents of it peels of in different beautifully told layers until you understand the core of it, and then it turns so sad, so gruesome and so hopeless and spite of all this sadness the true story stands stronger and more powerful than before.<br/><br/>The movie begins at a home for the elderly where an old man reads from a notebook to an old woman at the home. It's in present day, South Carolina and as the man tells the story we're taken back to the 40's in a fictional town of Seabrook where Noah meets Allie at a fair and he falls head over heels for her. They begin a journey of love and differences that ends quite abruptly at summer's end, but still lasts for years. The setting tells nothing of the political issues in the 40's US south but it's not supposed to either, I think. It's a story of love between two people from two very different backgrounds. The photography is amazing and the detail of the time and place is astounding, you do feel like you've been tossed 60 years back in time, but the real deal is the chemistry between Noah and Allie - that's what makes this move tick and is enhanced by James Garner's and Gena Rowlands's performances.<br/><br/>Beautiful story, beautiful setting and extremely much worth seeing - over and over again. It makes an even greater impact the second time around when you have all the answers and new realizations appear.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: . . . . When you watch the movie you realize after a while that the old man, Mr Calhoun really is Noah and the woman he's reading to is Allie who suffers from Alzheimers disease. That alone is heartbreaking. He has loved her all his life and is now retelling the story of themselves and she doesn't recognize it, she doesn't even recognize her own family that comes to visit them. The final blow that really tore through my heart is the realization that SHE wrote the notebook for Noah to read to her so that she might remember something Their story takes place in the run down mansion that Noah vowed to rebuild for Allie, as well. The movie makes me hope that there are men out there like Noah, with uncanny patience and perseverance to love another no matter what the circumstances. Another fine symbol is the birds in the movie. It begins with birds flying towards the house, they come back when Allie wants to be a bird in her next life to which Noah replies ""If you're a bird, I'm a bird."". He remembers this and later - when they meet again after seven years - takes her to a magical place to where swans and ducks come. Allie asks if the ducks stay there and Noah says no, they go back to where they came from - a semi-harsh analogy to Allie when she left that summer, long ago. Finally the birds return as the credits start to roll when we leave the mansion and a flock of geese take flight across the waters and reminds us of Allie's wish to become a bird in her next life."

","This movie is so amazing. I love it=) Rachel McAdams and Ryan Gosling are so cute together and they play their characters so well. I definitely suggest you see this movie if you haven't already done so. This movie shows how true love can last even through separation and it's just so cute that they die together. This movie is definitely a tearjerker and it is so well thought out. I can't wait to see more of these two in their upcoming movies. My favorite seen was with the birds though, it was so pretty. Anyone know where this movie took place? I think it was in South Carolina, but I could be wrong. Anyways, I hope you enjoyed the movie or if you haven't seen it yet you go out right now and rent/buy it!"

","Films seldom make me cry, but this one sure did.<br/><br/>This has to be one of the most beautiful love stories I have ever seen on film.<br/><br/>The photography is also quite beautiful with the lakes and the moonlight on the water and the birds flying.<br/><br/>I wish men really did love women this much, but I've never seen any evidence that they do. Nonetheless the characters, and their story grabbed me from the start.<br/><br/>The film opens with an older man, James Garner, reading a story to an older woman, the still beautiful, Gena Rowlands, at a nursing home.<br/><br/>We then move back into the 1940's and meet Noah and Allie, the young couple in the story, who first encounter one another at a carnival. Noah is instantly and completely smitten with Allie, but she takes a bit more convincing regarding him.<br/><br/>Eventually, however, they are both wildly in love with one another - but there are complications. Allie comes from upper crust people, Noah does not.<br/><br/>It seems they are destined to be parted. Allie meets another wonderful young man, Lon, while she does some nursing during WWII, while Noah loses himself in the renovation of a beautiful, old, ruined plantation house. I fell in love with that house almost as much as I did with the characters and the story.<br/><br/>Will they cross one another's paths again, and what might be the consequences if they do? The answer to this plays out in a highly interesting way and ties in with the two older people we meet at the beginning of the film, in an unexpected and heartbreaking way.<br/><br/>Allie is fetchingly played by the very pretty Rachel McAdams, and Noah is portrayed quite sensitively by Ryan Gosling. Ryan Gosling, whom I had never seen before, as far as I know, reminded me quite a lot of Adrian Brody - another fine actor who is excellent at playing sensitive types.<br/><br/>This is an exceptional film of depth and beauty.<br/><br/>10 stars out of 10 stars."
"simon_neilson","10","0","1","14 March 2006"," A truly engaging film........
","Having heard recommendations from people to see this film I eventually got the chance to last night. Having had high expectations and being a fan of McAdams, I was initially fearing the worst when the film opened and everything seemed quite disjointed. The plot pacing seemed erratic and nursing home set up seemed quite clichéd. It was only after half an hour though that i suddenly was completely sucked in to the film and forgot all about my initial thoughts.<br/><br/>The performances from both leads were so experienced and believable that you can really see them having very bright futures. The plot was quick and involving even if the movie was ridden with clichés. But at the end of the day, it was a story within a story and what is more clichéd than the trials of love.<br/><br/>I found that the flashbacks were more engrossing than the present day scenes but both sets of actors really made this film for me.<br/><br/>Its a film definitely not for cynics but anyone who is a romantic at heart will love this film for what it set out to be."

","Is a history about how the love should be...i even understand Allie's parents concerns the drama and the sweetness, the hope and above all things the love... A love that survive time and distance, the performances are completely convincing and vivid. Rachel mac Adams fit perfectly in Allie's role and Noah i just fall in love with him...Geena Rowlands and James Garner simply terrific.Is a lovely History about endless,naive and pure love in a complex prewar American society in a state of the south that not allows the circumstances of this two such different people; wealthy Allie and humble Noah, although he's a good boy and their love is real, but too young. Their feelings stay intact in spite of the distance, the time, the lost ones, a horrible war until they find each other together and in love like before, like always in the same spot where they fell in love when they were young, looked for answers that they already knew. In the end Noah is just there for Allie to love her and support her until the end."

","At first when I heard of the Notebook I said that it was just going to be a waste of money to go and see. It didn't seem like a kind of movie that I would watch since I'm more into the comedy and drama (yes the notebook is a drama but i didn't think it was back then I thought it was just a tear jerker) so i decided not to see it. More & more people at my school started talking about it and saying how awesome it was and how sad and how sweet, etc. I now wanted to see what the whole deal was, but I always forgot to pick it up at the movie store when I went. Then one day it was on TV and I was on a trip with my parents to New Zealand so we all watched it. This is now one of my favorite movies. It's so moving and sweet and although a little exaggerated at some parts, really real. It could actually happen and thats what makes it such a great movie. Noah's love for Allie was amazing like he would do anything for her. I think it's very sweet and if you haven't seen it then go out and rent it!"

They don't see each other for several years, and then they finally reunite where Allie has to choose he first and true love or her fiancé.<br/><br/>I had no interest in The Notebook when it first came out.

I saw her in ""Mean Girls"" and then ""Red Eye"", now after seeing her in this, I know she can act. She's pretty hot and I know she'll be doing more movies.

","I didn't see this film until a friend lent it to me, and its one of the most heart warming films I've seen in a long time. All the acting in it was fantastic and although on its own the music may not mean much, when put together with the film it made it even more emotional. Rachel McAdams was great and you could appreciate the difficulties she went through with her parents and true love, but in my opinion Ryan Gosling was amazing, and you could really feel the pain and love he felt for Rachels character Allie. The overall flow of the film was good too, with the balance between the story teller (James Garner) and the actual story being just right. After only seeing it the once though, I'd put it in the top 10 of my favourite movies..anyone who's ever been in love will definitely feel the emotion in this film.

","When i first heard of this movie i thought oh great another of those boring romantic movies where the two people fall in love but this is more than that. This is taken in 1940 where two young teens fall in love but then separate cause Allie is going to New York to go to school. Then seven years has passed and Allie has a new boyfriend well is engaged. Allie goes back home to find her first love and fall in love with him all over again. I especially like the lake sequence with the ducks. Overall they ended up but in a good way cause it kept you thinking who will she stay with Noah or Lon. It is also a good film cause Duke's (Noah) love Allie can't remember anything and he has to read her the book of there lives so she can come back to him. Overall i give it a 10/10.

Young love progressing over a period of time but yet being told by one of the loves is an old thing in movies. It it what the actors/characters do to the art that brings it much more life. How we all wish for a love that grows into forever and beyond. Too bad it took me so long to see it but am I ever glad I did. Keep the tissues nearby because it's a tear jerker for sure. I definitely want to own this movie because it is a collector's item that reminds me of how much more beautiful life there is out there that I have yet to experience."

","I hate mushy chick flick movies, I absolutely LOATHE them. The Notebook is the ultra rare exception. I LOVED THIS MOVIE, this is even more strange since I read the book before seeing the movie and I actually preferred the movie (which has never happened before!).<br/><br/>There are no falling in love clichés in the movie which gives the movie a fresh feel.<br/><br/>The chemistry between the Ryan Gosling (Noah) and Rachel McAdams (Allie) is absolutely incredible. SO incredible that I can literally watch the movie three times in a row and can still get caught up in the emotions of the movie every time!! Everyone needs to see this movie!!!"

","Since I don't have many girlfriends I never saw The Notebook in theaters, and it's probably now my biggest regret. I watched it on Monday this week, then again on Tuesday and Thursday and I'm ready for one more round tonight. I've never seen a movie like this before. I love old fashioned settings and I really believe that the 50's is such a perfect era for love stories, just because they were so creative back then. From the start where he's on the Ferris Wheel to when they go on the road to the house experience, it's all just so interesting. Makes me quite jealous that I never experienced that era. I thought it was a traditional love story but the plot was much more interesting and not so cliché. Too bad we all don't have a Noah. And it's also great since Ryan and Rachel are both from Ontario!! woo <3 This is better than Garden State... which says a lot!"
"menabar89","9","0","1","8 January 2006"," A great Movie!
","This movie was the best romantic movie I have seen. It was one of those movies that made you feel like you were in love. It had a great story plot to it and it made you laugh and cry at the same time. It makes you believe in faith and destiny. MY favorite thing about the movie was that it was just so cute it made my heart melt. It will definitely make your heart melt and swoop you off your feet I absolutely fell in love with the characters as well. Rachel McAdams is one of my favorite actresses and she was so good in this movie. She really portrayed her role extremely well. The acting was good as well as the story plot. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good feeling."

","Yes, I'm a guy and I watched it. I didn't see this movie when it came out for obvious reasons (being a chick flick and all) but was flipping through the channels tonight and decided to watch it. I'm more of a horror movie fan, action films, that sort of thing but I have to say, this movie was excellent. The story itself was simply a great story. There are very few movies these days that have an actual decent story-line as well as decent acting and well, the Notebook had both. It felt as if the movie was only a half-hour long. One viewer was right on when they said ""you feel as if you are in it yourself."" I respect everyone's opinion, yet, I find it very hard to believe how someone could not like this movie. 9 out of 10. (Hmmm...maybe I'm more sensitive than the average dude.)"
"reddyv03","10","0","1","7 January 2006"," Powerful, Grabbing...a wonderful experience.
","I'm not ordinarily one to watch romances, but i was drawn to the movie by my obsession with Rachel McAdams. However, the movie ended up being much more than a pretty face. The storyline is based on a brilliant NY Times bestseller, and the screen adaption is as good as one could hope for. The movie grabbed me, and made me feel like part of the story. However, what really separated this from other romances, is that it was a story WITHIN a story. The viewer is treated to two spectacular stories, side by side, each of which is necessary for the powerful effect that the movie creates. Story WITHIN the story occupies the bulk of the movie, and is wonderful in and of its self. But the OTHER story was what moved me to tears.<br/><br/>I'll be hard pressed to find a romance that can match this anytime soon."
"hoisum","10","0","1","4 January 2006"," the notebook epitomises the term beautiful!
","Everything about The Notebook is beautiful! The actors, the music, the scenery,the story...You go through quite a few emotional states when watching it. I think the strongest part to the movie is the acting, all the actors have feeling and flair and Ryan and Rachel do a good job in portraying this lovely intimacy. It has been a long time since I have found a movie, which makes me want to watch it again and again. Sometimes the characters remind me a bit of Romeo and Juliet...when you really want two people to be together and it is so sweet and so lovely that you feel extra charitable to annoying siblings after watching it... I do recommend anyone to watch The Notebook because it is heart-warming and should not be missed"

"Artpix","8","0","1","21 October 2005"," One of the most enjoyable films I've seen in years.
","I was bored and went to rent some movies. So I rented Five Easy Pieces and The Notebook, both of which I had not seen. The strange thing is, that in both films, the lovers played the Chopin Prelude for Piano for their loved ones. How often does this happen, thats why I mentioned the Five Easy Pieces.<br/><br/>The story was wonderful, no-one can forget their first love, no matter who you are with, and no matter how much time has passed. The film was wonderfully directed, acted, and photographed. The directors commentary was a real eye opener, and very informative, and very humble, what a joy it must be to work with him.<br/><br/>A must see. Nice work for everyone involved"
"dionne-8","10","0","1","26 August 2005"," The Notebook was an all time favorite
","I give ""The Notebook"" a 10 on a scale of 1 to 10. The story is very touching and inspiring to single people who have not found their true love. This movie reminds people of how love should be treated and how wonderful it can be if you work hard for the one you love. The best part of the movie is the scene when Noah and Allie are in the boat together for the first time after parting for 7 years and it starts to rain. They take the boat to the pier and Allie starts talking about why Noah had not written her over the past 7 years. Noah lets her know that he wrote her 365 letters (One for every day for a year). Allie tells Noah that it wasn't over for her and then Noah has the ultimate come back saying... It wasn't over and it still isn't over!!! When he grabs her to kiss her after saying those words is UNFORGETTABLE! Rachel and Ryan would make the best couple in real life. They look as though they have natural chemistry. I think that's why people can feel the love expressed in the movie. There is not another couple that can make you believe their character's role like they do."

I wish I could have a guy like the one in that movie! well its a real classic and I LOVED IT!! :]"
"latondre1","6","0","1","27 March 2005"," Corny!
","This movie is extremely corny. If scenes like the son on the porch reading poetry to his father as his new girlfriend walks up, sound appealing to you, then you will like this movie. There really isn't anything fresh in this story. The two main actors are rather mediocre. The mediocre acting makes it more difficult to immerse yourself in the story. The main male actor has modern looking longer hair during scenes from the 1930's and 1940's, even while serving in the military. These things can be minor compared to the flaws in logic in the storyline. I found the movie to be more of a comedy due to the corniness and weak plot."

","*Spoilers* Before people pre judge my review because of my ""Name"", let me just say that I wanted to like this movie. I have the capacity and appreciation to like this kind of movie. Unfortunately this film couldn't make me enjoy it. First of all this movie leaves no surprises. Everything is predictable and those who were ""surprised"" haven't seen any movie that has intense twists and turns. Also let's count the clichés: 1. Girl Meets Poor Boy whom she falls in love with. 2. Dancing In The Street 3. Parents don't approve of poor boy cause of his background. 4. Girl Leaves boy. 5. Girl meets another rich guy who is equally charming and good looking. 6.Parents approve of rich guy. 7. Girl runs into first guy and they fall in love again. 8. Now girl has to choose between rich guy whom she loves is the ""smart"" choice and Poor guy whom she loves passionately and is the ""right"" choice. 9. Old people looking back at the past. 10. Memory Loss 11. The Ending (Im not gonna give it away just so others can see how obvious it is.) There were,however some things I did like about this movie. How anyone can not like James Garner is beyond me. The film also captures it's time setting very well and looks beautiful. And every cliché it uses it executes well and is believable. The Acting is also very good. In the end this isn't really a bad movie its just not original and in a world with cookie-cutter genres originality is the only thing saving hollywoods soul."

It was an amazing movie, but i started to bawl and that is one thing that i really didn't want Jeff to see me doing. So i highly recommend this movie. it is deeply moving and just sensational. The acting is good, the story, while being a little unreal, was really good. i just cant put in to words how wonderful this movie is. For guys who want to do something romantic, watch this movie with your girlfriend on a day when it is very rainy, or the weather isn't suitable to go out in. and cuddle up on the sofa or lay on the floor and watch it. Do it as a surprise for her. Just a suggestion. All i can really say is i hope that i end up as happy as they did in the movie."

Needless to say, I loved it. I laughed..and I cried..and I cried..and I cried some more..It's a tear-jerker alright! Anyone reading this who is thinking about seeing it, stop thinking and GO get it..and bring some tissues, because you'll most definitely need them. The acting is incredible, not to mention the storyline. The author of The Notebook also wrote A Walk To Remember, and if any of you have seen that, you know how great it was!

How passionate and extremely beautiful there sex was.. Was completely amazing I don't know about any one else but i was COMPLETELY turned on during them. Not so much of because they were * making Love* its just that it was so special and passionate. The care they had for each other in this movie really made it appealing. I can say this was the best movie I have ever scene. To me it sort of reminded me of titanic. The love scene, and the completely opposite back rounds. Although titanic was a completely different movie it was also an awesome movie. I really hope this movie receives an Oscar or some amazing award because it is well to deserve it."

","The Notebook seemed to do well and people seemed to enjoy it. I didn't realize it was as good as it turned out to be or I would have seen it much earlier. The Notebook is a beautiful, touching, love story, well acted and wonderfully directed by relative director newcomer Nick Cassavetes.<br/><br/>The Notebook takes place during the depression era and throughout the forties. We are introduced to young, hard working, quiet, free spirited Noah. During a chance encounter and the carnival Noah falls in love with a rich débutante named Allie who is visiting the area for the summer with her wealthy parents. His charm and persistence eventually wins her over and the two fall deeply in love and have a passionate summer romance. A misunderstanding forces the young lovers apart for many years and Allie eventually falls in love with another man who is more to her social standards but the passion is not the same. Noah who goes to war, returns and builds his dream home as he always said he would. Once again fate brings the young lovers together and Allie is forced to choose between her first love and the man everyone believes she belongs with. All this is told through an elderly man reading to a woman suffering from senility.<br/><br/>First of all, The Notebook is breathtaking. It captures the era is such a way that it draws you in and makes you fall in love with everything about it. It's the most romantic scenery set amongst less than romantic situations such as the depression and war. The story is paced perfectly and we genuinely feel this incomparable love between the two young lovers. That's the most important thing to establish for this story. The twist to the story, to me, was never much of a twist and in fact you'll pretty much know what's going on from the moment it starts but that really only adds to the romantic tone of this film. Canadian Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are steamy together and both play their roles perfectly. You feel each character's emotions and spirit and you feel for both of them. The supporting cast including the amazing James Garner and Gena Rowlands are amazing in their small but so important roles. Anyone looking for a romantic film must see this one!! I admit I didn't overly enjoy the final ending, I think it was a cop out and could have been handled different but it's still a beautiful amazing movie. Possibly the best romance movie I have ever seen. A must see!! 9/10"

True love is very strong, but will it prevail over all odds. Can you imagining living a life and making it beautiful, and all of the sudden you slip away. Coming in and out of amnesia. Me either. Again, the cast is superb it is a must see. You won't be disappointed. Nothing like this has ever been written. A tale of serendipity, if you will also occurs in this awesome movie. Epic tragedy causes the lives of two lovers be split. But the same love, the strongest force in the universe brings it back. that same love, oh how true and beautiful. A must see for all lovers.<br/><br/>Thank you, Calvin Field"

Its just a truly great love story. Almost like a Romeo and Juliet story. I was astonished to find out that Rachel McAddams is the girl from Mean Girls. The 14 yr old or however old she was. Now I just wonder if she's actually older than me. But anyways, that movie rocked and now I want to go out and buy it!! Its a must see!

"earthsavers13","10","0","1","16 February 2005"," True love- a rare thing with the shown intensity
","The movie was absolutely phenomenal to only be topped by Phantom of the Opera. It was so amazingly adorable how they originally met- the cuts back to present time as Noah and Ally are 70 year-old portraying the strength of true love even though the mind may wander to unknown places. I cried along with (Noah) James Garner when Ally had to be sedated but was even more in tune with him than ever at that point. He patiently waits for her mind to return occasionally and for a short amount of time. The funny thing is that one cannot find that kind of love as often as it used to be. In the movie, there is an actual courtship before the first date with the tug of war game going on between Noah and Ally romantically. If only I could find that same intensity of feelings- and to top that off, this summer romance took place when they were both 17- as am I. A perfect time to start such a thing. Although I must say that my favorite scene or rather scenes take place when the rainstorm comes barreling through and they ""fall"" for each other again along with the scene of the young love courtship. And nothing beats the scene with Noah's dad telling stories of when Noah was younger. So cute and adorable in every way! Noah (Ryan Gosling) is without a doubt my forever and always leading man!"

It is really a very romantic and sweet movie. It is a great classic love story that is neither sad nor happy, but just completely touching. This movie will make almost anyone cry with the feeling and emotion that it contains. Women will probably find it more appealing, however, men can enjoy it just as well (it makes a great date movie or a sweet cuddle-on-the-couch with the hubby). The author of the book should be proud with the way the director brought out the human emotions and told the story so well. It was a very enjoyable movie (just be sure to have some Kleenex near at hand). I have a feeling it will last as one of the great movies because the fundamental human emotions transcend time and speak to everyone from the old to the young, the rich to the poor, the single to the married."

","This movie starts out innocent enough, and the entire thing couldn't have been any sweeter than it was. The story was magnificent and timeless, straight to the point and unforgettable.<br/><br/>The story takes place in present day and has a constant look back on the story of one couple's desire to be together through loss and senility. Even though they are apart throughout large groups of their lives, they still seem to find each other in the most perfect display of a humanistic romance. The notebook that is written tells the entire story to both of them as Allie, the girlfriend, struggles to piece together everything. To continue explaining the story would almost ruin it because of the way the film is laid out, but you need to understand every step.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me of such films as Forrest Gump, About Schmidt, & Playing By Heart. There are so many of these great stories out there on DVD that to come across another one almost makes you wish there were more hours in a day. Everything was perfect in this film, from the direction to the music pieces that were played to the scenery in every period in which these two met and dated in.<br/><br/>I gave it an 8/10 for its appeal to all ages and the universal message, which is almost a comfort to put aside all of the current world problems to enjoy a great story like this. Buy it today because you'll want to keep that DVD for a very long time."

"sslatten3","9","0","3","15 February 2005"," Believe the hype!
","This is a great love story. Anyone who has ever had a whirlwind summer romance with a tragic end will appreciate the depth of Noah and Allie's breakup and its ramifications. Plus, the film manages to capture much of the novel's insular quality, although the characters are far more developed for the film than they were for the book. The novel has an almost claustrophobic feel to it, while the movie is all about wide open spaces. Still, the director played the scene with the geese (or whatever they were) on the river perfectly. It looked exactly like I envisioned it when reading the book.<br/><br/>I was surprised at the acting ability of Rachel McAdams. I thought she deserved to be nominated, but she has to get a few more films under her belt before people will forget ""The Hot Chick."" She was excellent in this film, though.<br/><br/>This is one of the rare cases where the film is every bit as good as the novel. Still, bring your Kleenex. My girl and I were crying our eyes out by the end. Great film."

After the first 15 or 20 minutes of the move I was totally involved in the story and I thought that James Garner and Gena Rowlands were outstanding in their roles. I have always liked both of them and have watched Mr. Garner on television since I was young. This was one of the best movies I have ever seen and when the DVD recently came out I went immediately and got my copy and so did my girlfriend. I hope to see more movies like this soon.

","If you ever need a good cry, this will do it. I recommend this film for all. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen! I am so glad I purchased this movie. I will watch it several times. It is not often when a movie or program has such a strong meaning behind it. This should be considered a family film. Minus the semi nude scenes, this movie should be seen by all ages. A fantastic story line and so true to life. It is a real eye opener. Now I know why my father-in-law insisted on visiting my mother-in-law everyday at the nursing home until the day he died. I only wish this movie would have come out before 2001, so we could have understood his intentions better."

","Well I don't share the 'crying' throughout the movie crowd I can honestly admit to some teary eyes at times.<br/><br/>The movie was very good. I rented it as a surprise for my wife after hearing about it - and then didn't realize she had already read the book and knew about it.<br/><br/>I thought James Garner was great and although a lot of the movie is predictable his care for the aged Ally is great. The way the movie portray's the nursing home's staff deference to him as he cares for her is a big part of the movie.<br/><br/>Being a Canadian I was also impressed with the acting of the two main characters who both hail from Ontario.<br/><br/>My wife also agreed with the previous comments about the movie (although changed from the book) stuck to the original story and was enjoyable.<br/><br/>Another sleeper that I hope will get seen lots by word of mouth."

","One of the best love films I've ever seen. the actors have great chemistry and i love the poor guy /rich girl kind of romance. i was smiling at the beginning and bawled my eyes out till the end. Noah Calhoun is one of my favorite characters. He's a real man to love A woman like that. Allie, who's got everything didn't give a hoot about his background. But her parents and world war 2 separated them . they see each other 7 years later and had a second chance. it was predictable but its not about how they met and fell in love. it's about how love is so deep it can create miracles no matter what.

","I saw this movie the day it came out. I loved it with the exception of the ending not following the book. The book is my favorite book that I've ever read. It is an amazing story. The movie displays that, but I was disappointed in the ending. On a scale of 1-10 it would be a 10 even though the ending was in-accurate. It is a wonderful love story and it keeps your attention the whole time. I do suggest that you read the book before seeing the movie because the book is 10 times better than the movie. I suggest you read the book and see the movie. It is an amazing love story. You want to see more the whole time. Go see the movie!!!"

","I took my mum to see The Notebook, and we were both just mesmerised. It was magical, beautiful, inspiring. I didn't want it to end. I came out with an untouched bag of lollies!We were both sobbing at the end, along with the rest of the people in the cinema. But it was fantastic.The comments we heard as we left were all very positive. I have recommended this movie to all of my friends and I have definitely recommended Nicholas Sparks books to them too. I loved his book ""The Wedding"" .The sequel to The Notebook. Although I couldn't put the book down, I just didn't want it to end. It was absolutely empowering!I cant wait to read more of Nicholas Sparks' books. And whats more, he is gorgeous!"

","Two people (Ryan and Rachel) fall in love in the summer holiday. Since one of them coming from rich family, you will know how the story goes. Will their love lead to a happy ending, or is it a sad one?<br/><br/>You will have time to smile. You will have time to cry. Sometime you can feel the love, but sometime you will break your heart.<br/><br/>The movie actually has no special thing. Alhtough the movie has two parallel stories to prepare a surprise, but I guess most of the audience realize the surprise before it is revealed.<br/><br/>But this movie has all good love story need. Good casting (best Gosling movie, I think), good script, many good scenes.<br/><br/>I give 8/10 for Ryan and Rachel performance and good story/script."

","I usually don't like sappy love stories and would have probably never went to see this if my friend didn't talk me into it. I am really glad I did though, because I thought it was great. The story was really creative and I have never seen anything quite like it before. Both Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams did a great job in portraying their characters. I would definitely recommend it to anyone who appreciates a good love story or anyone who just plain likes movies. This is now my new favorite movie. I am just really upset that it still isn't out on DVD. I saw it in the theater back in July of 2004. I have been waiting ever since then, for it to come out on DVD so that I could buy it."

","I can't tell you how much I loved this movie! I went to see it a couple times. Once was with my boyfriend, and of course, he didn't want to see it because it seemed like a ""Chick Flick"". ... He LOVED it! Now he can't wait to buy the DVD so we can watch it at home. It reminds me SO much of us, and maybe that's one of the reasons I love it so much. But besides that, it is a WONDERFUL love story. Perfect for couples of all ages. I'm sure older couples will especially love it. (When you watch it, you'll understand why.) 5 out of 5; 10 out of 10. Pick a range and this movie is at the top of it. I'd recommend it for anybody and everybody!"
"tonybra","8","0","1","19 January 2005"," Perfect movie for couples
","The movie starts a bit boring, but proceeds to be very interesting. Personally I think the film is played by good actors, and the film has a very interesting turning point. The end is brilliant and makes the tears of your eyes come through. This is a film to be recommended for couples, and it also makes you think that you should really take care of those you love. The film does also give us a good example of how difficult life could sometimes - making right decisions - doing what you self want to - not letting your parents take all the control. You should not miss this film. The point was also very easy to understand.. Brilliant film"
"unique1harmony","10","0","1","16 January 2005"," Great Heart Touching Movie
","This movie is well worth to see! It's been a very long time since an excellent movie has come out about innocent love that really touches the heart.<br/><br/>It's one of the rare one's you'll find like A Summer Story(1988) starring Imogen Stubbs and James Wilby. The Notebook will definitely take your heart away if you are one who understands and feel the emotions of one's dedicated heart warming true love.<br/><br/>I thought I would never once again come across another wonderful movie about love and innocence that's just simply a heart touching love story. However The Notebook was a movie well done that covered everything a love story would make complete. Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams played their characters extremely well. They both matched up perfectly in the movie. It wasn't one where the lady was too beautiful and the man just simply had to be replaced by a more handsome bold looking man or the other way around.<br/><br/>This is definitely a must see if you are simply looking for a touching unforgettable love story. I plan on reading the book next since the movie was so great! It's usually agreed that the book version of any movie is usually (but not always) better."

","This movie has to be the ultimate Love story of 2004. It makes you really think of the future and what may happen to you or your spouse in the end. The disease she gets is a awful disease. I have dealt with this and it is not fun. I would not wish this on my worst enemy. I saw it 2 times in the theater. Once with my husband and then with my daughter. I don't remember seeing a dry eye in the theater when we left. The movie comes out on DVD on Feb 8th (hehehe right in time for Valentines Day) This would be a great V-Day gift. Your sure to get some love if you watch this movie with your spouse. But make sure you have the tissues handy for her."
"ruby_fff","7","0","2","14 September 2004"," Reminiscence of romantic young loves - a thorough dramatic tear-jerker for the hopelessly, or hopefully, romantic
","So it's quite melodramatic and probably familiar heart-tugging, sentimental plots - but you expect no less from a tear-jerker romance. The trailer of ""The Notebook"" sure beckons the romantics, young and old (since we see Gena Rowlands and James Garner included). It's worth it just watching the intense chemistry firing up, hot and cool, between the two central leads, Ryan Gosling as Noah and Rachel McAdams as Allie - it's a godsend pairing of these two young actors in their blossoming twenties, both from Ontario, Canada. Gosling is a stunner in his brave portrayal of Danny in ""The Believer"" 2001 (controversial subjects in a substantial film, indeed, from w-d Henry Bean). McAdams delivered a wickedly fun Regina George opposite Lindsay Lohan in director Mark S. Waters' ""Mean Girls"" 2004, screenplay by Tina Fey of SNL fame.<br/><br/>There's subtle but steady supporting roles from Joan Allen playing the stern opposing mom (with a secret) to Allie, and Sam Shepard as the supportive enduring dad to Noah. The skilful cinematography by Robert Fraisse (responsible for director Jean-Jacques Annaud's ""The Lover"" aka L'Amant 1992) complemented director Nick Cassavetes and the production design efforts. Yes, that swan swarm scene is a true love sight incarnate, seven years or not. Chance and coincidences, in love and war, together or apart, are part and parcel to the plot. I enjoyed the chance of naturally washing my eyes through and through. It's a winning love story, soap or not.<br/><br/>Two other movies also based on Nicholas Sparks' novels: ""A Walk to Remember"" 2002 directed by Adam Shankman, another tear-jerker about romantic young loves with an endearing performance from Mandy Moore as Jamie, Peter Coyote as dad Reverend Sullivan, and Shane West as Landon, who pursued Jamie and became a changed young man for the better. ""Message In A Bottle"" 1999 directed by Luis Mandoki, with Kevin Costner and Robin Wright Penn, and Paul Newman as Costner's dad - another lovelorn (tear-jerker) romance, this time more for grown-ups. <br/><br/>For a heart-warming and delightful romance with touches of Italian flavor, bread or pie, mother and daughter, an ideal son-in-law, I recommend w-d Melissa Martin's ""The Bread, My Sweet"" 2001, aka Wedding for Bella (DVD title). Scott Baio is Dominic the brainy businessman-brother-baker next door, Kristin Minter is Lucca the long 'lost & found' daughter, and Rosemary Prinz is Bella the life-loving wife & mother in a charming, moving little film."

","We had read up on The Notebook and came armed with a pocketful of tissues; however, this film didn't bring out any tears for me or for my wife. I think I felt more emotion when SPOCK died and when ET lived! We are new to this area (Columbus Ohio - America's heartland) and didn't really know how the long-time locals would respond - but I'd say only about 1/2 of the audience was sobbing when ***WARNING SPOILER*** their love ""worked a miracle"" and death took them together, peacefully in their sleep - but this was so telegraphed that when Noah cuddled up next to his wife, you knew it was coming. Solid performance by James Garner - kind of Divine Secrets of the Ya Ya Sisterhood meets Officer and a Gentleman."
"melaniehorn","9","0","2","9 June 2004"," A satisfying chick flick
","If you're in the mood for a movie that will satisfy every romantic yearning you have and leave you in tears, then this is it. Having read the book, I was prepared for a sappy movie. And don't get me wrong, it is very sentimental, and full of rather canned moments. But the acting is so great that you just get sucked in! The chemistry that the two young actors have is some of the best I've seen on screen in a long time. The movie felt like it was about twenty minutes long because you get so absorbed in the characters. I thought that the translation of the book was excellent. Yes, it's sentimental, but if you're in the mood for romance, it won't let you down."
"cheriberry","8","0","2","5 June 2004"," Not a great film, but a good one
","If you've been waiting for a well-told weepy romantic story, your prayers have been answered. As others have noted here, you will need to bring a large stack of Kleenex to this one. Which is not usually my type of film, but there is an abundance of talent on display in this one, both in front of and behind the camera, and that keeps it honest and enjoyable. Never manipulative, never cloying, it's a good old-fashioned time at the movies.<br/><br/>Ryan Gosling and Rachel McAdams are both wonderful in the lead roles. Him I knew, and he is again quite fabulous. Her I was not familiar with, but she is equally fabulous here. Together they are as winning a young couple as you're likely to find on the screen these days. And of course the old pros, Gena Rowlands and James Garner, hold up their end of the bargain in fine style. And the supporting roles, in what could have been horrible caricatures, are done beautifully by some very fine actors. Both the screenplay and the direction are restrained and first-rate.<br/><br/>Grab your tissues along with grandma and grandpa, and go see this one."
"vraptorz","9","0","1","21 May 2004"," SIFF Opener was superb!
","This film goes into general release on June 25th -- bring your lover and your hanky. This is a great little film featuring excellent performances by Gosling and McAdams, as well as James Garner. It becomes evident that the story Garner is reading to a patient in a nursing home (Gena Rowlands) is more than just a novel. Gosling and McAdams are young lovers who meet, date, lose each other, and reunite. Although some of the plot twists were predictable, the story was so cleanly directed and beautifully filmed it more than makes up for that shortcoming. A fine film for romantics of all ages. It was the opening film for Seattle International Film Festival 2004, and very well received. Check it out!"
"clewing","Null","0","1","20 May 2004"," Charming ""Chick Flick""
","I guess the official release date of this film is still about a month away (June 25th?), but having had an opportunity of viewing an advanced screening of ""The Notebook"" last evening I felt compelled to share. Actually it's kind of cool to see a film a month before its release. Kind of like ""nyah nyah, I've seen it and you haven't"". In any case, this movie delivers exactly what you'd expect from the trailers. Being an ""old guy"", I'll first admit I went into this show knowing absolutely nothing about the 2 young actors in the starring roles, so all I can base my opinion on is their performance in this particular movie. They're talented. They did a good job. I like James Garner, and he of course ALWAYS does a good job. I also like Sam Sheperd, and although he has a very small part in the film he's good too. I haven't read any Nicholas Sparks books, but my wife has, she likes them. I think the director did a good job making this story into a film, because he really caught the flavor of small town America in the 1940s, (except I didn't think anyone living in a small Southern town in the 1940s would have long hair and a beard like the leading man) and included some nice shots of sunsets on the lake and beautiful live oak trees with all the moss hanging off of them and so forth, so visually it's done well too. The storyline is predictable, but if you've read the book you know the story anyway. So anyway I liked the movie, it's a nice way to spend 2 hours in the theatre, your wife or girlfriend will enjoy it, and even if you're an old guy like me you will too."
