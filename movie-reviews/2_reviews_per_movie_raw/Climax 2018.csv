"Bertaut","9","458","587","8 October 2018"," A disgusting, morally reprehensible piece of insane genius
","Climax, the latest film from Argentinian-French provocateur <a href=""/name/nm0637615/"">Gaspar Noé</a>, is a disturbing, depraved, disgusting, and debauched piece of absolute insane genius that I thoroughly adored from beginning to end, and which I never, ever, want to see again. Lord of the Flies by way of Heronimus Bosch or Zdzislaw Beksinski, Climax is what you might get if you mashed-up <a href=""/title/tt0073650/"">Salò o le 120 giornate di Sodoma (1975)</a>, <a href=""/title/tt5109784/"">Mother! (2017)</a>, and <a href=""/title/tt0462590/"">Step Up (2006)</a>; a dance movie that morphs into a horror film, which then attempts to show the audience a literal hell on Earth. With Climax, Noe takes the audience and characters further than ever before. Granted, there's nothing here to rival The Butcher's sickening attack on his pregnant wife from <a href=""/title/tt0157016/"">Seul contre tous (1998)</a>, or the near-unwatchable rape and fire extinguisher scenes from <a href=""/title/tt0290673/"">Irréversible (2002)</a>. However, whereas those films feature sudden moments of barbaric violence punctuating (relatively) quotidian narratives, in Climax, the oppressive feeling of dread is unrelenting. So even though the acts of violence are not, in themselves, as extreme as some of those in Noé's back-catalogue, the cumulative effect is far worse. Obviously, this makes the film something of an endurance test, even at only 96 minutes, but this is precisely the point - Noé wants the audience to be utterly exhausted by the end, and he employs numerous confrontational and disorientating techniques to achieve such.<br/><br/>Set in the winter of 1996, and allegedly based on a real incident in France that year, the film focuses on a dance troupe putting the finishing touches to a performance before embarking on a national tour, to be followed by a series of dates in the US. Apart from the opening shot, and a couple of quick shots towards the end, the entire film is set in the rehearsal space; an isolated and unoccupied hall. Upon finishing rehearsals, the troupe starts to party, as we primarily follow Selva (Sofia Boutella), the group's choreographer. As the night wears on, it becomes apparent that one of their members has spiked the sangria with powerful LSD, with each of the troupe descending into their own personal Hades of paranoia, aggression, and/or uninhibited sexuality.<br/><br/>In lieu of any kind of title card or opening credits, Climax begins with an abstract and non-descript shot of pure white. So visually indeterminate is the image (it could literally be anything) that at the screening I attended, most people (myself included) didn't even realise the film had begun. It is only as a girl staggers into shot from the top of the frame that it becomes apparent we are looking directly downwards onto a snowfield. The girl is in great distress, leaving a trail of blood in her wake. After a moment, she collapses onto the snow, her body convulsing, unable to go any further. The camera then revolves upwards along the vertical-axis through 360 degrees, a shot anyone familiar with Noé's work will immediately recognise. Revealing the bare branches of a few nearby threadbare trees, the movement immediately establishes that we are in an isolated location in the dead of winter. By the time the frame returns to its starting position, the girl's struggles have fashioned a hideously disproportioned and asymmetrical red-tinted snow angel. Theoretically, this could be the cliched opening scene to any generic slasher movie. However, the striking composition and the economy with which the shot conveys so much information serve to betray the fact that this is not the work of an anonymous journeyman for hire, but is instead the meticulously composed opening salvo of an auteur who knows precisely what he's doing.<br/><br/>A moment later, the entire closing credits roll (upwards, obviously), right to the copyright information. With no closing credits at the end, the audience is allowed no transition from the film to reality. As the film ended, the lights immediately popped on, with no music to play us out, no darkened theatre to recompose ourselves. Indeed, to enhance the sense of discombobulation for which Noé is obviously striving, the last 15 minutes or so of the film are literally upside-down. The audience is thus placed in the same position as the characters - the absence of closing credits and the inverted image create a sense of confusion and discomfort, just as the film is depicting the surviving dancers coming out of their drug-induced mania and back to the real world. As he attempts to do throughout the film, Noé places the audience directly into the psychological reality of the characters.<br/><br/>After the opening scene, the film then cuts to a TV screen showing the dancers' audition interviews, which do a terrific job of establishing the differing characters, as do the dialogue scenes after the rehearsal but before the LSD has kicked in. The third scene is the dance number, which is easily the best dance sequence I've ever seen on film. Shot in a continuous 20 minute take, this grants the scene a sense of real-time immediacy and in-camera verisimilitude which one can usually only acquire from a live performance - this isn't something constructed by an editor from a series of individual set-ups, this is something literally happening before our eyes.<br/><br/>Thus ends the first section of the film. The second, and much shorter, section is the dancers engaged in conversation with one another (and, in contrast to the first section, is made up of a multitude of edits eschewing any sense of match-cutting). The third, and longest, section sees them realise the sangria is spiked, attempt to find out who did it, and the chaos that ensues when the drugs take hold. These three sections (dance, conversations, and drugs) roughly correspond to the three books of the Divina Commedia - Paradiso, Purgatorio, and Inferno. However, in the poem, the order is Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso, charting the ascension of the soul from the Inferno of Hades to the Paradiso of heaven. In the film, the movement is in the opposite direction, as the Paradiso of the harmonious and unified perfection in the dance sequence gives way to the calm Purgatorio after the consumption of the LSD, but before it has taken over their reason. Finally, they descend to the Inferno. In charting this allegorical journey, one of the most immediately interesting things is the obvious visual contrast to the dance sequence. Whilst the dance sees the group acting in unison, all of a single mind, the third section of the film shows them fragmented and in disarray, each individual driving towards their own purpose, whether it be paranoia, hedonism, or what they believe they need to do to survive. The harmony of the troupe has given way to the horror of individualised disintegration and psychological collapse.<br/><br/>We then witness a girl's head being set on fire, a pregnant girl being kicked repeatedly in the stomach, a girl slashing her own arm and face, a contortionist contorting to the point where he literally splinters his own bones, a child locked in a room full of cockroaches, a man scratching his chest to the point that it turns into four red bloody streaks, public urination, lesbian rape, incest, and suicide. As the veneer of civilisation is stripped away, the characters devolve before our eyes; some become concerned only with sex, others with violence.<br/><br/>It would certainly be easy to dismiss Climax as thematically empty, arguing that the brilliant camerawork and pumping soundtrack serve only to cover up the vapidity at its core, to argue that the depravity and excess is not in the service of any grand universal point, but simply to show attractive young people tearing one another apart. However, there is some kind of political point buried beneath the carnage; the dance sequence takes place in front of a massive French flag, whilst the credits declare, ""A French Film. And proud of it."" Perhaps related to this, the troupe is made up of a cross-section of Europeans, and in the explosion of excess hedonism and hysterical mayhem, does this cross-section of ethnicities, genders, and sexual orientations come to represent European multiculturalism tearing itself apart? Is Noé saying that if France continues to accommodate such a diversity of disparate cultures, chaos will ensue?<br/><br/>In relation to this, perhaps tellingly, Omar (<a href=""/name/nm8273855/"">Adrien Sissoko</a>), the person who is initially blamed for spiking the sangria, is Muslim. So, is Noé saying that in such a multicultural milieu, with fear of Islam at a high, it's very easy to blame everything on the Islamic ""Other"". Additionally, Noé depicts the dance scene with such reverence and awe that this kind of social critique, barely straddling the line between patriotism and xenophobia, doesn't seem to sit especially comfortably. Not to mention that Noé himself is an immigrant - he was born in Argentina, moving to France when he was 13.<br/><br/>The fact is, I don't have a clue what Climax is about. Nor do I care. Nor is it important. I take it for what it appears on the surface; an incredibly technically proficient depiction of a contemporary Inferno, as aesthetically impressive as it is morally questionable, as enthralling as it is disturbing, a film of unparalleled barbarism, that also stands as one of the most extraordinary cinematic achievements in recent years. It's a work of genius. Twisted, sick, depraved genius, but genius nonetheless. It disturbed me like no film in at least a decade, and I couldn't get it out of my head for days afterwards. I absolutely loved every single crazy minute of it. And I don't ever wish to see it again."
"allaman-george","10","35","43","5 January 2020"," Not For Everyone
","At last I have to review this film. Let me start by saying that it is the most engrossing film I have ever seen. I saw Noe's ""Enter the Void"" and I've seen plenty of disturbing films, but none quite as raw as this. I thought I could never watch this again, after the first viewing, but I love the opening dance scene so much (I've watched it at least a dozen times and it never gets old) that recently again I was compelled to watch to the end with my jaw on the floor. It was as insanely gripping as the first time.<br/><br/>I judge films primarily by how well they allow me to suspend disbelief. ""Climax"" - after the puzzling but still disturbing opening scene before credits - starts a little banal, straight up interviews with dancers, predictable questions, mostly predictable answers, but stay with it because it is integral to how the film develops. Then at about 9m is the amazing dance scene. My son is a break dancer so I love this kind of dance. The dance is quintessentially French - unrefined, raw, sexy, chaotic, dirty, sweaty, unbelievably talented. The whole film has that French feel to it - the women don't give a damn and are all the sexier for it. Only Ebert's review notes that this entire 6 minute dance sequence is shot in one take, no cuts to make it more energetic. It is quite energetic enough. But this is an important distinction. This film was made with uncompromising devotion.<br/><br/>By this time I adore all the dancers, but now we hear them talking to each other privately and revealing shocking attitudes that they usually keep private. There is no filter here and no moral compunction. I start to lose my affection for most of them, but now they are human, not just dancing paragons. I also start to get sucked in and forget I am sitting in darkness watching a film. By the time ""something is kicking in"" I am completely lost in the film, no trace of disbelief, and I remain rapt until last frame.<br/><br/>I did a lot of acid back in the 60's and had some really bad trips but none this bad because I did not overdose. How do you behave when you are completely disoriented, terrified, and confused? The worst in you sometimes comes out. There are scenes where a character sees another character in severe physical and/or emotional distress but the watcher simply cannot handle it and moves on. Sober, any of them would have stopped to sympathize and help, but not in this hellish dystopia. They have lost all ability to connect cause with effect.<br/><br/>I've been there. A bad trip is as ugly as it gets, and this film portrays it perfectly. I can completely understand if a viewer who has never tripped doesn't get it, but I do, and I think I am Noe's target audience. Still, the educated viewer who can't appreciate the attention to detail about the bad trip can appreciate the detail and love with which this film was shot, and the talent of the dancers.<br/><br/>I felt that most reviews I read missed the point. This is not a film to be analyzed. It is not aimed at the left cortex. Observations about the camera work and acting are helpful but don't address the end effect the film has on the watcher. Bottom line: how did it make you feel? For me - severely disturbed, captivated, grief-filled, horrified, sad. To me that is the mark of a great film.<br/><br/>Other reviewers praise Sofia Boutella, who is amazing, but I think Romain Guillermic steals the show. There are scenes where those eyebrows are positively evil and sexy at the same time. But it is hard to pick a favorite, they are all so remarkable in this film.<br/><br/>Do I recommend it? I don't know. Noe is known for disturbing films and they are not for everybody. I hope you will watch it simply because something crafted this beautifully deserves to be appreciated."

","Well, if you are going to watch a gaspar noe movie you should know what you are going to experience; search Gaspar Noe. But this movie will probably be the most popular Noe movie among popular culture or social media or whatever. So, this is a warning for those who haven't watched a noe flm before. This is not a familiar movie for you, do not expect to see a convenient work of art.<br/><br/>Yet, this is an experience for you to must have. Perfect side of ""cinema"" to create different perspective. Do not care about plot, do not care about subtle messages. Just use your eyes, try not the think about what you see. What you are going to see is an experience through the eyes of a phantom among dancers. Phantom is there, phantom sees what they see, feels what they feel, even drinks what they drink. So, you are going to completely involve in, engage in the movie.<br/><br/>After the movie you may like it or not, you may even hate it.

","CLIMAX or how long can you stand watching boring dancers and average at best actors pretend to be on drugs? Zero story, lots of screaming, no surprises. I'd even say this film is pretty tame (for Noé). And it's neither radical nor inventive anymore to simply turn the camera upside down or to show the end credits first. Apart from big respect for some well done one-shot moments, I'm quite disappointed."
"noizy290","1","63","102","14 May 2019"," So pretentious it made me write a review after soooo long
","So I get the premise because I've seen many of of Noe but this was just was too pretentious and trying to neglect character building with the justification of artistry...
Dancers aka bad actors(so much overacting here) taking acid and freaking out in a bad trip....Oh and quirky lighting and rotating camera angles that's all. Supposedly an experience rather than a movie but believe me Noe and sooo many others have done so much better at delivering an experience rather than some dark lighting and the classic upside down camera... It would've been better if he just gave some E or acid to the actors and just observe and tape the reactions.
Concluding, an pretentious avant garde art experience (whoever has had a fair share of art and experimental cinema will know that it doesn't deserve that title) that doesn't even deliver at least that experience while failing in all the rest. And do some research on drugs next time"

"christopher-underwood","6","20","29","13 April 2019"," I am not part of the intended audience
","I find that the brutal and garish style of Gasper Noe has little appeal and I have thus far only watched some excerpts and a couple of early shorts. Understanding that this might have a greater appeal, I gave it a watch. The confrontational beginning with unappealing youths was not a promising start and though the subsequent dance routines were impressive I couldn't help feeling that combined with the thunderous 90s dance music accompaniment this was my idea of hell. An hour later into this plotless extravaganza, those same 'dance' routines are replayed as death throes in an, admittedly very well filmed, modern version of Dante's Inferno. There is considerable directorial skill here but clearly I am not part of the intended audience. My only pleasurable moment, ironically, was when the police arrive to poke about the dead bodies and we have an instrumental version of the Rolling Stones, Angie. A moment of bliss amidst a mass of agonised death wish."
"ccamp89","7","25","38","6 April 2019"," Weak 3.5 // Mostly succeeds as viscera
","As an exercise in pure viscera, French provocateur Gaspar Noé mostly pleases with Climax. A group of dancers unknowingly drink spiked sangria which slowly warps their afterparty into an LSD-soaked nightmare. With a premise like that, it may be evident that this is a film meant to be experienced rather than thought about. The pleasures of Climax come nearly entirely from its sheer audiovisual power: the ceaselessly pulsating score, the fluid one-shot takes, the lurid colors. It's closer to performance art than what most people would characterize as a ""movie"" and should be approached with that mindset if you're to enjoy it. However, as enjoyable as its best sequences are, the lack of nearly any thematic depth imbues much of the film with a subtly nagging tediousness. And even when viewed purely from an experiential perspective, it is far from watertight in its pacing and flow. Still, there is a cumulative power in its sound, visuals, and theatrics that's hard to deny.<br/><br/>Weak 3.5/5"
"Metaflix","8","33","54","19 March 2019"," Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' ceremonial gathering scenes on bath salts
","Gaspar Noé's 'Climax' is labelled as a ""trippy drama horror musical."" Not a lot of people read ""trippy drama horror musical"" and think ""Now that's my kind of movie!"" Indeed, most people will find the movie to be quite objectionable, but that certainly doesn't mean 'Climax' is devoid of artistic merit or accomplishment.<br/><br/>The film is a menagerie of dance, neon lighting, long takes, and astounding camera work, propelled forward by a pulsing EDM soundtrack that fills every scene with a frenetic energy. It may best be described as Kubrick's 'Eyes Wide Shut' ceremonial gathering scenes on bath salts. If 'Climax' were a painting, it'd belong in the Modern Museum of Art.<br/><br/>We're not quite sure which drug one should be on to see the film, but some drug is definitely recommended."
"hampersnow-28905","1","154","289","5 February 2019"," French Garbage cinema pretending to be art
","A bunch of dancers have a really bad drug trip and that is the entire plot to this movie if you can even call it a movie. We are introduced to the dancers in sequences that go on way too long. After that it's people writhing around, moaning, screaming and crying and for the most part nothing else at all. The camera rotates and films scenes upside down. At times you can't even tell what's going on , on screen. There is no editing. There is plenty of over-acting. Swirling camera work doesn't make up for the fact that there is no story and the entire movie is a bore set to dance music. Gather all your friends in a room , stand in the middle of it shaking the camera at them while they pretend to be lunatics and you'll recreate whatever this is. Maybe this was an experiment in how much stupidity an audience can endure ?"
"paul-faherty1975","1","77","139","15 February 2019"," Where is all the sex and violence
","I am, I suspect, in the minority here, but I feel that after seeing all of Gaspar Noe's body of work you come to expect another boundary pushing instalment of art. Climax, for me, was dull and predictable. on first discovering Noe, I was invigorated by his fearless approach to filmmaking, his choices in content and texture were exciting and straddled the realms of decency and the taboo. I would always seek out his newest creation, until now. Climax seemed like a lazy and confirmative tick box exercise that never really gets out of the gates. It neither disturbs or delights, or tackles anything that I would normally flinch at, this is what I expect to see when buying a ticket to a Noe film. Red backdrops are now boring, I get it, red means danger, love, sex, blood etc etc. pumping pulsing soundtracks are there to disorientate and unsettle, boring, next, move along. drugs drugs drugs, erect dicks and maturbation, need I go on. Show me something new Gaspar, not snippets of your better films cut together like a bad greatest hits album, you are better than this, Climax was a sloppy idea and I can only surmise that you have now run out of ideas. I hate to be a debbie downer because I love your earlier movies, but this movie really need to be retitled as Anti-Climax."
"serbanboanca","1","91","167","17 February 2019"," Saying it was horrible is an understatement
","It's very hard to put into words how bad this movie is. Nothing interesting really happens, almost half of the movie is filled with seemingly endless dance scenes (some dancing is ok, while some is just random movements like the dancers are having a seizure).<br/><br/>The other half of the movie is just disorienting camera work, culminating with the picture being upside down, while the screen is red and blinking. For 15 minutes straight. I almost threw up.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is just a pretentious attempt at making an art movie, but really it's just a waste of time and money. I found it insulting that someone would create such a monstrosity and expect other people to waste their time to see it."

"james-re","9","115","215","25 June 2018"," An intense, exhilarating, exciting and terrifying experience.
","I always feel excited and a little bit anxious watching a new film by French director Gaspar Noe. His past films have have included the controversial ""Irreversible"" known for its unflinching and brutal portrayal of sexual violence, the mind bending and psychedelic trip that is ""Enter the Void"" and the erotic drama ""Love"" which features unsimulated sex presented in 3D.
Noe is pushing the limits for not only what Is allowed to be shown in a film but also for what the film medium is capabale of. Unconventional narrative structures, mind bending visuals and camera angles you wouldn't even dream of. These are just a few things that can be found in his films.<br/><br/>I am happy to say that Climax may be Noe's tamest film in terms of its sex and violence. And I am very excited to say that it may also be the best film he has made yet. I feel that it's best to know as little as possible about the film before seeing it to have the best possible experience. What I will say though is that the film grips you from the start, and only tightens that grip throughout the running time. The film makes use of one location and one situation and one set of characters to put you in the moment. The excitement and exuberance that you feel during the first dance sequence which is shot entirely in one take will change and evolve throughout the film into sequences that are much more frightening and intense. Go along for the ride though because it is a unique work of filmmaking worth seeing in a cinema and if you hold on tight, you may experience something that is close to an outer body experience."
"etmachina","2","97","180","16 March 2019"," Drug-shaming conservative garbage.
","This movie is ridiculously stupid and pretentious. The good reviews are baffling.<br/><br/>This is ham-handed poser arthouse cinema.<br/><br/>Marketed as based on a true story -- which is a lie. After some digging you can find an interview where Noe reveals the ""real life"" incident involved a ""much smaller"" dance party where drinks were spiked and things ""went sour...BUT NOTHING BAD HAPPENED"". OH OK! Noe decided to make club goers into drug-crazed raping incestual violent simpletons completely and totally as artistic license. In most interviews he asserts he just took some artistic license to avoid dealing with the real people involved. That is nothing but BS considering ""nothing bad happened"". This movie is based on Noe hearing about drinks being spiked at some party sometime. With a foundation that vague, it's no wonder the movie comes across like a performer who didn't prepare before they took the stage.<br/><br/>It ranks up there with Reefer Madness in the portrayal of LSD and drugs. If you have ever taken LSD or been around people who are on it, you will be confused. It's absolutely preposterous. They act like they are on some combination of bath salts and PCP.<br/><br/>The characters are terrible and nasty people. The gay characters act with the same toxic masculinity as the straight characters. Just wrong. It's over the top to the point of of ridiculousness. All the characters act like nihilistic young Republicans, carelessly offensive and unashamedly selfish. These are supposed to be professional dancers deep in the club/dance music scene -- it's preposterous. This is nothing like what the dance music world is like.<br/><br/>I was hoping for at least some cool psychedelic scenes to simulate the LSD use, but there's none. Noe turns the camera upside down for the last 10 minutes of the movie. No reason. Ohhhh cooool.<br/><br/>Three times during the movie he blasts boring, asinine, glib phrases onto the screen, like ""death is an amazing experience"" or ""birth is a unique opportunity"" -- oh really, Mr Noe? Tell us more you wise, wise man. The birth statement comes across as an anti-abortion message -- it follows characters discussing abortions, unemotionally and unflinchingly, y'know, cus that's how people who have abortions are like. Cold and heartless and open to talk about it with virtual strangers.<br/><br/>Midway thru the movie Mr Noe flashes his own name on the screen repeatedly, each time imitating a classic dance music label logo. It's incredibly egotistical and appropriative.<br/><br/>The movie has a great soundtrack with real quality electronic music, like Dopplereffekt and Aphex Twin. Someone who really understands and loves club culture curated the soundtrack. And the dance scenes before things ""go sour"" are cool.<br/><br/>Mr Noe however does not understand club culture. He made a movie that is an insult to club culture and comes across as a deeply stereotypical, conservative anti-drug movie. The only way it could halfway fly is if there was some nightmare unbelievable-but-true event that inspired it, but there's not..at all. You have to buy the idea that LSD does this to people and that club culture is just a druggy nightmare filled with hostile and dangerous people, which is how it's almost always presented. Raves=drugs=bad. Give us a break already.<br/><br/>Anybody who thinks this is a good ""arty"" movie is being taken for a ride."

","Gaspar Noe is an infamous filmic provocateur, who has inspired the kind of aggressive derision and accordant lofty praise that would be the envy of most other directors. With Climax, he is as dynamic, acerbic and occasionally pretentious as ever, resulting in a film that could be made by no one else, and an experience that is utterly harrowing and genuinely original. 
His ensemble is uniformly believable, giving the scenes of utter chaos a sense of gruelling horror the likes of which I haven't quite experienced in any other film.

","""Climax"" is less of a film than it is a visceral experience, and that will immediately turn off a good population of moviegoers who will invariable dismiss it as ""artsy garbage."" If you're one of these people who can't stand films made by ""artsy"" directors, what are you even doing going to see a Gaspar Noé movie?<br/><br/>But whew. If you appreciate film or dance, you are going to be blown away by this masterpiece. This is ""Step Up"" on crack cocaine.<br/><br/>A group of young people who subscribe to an underground dance culture meet for a three-day weekend of intense rehearsal. On the final night, during their closing party, someone spikes the sangria, and well....best not to say much more.<br/><br/>The first 45-60 minutes of the film are made up of impeccably choreographed dance sequences that had my eyes glued to the screen like I had just rail-lined a bunch of Ritalin. Some may call this ""boring"" but I found it to be electrifying and mesmerizing. The music in the film is constant, like you're watching it in a nightclub instead of a theater. Electronic powerhouses such as Thomas Bangalter, Giorgio Moroder, and Aphex Twin contribute to the dazzling soundtrack. After the first dance sequence, which lasts about 10-15 minutes, I wanted to stand up and applaud. Then I forgot that I was in a movie theater.<br/><br/>I especially enjoyed the cast of characters, which reminded me so much of my days doing musical theater in high school. If you've done performing arts in either high school or college, you will appreciate ""Climax"" on an entirely different level. The awkward politics of being in such a troupe come out in full force -- while everyone is generally nice to one another, rivalries and furious envy exist in the shadows, in addition to cutthroat attitudes and the occasional best friend / power couple dynamic. When things go wrong after the sangria is spiked, these politics are blown up into a larger than life spectacle. It was a neurotic joy to watch unfold.<br/><br/>And boy do things get wild. The key theme once the action begins is pure, unadulterated panic. Gaspar Noé's trademark direction brings us back to the chaotic, irregularly lit sequences seen in ""Irreversible."" The action is so dense. Some keep dancing. Some commit acts of violence. Some have passionate sex on the dance floor. Your eyes and senses are overwhelmed and you have no idea where to look, until a fast camera pan takes you to a completely different part of the room.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, the cinematography is top notch (although that's a running theme in Noé's repertoire). You've got all kinds of shots here -- dutch angles, long cuts that contribute to the chaos, even slow inversions that make you feel as if you are in a fun house at the Jersey Shore. It's incredibly disorienting, nauseating, and a whole lot of fun.<br/><br/>While watching, I also noticed a lot of similarities to Aronofsky's ""Black Swan."" If you enjoyed that one, definitely check out ""Climax.""<br/><br/>The ending of the film seems less complete than it should, but it's really no big deal, and does not spoil or ruin the rest of the film.<br/><br/>This is one roller coaster I'd happily ride again, and I'd say it is destined to become a midnight cult classic. Keep on dancing."

"sam-519","8","10","17","22 September 2019"," Control is an illusion
","Climax doesn't deviate from the standards that Noé has set himself since his feature-length début Seul Contre Tous in 1998. A typically extreme, harrowing and depressing affair, Climax, on the surface, tells the story of a troupe of young French dance students who party overnight in their studio and fall prey to one of their number who spikes the punch with LSD. This results in a number of shockingly horrific situations for the students and what starts out as a fun, innocent evening celebrating their craft and achievements turns into an irreversible catastrophe involving rape, abuse, self-harm and death. But beyond that, like many of Noé's films, Climax is a warning of the transient brevity of life's gifts and of not falling prey to the dark temptations of unchecked hedonism.<br/><br/>Climax is directed in a typically disorienting style both in its chronology and its camerawork. The film starts at the end point, rolling the end credits at the start and showing the agonised death of one of the students before going back to the beginning of the evening to present how things got to this point. In this film, as with many others of Noé's, there is a strong focus on camera motion and long takes. After the audition tapes for the troupe, in which we are shown the promising, excited interviewees on a CRT set literally bookended by various tomes and VHS tapes relating to psychosis/psychopathy, the film cuts to the dance hall showing the students practicing their impressive new dance act in its entirety before running on to the start of the party itself all in the same take. In between the interview tapes and the dance routine Noé flashes onscreen one of his trademark blocks of text, this one telling us that EXISTENCE IS A FLEETING ILLUSION. This is a time-honoured warning (for example, in Hinduism the universe itself is thought to be an illusion/maya) but Noé's focus here is on the word 'fleeting'. The good things in life can be short-lived and worth treasuring, and the long dance sequence, which is stunningly choreographed, seems to end too quickly in spite of being a technically and temporally long take. It's so well done that as an audience we don't want it to end.<br/><br/>Noé presents multiple themes in the films and this 'bookending' is just one of them, likely alluding to the bookending of life with birth and death. The dance sequence at the start is long but enjoyable whereas, at the end of the film, when the LSD has taken its full toll and the students all 'freak out' in a bad trip, the sequence is painfully long, but this is a sequence which we do want to end but which drags on. Noé often concentrates on the victims' situation and here, just like the dance students, we experience their mania along with them, wanting the scene to end as it draws itself out with the swirling camera movements showing that everything is 'out of step' - as an audience we have as little control over the film's grip as the students have over their situation. But control is also an illusion, and sometimes terrible unforeseen things happen to us, further reminding us that we should make the most of life's benefits.<br/><br/>The film is split into several sections of long takes, each one with their own distinct camera style. In the opening dance scene the camerawork is as 'controlled' as the dance students themselves, moving with them, allowing them to display their form fully, not missing a moment, it's almost as if the camera has its own choreography. As the situation in the party deteriorates the camera style changes, and at one point, after a few drinks, when the students have an impromptu dance-off, the camera shows the scene from above, constantly rotating, warning us of the chaos soon to come. By the end of the film, the camera cannot hold a straight shot, rotating upside down, tumbling back and forth, with all order, planning and organisation at the whim of the tragedy we see unfolding.<br/><br/>Like with many of his films, Noé uses the significance of colour to full effect. As with Love, he is particularly fond of using red and green, red being of special import in Climax. Whether it's the red of the dance studio floor, the red of the sangria or the red of the emergency lighting, this colour seems to represent a start and end point (motionlessness), the precious blood of life and death, whereas he uses green to show points of transition (motion) between physical and psychological locales. Blue seems to represent a rare environment of safety, like the blue room where two of the girl students make out and calmly fall asleep within, locking out the madness of the dance hall and their partners. When the power in the hall trips out, the lights flash green-blue-green, again representing a transitional state and the end of any safe point where the evening could have been salvaged. White is the bringer of death, and this can come in the form of the snow of the winter outside which slowly envelops and kills a number of the students, or Psyche who spikes the LSD, a tall blonde wearing a short white dress who effectively acts as the orchestrating angel of death. Indeed, as we see her dropping liquid LSD into the whites of her own eyes at the end of the film (which in her interview she mentions her 'flatmate' doing. and the kind of thing which she wants to ""get away"" from), Noé reminds us that DEATH IS AN EXTRAORDINARY EXPERIENCE before the screens 'whites out' and the movie ends. White, a colour often associated with madness, has fully taken control of and put to rest the events of the film. But it's no mercy kill.<br/><br/>One of the most important aspects of Climax is the emphasis on the choices we make in life. Emmanuelle is the only member of the troupe to have a child who goes everywhere with her, mentioning early in the film that her dancing life has changed as a result of his existence (another theme in Love). Her son Tito ends up representing her own failing to make the right choices, and signifies her self-resentment. Later in the film when she locks Tito in the transformer room she is fully aware of the danger she is putting him in, and when she loses the key (ambiguously intentionally) she has sealed his death warrant. When he electrocutes himself, wearing the significant red of a situational victim, Emmanuelle can't live with her guilt any longer and slits her wrists, but this is not just the guilt of killing her son, but the guilt of not being true to herself. Locking her self-resentment away doesn't work, and it comes back to kill her because she refuses to face it in spite of her earlier protestations that with Tito in tow, she is trying to make the best of a bad situation. Her words are noble, but they are betrayed by her actions which reflect what she really feels. This is where 'pro choice' and 'pro life' come to have equal significance beyond just having kids. Noé tells us that BIRTH IS A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY and it's one that Emmanuelle has squandered both for herself and her child. We cannot escape ourselves or our true nature and this is just as applicable for Emmanuelle as it is for Psyche, who escaped from Berlin but was ultimately unable to escape from herself.<br/><br/>For those who are well versed in the works of Noé, Climax doesn't offer anything that new: it's Noé in typically extreme fashion exploring themes of life death, pain, suffering and all the ways in which these influence our lives. What's most important is the storytelling and symbolism which Noé injects into the film, showing us that there are signs and warnings all around us in our daily lives telling us to enjoy and savour the positivity of existence. The long dance take at the beginning is similarly savoured by the camera, and us as viewers, and in giving us this indulgence Noé shows us both how fantastic and impressive life can be, but also how much there is to waste if we're not careful or thankful enough."

 Gaspar Noe plays with your mind and your emotions in every way possible. The nightmarish cineatography, the unsetting colours apperaing in the screen, the horryfiyng soundtrack ( Supernature is spectacular!), the the non-stop movement of the camera and the incredible work by the cast- which mainly consists of kids between 18 to 23 years old who only do sorts of krump dance-offs or voguing balls mash up in a 1 and a half hour film which is as electrifiyng as hell. 
I really admire such films, that are able to make you part of their universe, even if it is totally odd and ablnormal, and force you to feel one of with the situation, thus creating a completely genuine cinematic expericence.
 I also love the filrst dance scene, which is actually a single shot and you can actually see the amount of effort that the actors put to take you by the hand and pull you in their own world filled with fleeting plesures. And this is what CLIMAX really is.
 It's horrifying but beautiful, sick but true, dark but colourful, dead but alive.

Never in my life have I hated so much experiencing something I adored with a passion. And that's Climax. I never want to see it again, and that's surprising, because I never had a problem handling dark themes or gore in films, but this was something else.

"AhmadAbabaei","10","13","24","1 March 2019"," From paradise to hell
","Climax is a French-Belgian movie written and directed by Argentinian-French filmmaker Gaspar Noé. It is apparently based on real event that date back to mid-90s. Climax is the insanity, hallucination, and fear of using acid; it has an ordered chaos; it's a cocktail of panic and music that starts with dancing, then reaches terror, and finally collapses into frenzy; it is aesthetically admirable and ethically questionable; it's migration from paradise to hell; it's the downfall of human civilization; it's the realization of savagery. Climax is dance-inducing, dizziness-causing, headache-giving, nauseating, annoying, exhausting, musical, breathtaking, unharnessed, excessive, inhuman, filthy, harsh, bloodstained, colorful, high-contrasted, noisy, thrilling, crowded, torturing, revenge-seeking, nightmarish, abusive, intruding, shameful, horror, inverse, obscure, frosty and hot; it takes you to death.

","Climax is an intense and hallucinating experience. I watched this film at the Sydney Film Festival last year and still can't get over it. In my opinion, Climax must be the second or third best film I watched in 2018. Once again, Gaspar Noe has reinvented his very characteristic style to create another unconventional arthouse film. As most of Noe's films, Climax is disturbing, polarising and highly controversial. Meaning that it's not a film for everyone. Having said that, for the ones that appreciate experimental cinema, this is a must-see.<br/><br/>Climax is an absolute audio-visual feast. The dance sequences, beats and long shots are beautifully assembled, creating a hypnotising and electrifying spectacle. As the film unfolds, the characters all fall into a frightening atmosphere of tension and death. Climax represents the multiplicity of human emotions at the same time: euphoria, joy, sadness, surprise and fear. Every frame of this film is composed with amazing cinematography and perfect editing. This is a film to be watched on the big screen with the best audio system. Climax is an absolute masterpiece and I will never forget it.<br/><br/>Score: 10/10<br/><br/>FJ Medina"

","Wow.<br/><br/>I've been a massive Gaspar Noe fan since I first watched 'Irreversible' at age 11 (I sure regretted that experience), and was crazy excited to hear he was working on a new movie. A group of dancers drinking sangria laced with potent LSD? And their slow descent into madness is shown through their dance moves? Sign me up!<br/><br/>Then I watched it. And there was honestly nothing that could have fully prepared me for the ride this took me on. I haven't been so disturbed by a movie since 'Hereditary,' and honestly, this is kind of on the same level as that movie (for me, at least).<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint alone, this movie is a masterpiece. The camerawork is inventive and often hypnotic, and even the sound design and subtle CGI elevate the moods and frenetic energy of the dancers. Speaking of, the dancers all do an amazing job; their dialogue is almost entirely improvised, which makes their conversations feel so natural and real. The soundtrack, of course, is the main star of the film and will entertain you at first, then utterly disturb you when you see how the characters act (particularly the Giorgio Moroder song near the end).<br/><br/>Any emotions Noe wanted to convey, he succeeded in doing so. While not every character gets as much screen time as the next, they are all interesting and add something to the film. Every time a character takes a sip of sangria, you get a bigger pit in your stomach. When everyone realizes what's going on, everything goes off the rails and we're subjected to an absolutely horrific and chill-inducing experience unlike any other. This movie blew my mind, I really don't know what to say. I've seen a lot of negative reviews for this movie, and I kind of understand why. This is 100% not a movie for everyone. The dialogue gets graphic at times, there are a few scenes of really shocking violence that some might not be able to handle and there are no moments that alleviate the constant tension once the going gets good. But for those familiar with Noe's works and those who are willing to take a wild ride, Climax is one of the best films you'll ever experience."

","I loved Enter the Void (2009) and Irreversible (2002) and i knew that Gaspar Noé will make, this time too, an unforgettable movie. Through atypical technique which he masters terribly good, with psychedelic visuals and a heavy but dynamic load of suspense, succeeds to put in image the violent creeps of the world hidden in the human mind at certain moments of implacable delusion.
Important in this film is the hue - the contrast between the white of snow outside and the wild colour inside, the neon cinema which spread shades of reddish darkness (like a bleeding nightmare running through the hallways), the racial and sexual diversity. The whole dance floor looks like a sangria - the drink that represented the center point, the mechanism that made everything spin in a chaotic circle of dementia.
The eye of the camera reveals incredible dance skills, a hypnotizing choreography and the paranoia that grows in intensity to climax.
Life and death presented as terrifying experiences and the endless music that maintains an exhausting atmosphere, make you remember this movie a long time, make you live with it, love it, but did not want to see it again.
If this movie succeeds in making the spectator uncomfortable on this exhausting journey, Gaspar Noé will fall asleep satisfied."

The audience has to figure out what the film truly means and what is actually happening.<br/><br/>The never-ending soundtrack is the heart beat of the entire film It is very loud and intrusive that accentuates the very insane mood of the film.

While not the biggest fan of Vice I found the portrayal of what it's like to do psychedelic drugs in a bad setting quite on point and I think they were the right choice to make a film like this. Of course there is some extremity here and there baring in mind this was based off a true story where nothing really happened, but just the right amount. Excellent shock value and not nearly over the top.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film. Not for the uptight kind though"

","If you want to watch this movie you should prepare yourself because Climax is not your grandmother's bedtime story and definitely not a movie for everybody.
Take for example the first 45 minutes which is basically one big dance scene - - at this point I would like to note that the dance performed by the actors is easily one of the best group dance I 've ever seen in a movie - - Also here you get to know the characters, the relationships between them and you can hear and see some realistically written and performed dialogues.
Interestingly the inciting incident happens at the middle of the movie, and then all hell brakes loose... paranoia, fear, violence, madness. Gaspar Noé brings us the living nightmare which stands till the ending of the movie. These scenes are like we just watchng the neverending videolog from Hell of the Event Horizon. That's a little exaggerated I know, but that's what I thought while I was watching the movie. The camera scans around the location's every half-lighted corridors and dark corners, and thanks to the director's clear and definite direction, it finds something interesting and scary thing everywhere. By the movie ends, only a few lost souls are dancing.
Technically and in creating the athmosprere this movie is impeccable. If you're into for something different than the mainstream, this is your type of movie."
"antimog","10","7","12","23 April 2019"," Masterpiece
","The cinema of Gaspar Noé reconfirms itself as a unique visual experience, its long-awaited return has not disappointed expectations and brings us back to the world of psychedelics as only he can do.
We are in the 90s and a dance company meets in an abandoned building to practice and have fun. The title is clear, it is a real ascendant climax, everything flows in the right direction until they start one at a time to feel bad and the atmosphere becomes more and more anxious. The reason is discovered shortly after, in the buffet next to the improvised dance floor LSD is placed in the sangria, creating panic, death and destruction among the dancers.<br/><br/>Gaspar Noé is a provocateur, a director from whom you never know what to expect exactly, but you know he will be able to enchant you and horrify you. Trying to make comparisons with his filmography we can say that he has extreme scenes that can be traced back to Seoul Contre Tous and Irreversible, which remain his cinematographic apex, and Enter the Void as use of the video camera and theme, so he places himself in the middle. As for the cinema in general, it is a fusion of Salò by Pasolini and Step Up, a crazy combination that works.<br/><br/>I think the purpose of this film is to disorient, starting with the credits that appear first on the screen, followed by the opening credits 10 minutes later. I particularly appreciated the fusion of psychedelics and the fully articulated dancers, I am not kidding about hypnosis, anyone who has seen that Enter the Void trip will know what I mean. The physical skill of the actors and their naturalness make their mental failure caused by drugs very credible, regressing in a few minutes to primitive beings and making the climax explode in all its delicious violence. For the rest there is not much to say, we have the usual long and wonderful sequence plans that follow the actors, we have an omnipresent care for the lights and colors, in particular the red, in short everything that was expected from the genius of Noah.
Viewing is not recommended, it is mandatory."
"subxerogravity","7","7","12","15 March 2019"," It was a spectacular movie with a great beat.
","It was that beat that made everything consistent as Climax successfully attempts to mix up the format of a narrative and toss us off a bit.<br/><br/>(For some reason) set in the mid-90s (Maybe because this type of House music was really popular during this time),a dance troop being assembled for some music event are getting their groove on when someone spikes the punch with some LSD, which has a bizarre variety of effects on the group. It's like an Urban Legend come true.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, there is not as many dance segments in the film as I would think, tidbits here and there but not flooded with it, but that score was impressive, and had me bumping. It's like the film composer was a DJ just spinning the sounds of Daft Punk (and a few other dudes from that house era that I'm not going to pretend to know). Maybe that is what happen because that's what it overall felt like.<br/><br/>I think the movie was cast with french dancers (Not actors). The only one I knew was Sofia Boutella, who had supporting roles in some great action movies like the Kingsmen and Atomic Blonde (She was also in Star Trek Beyond) Not much acting was needed, the filmmaker just turned the camera on some of these kids and just let them talk naturally (or at least that's what it seems like cause, you know, I don't speak french). There was actually more talk than there was dance, before the movie got really odd with the heavy trip.<br/><br/>I've never done LSD myself and in fairness, these kids seem to have done so much in one dose that I'm surprise the film was not far more crazy than it actually was.<br/><br/>A simple story made interesting by a kinetic flow to the narrative, sexy people in motion, and a full proof plan to make sure you cannot just up an leave without sitting though the list of everyone credited in making the film.<br/><br/>Nice!"

","Pros: Amazing choreography. The opening scene really got me (as did the intro credits roll part). Very good acting, and a creative use of camera. Loved the first act of the movie.<br/><br/>Cons: A story with no conclusion. The ""brave"" use of camera was kind of overemphasized to the point where it got exhausting. Reveal of who was guilty of pouring LSD in Sangria gave us no satisfaction, no conclusion, and the movie takes such a big curve in the second act, that everything that happened in the first act is utterly meaningless."
"TheVictoriousV","10","11","22","3 March 2019"," Unequivocally the best film of 2019 (already)
","Gaspar Noé is one of the boldest, most unmistakable artists of all time. His films are so relentlessly horrifying, on visual, emotional, and even auditory levels, that they oft induce literal nausea (but still impress). Their colors are stark, their actors show authentic agony, and their camera work is ambitiously executed, including takes that last upwards of 30 minutes. His camera has its own life, even if we don't always feel as if we're on the mortal plane.<br/><br/>Climax, his latest piece of French extremism, is not as hallucinatory as you may expect; it never lets us see that which is seen by its drugged protagonists, but simply observing their gradual descent into madness and anarchy in an isolated space via the hovering camera is still an outlandish experience. This is, of course, largely due to the acting. Even when the shots are seemingly endless and contain 20-ish actors doing things at once and several subplots intertwining, no-one in the cast or camera crew ever miss a beat. Or the special effects crew for that matter.<br/><br/>It may qualify as one of the most flawlessly coordinated movies of the past 20 years, although I must note that many scenes (excluding the early, astonishing dance number) are improvised - so many, in fact, that in spite of its intricacies, Climax proved a relatively brisk production. The horrific intro in the snow was only added because, well, it had been snowing.<br/><br/>The plot concerns a diverse class of dancers who, on a cold and dark night in the year 1996, gather in an abandoned school to celebrate a succesful rehearsal, only to find that the alcohol has been spiked with LSD and things go to Hell and beyond. There are some nods here to the works of Noe's old friend and fellow filmmaker Dario Argento, including a clearly visible Suspiria case during the prologue (I also spotted ""Labyrinth Man"", The Possession, and something by Fritz Lang).<br/><br/>Most famous on the cast list is probably Sofia Boutella, known to overseas filmgoers for Star Trek Beyond (i.e. the one film from the new batch that actually feels like Star Trek) and the infinitely insipid Mummy reboot. I want this to be the film that truly opens the door for her and showcases her skill. But then, the acting all-around is unthinkably good.<br/><br/>The setting, as I wrote above, is tight and isolated, and the music played in this place is perfectly selected. Trippy songs by the likes of Aphex Twin, Coh, and Wild Planet go well with the unnerving sounds of frequent Noe collaborator Thomas Bangalter.<br/><br/>Noe has previously made Irreversible (which I found too disorienting on my first viewing and need to finish) and Enter the Void, which I've only seen a handful of times but confidently include amongst my favorite movies of all time. People weren't too hot on Love, but this is no doubt a return to form.<br/><br/>I saw someone call Climax an anti-drug film, irately so. I believe it is only anti drugs in the same way that Requiem for a Dream is an ""anti-drug film"". If straightforwardly depicting the effects of acid makes a film ""anti drugs"", take it up with the drugs. Noe has first-hand experience with illegal substances; they inspired him to master the hallucinogenic imagery of Enter the Void and Irreversible. He seems the right man to portray their users.<br/><br/>I don't care that we are only 3 months in. This is, unequivocally, my favorite movie of the entire year and may yet become even more than that. It is directed, shot, acted, and presented without fault, creating an experience that (despite, again, lacking outright surreal images) make nightmares seem escapist. I expected to utterly love it and it still went beyond. If it was mathematically possible for me to give it more than a 10/10 and place it higher on my list than number 1, I would. My God, Noe, you absolute madman!"
"buster75219","9","5","8","27 May 2019"," Take the ""trip""
","If you made your way through Gaspar Noe's film ""Irreversible""(congratulations are in order if you did) then you'll most likely be able to ""take a trip"" (literally) along with ""Climax's hip, slick and cool French dance company as they spiral their way down a ""rabbit hole"" the size of the San Andreas Fault.
You'll find yourself wanting to immediately compare ""Climax"" to ""Susperia"" (at least I found myself doing) which is quite understandable as Noe' uses the same ""eye popping"", brilliantly shot, red, yellow and green palate from which to use, as well as both film's protagonist(s) encompassing the same paranoiac behaviors as they search for any form of elucidation for the mania/hysteria that engulfs them.
Both directors use the setting of a dancer's dormitory-studio where thing are ""not always as they seem"" where their surroundings are meant to provide a ""safe space"" for each films' characters to dwell in, as well as for the audience to feel a sense of familiar comfort which is, ultimately shattered, to say the least.
Noe' frames his opening ""video"" interviews between what appears to be his favorite books, films, scripts which give hints (if we are paying close attention) to many of the film's cinematic ""winks and nods"" to such directors (Noe's influences?) as Godard, Lynch, Bunuel and Argento-just to name a few!
One of the many videos stacked surrounding ""Climax""s opening ""video"" interview sequence is Zulawski's ""Possession"" (1971). Remember, I said to watch very carefully for the various Easter eggs, hints and homages. It is as if Noe' is begging us to notice his knowledge/expertise of film history and aesthetics as if to say, ""Look here! Did you catch that?""! We begrudgingly witness (Argentinian dancer/actress) Sofia Boutella's descent into madness that rivals Isabelle Adjani's (1981) Palme d'Or best actress win/performance. Boutella thrashes herself, not unlike Adjani, into the claustrophobic barriers of a hellish corridor that even the likes of Dante' would appreciate. I found myself hypnotized (drugged?) not unlike the character's, while viewing most of the film's somewhat relentless harrowing and hideous sequences that are strategically juxtaposed to the Electro-industrial, Hip Hop and Disco soundtrack (download on Spotify-great for cardio!).
Keep your eyes peeled (no pun intended) for the director's insertion, amongst the video stack, of Bunuel's ""Un Chien Andalou"" which serves as a thematic warning that we, like those who originally viewed the 1929 masterpiece, will have our eyes opened ""literally"" to a new way of viewing cinema. Like a Siren's splendidly abhorrent cry luring sailors towards the rocks, we too are seduced by ""Climax""s psychedelic call towards our cinematic gorgeous demise."

Fantastically lit with Noe's neon style, we are brought into the heat of this story through the spinning frames.<br/><br/>It was perhaps slightly too long with sequences that could have been cut shorter and some dialogue cut out to hide some of the slightly questionable acting. However this doesn't really seem to affect the film, as they are all on drugs, so their lacking of technique at times fits well.<br/><br/>Me and my friends left the cinema and couldn't talk for atleast 10 minutes, which tells you how much of an effect this film has on you!<br/><br/>Go and watch it, you'll probably learn something about humanity, and if not atleast something about great filmmaking!<br/><br/>Ignore the bad reviews, I expect they couldn't handle the psychological trauma and the bad ratings are a defence mechanism as they couldn't really comprehend the vision."

","I wont be taking LSD anytime soon until this horrific darkness of a film gets flushed to the back of my psyche. Needless to say not all acid trips need to be dark, they can easily be toward the light given the right environment.
Gaspar Noé tackles a story under Vice Studios about a school of french dance students who don't know how much LSD they have taken because one of the students has laced the sangria bowls with the drug. We learn at the start of the film that most of the students have little to no experience with hallucinatory substances setting the perfect stage for a film about paranoia, madness, and sex. Noé evokes ""bad trip"" drug abuse similar to Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas but without the visuals. The approach to the story here is direct as we often see now when the characters are interviewed by the camera and then their stories continue. No CGI in this film to capture the effects of the drug, it is all actors giving their all, which I'm sure was a monumental challenge. Great acting and excellent cinematography keeps the viewer engaged for its 90 minute running time. good luck watching this one. Noé has done it again."

Everyone is moving, and the scenes flow into each other as if it was one long continuous take. The photography is colorful and spellbinding. I was pleased that the cinematographer from Enter the Void (which is one of my favorite films) joined with Gaspar again. The dancers are remarkable for their talent, clothing (or lack thereof), fitness and freestyle movements. The camera goes above, close-up and spins round them, mimicking and enhancing their movements and energy. Members of the cast that are not professionals were culled from Paris night clubs and YouTube. The hypnotic, pulse quickening beats come from Cerrone, MARRS and Aphex Twin.

This movie tries so hard to be politically incorrect, it's beyond depicable.<br/><br/>I love the IMDB game that occurs with these controversial movies :
People who appreciate will be like ""don't listen to bad reviews"" and vice-versa. Lol.
Hey, listen to what you want to listen. This is just my review, for God's sake.<br/><br/>What Gaspar Noé should understand is that filming people on drugs doesn't make either a story or a good movie.
Or maybe with less that 20 characters, like Blow or Fear and loathing in Las Vegas, or his own movie Enter the Void...
Why would spend time with characters if we won't follow them again ? Why filming 5 minutes of random people instead of creating good characters and follow them ?
Have you ever heard of character development ? Of course you did Noe, because Enter the Void is amazing, so what in the hell happened here ???<br/><br/>My 3 stars belong to the director of photography. The camera roams around the characters and gives a surreal, dreamy atmosphere which relates to the drugs.
It's the only interesting thing in this movie. Camera work.<br/><br/>Acting is hysterical and really tiring.<br/><br/>Structure is like this :
20mn dance
Some credits (???)
2-hours unwanted drug meltdown.
Fun fact : I wrote 2-hours but I just verified and it's actually 1h36. That's how boring it is !
And all of this interrupted by weird statements on black screens, which add nothing to the movie except satisfying artsy weirdos from cinema critique.<br/><br/>I like the esthetics of dance in cinema...but this one is grotesque. It lasts like 20mn and you will feel every one of them.<br/><br/>Basically we follow a dance club doing a party after a rehearsal. They like sex and drugs...like in every Noé movie. I liked to discover this kind of atmospheric cinema but the story is really getting old at this point.
It feels like Noe is really struggling to renew his work, and find new ideas.
Not only it's still about sex and drugs, but it's not even as good as the previous movies like Enter the Void.<br/><br/>This movie is too experimental to be a good story, and yet it's still a movie with a story and characters.
He should have done either a 100% experimental movie or not. This movie is an in-between, awkard attempt at being artsy enough to go to Cannes festival and still get enough production funds to be released worldwide.<br/><br/>There is no climax, at the end they just get to sleep after their psychotic drug effect, and police come. It's ridiculous.

YOU CAN'T MAKE A MOVIE ABOUT A CERTAIN THEME WITHOUT HAVING LIFE EXPERIENCE ON IT. Clearly Gaspar has no idea or experience on LSD. There is no type of LSD that would have those effects... And what's with the upside down thing... seriously...?

"ethancarmanmoore","9","20","51","24 September 2018"," Climax (2018): Review
","A group of dancers practising for their American tour celebrate while unknowingly drinking LSD-laced Sangria; what could go wrong? Gaspar Noé is back with his newest, and possibly most accessible, film. Noé has been on a list of directors that I would label 'watch cautiously' ever since I originally saw his film Irréversible (2002) years ago. It was, and still is, one of the most emotionally detrimental films I had ever seen. With his use of amazingly unique cinematography, lighting, and camera movements, Noé immediately peaked my interest. I thought he knocked it out of the park with that film and hasn't matched up to it since. While Enter the Void (2009) is an extremely interesting film visually and conceptually, the characters and story just did not work for me. The same can be said for his film Love (2015).<br/><br/>Climax is an extravaganza of dance, sex, chaos, and, the most importantly, panic. It is comparable to one long, 96 minute, looming panic attack. But in a good way. The film reels you in with a wicked-long dance number with blaring synth music and it is honestly enthralling to watch. It is one long beautiful take and it prepares you for the style that encompasses the rest of the film. Noé can make a shot last 10-15 minutes without it coming across as if he is showing off. It takes real skill to set up these complex shots that last for so long and to pull them off flawlessly without having the actors mess up a line or having the continuity be broken. His long takes simply engage you as an audience member and make you feel as if you are part of the situation. It feels natural.<br/><br/>Seriously though, beware. This film is emotionally exhausting. It has a way of sticking a horrible feeling in your gut and keeping it there until long after the movie is over. It is a spectacle of a bad acid trip. The actors, camera work, and storytelling make it feel as if you are a witness to this chaotic event that is taking place. Sofia Boutella is fantastic in the film and so is the rest of the cast. Every character feels so believable and honest. There is a lot of information given about the characters within the first 20 minutes or through dialogue which can be a bit confusing considering there is a lot of them and we do not immediately learn all of their names. However, I think that this will make for rewarding rewatches.<br/><br/>'Climax' is much more accessible compared to any of Noe's previous works. It is not ultra-violent, nor is it an excess in experimental filmmaking. It is a fairly straightforward story with fantastic performances, beautiful cinematography, and unbelievable camera work. It is by far his best film since Irréversible and may be his best film, period. Although multiple viewings will have to confirm this. It is enthralling in every regard and should be seen for the first time in a theatre if possible. I cannot wait to see this one for the second time."
"torrascotia","1","10","22","7 March 2019"," More French Arty Garbage.
","This is an extraordinarily bad movie experience.
This is from same director who made Irreversible, the movie which prompted mass walk outs and for good reason. He seems to enjoy disgusting people with violence most would not class as entertainment. We yet again are subjected to extended discussions about anal sex which seems to be a theme in this directors work, to what purpose? It seems its all about intentionally trying to provoke disgust ""in the name of art"". In Climax we see pregnant women being kicked in the stomach, small children drugged and electrocuted and incest between siblings.
That is the tone of the movie and it beggars belief that this has any high ratings on here at all, or it says alot about the moral compass of those who enjoyed this trash. Its basically aimed at a pretentious audience who believe they have superior taste to others because they think ""enjoy"" things the majority rightly ignore or that because the movie is in French its somehow above critique. If this had come from Hollywood or if more people knew about its content it would have been slated.
The film itself doesn't amount to much. Its based around a group of dancers, we initially see them being interviewed then it moves to the dancefloor. An extended stylised dance sequence takes place before a party where most the dancers drink a sangria spiked with LSD. The remainder of the film is basically each dancer having a bad LSD trip and the final act is just plain nonsense with everyone writhing around on the floor while a red strobe flashes and camera is shot upside down. Oooh arty.
The odd thing is that none of the dancers seem to have any clue as to how LSD affects individuals, they all have the same reaction which is negative. This rings hollow. Anyone who has attended a rave or music festival where hundreds if not thousands of people may be on drugs do not all decide to try and kill each other. Its not a realistic premise. Nor is the premise that despite bad things happening they would all decide to hang around in the same room. Its difficult to make a movie about being trapped with others when the doors are all unlocked. Fail.
There really isn't anything about this which is positive, its odd that quite a few well know electronic musicians agreed to have their music attached to such a bad movie. That being said the musical choices of each artists don't exactly fit well with the scenes they are used in. Although the soundtrack is probably what attracts some of the audience.
Oh yeah the closing credits of the movie are at the start and some of them are written upside down or backwards. If you think thats ""edgy"" then you may like but if you just find it tedious trying to read upside down or backwards then head for the exit because it just gets worse,way worse after the credits roll."

","""Climax"" is an award-winning 2018 film and the newest work by writer and director Gaspar Noé from Argentina, but yeah his works are almost always in the French language and so is this one here. French film buffs will probably recognize more cast members than I did during these almost 100 minutes. The only name familiar to me is Sofia Boutella and she plays also the character that is closest to be a main protagonist and probably has more screen time than everybody else in here. But it is an ensemble piece for sure. This is about a group of young dancers practicing in a snowed-in house in no man's land somewhere, but quickly ending the practice and moving on to party hard afterward after a bit of talk. And this is where the film gains steam really and becomes as excessive as you would expect it from a Noé movie. It is very graphic again, this time more in terms of violence than in terms of sexuality. For example we have a relatively young child take a drink from sangria that is laced with acid and we hear him suffer afterward, perhaps die even. It is not 100% clear as we only hear him behind a thick wall. And a young pregnant woman is kicked and punched several times in the stomach, which was most painful for me to watch. Still, there are some boobs visible, but yeah that is all really apart from some making out. We also see said woman cutting herself deep with a knife in her arms and also her face, which I found surprising as I could have expected this reaction had she taken from the LSD drink too, but she didn't, so yeah did not make that much sense to me. Then again, what is supposed to make sense in a Noé movie!?<br/><br/>It is all about the style and the immediate reactions you are experiencing to what you see on screen. Which can be extreme. And if you have seen some stuff from Noé like ""Irréversible"" of course, then you will know that he is not a great fan of chronology and this is also true here, especially very early on, even if it is more chronological than most other stuff from him. Tough to watch at times for sure with the scenes I mentioned earlier, but if you manage to stomach them and sit through them, then you will be rewarded with a pretty good film. It's not my favorite film by Noé, but I enjoyed it. The longer the film goes, the less important it also becomes who laced the LSD in fact, so it is never really a crime movie, even if there are indicators it could have been Boutella's character at the very end. I liked the reference back to the beginning when we see somebody drugging herself through her eyes, something another character has described very early in the movie and yeah watching it is far more intense than just hearing it. Besides, pay attention to the films shown very early on when we hear those interviews with all the characters. Anyway, another aspect I finally want to mention is how this film can be seen as a parallel to sex, with how it all starts and moves slowly towards the ecstatic (drug-induced) climax before at the very end, there is the silence, the calming down, the resting, even the (little) death for one, no two characters I believe. I don't think this is a coincidence, but it is something you may want to experience yourself and think about it. While I did enjoy the film for the most part, it is not one I would want to watch soon again in the near future. But I do give it a thumbs-up and recommend checking it out. To grown-ups only though. Noé delivered again, even if I did not like it as much as the raters here on imdb did and also not as much as critics loved it, even if it certainly oozes creativity frequently. Go see it, preferably on the big screen."

"nairtejas","7","13","32","1 November 2018"," MAMI Review: Climax (7 Stars)
","There is so much energy in Gaspar Noe's Climax that I wanted to jump out of my seat and start dancing to the beats of the continuously humming techno soundtrack. Sadly, my fellow audience wouldn't have let me, but deep inside I believe that if I actually did, they would have only joined me. Such is the power of Noe's beautiful, philosophical, and insane techno-dance thriller that hypnotizes from the first frame itself through its immensely talented actors to the anti-climactic credits placement and shots of textual philosophical one-liners to eventually the conveyance of the moral of the short story. The story about a group of French dancers practicing in an old abandoned school premises for an upcoming tournament so that they can compete with the Yankees and show who rules the dancing world takes an ugly turn when the idiosyncratic characters - not one as same as the other - find out that their cocktail was laced with LSD by someone. Who? Why? These questions is in everyone's mind, but the music never stops and no one is in their right mind to sit and think and investigate. And by the time director Noe ends the shots - most of which are single takes - you realize that what you are seeing in front of you is the definition of intoxication and its consequences in its purest form. Climax is true madness and it will blow you away with its truthfulness. TN.<br/><br/>(Watched and reviewed at its India premiere at the MAMI Mumbai Film Festival.)"

Beautiful and brutal.<br/><br/>Technically and artistically it is splendid, it borders on perfection, but, the argument does not go that far. Presents a choral cast and then focus on a single character. We know the motivations and fears of the characters through a brief interview at the beginning of the film and through the psychotropic trip. This leaves us with a film that is more empty than it seems.<br/><br/>When he talks about human drama, the plot is great, however, when he leaves this drama, the film falls apart.

","I think this may be the first IMDB review I've ever written. But I am so baffled by the high praise for this movie, I have to give my opinion on this movie.<br/><br/>First off, I saw Irreversible by this director over 10 years ago, and that movie was somewhat traumatizing to me. I actually had to look away during a couple different scenes and I never feel so repulsed by something in a movie that I have to look away, so that's saying something.<br/><br/>I heard only great things about Climax, and was cautiously excited to see it, mostly looking forward to how crazy it seemed it would be but also mentally preparing myself for anything that could possibly happen.<br/><br/>Then nothing happened. The very first (really last I guess) scene with the snow and person writhing around was the most interesting part of this movie, and we see that scene in the trailer. The dancing was cool, but gets tedious after awhile. It took forever for whatever the drug was (they mention LSD I think? But the way it makes them act doesn't really make sense) to kick in, and when it does, it's still tedious and just silly. I was hoping Gaspar Noe, the director, was going to film it in a way that made the audience almost feel the effect of the drug too, but his upside shots and shoddy handheld camerawork didn't bring me into the trip at all. I felt like I was watching mostly bad actors who've never done any drugs try to act like they were on drugs. The violence was very tame compared to what I was anticipating.<br/><br/>When it was over, I actually apologized to my husband for asking him to see it with me. We were both really shocked how bad and boring it was. I should have learned by now that review aggregators are not to be trusted, yet I still believed the baffling hype."

"noahgibbobaker","9","2","3","7 June 2020"," Intoxicating and brilliant
","Climax is a story about a group of dancers who have their drink spiked with LSD, the night only goes downhill from there. I loved watching these people change and begin behaving extremely irrationally. These people go from being mostly friendly with each other to very aggressive towards other becoming extremely violent and making people do completely insane things as the film gets more insane as well. Everything about Climax becomes crazy by the 40 minute mark, the camera does not stop moving at all from this point, it is upside-down for very long periods of time. Even when the camera is not filming upside-down every shot is still very interesting, whether it's showing impressive dancing for following someone around as the mingle with the crowd something interesting is always happening. Every performance is great, so good In fact I could not pick out a best or worst performance. Having so many long takes and pulling off some very difficult dance moves in pretty much all of them along with acting high on LSD would have been a nightmare but as I said the cast was great and pulled this off flawlessly. There are so many unique aspects shown in this film that just don't come up that often, like the Birdman esq long takes or the completely original dance choreography. All the technical aspects were also brilliant, I could not point out an obvious problem with these either. I should also mention there are some quite horrifying sequences in this film that personally tend to enjoy but these may put some viewers off. Despite all of this praise, there are a couple of things I did not enjoy . I first being some of the convocations felt a bit pointless. Second even though I loved the dancing in this film there was a lot of it at the start of the movie and it got a bit repetitive at a point, it became much more entertaining once the film picked up, but I feel a couple minutes of dancing could have been cut. Other than these two minor issues I loved the rest of this film and highly recommend you watch it."

When you first begin the film it kind of whispers as you watch slowly creeping along as the characters ramble and speak giving you a glimpse of what they're mind may percieve. But all bets are off once the stage is set and after 5 mins. Of revving the engines the gas peddle is smashed and like a rocket the film blasts off. The dialogue of this film is so jaded and amazingly fresh. As you watch a lifestyle to most that's absolutely foreign and yet each scene reveals elements you can relate.

The realism of this film is terrifyingly unmatched and it doesn't take the peasant road of filming it through found footage to try and fake feeling real.. No it's authenticity is the dance group who some are admittedly just meeting each other so as there relationship grows the viewers grow along with it amplifying a feel that's genuinely real and not rehearsed. There are so many characters to meet at once it may seem hard to distinguish on first glance but every character is tied to a specific style of dance and you get acquainted by watching them move. With amazing talent that everyone of them possess you feel an admiration and respect regardless of how much your really into dancing yourself. To say Gaspar Noe is a great director and writer would be a pitiful label to thrust upon his film that ignites a magnificence rarely achieved by the best filmmakers of all time. It may be compared to other films I really loved like ""SUSPIRIA"" to name one and I'm ok with that, It's fair game to compare but the feeling I got when the final shot turned white is way past and above any of those compared films whether it's the remake or original... 10 stars means one thing..

","Whilst as I can completely appreciate the cinematography, direction and (most impressive) the choreography this had the potential to be a truly well rounded and rather original horror movie. Unfortunately for me, even before trying to realistically portray something that is so personally subjective as a bad reaction to a hallucinogen, there's the strong argument against having actors spend excessive amounts of screentime screaming and moaning at the camera... All in all, worth a watch if you can make it past someone losing the plot and screaming for what feels like ten minutes."

Choreography, camera, music, lighting and story meshed in perfect harmony to drag you into a thrilling horror-trip. It actually feels like you are tripping along, knowing things will get worse and more intense with no chance of coming down. Each of the characters can be found at any party in real life and their feelings are portrayed in an authentic way. The fact that the actors are more professional dancers than actors plus the short script make it so realistic. Especially the camera seems to move like it's intoxicated as we know from 'Enter the Void'. The soundtrack is well chosen, with songs which makes you wanna dance, but also get more and more terrifying. The songs recorded on vinyl and the volume decreasing when we move away from the speakers add to the atmosphere. All in all this film is disturbing, a classic NoÃ©. Not as morally shocking as 'Seul contre tous' or 'Irreversible', thus way scarier. It was a pleasure to watch such a piece of cinematic perfection. Can't wait for the BluRay to come out!"

Full-on techno culture crossed with full-on psychological horror. It's completely one-of-a-kind. I had a massive smile painted on my face through the majority of the film. This made me feel so much more than Luca Guadagnino's recent Suspiria remake, especially through it's incredible dance sequences - I couldn't help but groove in my seat during the majority of them. The soundtrack was fully up my alley, from Dopplereffekt to Legowelt to Aphex Twin to Giorgio Moroder - all the best in techno/electro. The diversity of the ensemble cast was impossible not to admire - so much personality to take in. The cinematography was absurdly impressive as always with Noe, functioning like you're watching through the eyes of a wandering ghost or almost another voiceless character in the room, effectively making you feel like the majority of the film is happening in ONE shot, without cutting.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of film as an art form, or simply put, really INTENSE movies - you NEED to go see this ASAP, in the theater. This is a theater movie, not a watch-at-home movie! I will absolutely be seeing it a second time in the theater!<br/><br/>Avoid this movie if you can't handle relentless psychological horror. Though it made me incredibly happy, this is the kind of movie that could trigger a certain claustrophobia for those who suffer from certain anxieties.<br/><br/>It's MINDBLOWING! Noe has done it again. I can't say any more!"

This movie has the best sequences I've seen in my life not to mention that picture and color palette which intensifies that atmosphere of the 90s.On the other hand it lacks character building and plot in general which it's very disappointed but that doesn't matter when you want to show the reality of human behavior in such a raw way."

","Climax locks a bunch of young dancers in a school at night, drugs them with spiked sangria, and watches them slowly lose their minds. That's pretty much all one can say without giving away the hallucinatory horrors that await anyone who decides to watch this movie.<br/><br/>At first, the film was so sexualized that it seemed to be building into some gigantic group orgy or something. Much to my surprise, it goes the complete opposite direction and goes into full-on nightmarish horror land where people are locked outside in the freezing snow, women are forced to miscarry, fights break out, children are electrocuted, and people's hair catches on fire.<br/><br/>The real star of the film is the cinematography. Bathed in colored lights, Climax is told within a series of just a few seemingly unbroken shots, giving the film a dreamlike and claustrophobic feeling. The work here is truly a marvel.<br/><br/>Climax is more endurance test and experience than your usual film and it's certainly one I won't forget.

","I expected an erotically charged fever dream full of twisting paranoia, complex choreography and intermingled expressions of lighting, sound, and visual excellence. You know, something that would live up to the simple yet potentially good premise, and serve as an appropriate vehicle for a movie using dance to explore themes of decadence, loss of control, and fear, all of which can be skewed as inherently sexual.<br/><br/>What I got was a poorly paced, repetitive, and above all painfully tedious soup of mediocre and messy choreography, bad acting that was neither compelling or 'authentically' real, some very lazy stereotyping (now with extra by-the-numbers racism, misogyny, and homophobia!) in place of any actual characters or psychological avatars, and some relentlessly boring shots of the same group of people doing the same thing over and over and over again.<br/><br/>There are some relatively committed performances, and some very tired 'enfant terrible' tricks that one would assume Noe would have grown out of by now (flipping the camera upside down, putting the end credits first, and flicking up trite little title cards about the enormity of birth and death are just some of them), but nothing really makes up for the sense of wasted opportunity and, frankly, wasted time.<br/><br/>The best thing in this film is the lighting, and even that - by minute thirteen of a red- or green-drenched shot of the same hallway - wears its welcome very very thin.

The movie start with the probably the best dance performance I've seen in film so far, incredibly well executed, the camera and acting just transitions you so smoothly through that beautiful one-take and together with the music gets you in the mood for what's about the happen. The trip starts and it quickly gets ugly and gets worse from there. The camera work and scenery does a good jon of putting you into that feeling of panic and anxiety, you can feel the man has been through all of that himself.

If you got this movie on your watchlist you know what you' ll get in this department anyways, so nothing too hard to take.

This movie definitely made me feel in the party atmosphere and the mood they were in. At the beginning it was difficult for me to understand this movie ... at first I found the way of dancing of each character interesting, the context in which the party is located ... and I really loved the soundtrack, the costumes and the lighting of the movie; however, in general, this movie made me feel a bit of discomfort that I liked, i don't know why. It was the first movie I saw of this style, which caused me a not so comfortable feeling, but I liked to understand that this is part of our human nature and, if it weren't for some trigger we wouldn't show hidden parts of our interior.

the other personalities that consume us sometimes"

","As many others have said, this is a movie I don't ever want to see again. At some point, when the craze its at the highest; you became claustrophobic and anxious, where the director purposefully makes you part of the madness. Nonetheless, their harsh themes, terrifying camerawork, alarming relationships, subtext charged with political/sociological critiques and frightening dance choreographies, made me appreciate quite a lot this film. More than a film, this is a unique experience you will never see in another work, like, NEVER; the lens throughout we're driven in this hellish pseudo-high school dance is dominative, eats-it-all in a kind of magisterial way.<br/><br/>I really admire and praise the technical skill and intensity poured into this artwork. Without hesitation I would say this is a horror movie. idk why, people in the US are very accustomed to ""horror"" in a tacky format; with dull plot lines, one dimensional characters, lacking soul, full of cliches and cringy psychopaths (without its honorable exceptions, obviously). THIS, is another thing. Like, it shows the degradation of the human soul in a traumatic, terrifying and very scary format. This is real horror, citing Sartre: ""Hell is others"".<br/><br/>Gaspar Noe gives us here not what we want, or what we knew we want, but what it's needed. Art and more specifically, cinema needs to keep pushing the boundaries of storytelling, and this is a masterful example.<br/><br/>I understand not everyone will see it in a objective lens; but if you do, prepare to be thrilled, shocked, amazed and terrified. Prepare to travel through a dark place of madness."

","The woman will die from hypothermia if no one on a snowmobile passes by soon. She needs a St. Bernard, stat; and make sure that dog has a barrel filled with a good stiff brandy. Is she a dancer who got left behind at some bus pit stop? No. At the derelict old building that houses the dance repertoire, every performer is accounted for. The contemporary dance routine, fully staffed, goes off without a hitch. The choreographer seems pleased. So who is she then, this dislocated female in distress, screaming for help? The woman sees imported from another genre, a survival film; a plan crash survivor who went rogue from ""Alive"" in search of another diegesis, a parallel oasis with food and water. ""Climax"" isn't a survival film, is it? She's not the dancer who came in from the cold; she has no affiliation with this makeshift school for the performing arts. Right? ""Climax"" is not your father's ""Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo"". Form-wise, because of the disparateness between the opening scene and the first interior shot, the film could be construed as having the potentiality of being ""Blazing Saddles"" in slow-motion, but instead of a western, it's an adventure film that finds itself on a collision course with the musical. The woman's survival is of no consequence. The filmmaker forgets about her. If you forget about her, too, filmmaker Gaspar Noe will be pleased. ""Climax"" is a meta-commentary on American film. Noe's latest provocation, with its long uninterrupted takes is the antithesis of ""Flashdance"", whose editing style, informed and inspired by MTV, gave audiences short memories and made it harder for people to follow multiple narratives. The woman outside is an inconvenience. The woman's storyline; her progress towards the sanctuary of that derelict old building, gets discarded. She's a red herring. ""To dance right through your life,"" to pursue your dreams of dancing on Broadway, ""what a feeling"" that must be when you're young and your whole life is ahead of you. ""Climax"" never leaves the warehouse. No cutaways to feet in decline, dragging across the snow; feet do what do best, keep the dancer, vertical. It's the final rehearsal, a graduation day without the pomp and ceremony of a gown and cap. The French dance company is taking their show overseas where the lights are brighter and the stakes are higher. Clapping Americans are the most important clappers. The dancers know this. A little fame may be in store for them. But ""Climax"" gets off on the wrong foot, so to speak. Get rescued or die. That is not a pertinent question. Peel away the same old rags to riches storyline that's been told since a young hayseed with stars in his eyes said: ""Hey, my uncle has a barn. Let's put on a show."" More or less, ""Climax"" is Busby Berkeley's ""Babes in Arms"", set to Daft Punk and Aphex Twin.<br/><br/>Dance or die? It's not the question the choreographer asks, but it might as well be. ""What would you do without dance in your life,"" is the actual question posed to a candidate. ""Suicide,"" the female dancer answers to the off-camera voice, Lou(Soufelia Yahoub), the aforementioned choreographer, captured for posterity on VHS tape, during the sit-down part of the audition. Hyperbolic, a little, this patented response, meant to impress the interviewer, but not by much. When the talking head is finally attached the body in perpetual motion, Selva(Sofia Boutella) dances as if her life depended on it. It's the same psychical surgery for the others, as well. Do these young people have a contingency plan should their dreams not go according to their liking? Probably not. They are living in the moment, sweaty day to sweaty day, and party all night, every night. The goal is to be seen by the right people who can propel them from obscurity to stardom. The lights in their rehearsal space doesn't have a lot of wattage. Only the lights in their eyes are bright. The people who populate ""Climax"" are living in an Irene Cara fever dream. So which one is Cara's alter-ego Coco? They're all Coco; both the girls and the boys want to be the confident young woman with talent to burn, who sang, ""I'm going to live forever,"" in the 1980 Alan Parker film. ""Fame"" is fleeting, however, and so is life itself. What will Coco do if her embryonic career as a popular singer doesn't pan out? Alex(Jennifer Beals), the flash dancer, has a trade to fall back on. ""What a feeling,"" it must be to know that you can weld. Soldering copper pipes can wait. Hard hat, blow torch, lunch pail, thermos; the accoutrements of a blue-collar worker can stay where it is, untouched, posing for a still life. It's New York or bust; it's time to get out of Pittsburgh. But in Coco's case, Parker suggests, fame may potentially be of the infamous kind. People won't remember her name; they'll remember her alias' name, if even that. At the performance arts high school, Coco has friends and associates. Doris, Ralph and Leroy are her friends, but her collaborator, Bruno Martelli(Lee Curreri) is her associate. Bruno, the portrait of an iconoclast as a young man, arrives at the performing arts school with his synthesizers; his futurist mindset, an affront to establishment types such as Professor Shorofsky(Albert Hague), a proponent of baroque instruments. The proto-EDM artist, in some respects, can be characterized as a forerunner to Daddy(Kiddy Smile), the commonwealth dancers' deejay. Both are part of the vanguard, revolutionaries who make traditional musical outfits ranging from orchestras to four-piece bands obsolete. But whereas Daddy can be a band, who not only spins and manipulates vinyl records, and most importantly, ingratiates himself within the collective whole, as when he leaves his exalted perch behind the turntable to bust a few moves of his own, crossing the boundary between master and servant; Bruno, conversely, likes the concentrated ascendancy that comes with rewriting the rules in his own image, telling Shorofsky: ""Who needs an orchestrar? You can do it all with a keyboard, an amp, and enough power,"" as a member of the new order. He doesn't need sheet music of the old masters. He doesn't need a conductor. He broke the baton in two. The sheet music is in tatters; the old masters are granules of putrescent dust in a coffin. He writes the songs, alone. Fast-forward to 1996. Oh, no, the DJ is on acid. Somebody spiked the sangria. Daddy lost control. The techno music playing over the PA system has no oversight. The Prodigy has unchecked power.<br/><br/>No one from this group would be caught dead with a Rolling Stones album. The woman in the snow; the woman who is ""Out Here On My Own"" crashes the mis-en-scene with her survival narrative in tow, turning ""Climax"" into a survival film, after all, a tragi-comic Mel Brooks mash-up. Instead of two soundstages, it's the settings of the single interior and single exterior that converge. The woman who came in from the cold transfixed the cocktails with acid. Unbeknownst to Psyche(Thea Carla Schott), she tracked down her Berlin roommate. The woman in the snow is named, we surmise, is ""Angie"", like the song, a rock song, an outlier on the EDM-heavy soundtrack. In Pablo Pier Passolini's ""Salo"", the Ennio Morricone score competes with the Frederick Chopin piano pieces that the fascists use as an anesthetizing backdrop for the base and amoral tales they unspool to their young prisoners. Bruno, in a sense, avenges these fascists, theoretically, when he enacts a hegemonic shift from classical to popular. The idealism of a new music language, however, over time, can curdle into demagoguery. Bruno won the fight, the usurpation is complete, the old masters has lost its relevancy, but EDM, the end-result of the young American's pioneering work, turns into music of the ruling class. Angie, in a fight for rock's proletarian soul, co-opts electronica, the music of debauchery; the music of the people that Passolini condemned. She's no fascist; she's an Englishman in drag. Mick Jagger fighting Keith Flynt, or rather, an imitation of Flynt, alive in the grooves of a record that the deejay spins on his turntable.<br/><br/>Angie goes through Cara's inferno and comes out the other side, and lives to fight another day, undoing the damage that new traditionalists like Bruno had unleased on the world. Rock music is no longer at the center of youth culture.<br/><br/>To rock, is to be a revolutionary."

Conducting a utterly unsettling and a beautiful work of art.<br/><br/>'Climax' backtracks on its introduction of its characters by twisting them in ways, when spiked their vicious side and true emotions come out, like a clingy brother being in love with his sister and not to mention a mother who's son drinks the spiked alcohol then is forced into the electrical room, to later die to the fuse box, this scene was probably the movies most intense and real scenes with its constant building of anxiety and intensity 'climax' never slows it's pace down, gradually getting more nauseating and fast pasted.<br/><br/>My eyes were peeled from start to finish, i couldn't believe this cinematic experience, whether it's the dance choreography and it's weird gripping enthusiasm or unusual style of directing even it's dark realism everything is perfected especially with the last twenty minutes or so managing to feel like a rollercoaster of emotions, visuals, styles and genre. This film is a must see and a true piece of cinema."

","The stories about a group of people who are having fun in any kind of places, to celebrate a party or even to prepare for the next days rehearsal, are one of the most unexpected stories to tell. As these parties are surrounded by loud rhythmic songs, with more or less choreographed dancers, who express all of their emotions through the dance as body language. Until something unexpected would happen to the main characters, who would live in a nightmare which they cannot escape. Some of these stories would end with the main characters who survive from the nightmare, while other stories would end with the main characters who die from the nightmare. The auteur filmmaker Gaspar Noé seems intrigued to explore this theme, in the most unexpected way and unforgettable way. As the shooting of the movie took only 15 days, which is unusual to shoot a film with that brief time, in 2018 came out Climax by Gaspar Noé with Sofia Boutella, Kiddy Smile, Romain Guillermic, Souheila Yacoub, Claude Gajan Maull, Giselle Palmer, Taylor Kastle and Thea Carla Schott. The movie's plot: In the mid 1990s, a group of dancers join in a boarding school, for three day rehearsal with a DJ, their choreographer and her little son. All of them are having fun, until they would realize in the drink sangria is filled with LSD, which everyone is going to live in an irreversible nightmare. The movie would capture the audience attention from the beginning to the end, without letting them be distracted by anything. The camera and the lightings work to be compatible, in every single angle shots and in every camera movements, especially to see what would happen to the main characters. As most of the long takes help to capture the audience attention, to see how much the nightmare would go far. The editing was specifically elaborated to create scary atmospheres filled with suspense, without ruining the narration's rhythm, needed to see what the main characters would go through. Each of the actors, especially the ones who play the dancers, did an excellent performance as some of them have initially a bond with each other. Until the nightmare would cause them to not have anymore trust with anybody, as they would be unprepared with what is going to happen with all of them. Each of the actors who play the dancers have done an extraordinary choreography, as the main characters would communicate their feelings only through dancing. Especially in the dance sequences surrounded by the rhythmic songs, which can be felt their rhythm in their movements. Climax is one of the most thrilling and unexpected movies of all time, as well as one of the best Gaspar Noé's movies."

What starts as a fun, underground dance party quickly spirals into a nightmarish descent that is better left seen than explained.

","It's an arthouse film. Other films in the same genre include: The 400 Blows; In the Mood for Love; Pi and Tokyo Story. These movies are not designed for the majority of people (I'm shocked it's rated as high as it is) but a niche.<br/><br/>Positive - This is experimental high art. The dancing is mesmerizing. The cinematography is captivating. The music is fantastic. The characters are defined. It's a visual and audio spectacle, an exploration of mass hysteria.<br/><br/>The plot is a kind of character study, the unraveling and disintegration of who this people try to be. Perhaps it's even a microcosm of modern France with a metaphor for her future.<br/><br/>Negative - The acting is not the best but it's believable enough, the actors had passion for the project and you can feel it. The story itself is factually misleading, LSD would very unlikely have that effect on people, PCP would be more likely candidate.<br/><br/>If you're looking for something weird and you wanna try something new.

","This Gaspar Noe film is purely an artistic attempt, nonetheless not original, maybe completely unintentional its reminiscence of an old story from the classic 70s exploitative film, ""I Drink Your Blood"". Another film that explores a group of free-spirited (and drug-induced) people but are fed rabid-infested food. They end up going mad and doing violent acts toward each other.<br/><br/>The film is supposed to be set in the mid 90s but the French slang, dance moves and DJ music tracks is completely off. Maybe it was a 90s ""Rave"" party in a multiverse location? Its definitely the ""Party Monster"" film reinvented but if you love dancing, this film delivers.<br/><br/>It rivals the recent ""Suspiria"" remake's attempt to re-imagined its original filmmaker Dario Argento's planned 1978 dance scene that was never filmed. That being said it borrows Argento's upside-down camera shots from his 1996 film, ""Stendahl Syndrome"". Another Argento reference is that the one of the DJ tracks sounded like a song from Argento's 80s ""Phenomena"" film.<br/><br/>It takes awhile for the ""climax"" to fully happen as a notable attempt to deconstruct ""dancing"" and experimental drug culture (acid, bathsalts, LSD, etc.) but falls weak. It definitely delivers on the emotion of tension, Argento should be proud!"
"dreaminbeige","8","0","0","19 March 2019"," I like it!
","After reading a bunch of 1 star reviews on here I had pretty low expectations and I think that made a difference. So I'm hesitant to oversell it. I also got stoned which in hindsight was a great idea since the first act is mostly dancing. It's kind of a slow burn the first 30-45 min I felt indifferent & bored. However a bunch of pro dancers on acid does sound like the start of a nightmare so it sets a tone. About an hour in I started to love it. Then I thought maybe love is too strong a word but I definitely like it. This movie really captured the feeling of experiencing a bad trip without relying on cringey filters or camera tricks. As I left the theater to mixed reactions (a couple talking through out gave the credits the middle finger and booed, such rebels) I felt disoriented ""is this a dream? Am I awake??"" The guy loudly and frantically playing sax on the subway home added to this movie induced pseudo trip. As I walked home I kept thinking I really like how I feel right now!...not for everyone but I'd definitely recommend seeing it in a theater vs a laptop or tv."

"david_rudy_lee","7","0","0","15 March 2019"," Wild, Hallucinatory Nightmare
","This was a film that I heard about when it was making its festival rounds and it had me intrigued. Podcasts I listen to gave some non-spoiler reviews and from what I gathered, it had been kind of hit or miss with those I listen to. To get into this, the synopsis is French dancers gather in a remote, empty school building to rehearse on a wintry night. The all-night celebration morphs into a hallucinatory nightmare when they learn their sangria is laced with LSD.<br/><br/>We kick this off with a woman walking through what looks to be snow. She is screaming and the film then informs us that this is based on real events that happened in France back in 1996. The film also interesting enough follows this up with the full credits before shifting to interviews of all of the dancers that are in the film. They are asked similar questions and it is quite quick, but we really get an idea of each of their characters. This is further done when we see them breaking off into pairs to tell more about themselves or to make comments about other dancers.<br/><br/>It then follows this up with a pretty impressive performance. This is actually the rehearsal they are there for. I'll be the first to admit, I'm not great at dancing and I really don't understand how people can move this way, but I will admit this was pretty cool. At the end of the performance, there is food and drinks for everyone to unwind and celebrate. The problem is that the sangria is laced with LSD. We then see the people as they start to experience their trip as they go for their carnal desires, blame those around them for spiking the drink and a lot of madness. We really see the truth of each of the characters as this becomes a psychedelic nightmare.<br/><br/>I wanted to keep this recap short as this film doesn't really have a lot that I can say without spoiling it. I found it interesting that I read this film really didn't have a script. What they had was about 5 pages to start it off and the rest of it was improvised. I do find this to be pretty impressive. The film also feels very Hitchcock as it has extremely long takes and it feels like it all one continuous shot. It is able to do this as characters move around the perspective as it jumps to follow what the next person is doing.<br/><br/>This film has a very arthouse way to telling the story as well. The issue of abortion is raised as a character thinks they could be pregnant. We see that this bothers Selva (Sofia Boutella). This goes no where, but it really made me start to wonder if she was faced with this same decision. I have to commend writer/director Gaspar Noé if you can make me think about minor things in the film. He also has some text that hits the screen to tell us birth and death are very important things.<br/><br/>We also get a lot about sexuality. David (Romain Guillermic) is a player and he admits to it. Others around him know it too, but he still on the prowl. He his sights set on Selva as well as a lesbian couple. He does admit he would hook up with any of the women that are there. There are a couple of guys who also talk about how they work as a team to hook-up with women. I find this interesting that they are open about their sexuality and what they are looking for. It is misogynistic though in some of the things they say. Along with the lesbian couple, there are also some gay men as well, which their plight I found intriguing with the other men around. On top of that, there is the concept of rape, incest and a horrible parent as well that is explored.<br/><br/>I will admit though, I did have some issues with the pacing of the film. It takes entirely took long in my opinion before we get into it. I thought it was solid once the LSD starts to kick in and we see the craziness happening. Part of this is the amount of characters and the director trying to introduce and let us get to know everyone. I'll be honest that I don't know the names of most of the cast. I think it would have been better to cut a bit of that and go a little heavier with the second half of the film. I did like how things end up once we get to the climax of this film.<br/><br/>Despite me not being able to tell you who all of the characters are, I thought the acting was great. I was a big fan of Boutella and I liked when her character was the focus. I should point out; this film doesn't have a star we follow. It shifts around to everyone in this film at one point or another. Guillermic's character was also interesting. I would say the rest are good, sometimes in a bad way, but I thought we have enough different personalities to make this film work.<br/><br/>This brings me to the effects. For the most part, there aren't a lot used. I wasn't sure since I know that Noé films I've seen in the past can be quite brutal. We do get some of that. There is a scene with someone being set on fire that I liked. I think the bigger thing would be the camera work. We don't get the screen going too crazy to show the effects of the drugs, but there is some good lighting. We also get the camera showing us things upside down, which is a solid allegory to what the drug is doing to them. I have to give credit for these aspects.<br/><br/>Next would be the score of the film. I thought the music selections were amazing for this film. It isn't necessarily my type of music, but it fits the film in multiple ways. First is the dance performance, which matches perfectly. Then once everything starts to go crazy, the music becomes haunting. When characters leave the room it is playing, it is quieter, but that almost makes it a bit unnerving. I have to give a lot of credit for the soundtrack for this film.<br/><br/>Now with that said, during the set up of this film, I found myself bored and wanting to get into it. Once we get to the craziness, I was locked in and there might have been more than once that I was shocked by something I saw. I would be interested to see what really happened here and how different the two are. I thought this film had good acting and it does have a good build up once we really get into it. The effects, how it was shot and soundtrack were really good as well. There were some choices by Noé that weren't really needed in the film, but this is a solid hallucinatory nightmare like the synopsis said. I found this film to be above average after this first viewing though."
"specialkrp","7","0","0","3 March 2019"," Another heck of a trip by French auteur Gaspar Noe
","I was glad to hear when Gaspar Noe released a horror film finally last year in 2018. His previous titles with the exception of Love were almost in the horror genre at times, especially his first 3 films. To me his third film, Irreversible is a genre bender of horror, suspense, drama, and romantic genres all rolled in 1 with an artistic flair that was inventive and most definitely a unique 1 of a kind film. So I was very eager to see what he had in store with Climax since most of the early reviews classified the film as horror, and I'm a horror fanatic. Climax is a psychological horror film to me with a simple storyline. A dance crews party goes from partying, fun, and dancing to a trip through hell after lsd spiked sangria is ingested by everyone there. The first half of the film is mostly dance numbers with little character introduction. What ensues in the second half is nightmarish and unsettling at times especially if the viewer has ever had a bad experience or a bad trip with use of drugs. The film is nowhere near Noe's more violent films in the past, but still has a feeling of dread especially in the second half of the film. The film is supposedly based on a true instance from 1996 in France so is said in the opening credits. Climax has a few similar like scenes that Hint of 2 of his previous films throughout that I've found. The trippy visuals that hints of Enter The Void , and a few scenes of a character walking down a red tunnel that can only remind the viewer of the most haunting red subway tunnel rape scene from his masterpiece in my opinion, Irreversible. The film is not one of Gaspar Noes best by far but it is still a film to experience just like the rest of his body of work."
"kwaiglindsay","8","0","0","26 February 2019"," Impressive, bold and deliberately uncomfortable.
","From start to finish the film was thematically impeccable but perhaps too uninteresting. A hell-on-Earth scenario that highlights how easily humanity can get complete chaos with the simplest of changes. It's not a film I'm ever going to watch again as there is no subtlety in the way it was made, but am glad I experienced it. It is literally a story told in two 45-minute halves; the first a character build up with solid editing, cinematography and choreography. The second half a terrifyingly exaggerated experience which, whilst competently filmed, deliberately relies on tension that the film expertly dishes out in a very gradual way. An extremely enjoyable but uncomfortable watch. Not for everyone.<br/><br/>Other notes: Glad that the film wasn't too explicitly sexual as it would have seemed gimmicky. The violence is definitely tamed down from this director and it's good to see he doesn't need it to make a great film. The overhead shots were the best scenes. The wardrobe seemed really fitting to the individual personalities. The sound editing actually stood out as the music could have been droning but it wasn't."

","Gaspar Noe is not a director I particularly praise. Like Lars Von Trier, I'm in a polarizing category of cinephiles where some of Noe's comes off pretentious and over ambitious where his other films are hypnotic and captivating. Fortunately, Climax ranks as the most white-knuckle film experience I've had in a very long time.<br/><br/>Climax has a formula that is very, very difficult to achieve: being groundbreaking in its stylization; a phantom-esque style of the camera just floating around. The shots are less like Into the Void and more like Birdman. Additionally, the film feels very organic. These are characters that don't need to be ""fleshed out"" because they feel like real characters. I was a skeptic when I heard that trippy visuals were not going to be utilized, but I am so glad Noe took the approach of focusing on the characters and how their madness unfolds on screen. If you're having trouble finding a movie that scares you, Climax might be ""the one"" that will finally make your palms sweat. The movie knows how to instill angst in the viewer. I can't remember the last time I let out a huge laugh after a film was over because I was so freaked out. Watch this movie but be warned it might make you feel strange for a few days after. This ties with Hereditary as my favorite film of 2018 and I recommend everyone watches it."

He is clearly trying so hard to shock the audience and make everyone hate the movie to such a degree that I don't see a point in indulging in his twisted fantasies that have no ultimate payoff. The film is just mindless violence and stupid shock value with terrible characters,plot and sub-par acting.Noe might say he draws inspiration from Kubrick but he's just an art-house version of Eli Roth. The craftsmanship of some shots and some good cinematography are the only reasons why the movie gets two stars even though the last fifteen minutes are shot upside down which made me want to pick up my TV and throw it out the window to make sure that it never has to endure another of Noe's films."

"frankparnell","7","1","2","18 June 2020"," Intense and effecting, it needs to be experienced to be believed, a truly visceral film
","CLIMAX is written and directed by Gaspar NoÃ© (Irreversible, Enter The Void) and tells the story of a French dance group who's sangria is spiked with LSD during a party after rehearsals, what proceeds is a night of increasingly intense, disturbing and cringe inducing events as the friends slowly become effected by the drugs.<br/><br/>I had never heard of this film until it was recommended to me online, and as a lover of the horror genre as well as low budget independent films I was eager to see this film. It's been a few days since I watched it and it is still in my head, this film is above all else an experience, not just a piece of media that demands viewing but a film that is so unrelenting in its violence and disturbing content that it deserves recognition from fans of the genre. The slow burn nature of the film eases its audience into its intense subject matter and only becomes an outright Horror/Thriller around the 40-50 minute mark. What proceeded this was largely getting to know each individual character though conversations with each other or though interview format (how the film is opened), and long, unbroken takes of choreographed dance sequences. This really was not what I expected but it got us familiar with each person's role in the group as well as giving the film a character and personality that many films, especially one from this genre lacks. So that must be the biggest positive of this film, the production design from sound to lighting, chorography to camera work, this film excels. Great wide shots displaying a variety of characters and the repeat shots to show the juxtaposition before and after they have been spiked is truly something to marvel. The final act (the CLIMAX of the film) uses sound, lighting and unconventional camera angles to unnerve, unease and discombobulate the audience, although I was uncomfortable with what was on screen I found myself truly effected and when the film ended it had, and still is having, a lasting effect on me.<br/><br/>The slow burn nature of the film however is something that results in a negative for the overall quality of the film as the films plot doesn't really ""get going"" till around the 40-50 minute mark resulting in the film feeling inconsistent and struggling to decide on a tone. This is not always a negative, films like the Nicolas Winding Refn's DRIVE (2011) slowly puts our protagonist into the uncomfortable situation in a way that doesn't make the films tone feel confused, something that CLIMAX don't get so clearly. Although the end result is an exciting and visceral final act and a pay off that is truly spectacular this is proof of the director fully presenting his stylistic flare and unique ability to position his actors and the camera to create a film unlike anything I have seen. To me however, tones clash before the hour mark and I wasn't sure if I was watching a horror/Thriller or a French remake of STEP UP.<br/><br/>Every actor who appears in this film really shines in their respective roles; each actor has something exciting to do throughout each act. The actor who really stood out from the ensemble cast is Sofia Boutella (THE MUMMY), who though her scenes interacting with other actors or performing alone really brings her A-game, making me suspend my disbelief and act as if I was witnessing a night that is truly traumatic for each character involved, as a performer this is where she, and everyone, truly shone. The scene in which Boutella is alone in the red lit room, dancing to sitting in agonising fear to climbing the wall made me fear for the characters involved, I later learned that a lot of the film (bar the choreographed dance) was improvised by the actors and cementing Boutella as a born, natural performer.<br/><br/>Overall, CLIMAX is unnerving, brutal, and in the end devastating for everyone involved, including the audience, as a film that sets out for that outcome I cannot praise this film enough. Although it does have issues with pacing and tone towards the beginning of the film, the latter half is an explosive look at the effect of drugs on a unknowing group of people with expert camera work, performances and choreography elevating the content, that results in what can only be described in a unique experience and notable addition to the genre. Just be sure to take a walk when its finished."

","""Climax"" continues the long tradition of Noe's highly praised , loved by critics cult films that lose tons of money at the box office regardless. It's a magistral tour de force where he was able to shoot and hour and half (great restraint there by the way) of communicating:<br/><br/>1- raw humanity and what unites us despite our social divisions (and not in an annoying sjw way either)
2 - the effect of drugs on the human body and mind without at any point having an actor saying a single thing about what they saw or felt
3 - a story with a proper arc (which i know bothered many in 'love'.<br/><br/>9/10 , i would say irreversible still his best , tied with i stand alone and enter the void - you can't go wrong."
"originalchc","8","1","2","29 May 2020"," Clearly most people reviewing this have not taken LSD in significant amounts.
","I have. And the movie is the epitome of a bad trip which could easily happen. You see, human society is the convergence of many people that have egoistical concerns. It's amazing that we manage to keep this world together despite all the differences. A lot of it is due to law and moral values that are based in major religions but not everything. There is a social contract every step of the way which is crucial for the world to work.<br/><br/>LSD is a dissociative. At certain concentration it makes your ego separate from your perception of reality and throws in a decent amount of visual and audial hallucinations. You no longer are you and the world is no longer what it seemed to be. A very real notion that the world might never be the same again visits you time and time again. This can be a very positive introspective experience where you realize the socially acceptable limits of your ego but it can also be a frightening one if you have not been the best person you are. We live in a ""me, me, me"" age where over the top exhibitionism of our accomplishments or just vanity is looked up upon (thanks to popular media for that). LSD cuts right through this mirage. And the movie shows just how horrible it might be if every single person realized this at once, in fear of it forever staying the same. A true nightmare, if you will.<br/><br/>Overall, I think that it has both artistic and real-life value but it succeeds in only portraying the negative side of dissociative use. To put things into perspective, there should be a diametrically opposite movie that would show the other side of the coin (inherently positive experience) and, thus, the waking life of our realities would be smack in the middle."

","Though his work is praised as innovative and stylish, I have always considered Noe' as an eternal film student with top notch actors and plenty of production resources at his fingertips. Throwing tons of elements into Climax caused it to be disjointed, but following the simple plot was easy. However, without cohesion, the special cinematography, lighting and strange behavior did little more than irritate me, as if watching a director who can't decide in what direction he'd like to go. The first act was too long and the transition into the second act was nonexistent. Sofia Boutella shines wherever she is, so perhaps her skills were the saving grace of Noe's jumbled mess of a movie."

","I love Enter the Void, and generally respect Noe for taking chances and getting out there, but this was mostly bad. Dance sequences are well done. I wondered if the dialogue was improvised, because some of it seemed really forced and unnatural. It turns out I was correct and much of it was improvised. Was expecting to be able to identify a protagonist, but even that was hard to do for sure. The film's depiction of what lsd does to people and how they'd react in a scenario like this is way off and there's just so much behavior in it that doesn't really makes sense or stays unexplained. It never feels scary or horrific or terrifying, just confusing as to what the characters' motivations are at any given moment.<br/><br/>The cinematography is well done, but some of the creative choices visually seemed amateurish and unnecessary-a very long shot done upside down for no apparent reason, for example. Whereas Enter the Void-same DP-had profoundly unique and original shots that made sense in the context of the story AND were visually spectacular. Not having more interesting psychedelic visuals in the context of a plot wherein everyone is on acid seems like a lot of missed opportunities and may have made it more interesting since there's not a lot of plot to go on. Music is solid, but it seems they could've used it better to reinforce the action of the scene, while in this case it's basically just playing along. Could've gone with some deeper and weirder tunes that'd be more indicative of the time and place, while these are all fairly mainstream and well known songs.<br/><br/>Overall, it's pretty boring and lacking in plot. There's no real reason to care about any characters except for maybe the kid. Seems like it could've benefitted from a real script and just more effort put in in every department."

","Climax in its self is a choreographed psychedelic film...from the beginning a complex group of France's finest dancers agree to a night of everything they've desired. A secluded area to express themselves. The dance in the first seen is something that shouldnt be missed and as it was astonishingly choreographed. But what starts as the night they will never forget turns into the one i wouldnt wish on my enemies. Climax starts with interviews with everyone involved; which shows they all relatively have ulterior motives into and absolute descent to madness and a nightmare all in its own. The last 30 mins will leave you speechless as its shot dark and mostly upside down with way more than most people would care to see. But my girth of horror films would be a testament to that. This film definitely takes some will power for sure and the end result might also not be there, but its deff worth watching."

"ronakkotian","8","1","2","11 July 2019"," One word: INSANE!
","I've been wanting to see Climax after hearing all the buzz surrounding it. After a few months, I finally got the chance to view it and it was the MOST INSANE EXPERIENCE EVER!<br/><br/>By the end of it I was just in awe at what I just witnessed. This film was like no other. Climax was helmed by director Gaspar NoÃ© who is known for the controversial films IrrÃ©versible and Enter the Void. He has a style for making very disturbing films that will be polarising between audiences. Climax goes through the same treatment. NOT EVERYONE WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>First of all, I have to praise Gaspar NoÃ© on his direction because it was shot masterfully. The camerawork on this film is one of the best I've ever seen. The way the camera moves in the small location it's set in, especially in the second half where it gets crazy, makes The movie feel more anxiety inducing than what it already is. The camera lingers on the scene for long periods of time, one lasting over 40 minutes. I find it a huge achievement for everyone involved to stay in character for that long.<br/><br/>The music creates a fearful and disturbing atmosphere which suits the overall tone. The cinematography and choice of colours also intensifies what's going on.<br/><br/>The acting is top-notch. Considering that this film is most of the dancers' first film is incredible. Everyone did an incredible job especially when they all get drugged. All of them had great chemistry with each other as shown when they have conversations with one another. Their reactions to the situation felt so real that it made the film so much more engrossing and hard to watch.<br/><br/>The only problem I have was the story. At times, during the film, I wondered how will the story progress and by the end it didn't progress much. If the story was tighter then this film would have been perfect.<br/><br/>Overall, Climax is an experience that's worth watching. It may be a film that will haunt and disturb you for days and make you feel extremely anxious by the end of it but you should watch it just to appreciate the amount of effort put into its craft as well the praising the outcome."

The results was far from good, unfortunately.
I believe that we can see the result of a 4 pages script, full improvisation and a professional dancers cast.
Lot of dancing, sometimes was good, most of the times was boring and waited to see where it was leading. Unfortunately nowhere.
The worst thing is that the whole acid trip experience was badly given. Over reactions, exaggerations etc. I know that he wanted to give the chaos, and the return to raw human instincts, This is what I also wanted to experience, but I'm sorry with no success.
I am curious, if this movie is accepted better from people that never had substances experience, and watch it from a clean perspective.
Also one more thought is, if the negativity about this movie from people that had experience with hallucinogenic substances, is coming from the fear of a bad trip for themselves (in the past experiences).
But again these two are just philosophical/psychological questions,
the result was not good.

He was a complete and total mess and was doing bizarre stuff. I can only imagine if 30 people like that were locked in a building taking some sort of hallucinogen they had no experience with.... It is ONE THING to willingly consume drugs, and another to take them without knowledge and having NO IDEA what is going on, especially psychedelic drugs, which was clearly the case in both regards with this film.<br/><br/>This film is about a dance troupe that clearly doesn't normally use drugs, whose punch unexpectedly gets spiked with a hallucinogen.

Seems a bit counter-intuitive to what you're claiming about open-mindedness, and I would advise anyone else who thinks like this, to take a good hard look at themselves. Again wish I never saw this movie, it was definitely a work of garbage, but beautifully filmed garbage.

"Councillor3004","Null","1","2","23 March 2019"," A dazzling and unique vision for a very specific type of audience.
","Before watching ""Climax"", I would never have called Gaspar Noé one of my favorite filmmakers. I have seen ""Irresistible"" at the beginning of the last year and found it a great and unsettling film told with such an energetic force and cinematic style that it was absolutely unforgettable. I also watched ""Enter the Void"" and couldn't get into it at all, and wasn't really able to find anything meaningful in my viewing experience. I haven't seen his 2015 feature (""Love"") yet, but maybe I should check it out soon after the incredible experience ""Climax"" has just given me. This film was completely and utterly original, not necessarily in terms of its storytelling, but definitely in terms of its technical efforts. The film beams with energy, it's powerful and disturbing and dazzling and unforgettable all at the same time. If you have seen the trailer, you will already have seen what the entire film will be about; the important thing about this is Gaspar Noé's filming technique, the absolutely extraordinary cinematography, the superb choreographies, the absolutely FANTASTIC soundtrack - I couldn't take my eyes off the screen, and I was fascinated and disturbed and intrigued all at the same time. I loved the long overhead take in particular, which is a scene you would basically immediately recognize Gaspar Noé for.<br/><br/>I wouldn't count ""Climax"" as a film, but rather as an experience. Obviously, people will have extremely mixed opinions about it. Some won't grasp why this film was even necessary in the first place, some won't get warm with Gaspar Noé's unmistakable style, some simply won't enjoy the experience. I myself wouldn't have thought that spending ninety hallucinatory minutes at a dancing rehearsal would turn into one of my favorite movie experiences of 2018 - but somehow it did, and somehow I found a lot of respect for the art of Gaspar Noé. Definitely worth checking out; such a unique film."

"paul-allaer","6","1","2","18 March 2019"," Truly ""way out there"" experimental film
","""Climax"" (2018 release from France; 96 min.) brings the story of a dance troupe. As the movie opens, a choreographer is interviewing each of them to get more personal background information. We then switch to a rehearsal, where we see the dancers perform as classic dance tunes of Cerrone and Patrick Hernandez are thundering. As the rehearsal concludes, the dancers start talking to one another, while most of them drink lots of sangria. The stories become gossipy rather quickly... At this point we are less than 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more of the plot would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.<br/><br/>Couple of comments: this is the latest movie from noted experimental French director/editor Gaspar Noe. Here he brings to the big screen a story inspired by true events that took place in France in 1996, as we are reminded by the movie's opening credits. When I see the term ""inspired"", I translate that as ""very loosely based on, with lots of artistic licensing, just because"". The movie is really two films in one: the rehearsal and its immediate aftermath, and then the transition into personal hell for these dancers. The film was made on a very small budget and with little to no prior dancing experience by the cast. Oh, and did I mention that the movie's opening dance rehearsal and subsequent conversation comes in one long shot of about 15 min.? And that there are subsequent single shots that run even longer? Yea, it's kinda like that. The contrast between the movie's opening scenes and the last 15 min. or so couldn't be further apart mood-wise (and screaming-wise). There is a ferocity in these acting performances that are bound to unsettle some (they sure did unsettle me). Bottom line: this is a movie that is truly ""way out there"", but not without its merits (I don't really want to use the word ""charming"" as that is really the exact opposite of what this movie is). Last but not least, there is a ton of great dance music featured throughout the movie (Cerrone, Patrick Hernandez, Giorgio Moroder, Soft Cell, and on and on).<br/><br/>""Climax"" premiered at last year's Cannes film festival and finally opened in US theaters this month. The Sunday matinee screening where I saw this at my art-house theater here in Cincinnati, was attended dismally (5 people, including myself), and I'd be surprised if this plays more than one week. If you are in the mood for a weird cocktail of dance and talk and all hell breaks loose, all with a French twist, then by all means I encourage you to check it out, be it in the theater (not very likely at this point), on VOD, or eventually on DVD/Blu-ray, and draw your own conclusion."
"scb_coldsteel","6","1","2","17 March 2019"," One of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.
","So I saw Climax a few days ago at the theater. I literally have not stopped thinking about the movie and the overall experience the film provided. Casper Noe is a master provocateur and he certainly made a film that will stay with you for days. I can't say it was an enjoyable experience, but I don't think it was supposed to be. It was an incredibly unique and jarring film that should be experienced though.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie can be summed up easy enough without spoiling anything. ""Drugs are bad M'Kay"". The film follows a diverse group of dancers as they finish up an intricate and well choreographed dance routine. After a long and tedious introduction the film descends into a nightmare fever dream that is designed to provoke emotions and make you as uncomfortable as possible. The film certainly was a success in that regard.<br/><br/>The movie was populated with acts of violence and depravity that will leave many in shock. One of the most terrifying aspects of the film being it was grounded in reality. All these depraved and shocking moments on screen were not exaggerated, but gritty and raw. This only further added to the experience the film provided.<br/><br/>I'm having a hard time really classifying this film under any given genre. It certainly had elements of psychological terror and put forward a number of disturbing scenes, but it's not quite horror. Hell it's almost hard to classify this as a film in the first place in the traditional sense. This feels more like an interactive art project than a coherent story.<br/><br/>Like the best abstract art this movie acts as a Rorschach test designed to push viewers experiences. I normally don't read other reviews before writing my own, but I had to see how other people interpreted the film. Is it a philosophical meditation on human nature? An allegorical masterpiece? A product of insanity or genius? Is it pretentious nonsense? Or is it simply exploitive trash? It can be all those things and much more. It was an experience that demands to be felt. I can't say I enjoyed the film, but it was one of the most immersive experiences I've had from a film.<br/><br/>Climax asks the audience a complex question. Is art designed to be enjoyed or experienced? In the case of Climax the movie is designed specifically to provoke an emotion. Climax wants you to feel something as a viewer. Something primal, uncomfortable, and anxiety inducing. It's the kind of jarring experience that will leave you in shock for day. It was the kind of experience that will really make you think about the movie. Climax demands that you are an active viewer. It really pushes the boundaries of what it means to be a film.<br/><br/>From a purely technical point this movie should be seen anyway. The cinematography and choreography were outstanding. Of course all of the dance numbers were intricate and well done, but the most impressive aspect being how they were shot. The film utilizes single takes for long stretches of time all the while the camera seamlessly floats around capturing some truly wonderful scenes. There's almost a 20 minute stretch without a single cut all the while the camera acts as an omnipresent viewer following different characters and their drug-induced stupor. Plus the color and lighting of the film were perfect to push the changes that occurred in the narrative of the film. It's not my genre of music, but the techno dance soundtrack was also perfectly incorporated. The technical aspects were the best part of the film and really stand out.<br/><br/>That all being said Climax was not what I would call a good movie in any traditional way. While the film is relatively short, around 40 minutes of the movie was literally nothing but mindless dialogue and dancing. This wasn't a case of a slow burn start to build suspense. It was a tedious and mind-numbing experience just to make you feel uncomfortable. There simply was no driving plot for the bulk of the film. All of your expectations as a viewer ultimately fall flat as the movie never really delivers on its promise providing terror. I will also add that while yes, the scenes were designed to be provocative, I have certainly seen worse in film. The content didn't make me feel uncomfortable as much as the movie itself did.<br/><br/>I also have to mention how utterly terrible the acting and dialogue was. All of the dialogue felt utterly pointless and added nothing to the film. It would be one thing if the actors delivered their lines in a believable manner, but they all failed to do so. The whole thing felt far more like a College term project instead of a major film. I will also mention that the abstract and allegorical aspects of the film were purely unintentional on the directors behalf. He has gone on record saying the film is not a allegory and ultimately he wasn't making a social or political statement. Sometimes viewers read into things that simply aren't there.<br/><br/>So Climax was one of the most disturbing experiences I've had since Salo. In both cases the films weren't truly scary, but they were uncomfortable and anxiety inducing. Climax is less of a coherent film and more of an art project. It is the kind of ultimately pretentious content that will have critics raving. I did not enjoy Climax as a movie. I enjoyed the technical aspects of the film and I liked that they tried to make an immersive and powerful experience. The film was very successful in that regard. As far as crafting an intricate psychological thriller this movie falls flat and will leave many bored and scratching their head wondering what the hype was about.<br/><br/>This is an incredibly difficult film to try and rank numerically. It succeeded in everything it was trying to accomplish, still it had too many glaring issues for me to call it a good movie. I would still highly recommend everyone watch it though for a unique and powerful experience. Climax will certainly make you feel something as a viewer and if that is enough for you the film is sure to wow. For me it was just a muddled nightmare that tried way too hard to be cool. 6 out of 10."
"ferguson-6","5","1","2","15 March 2019"," hypnotic or horrific depending on your taste
","Greetings again from the darkness. A wounded, bleeding, hysterical woman is seen crawling through the snow. She's not dressed appropriately for the weather, and it's apparent she's suffered some type of trauma. This opening shot is from a bird's eye view, and it's the way provocative filmmaker Gaspar Noe (LOVE, ENTER THE VOID) opens his latest film. This vivid visual sticks with us as we flashback to the progression of events that led to this woman's unfortunate circumstance ... her situation being the conclusion to what we are about to watch.<br/><br/>The initial dance sequence is shown in full and it is quite stunning in its energy and physicality and athleticism. As best I could tell, it was a single long take with dancers writhing and music thumping, both in frenetic mode. Much of each dancer's personality is depicted in their movements, and the video interviews we see as part of their audition reveal a culturally diverse group of young adults unsure of where this is headed. We are watching a troupe of mid-1990's French dancers rehearsing in a large, otherwise empty facility on a snowy night, and we too are unprepared for what's about to unfold.<br/><br/>After that initial performance, the dancers begin mingling as the camera takes us inside the various conversations. Lust, jealousy, and insecurities fill the air as the choreographed energy we first watched in awe slowly disintegrates into a bizarre type of hand-to-hand combat ... some psychological, some more physical/violent in nature. The dancers are slipping from sanity, unsure if it's temporary or possibly deadly. One of them traces their spinning head (not literal) and unexplained sensations to the Sangria punch - leading to some angry confrontations and outrageous behavior.<br/><br/>While none of the individual performances really stand out ... this is not a film about certain interesting characters ... it should be noted that Sofia Boutella (HOTEL ARTEMIS) plays Selva, the dance company's choreographer, and Kiddy Smile plays Daddy, the DJ who keeps the music pumping. Watching the movie is truly like observing a group acid trip through the eyes of someone on an acid trip. The camera is sometimes invading intimate moments, while other times hovering or wildly spinning above or below. Sometimes it felt like a GoPro was strapped to a frantic parakeet that had just been set free from its cage.<br/><br/>Combining the camera work with the constant thundering of music, some might describe the film as hypnotic and hallucinatory (I prefer horrific).
While most of the dancers seem to lose all sense of reality, some react more violently than others. Hysterics run rampant, especially in a sequence where a young boy is locked in a utility closet by his mother. Whether the scene was for shock value or merely in keeping with the filmmaker's demented approach is unclear - either way, this came across as too much on top of too much. Simply put, the film is a relentless assault on the eyes and ears and all sense of decency ... just as Gaspar Noe likely intended."
"kluseba","9","1","2","13 March 2019"," Homo homini lupus
","Caspar Noé's latest movie Climax is an experimental combination of a musical, drama and horror film.<br/><br/>Climax is a musical because it revolves around a group of young French dancers who get prepared for their new show over the course of three days in an abandoned school building. The movie starts with interview sections as the different dancers talk about their motivations to join the group. The second scene shows the elaborate dance choreography. The third scene is the party after the last practice when you can see the characters dance to electronic music. The entire first quarter of the film focuses on dance moves and electronic music to portray how the characters express themselves artistically.<br/><br/>The movie slowly shifts towards a drama. Someone has poisoned the sangria with LSD and the dancers start acting erratically, emotionally and aggressively. We observe a brother who overprotects his younger sister who is longing for more independence. We get to know that one of the female dancers is pregnant and she doesn't know who the father of her child could be. We come across a nervous mother who is desperately trying to protect her son from the dancers.<br/><br/>The film ends as a horror movie as the situation escalates. Prejudice, rape and murder occur as the drugs bring out the worst in each and every single character. The film's second half and especially its final third are certainly hard to digest. This movie should only be watched by adults with an open mind and a strong stomach.<br/><br/>The cinematography of the film needs to be pointed out. There are almost no cuts as the camera randomly follows characters throughout the fateful night which gives the movie a quite fluid vibe. The fact that the movie values music and movements over an actual plot or even dialogues is also particularly outstanding. The film starts with the credits, introduces chapters like silent movies used to do and the camera sometimes turns around to portray a world that has been shaken upside down.<br/><br/>As nightmarish as the film might seem, Climax is actually based upon true events. Without pointing fingers, the movie certainly includes a lot of social criticism. It shows how partners, friends and even family members turn against each other once a drug has eliminated their self-control. The film also uses a lot of stereotypes that may be shocking at first contact but that turn out being more realistic that one might be willing to admit. It leads the viewers to question their societies and their values.<br/><br/>In the end, Climax is a mindblowing experience unlike any other film. It's not easy to digest because of its explicit violence, thin plot and absence of dialogues but the aesthetic aspect, vibrant atmosphere and underlying messages pardon for its minor flaws. If you are an adult, have an open mind and strong stomach and like experimental cinema, this might become one of your very favourite movies."
"jadavix","7","1","2","11 March 2019"," They should have spiked it sooner
","Gaspar Noé's ""Climax"" is a rarity in that it is a movie that does exactly what it says it will, and really nothing more, nothing less. If you are reading this you probably already know what it's about, even if you haven't seen it yet: a group of French dancers meet in a remote location to rehearse, and realise too late that the ""sangria"" they have all been drinking is spiked with LSD.<br/><br/>Their behaviour gets increasingly crazy, in some cases attacking each other and themselves. In one instance a woman is accidentally set on fire, though typically Noé's camera doesn't follow her.<br/><br/>Eventually they all just end up gibbering wrecks on the floor.<br/><br/>If the movie has any serious problem, however, it's how long it takes to get going. More than half the movie is spent with these characters just talking, and their conversations are dull. It's not until over half way in that the drugs start to take hold. Before that, these characters aren't interesting enough. I don't know if you're supposed to care about them or not, but I certainly didn't."

","With Climax Noe injects all his trademarks with good effect, such as 'out of the comfort zone' themes and stunning cinematography and effects. However, where these are used to great effect with titles such as 'Irreversible' and 'Enter the Void', with Climax they are the only elements worth mentioning. The afore mentioned films had a lot more going for them, where Cilmax, seems to me, to fall flat. The first hour of the film is full on ITV Saturday night mainstream entertainment. Great fun for the lovers of X Factor etc, no doubt. The characters are also 2 dimensional and not very likeable, were the only topic and conversation seems to be about sex. Now I know most of the characters are young and they are placed in a party scenario, but this doesn't lead to a very engaging script or narrative. If you like your horrors full of dull (in my opinion) street dancing, this is the one for you....just dont expect much depth...."

","This review contains minor spoilers.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is OK. Nothing spectacular, decent choreography, cool soundtrack, not particularly appealing characters. You don't develop any interest in them, except maybe the 7-year-old who is so terribly out of place. Whether that was Noe's intent or he just fails to make you care for the troupe I cannot say.<br/><br/>Then the midway credits roll; yes at the half mark exactly.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is a gradual build-up of insanity.

"PeaceGuard","3","1","3","19 June 2020"," Modern, long, visually impressive version of ""your brain on drugs"" brainwashing propaganda.
","So first.. anyone who has experience with LSD knows that reactions of characters within this movie have nothing to do with reactions on LSD. In fact, they're a whole much closer to the exact opposite.
Maybe it could happen on scopolamine (deliriant) or on large doses of dissociatives (especially arylcyclohexylamines such as PCP and analogs) or as a result of some stimulant psychosis (large doses of amphetamines, cathinones, cocaine - cocaine is present in the movie, but only few people take it).
So the question arises.. what exactly is the point of Noe to make such an extreme brainwashing propaganda? He has done multiple drugs featuring films... oh wait, or is it multiple films featuring drugs (and sex, of course, he has an undeniable unhealthy obsession with both) and I assume he has at least elementary knowledge about their effects (although does he really? maybe he's just this ignorant/unintelligent). So he does it fully consciously. Why? Because he assumes the general public knows sh.t about the topic anyway?<br/><br/>His previous movie, Enter The Void, was better, and, if not for the last 20 minutes, it could've deserved even a 9. If only it would conclude that most of the film was a hallucination, not a Buddhist pseudo-philosophy.
Since then, with ""Love"" and ""Climax"" he has only deteriorated.<br/><br/>The general public actually knows how people act of LSD. Crowds of hippies during large concerts in the 60s showed that. People relax, chill, get dreamy, talk, seek closeness (this is the one and only remotely close aspect compared to the reactions in this movie), concentrate on what's going on within their heads without much external activity, sometimes do dancing or singing or just perform normal day-to-day actions.
Here you just have a mass psychosis/hysteria. Nonsensical.
Also, who instills LSD with eye drops? It's not ibogaine, you ignorant Noe.<br/><br/>And, apart from the drug part, there isn't mush in the movie. Is every movie of Noe about sex, drugs and almost no plot?"

","First time I've ever been compelled to create a IMDB account, all to lower the un-deserved rating this film has.<br/><br/>Unbelievable things in this film:<br/><br/>1. Acting - It's like these people were pulled form midday soap operas. Insane over-acting and unfortunate dialogue that the actors had to work with.
2. Dancing - Some moves are alright, but for the most part none of them can actually dance.
3. Drug - Whoever watches this and thinks it is believable clearly never tried acid before however I believe the cameraman may have been on LSD while shooting half of the film upside down (SO ARTHOUSE YO!)
4. Story - After a quick google, this never happened. Not even close - I won't ruin it for you but check on the internet and prepare to be amazed at how far the original story was blown out of proportion. Mind-boggling.
5. Music - Absolutely no audio techniques to create change of pace or mood, just constant generic techno drivel, maybe to create a tense atmosphere but instead resulting in a terrible headache. My ears are ringing 30 minutes after viewing.
6. Colour - Put a piece of red cellophane over the cam lens, would have saved a good portion of that 2.6million euros. Yes, red again. I'm getting irreversible flashbacks (get it).<br/><br/>Ayway, save your life. Skip the film."

","The idea of Climax is an interesting one. It follows the same structure as a found-footage film if the found footage was shot professionally with a full crew. The events in the film follow a narrative but they are not leading towards anything. It's simply a progression of what might happen next in relation to preceding events. The film's problems come not from this unconventional style of storytelling but from the ""story"" itself. Nothing in the film matters any more than anything else. The film keeps the viewers interested through shock-value more than anything else which, to me, comes off as cheap. There's not much to enjoy during the movie since it's mostly unpleasant. I think I understand that it's trying to forego the need for anything other than a climax but other than the atypical structure and some of the displeasing scenes, this film isn't memorable for much."

Climax is sure one of those movies but not in a good way I'll tell you that. The thing is the pace is terrible and by that I mean that the first half of the movie is so unbelievably boring and meaningless, full of scenes of people dancing and talking about sex, drugs and gossip that it makes you angry. I felt so tempted to give up on the movie during the first 45 minutes but I decided to stick on it since I was assuming that some action was building up and I was right. The second half is full of desturbing scenes of people doing crazy and violent stuff, blaming eachother, dancing (again), screaming (all in all it's a complete mess). I really enjoy intense movies but this is something else. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone for the simple reason that the first half is boring and the second half is so disturbing that it's impossible to go through without cringing to the whole craziness of it all. If you hate yourself and you want to watch something that is going to make you feel terrible and empty then watch this movie. Also if you have any friends who think drugs are cool I recommend you make them watch it because after this they're going to change their mind.

However, to those of us who are not so easily mesmerized by gyrating bodies, this movie is quite a bore. If you take away the alluring French accents, I'm quite sure that you will agree with me that the dialogue is the equivalent of eavesdropping on someone's post-party ruminations on a urine soaked subway car at night. There is no horror. There is no plot. There is just an abundance of stupidity masked by bodies and an array of uninteresting relationships, where everyone acts as if they are so liberated, but surprise, surprise-- once some mayhem interferes, suddenly everyone's shadow self comes out to play, and then the audience finally gets to see who's an actual dancer, and who is just a poser.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. Some of Gaspar Noe's work is brilliant. But this film just wasn't one of them. And someone needs to change the genre, because nothing in this film resembled horror in the least. You know what's even scarier than a bunch of delusional, semi-repressed dancers on LSD? People watching the movie who find it entertaining without the drugs in their system.<br/><br/>Oh, and the title definitely needs to be changed as well.

It's quick and crude.<br/><br/>It appears that an actual dance troupe was hired and encouraged to ""act"". There appears to have been no script whatsoever.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are some very long dance routines. They take up almost half the movie, it's quite impressive but during the second one I found myself reaching for the fast forward button.<br/><br/>The second half of the film is incredibly boring. The contrast with the beginning is clunky. It's an entire group of twenty people acting randomly and violently, without any story. It goes on and on... there's a rough concept about a sangria spiked with LSD but that's about as much story as we get. Why did the dancers become so violent and horrible? Not explained. There's some cheap camera stunts and then the film ends.<br/><br/>It's super embarrassing that Noe turned this out.<br/><br/>Also note, I am a huge fan of electronic music, and the soundtrack really wasn't all that hot in my opinion. The long tracks played in the dance scenes are super repetitive and become tedious. The film seems to be attempting to be set in the 1990s but the music is evidently not from that time period, which contributes to the cheap quick and nasty vibe of this production."

""Climax"" is right to the point for the most part and starts of with a breathtakingly engaging dancing performance. Making most of the characters to be professional or -to be dancers was a brilliant choice, since it allowed to tell let them portray so many emotions, behaviors and experiences in a very special yet authentic and realistic, physical and often non verbal way. Always captured with beautiful and organic camera movements and a great but never ending soundtrack, that contributes to pull you in further, leaving no escape. A real horror trip. Relying neither on the supernatural or expensive effects. All we see is pure human behavior at some of its worst, sometimes tragic sometimes sadistic, under the involuntary influence of some very heavy substances.
They all had their demons (issues and worse) inside themselves right form the start.

","Within Climax is an almost perfect film (I know that can be said of any film but it's more realised here). The idea is intriguing and really well executed. This also feels like a culmination of other Noe films and themes and styles he has tried before and getting them to work (Enter the Void and We F*** Alone being the most obvious) here. It's also on the shorter side which is another positive as previous films have fallen ill to the dreaded 2+ hour runtime.<br/><br/>The camera work is inventive and exciting and the lighting is dramatic and jarring, which pairs perfectly with the animalistic dancing and character actions. It also gels perfectly with the decent into drug induced hysteria that follows. There are also extended dance sequences and scenes where the camera tracks which are both styling and gripping.<br/><br/>The script also has many of the hallmark strengths of Noe's writing style, characters being abysmal to each other whilst not feeling forced or 'shocking for the sake of shocking'. The usual narcissistic characters are back, but in this setting it fits and is less grating than in previous films (such as Love).<br/><br/>However the weaknesses are still as present as ever; namely pretentiousness. The opening sequence is an interview with all the characters, which aside from being boring serves very little purpose as the following dance scene (which should have been the first shot) is a much more effective way of establishing them, as well as being more interesting. There are also scenes of characters talking, which is probably improvised, and having some banter, but is insufferable and largely about sex (not surprising). They may seem small, but they kill the momentum and engagement the film builds. However this is largely in the first half and the final 45 minutes or so are fantastic.<br/><br/>I recommend this film but highly recommend it with this small caveat; skip the first part (start the film on the overhead shot of the turntables) and when they're drinking sangria and talking, read the first few lines and then skip to the next pair until things start kicking off. With those steps skipped you'll have watched one of the most unique and visceral films made and be left wondering why Gasper Noe isn't considered one of the greatest directors ever. Without you'll have watched a unique and visceral film, but with some glaring floors."

","It's not worth spending a great deal of time on this film and I'm not a professional critic, so I won't pretend to be; there are plenty wannabes doing that here already. Plus, there's not much to break down in Climax.<br/><br/>Meat and potatoes: Should you watch? I think the dancing is the best part from a visual perspective. The dialogue was very simple and plain. You only get minimum insight into some of the characters, others you won't get any information on. After a while, the camera angles were annoying. I can understand attempting to provide the perspective of someone under the influence of drugs and alcohol but I've seen it done better in some TV shows. Climax didn't seem to really have a climax. You just randomly followed each character through their episodes with only your interpretations of the underlying issues the characters may have been dealing with in their personal lives previously, then it ends. It lacked a thoroughly developed back story and characters development. I didn't connect with any of characters. I will say as a positive, Climax did hold my interest. Mainly, because I was waiting for something exciting to happen that ultimately, didn't transpire.<br/><br/>Verdict: Climax reminded me of my college days, when I used to party hardy several nights a week with kids that didn't go to class. Not much different happened in the movie from what I've experienced in those days, but we did know what intoxicants we were consuming (not clear what drug was actually used). It was a watchable movie that had the potential to be good, but with a few exceptions, not really worth recommending.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Take two Excedrin and call me in the morning. You may need them if you are unaccustomed to long hours of thumping club bass, EDM and a discernible room full of cigarette smoke, so aptly depicted you begin to smell the thick of it wafting through your television. This is Gaspar Noé's highly debated film Climax-the movie that transpires in a single location and sometimes even in a single 42 minute-long shot.<br/><br/>The French filmmaker is best known for creating experimental and demanding bodies of work-all of which strive to inform a kind of hell to varying degrees of success. For those unfamiliar with his 2003 film Irréversible-Roger Ebert called it ""a movie so violent and cruel that most people will find it unwatchable.""<br/><br/>As for Climax, the extreme violence we have come to associate Noé, is shed for a less tactile subject furthering his experimental style while exploring drug use. This is not to say the horror of incessant screams won't make the person in the next room over wonder what the hell you are watching.<br/><br/>Climax begins with an interview of a group of professional dancers. They are introduced through an open-ended format of questioning then a rough cut transports us to the next scene, a dance studio where we linger for the remainder of the film. It is here we witness a dance so chaotic and energetic it can only be said to mesmerize.<br/><br/>This is the best of Climax. And once it is over the best is gone too.<br/><br/>At the completion of the dance, the members hang around to celebrate their successful choreography with a sangria punch, lewd conversation and more dancing. Unbeknown to anyone or most anyone-the sangria is spiked with a ferocious hallucinogenic.<br/><br/>For the summation of the film we witness the effects of the drug and its unraveling of the dancers making them paranoid, belligerent and even dangerous to themselves and others.<br/><br/>You will find buried messages throughout the film-messages that are an important part of the dialog today. Credit where credit is due, Gaspar Noé is not afraid of experimenting with intriguing concepts even in the face of failure. But sometimes it is the failure staring us down at the end. That does not mean we should ever stop trying."

","Climax follows a dance troupe who spend a night in a secluded, abandoned school in the middle of a snowstorm. When the troupe's sangria is spiked with LSD, the group must find a way to survive the night.<br/><br/>Let me start off by saying that this film, on a technical level, is very impressive. While the first half of the movie has relatively standard cinematography, the second half is done almost entirely in one take. It really makes you feel like you're there and witnessing all of these disturbing things right along with the characters. And the dancing in Climax is also excellent. It's engaging, inventive, and of course really solid.<br/><br/>However, whilst these are big strengths of the film, it has some big issues as well. Namely, that the first half is quite dull. It's supposed to be building up the eventual madness in the second half, but frankly the film isn't insane enough to warrant sitting through what feels like half an hour of just watching people gossip. Perhaps these scenes would be more interesting if I had some emotional attachment to any of the characters. The opening tries to do this; right after the credits (yes, this film starts with credits for no real reason), we cut to footage of the dancers being interviewed about their passions, vices, regrets, etc. But there are simply far too many for me to keep track of. As a result, most of the insanity of the later half of the film wasn't engaging because I was unsure of everyone's connections to each other, aside from the fact that they were all in a dance troupe. So stuff like the attempted incest later in the movie was completely lost on me, since for all I know the characters involved don't even know each other.<br/><br/>Another problem I had with Climax was that it really didn't have any meaningful point or purpose behind it. Honestly, if a film is going to put me through 45 minutes of boredom followed by 45 minutes of chaotic, incoherent madness, I should at least be rewarded with something that makes it even a little worth it. But no. The film ends with police arriving the morning after everything happens, and we see the various states the characters are in. We see this one lady put acid into her eye, which I guess implies that she was the one who spiked the sangria and sent everything into chaos. But since we barely know this character at all, and there isn't any explanation for why she spiked the drinks. We see her with this book on how LSD affects people psychologically, but come on. Nobody on earth would put all of their friends in danger by sending them on an acid trip just for some sort of experiment. Don't get me wrong, an ambiguous ending is fine, but a lack of reasoning behind the main event of the movie is not.<br/><br/>The director of Climax, Gaspar Noe, in an interview with Candid Magazine stated that the theme of the film was ""a group of people creating something together and then collapsing."" This, I think, showcases the true intentions of Climax. It is not a movie meant to say anything. Rather, it is supposed to shock and disgust and that's it. After all, I don't even know what Gaspar is on about with the supposed ""theme"" of the movie. It isn't a statement on society/life lesson like a theme is, nor is it even a bare bones description of the plot. A group of people do not create the sangria; it's the mother and the mother alone who makes it. Asking Gaspar Noe the theme of Climax is like asking Stephenie Myer about the symbolism in Twilight. There is none.<br/><br/>As far as Climax is in the scariness department, it falls flat because the entire second is a balancing act between being disturbing and tiresome. Whilst the film does succeed in some places, it falls flat far more often. If you want a better movie about crazy things happening to people who take drugs, go watch Requiem for a Dream, a movie that actually bothers with basic storytelling devices like theme and motivation. Just... don't watch Climax."

Yawn, what a bore. No zombies, no vampires, no demons. Not even a serial killer in sight.

"fedor8","Null","0","3","29 November 2019"," Shlock cinema with a ""message"". So original...
","If you decide to watch this silly nonsense, do yourself a favour and skip directly to the 50-minute mark, roughly. That's where the movie starts. No joke.<br/><br/>The first 50 minutes are ""character development"", which is fairly odd considering there is no time to develop/introduce 15-20 characters in the space of a mere movie, much less a horror flick. Suffice it to say, the first 10 minutes consist almost entirely of monotonous ""VHS"" interviews with (mostly) airhead dancers, after which we get tortured with a bloody silly 5-minute musical number(!), this in turn being followed by 30 minutes of random and brief conversations between the extremely dim-witted low-life characters. This segment includes yet another utterly pointless lengthy musical number. Needless to say, I fast-forwarded that too.<br/><br/>Then the violence erupts. Apparently, someone spiked the alcohol with LSD - although I suspect it's more likely to be the notorious ""New Extreme French Cinema"" drug - and all hell breaks loose. But because this isn't an American movie, the violence is generally perpetrated by blacks, with usually whites as their victims. It's hard to say whether this was intentional though, especially because so much of the movie seems random and improvised. (At one point the camera turns upside-down, and stays that way for a long time, and I wouldn't necessarily bet that this was planned either.) If Americans or Brits had made the same movie (I know, very difficult to imagine them producing something so intrinsically French as this cuckoo-for-caca drivel), the blacks would be victims of white violence: it's pathetic how each region/country/culture has its own (hidden) political/social agenda; nobody is innocent anymore, and everyone wants to preach and teach, rarely to entertain. Bias bias bias everywhere: there is racism among racists and ""anti-racists"" alike. Nevertheless, there is no obvious or at least central racial agenda or theme here, aside from one of the black dancers shouting ""you white pigs!"" while severely beating a white dancer.<br/><br/>I am convinced hipster cinemaphiles love this flick though. Aside from the fact that it tackles some of their favourite subjects such as insanity, drug use, incest, anti-social behavior, masturbation, homosexuality, weirdness, and extreme violence, it is an unusually (read: stupidly) structured film which is to their liking. It's very much fringe cinema (though nothing remotely as extreme as the depraved 70s underground cult scene), and to a hipster fringe cinema can do no wrong, just as commercial cinema can do no right. (Hipsters have strict rules which they must abide by, otherwise they risk losing credibility with their militant peers. This goes for music too, and perhaps even hats and coffee.)<br/><br/>The plot, despite the ""elaborate"" i.e. arty set-up, is very basic. It is even more primitive than some zombie movies. I specifically mention those because this essentially plays out like a zombie flick: the difference being that people aren't bitten/infected but high on drugs. The effects are very similar though: total barbarism and random violence. I guess this is why the film-maker decided on such an odd structure, because he perhaps felt that the story was so ultra-simplistic that the film required additional ""decoration"", something to impress the art-crowd with. Correction: the bloody-thirsty art-crowd...<br/><br/>Yet, this pretentious decision to over-decorate is more-or-less why the movie fails. Wasting FIFTY minutes of screen-time, i.e. more than half the movie, on superficial/dull banter involving very dull nitwits makes it impossible for me give the film a rating better than 3/10. I had to fast-forward large chunks of the movie, so it's a wonder the film gets even that much from me.<br/><br/>Naturally, the movie has no point to make, at least not any new or intelligent point - despite what hipsters might claim. I haven't read any reviews, but they probably believe that the film makes some ""powerful statement about our inherent barbarism"" or some such pretentious laughable malarkey. Although, to be fair, this is mostly true: give idiots half a chance, and they will become violent. Nevertheless, hipsters being staunchly left-wing would mean they contradict themselves and their idol Marx if they adopted the view that humans are still essentially easily manipulated savages with an intrinsically evil essence. After all, don't (millennial) hipsters foster the illusion that they are so much smarter and more evolved than older generations? Don't these ""trendy"" young dancers qualify as ""evolved, hip, and smart"" to hipsters? Doesn't Marx elevate humans to an almost god-like status? (No, wait, that highly optimistic ""great and sudden evolution"" comes AFTER the great overthrow of evil capitalism, according to the pompous 19th-century couch philosopher...)<br/><br/>The director tries hard to give this shock-cinema ""art-house"" nonsense a stamp of intellectual credibility - through the use of cheesy quasi-intellectual captions - but whoever falls for that lame fortune-cookie ""trick"" only has their own gullibility to blame. This film is just an excuse to create train-wreck situations for thrill-seeking blood-thirsty film buffs. Most of these film buffs are completely unaware of this thirst for blood in themselves, and those who are justify their interest in it by treating the quasi-intellectual captions as poignant rather than laughable, thereby allowing such movies to get away with murder - simply on the pretext that ""it's all symbolism anyway"".<br/><br/>Yeah, sure it is."

"RaulFerreiraZem","5","0","3","21 October 2019"," Climax
","Climax, to me can be defined by 30 or so minutes of ostentatious film making, with its long takes and its gogard-ian stylized texts,etc. Plus about 60 or so minutes of empty sensationalism.<br/><br/>One must wonder, how can Noe at the same time romanticize and aestheticize this semi bohemian, recreational drug taking lifestyle while being such a moralistic tool? ( all the adulterous people in his films end up being punished in one way or another, in his films drugs lead to alienation and death.) The only answer i can think of is this; Aestheticizing and problematizing and most importantly, making it seem counter cultural and dangerous to live such a lifestyle he essentially is making himself a martyr and a hero for despite of such dangers indulging himself in drugs and sex.<br/><br/>Despite all of that, the film is not a failure since all of its artifices work quite well.
The long introduction works as a premonitory character investigation and can give you early hints on where the movie is going. One weird thing worth pointing out however is the way the movie depicts black people. So early on we have a really long and uncomfortable scene where two black men discuss raping one of their colleagues. Not only that but later in the film in the lynching scene we see a white woman as innocent and fragile while black men and women ignorantly accuse her and literally ask her to kill herself. Not only that but the only one person who stands up for her is a white woman.<br/><br/>Quite alike to the first minutes of Irreversible, the last 20 or so minutes of Climax use some of the same camera effects to disorient to build suspense. All of that works really well, but like the rest of the film seem gratuitous. In love with nihilist catchphrases Noe almost at the end of the film says to us that Living is a collective impossibility. It might be so, but it seems like a bit of a exaggeration coming from a film that depicts a tragedy that could be so easily avoided. The sole fact that he had to go as far as digging some urban legend from 20 years ago just to make his audience feel like people are awful and untrustworthy makes me realize how much people are great and trustworthy. I don't think that living is a collective impossibility, i think that Noe's films try really hard to depict collective cases of bad faith."

""Slow build up to ending"".<br/><br/>Introduction<br/><br/>Climax is a 2018, Drama and Horror movie, according to IMDb. It's produced in France, which mandates watching with subtitles on, if indeed you only speak English like me.<br/><br/>Storyline<br/><br/>From the word go, horror and music themes are suggested casually. Voices and temperaments are clearly engaging, from the opening instant. A clever beginning.
Ideas to be taken further, are quickly introduced, giving you a clear sense of the main movie themes. This provides a hook to retain the viewer. Introduction is slightly too long however.
Following this, things retain interest and intensity, but the plot is slow to progress, which after a time makes things appear tiresome.
Following a slightly mediocre centre, the film progresses towards the ending nicely. Themes such as gore were well implemented here, with despair, stress, profound sadness, fear, and anger. Labelling sections with title pages throughout, also adds something. Not many films feature this.<br/><br/>Genre<br/><br/>The progression of horror vibes after the opening was too slow. It took far too long for anything shocking to occur. In parts, the film was more Drama or Adventure focused than Horror, sadly.
From the middle though, the genre became more and more of a Horror, until it actually earned it's reputation as a great film. It was very unusual in it's set of themes, but eventually lived up to it's name. It was in fact, difficult to tell exactly when it became a true horror, but once the whole film had elapsed, it almost certainly did.<br/><br/>Characters<br/><br/>Characters quickly differentiated themselves by their responses to questions asked. This allowed the viewer a way into their personalities, which emotionally seemed nicely variable.
The character emotions were tested hugely from middle to end. As the film name suggests, it does build up to a ""Climax"". It's a shame that the beginning half an hour, didn't provide sufficient horror themes, leaving the viewer only partly engaged. Thankfully though, from this point onwards: Pleasure, satisfaction, fear, despair, grief and turmoil, all ensued. Characters were well portrayed throughout, and really sculpted a distinctive signature for the film. It's one you'll struggle to forget.<br/><br/>Music<br/><br/>Eerie music from the word go, ramping up to more sinister tones. Contrast used well. Music was a central theme throughout, helping its variability.
From middle to end, the music really develops into it's own. Becoming a haunting backdrop for the horror themes that develop. The overall soundtrack is a real triumph, and very cleverly created and selected.<br/><br/>Summary<br/><br/>""Fabulous conclusion and profoundly unique"".<br/><br/>Follow us: Reasea dot org<br/><br/>Tags:<br/><br/>Comedy, horror, thriller, horror movie review, monster, monster party, 2018 horror review, gory horror, monsters, clowns, clown horror, dungeons, Micky, reaseaorg, benandthegang, Fossafitness, followus, moviefans, reasonedandseasoned, hey Micky, Mickytheclown, adrift, open water, open water 2, no sharks ?, climax, french movies,"

"clockworkorange13","5","0","2","14 June 2019"," Pretty bad movie
","I read that this movie was based on a 5 page outline, and that sounds exactly right to me, based on what I saw. Its about 5 minutes worth of content desperately stretched out to 95 minutes. The movie is extremely dull and drags on and on and on with close to nothing happening and no forward motion in the plot. I watched almost the whole movie at 1.5x speed, that was the way I could make it til the end."

","Let's start by making something crystal clear: I'm not a big fan of gore, torture, snuff or such kind of content in cinema. Not that it disturbs me or freaks me out. I'm simply not particularly fond of it, but I've enjoyed my share of it when it serves a purpose. Unfortunately, in Climax Gaspar Noé has no story to tell, no message to deliver, just a poor, weak excuse of a remotely imaginative concept to let loose on the screen an increasingly annoying collection of sexual graphic scenes, violent imagery and deranged acts that feel out of place even in the context of the movie. It's just a lazy effort to get all avant-garde critics to come out of their shells and claim it's a bold take from a brave director, a raw experience showing the true nature of humans and whatnot. The truth is that besides the interesting cinematography and a solid music score that fits the film perfectly (although gets a bit tedious after a while) there's nothing else to salvage from a film so meaningless and empty it could only produce an equally empty review."

","This movie blows. Was expecting some real disturbing stuff to go down, but the worst thing you see is a girl cutting herself with a knife. Snooze. There's no plot and certain scenes go on for way too long. Just more pretentious crap from Gaspar Noe. You want a really good dark art film? Watch the 2018 ""Suspiria."" Better story and actually has a plot. Only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because I liked how the 2nd half looked like it was filmed all in one take."

"piggulu","3","0","1","22 March 2019"," You'll need to be under the influence of something to enjoy
","Simply a waste of time. I generally don't mind slow-burns or potboilers, but this movie goes absolutely nowhere. Much of the problem is the large cast involved (20+) and but none of them are actually captivating to care.<br/><br/>The film starts off with each dancer's ""interview"" where they discuss various life goals which goes on forever since they have to go through everybody. Then they break into a remarkable uncut extended ensemble dance routine which is the absolute highlight of the movie and worth 1 solid star.<br/><br/>Then they sit and talk. And chat. And discuss. And gossip. And banter. And gab. And confer. And parley. And argue. And converse. And babble. And spout. And prattle. And jabber. And vent. And whine. And cluck. And yak. And yap. And yammer. And yarn. For over a brain-mushingly half-hour!<br/><br/>I should've followed my instincts and just left. The supposed upcoming ""climax"" was an empty promise; you would see better drug trips by drawing circles on paper.<br/><br/>After another, less spectacular dance-off, people realize they've been drugged and a brief confrontation while trying to figure out who spiked the punch ensues. For the rest of the time, everyone is either wandering around aimlessly or continuing to dance (which the camera spends an obnoxious amount of time focusing on). There's some interpersonal relationship drama that pokes its head out once in a while (earning a couple more points) but nothing worth sitting around for.<br/><br/>Don't be fooled by the title or tagline of ""Horror"", there is nothing scary, suspenseful, or rewarding. Violence is minuscule and tame. Nothing gets resolved in the end because there was nothing put forth in the first place. Go outside and stare at the sun instead."

","I loved every single bit of this movie. Even though it was very extreme and at some points very unsettling. Every performance felt real with every actor giving a very uncomfortable yet amazing performance. It holds no boundaries on how far to take the next scene. Every bit of emotion can be felt while watching this film. There are a few problems as far as character choices but it in no way affects the film negatively. This is definitely a movie that will appeal to most of you horror junkies out there."

","A totally insane nightmare full of memorable images. The performances were intense and expressive, as expected of dancers. This was by no means lighthearted, but compared to other Noé films, this was easy and much more fun to watch unfold."
"deloudelouvain","7","0","4","14 February 2019"," Gaspar Noé, a name you won't forget once you watched one of his movies.
","Climax is not a movie for everyone, and that becomes clear when you read the reviews that go from excellent to bad, but you got to give it to director Gaspar Noé, he can make provocative movies like no one else can. But not only the provocative aspect of the movie is interesting but also and mostly the way of filming his subjects. It's all very weird and special, a visual fest for the eyes. The story is quite simple but effective and that's all due to the strange ambiance that reigns throughout the whole movie. Seul Contre Tous is still Gaspar Noé's best work, at least to me, but with Irréversible and now Climax he showed everybody that he's a natural talent and that his movies make people talk about it. I can't wait for the next Gaspar Noé movie, as I'm always curious what it will be this time."
"kosmasp","8","0","2","12 February 2019"," Influenced by ...
","This is not an easy watch. And while Climax may suggest this to be very sexual or at least sensual, you might be dissapointed if you're looking for that kind of ""satisfaction"". The choreography of the dancing is really good, the cinematography is something to behold too. If you don't mind long uninterrupted shots that is of course.<br/><br/>This is about addiction, about people driven to go the extra mile and about people hoarded in a secluded location going ""nuts"" as some might describe it. And as a different reviewer wrote: this is an experience. It will split a lot of people as it did at the various festivals it played. This is not an ordinary movie, but when has Noe done that? So if you are aware of his body of work, you at least know not to expect something ""normal"". Now some have stated, that if you had experience with certain drugs, you may understand or ""enjoy"" this experience more than others. I can't talk to that, not having had that experience. I can say though that this is quite rough to watch. Especially when things spiral downwards ...<br/><br/>Still very enticing and tension filled. Technically almost flawless it will depend what you make of the ""story"" or rather the excuse of one to get the viewer to go on a ... well ""trip""!"

","""Clímax"", new film by the illustrious, technical and accurate Gaspar Noé does not have the same impact and power of his previous works, but continues with a very clear technique and keeps his signature present, the objective of moving the viewer, what is displayed, and that goal is reaching to perfection.
The film tells the story of a dance group that goes to an abandoned room to do their last rehearsal, and they end up being drugged, and during that trip they find their inner self, their real beings come up without the re-usation of social reins, your inner monsters come along with your fears. Will I be a good mother? Will someone ever relate to me? Love me? Who I am? I feel forbidden desires. These are questions that arise in each character. Even so, this is a depth of script that exists but is not quite as deep, but works, it works to contextualize the real meaning of the long, cinematic immersion.
We have a camera that starts behaving, with wonderful sequences sequences aligned to good and uncomfortable choreographies, but that with the passing of the film, it gains a life of its own and goes into the habit of each character, and thus, if lost completely, The camera rotates 360 It gives jumps, closed planes, medium planes, aerial planes, we do not have a pattern. We have only one focus that is to cause the viewer to immerse, so we need more technical devices such as photography and games of lights, dark and reddish, that shine according to the state of the film's spirit, its strong and vibrant colors bother, such which is a kind of classical music, electronic and urban, is exquisite, it has a cool touch and at the same time is long and nauseating, it is uncomfortable and at the same time attractive, such a junction of technical aspects added to the delirious and ungovernable performances culminate in a film difficult to digest, but rewarding.
Because Gaspar Noe can again fulfill his goal as a director, we are sucked into another dimension during the film, a dark and dangerous dimension, it is tense. like every movie, it seems that life is always on the line and that we are going to die due to insanity and our inner monstrosity. ""Climax"" is far from perfect, with some gruesome performances and repetitions of the idea. Gaspar Noe's new film takes on and perfectly fulfills the promise (despite the exaggerated marketing)."
"novacasa42","9","0","1","8 February 2019"," An exhilarating EXPERIENCE that will most definitely take your breath away.
","Gaspar Noe's Climax is a work of art, I can end the review right here and no additional words are needed, Noe exercises chaos in its most beautiful state, he crafts this perception of things much like an actual LSD trip, few minutes into the film and I assure you that you'll be consumed by it, it has a psychedelic rhythm that sways back and forth and shocks you out of your mind, having watched Noe's previous works, I feel like I'm familiar with his bold and shocking style but this takes it to a whole other level, much like an actual climax this sets in slowly and beautifully, it's truly amazing, to say the least.<br/><br/>Not a lot of people get Gaspar's style, it's often mislabeled and it sometimes comes across as pretentious, none of that is true, his work is fascinating and captivating, I dare you to find a dull moment in this film, it's an exhilarating EXPERIENCE that will most definitely take your breath away, Incredible film."

","The directors movies are getting better and better. I wasnt a fan of Irreversible as it was mercilessly and relentlessly morbid to an extent few movies are. This movies 2nd half again is also a hard watch, its an acid overdoses worst scenario. Alaia Alsafir is hot and I hope shes back for a sequel lol, or any movie for that matter. It stands up there with Requeim for a Dream in the genre of drug horror movies. The dancers are amazing and must be quadruple jointed or something, never seen anything like it. Its the most unusual musical youll ever watch. You will either love it or hate it thats clear from the already posted reviews. Reminded me of the remake of Suspiria which recently came out which also puts a strong emphasis on dance choreography as a theme. If your a fan of Black Swan you will also dig this."
"gabolasky","8","0","1","2 February 2019"," Needed a seatbelt on my seat to watch this movie
","The way that Gaspar takes you from the most happy to the most anxious is amazing, this is the definition of the worst trip imaginable, too look around you and realize that you are f#$#ed up so you look for someone to bring you back to reality and find out that everyone is as f#@&d up as you, or worse.
Lots of different emotions going on in this picture.
Photography is amazing plus the colors and the sounds used make you feel very uncomfortable on some parts and very happy and ready to party on others.
Ending is marvelous, very clear and should live you with no questions asked.
Although I did get the feeling in some scenes that they would not happen in real life but at the same time im just a person that knows certein people so maybe they are possible.
would have liked a little bit more light in some cenes to get a clearer view of what was happening but again its also part of what gets you in the mood of a very bad trip."
