"BigMez","7","115","147","10 November 2006"," A Mythic Penguin Tale
","I saw this last weekend at a special screening and was suitably impressed. Although I'm a big fan of George Miller's films, I was very hesitant to see this one. I'm not a big fan of animated films, much less musicals. The trailers looked awful and indicated nothing about the story. Until the screening came up, I had no intention of seeing this on the big screen. After the opening musical number, the movie quickly won me over. The way it's made is incredibly cinematic, and, at its heart, tells a great mythic story: an outcast leaves his community and journeys to the edge of the world to find a way to end the famine that's plaguing his species. Along this quest, our hero, Mumble, learns to live with his outsider status (he can't sing) and makes use of his own particular gift (tap dancing). It's a simple story that's told in a very creative way with a lot of heart. <br/><br/>The musical numbers, instead of having a disrupting effect and stopping the flow of the story, actually advance the plot because they're integral to the story and this particular type of penguin. Emperor Penguins apparently find their mates by singing. While it all sounds the same to us, they are highly attuned to each others songs. The film cleverly translates that idea to the screen by having these animated penguins sing iconic pop/rock songs. <br/><br/>I thought the animation was top notch and the style perfectly suited for the story. This isn't the goofy cartoonish animation seen in this past year's other animal-oriented films. It's very rich and leaning heavily towards realism. The vast icy landscapes seem to be copied straight from documentary footage. Just jaw-droppingly beautiful.<br/><br/>There's one shot in the film which really epitomizes how well made it is and made me love it that much more. Mumble, his four friends, and the old wise mentor (Lovelace) are heading to the edge of the world as they know it. They're caught in a snow blizzard. The six penguins are shown in almost a dark silhouette as they struggle to move forward. The fading red light of the sun provides faint illumination. As the penguins are pushed back by the blizzard, they lean into the wind and keep going. It's almost like something out of a Kurosawa movie. And that's all it is. Just one shot of the blizzard. But it's beautifully done. Never seen anything like it in an animated film.<br/><br/>By the end of the film, my initial reservations about the film were completely washed away. Disregard the lame trailers and see it for yourself."

","I saw this film on October 2nd, 2006 in Indianapolis. I am one of the judges for the Heartland Film Festival's Truly Moving Picture Award. A Truly Moving Picture ""explores the human journey by artistically expressing hope and respect for the positive values of life."" Heartland gave that award to this film.<br/><br/>It's not easy being a young penguin when you can't sing and singing well is how you find your one true soul mate. The mating happens when young couples are attracted to each other's own rendition of their heart song. And to make matters even worse, the young penguin, Mumble, is a natural tap dancer, which is not appreciated by his parents or his teachers or the penguin colony. And to top it all off, there is a shortage of fish and no one knows why.<br/><br/>The unhappy young Mumble runs into 5 small Latino penguins from another penguin colony and the adventure takes off. The story line cuts back and forth between the fish shortage environmental mystery and Mumble's attempt to be attractive to Gloria, his love interest. Along the way he runs into penguin eating birds and penguin eating mammals and almost alien-like man made machines.<br/><br/>This is a musical comedy animation and the songs are classic rock and the dance routines are Broadway-theater clever and these songs and dances never stop throughout the film.<br/><br/>Mumble is a loser in the eyes of his peers, and feels a lot of pain. But he is also heroic and brave and optimistic and he never gives up. Those traits do not let him down. Mumble can pass on an important message to young people. It's your attitude that can carry you through successfully in life. It is not always about physical attributes and physical beauty.<br/><br/>Robin Williams voices Ramon, one of the small Latino penguins, and also Lovelace, the film-flam psychic of the Latino penguin colony. Robin Williams' two characters are over the top which is perfect for the normally over the top Robin Williams. This comedic element keeps the film from taking its adult themes too seriously.<br/><br/>FYI  There is a Truly Moving Pictures web site where there is a listing of past Truly Moving Picture Award winners that are now either at the theater or available on video."
"pgear83","10","22","29","16 January 2007"," A Joyful Masterpiece
","George Miller's Happy Feet is an exuberant, beautifully animated film and, by a wide margin, the best CG film ever made. The photo-realistic characters and Antarctic landscapes provide the backdrop for a story of brilliant originality. The film's plot is somewhat based in reality - but with a surreal twist. The movie is a spectacular jukebox musical in which Emperor penguins serenade each other with songs from some of the royalty of music (Queen, Prince, ""The King"" Elvis Presley) in order to find a mate. One penguin, Mumble, cannot sing but expresses himself through tap-dancing. For this abnormality, he is ostracized by his fellows, blamed for the misfortune of famine and eventually banished from his home. He then goes on a perilous quest to find answers that are not otherwise forthcoming.<br/><br/>In addition to the music and spectacle, the greatness of Happy Feet is found in its ideas. Miller (producer of Babe) has made another great film for children (though certainly not only for children) because he knows that the great children's stories do not merely pander to and occupy them but attempt to convey something about the nature of the world, something that is not necessarily pleasant. The themes of Happy Feet are as timeless as they are important. Tolerance and respect for those different from you, compassion, respect for the environment and for the dignity of all its inhabitants; these are not political issues but ones of the greatest moral importance and essential to the survival of the human spirit. In a world that sometimes seems to be becoming increasing intolerant, in a world that may be standing on the precipice of environmental disaster if something is not done, I find a great deal of hope in this story. These animated penguins, who show more humanity than most human actors do on celluloid, may just have what it takes to bring out the basic goodness in the people who see them, to ""appeal to our better nature,"" if you will.<br/><br/>On another level, I see Happy Feet as a great parable about the generation gap, with Mumble and his friends as the children of the world. Their differences and uniqueness frighten their elders, who may be falsely pious or else just set in their ways. Yet Mumble does not hold a grudge against them. In the end, Mumble not only makes the world better than it was when it was given to him, but actively draws those same elders into this new world, redeeming them and allowing them to help in its creation. All with the power of song and dance!<br/><br/>Overall, Happy Feet is a joyous spectacle for the eyes and ears. It was so good that I had to see it a second time in the theater, something I had never done before. It even makes tap-dancing seem incredibly cool. This is a film that cannot be ignored and will not be forgotten."
"I_amindeed","10","125","194","5 December 2006"," This was a great film for all ages
","Finally saw this on Sunday when it previewed in the UK (out on full release Friday). The cinema was packed with kids ranging from babies to teenagers. Our group had kids from 3-15 in it as well as the parents. We all absolutely loved it; what I thought was so good was that the kids in the party all reacted according to their ages. The little ones just thought the penguins were cute and the chase scenes etc were thrilling. But the older ones thought the film had a deeper message and really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I would normally be fairly bored at a kids' film and have just gone to take the kids - but all the adults were fascinated the whole time. We all agreed that it was easily the best animated movie of the year. I would recommend it for any age of kid. The audience in general obviously loved it judging by the laughter but by the enthralled silence at the dramatic parts.<br/><br/>Most families obviously consist of children of different ages - so it is not easy to find a film that appeals to teenagers as well as 3 year olds. This one did - an had the adults enthralled as well. I am not surprised that it beat Casino Royale at the Box Office in US 2 week ends running.<br/><br/>The green message was great - I think it is really important that children should be aware of not littering etc, respecting the planet, from a young age. Having said that, I'm not sure the kids really got that message but it might have had some effect on the older ones.<br/><br/>Have read some stuff on here saying kids should not be taught liberal values or not be made aware of them. Liberal values like tolerance and fairness etc. The film didn't promote those values more than a lot of kids' movies but even if it had I can't imagine why anyone would be worried about that so I'm not going to give it serious consideration.<br/><br/>The film I went to see was basically a really exciting adventure story with excellent acting - you really felt for Mumble - he wasn't just a stock character. I thought Elijah Wood did an excellent job in that role. Quite a few people on the internet are asking - why use such famous actors for Happy Feet - why not have an unknown voice cast? Obviously having a very big name cast of A listers costs far more and so reduces the profits - at least that might appear to be the case. Here is one reply I found - ""some of the famous actors out there are famous (and expensive) for a reason- they're good at what they do. Elijah Wood really is pretty amazing at playing a sympathetic lead; Nicole Kidman has a fantastic singing voice to go along with a sweet stage presence...."" The visual effects were really breath-taking, probably the best animation I've ever seen. But the film also had an intriguing story with some depth - it wasn't just a bland cutesy film.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend it for children, especially when you think of all the predictable rubbish that Hollywood often serves up for family films.<br/><br/>Up-date - I am very pleased that it won the Oscar for Best Animated; I thought that it was clearly the best animated film of the year - and also I was pleased to see the Academy award originality and depth as opposed to a pleasant but rather bland, mix-as-before Pixar product."
"dfranzen70","8","117","182","19 November 2006"," Feets don't fail me now!
","Happy Feet, directed by the man who gave us both Babe: Pig in the City and Mad Max, is just the kind of feel-good animated film that works on a few different levels; it'll make you laugh, it'll make you cry, and it'll inevitably, unquestionably, make you tap your toes or bounce your leg, right there in the theater. It's charming and exquisitely detailed, and it succeeds where it really counts: It makes you really feel for the lovable lead penguin, Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood).<br/><br/>Mumble is an unfortunate penguin, you see, because was born with no singing ability, and in his penguin tribe one attracts a mate through the use of song. The poor flightless bird can only look on helplessly as his fellow hatchlings croon their little hearts out. Amazingly, though, Mumble can tap dance, a big no-no in the penguin community. Soon, with no heart song to guide him, Mumble isn't permitted to graduate from school, to the chagrin of his Elvis-like dad (Hugh Jackman) and his songbird-like mom (Nicole Kidman).<br/><br/>Mumble heart belongs to the best singer in his age group, Gloria (Brittany Murphy), but without the gift of song he can't hope to woo her. Worse, with the penguins' food supply running out, some of the other birds begin to blame Mumble's foot-tapping, that somehow he is angering the great god Guin. The sad-sack penguin is then drummed out of the penguin corps, shunned for his lack of song and strength of feet, and he runs into another penguin colony, one that uses pebbles to woo their females instead of song, and makes new friends - a Latino-sounding quartet that's high on life, full of zest and pizazz and charisma, everything that Mumble's old group isn't.<br/><br/>Then Mumble hears from some predator birds of mysterious ""aliens"" who probe and attach tags to their victims. Mumble thinks these aliens might have something to do with the lack of fishies for everyone to munch on, so he and his new pals head off on a Quest to find these aliens and ask them to stop stealing all the fish.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are beautifully imagined, including attacks by sea lions (quite harrowing, actually, until its denouement), vultures, and killer whales, not to mention every time Mumble and/or his posse leap off a cliff and slide down the side like avian sleds. Or through ice tunnels. Or through the water itself, shooting like streaming jetliners with mile-long contrails. Gorgeous animation.<br/><br/>At its heart, the movie is about how it's okay to Be Different. It's about how older folks sometimes hold prejudices that are as illogical as they are insulting, and how they'll often pass along those prejudices to their children, sometimes through direct actions and sometimes by dint of their inaction when wrongs are being perpetuated.<br/><br/>Robin Williams takes on four roles in this movie: the Narrator (where he's excellent and not at all hammy), Ramon and Cletus (two of the feisty new penguins), and Lovelace, a self-professed penguin guru to whom penguins go to have their problems solved. On the one hand, Williams is delightful doing what he does best, improvising rapid-fire comic patter to get laughs; on the other hand, he's Robin Williams, and although there are differences between his voice characterizations, they all bear a strong resemblance to one another. As with most animated films, the movie is well-cast; Jackman is particular has an appealing Southern drawl (ironically, he and Kidman are Aussies playing penguins with southern accents).<br/><br/>In the wake of the phenomenal, surprise success of March of the Penguins, Happy Feet makes your heart soar from start to finish. It'll be very difficult not to shed a tear at the mistreatment of Mumble by his peers and his elders, and it'll be near impossible to thoroughly enjoy this dazzling animated offering."
"jdesando","Null","120","194","15 November 2006"," Happy Film
","Tap-dancing penguins could never have been pitched if the mega-hit doc Marching Penguins (2005) had not caught the imagination of every breathing human. Only this time around Happy Feet is not a doc but a high-class animation (from the director of the very humane Babe) and much more anthropomorphic than Marching Penguins because these are tap-dancing penguins.<br/><br/>Besides the themes of individualism and environmental destruction, Happy Feet's special effects take animation as close to 3-D as could be possible in a 2-D medium. One scene with frolicking penguins careening down a mountain has the sight and sound of rapid descent so authentic as to make me cringe at each turn for fear of flying off the snow into the sky. The colors are luminous and the long and helicopter-like shots stunning enough to make you feel you're watching IMAX.<br/><br/>Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) has no singing voice, so he can't sing a ""heart-song,"" the signature croon of a male to attract a female for life. But as Nature frequently compensates, that boy can dance. A hard-to-accept-it dad (Hugh Jackman) laments, ""It just ain't penguin."" The adventures of this hippity-hop outcast bring him to a band of diminutive Latinos headed by a savvy Ramon (Robin Williams), who helps him to find his inner heart-song in his feet and eventually the source of fish depletion (the ""aliens"" are a familiar race of buccaneersus).<br/><br/>Along the way Mumble finds soulful love with Gloria (Brittney Murphy), a young lady strong in song and belief in Mumble. Speaking of song, much of the score, while replete with pop standards from the likes of the Beach Boys and Sinatra, adapts several gospel tunes to accentuate the theme of a savior being rejected by his own kind.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is a happy film that features cutting-edge CG while it teaches young and old about tolerance and talent. This is the season for the tuxedo crowdshaken and stirred."
"crowhawk60","9","107","172","18 November 2006"," Impressive, Expressive and Delightful for all ages
","Rarely do I enjoy animated films these days: I find the animation (mostly computer generated) to be colorful but banal, and the action angles are selected by the programmer's eye, not the way a natural observer would have seen the shot (like we saw in classic cell animation of years past). ""Happy Feet"" is different. The combination of rotoscoping (now advanced motion capture), intense attention to detail and organic POV make this film extraordinarily enjoyable to watch. The sound quality was top-notch, and the music loads of fun for anyone with a pulse. The character voices from Robin Williams, Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, and others was perfectly matched to their characterizations. Savion Glover's performance as Mumble's ecstatic feet was not only good as a an animated fanciful Emperor Penguin, but also valid as a fine, skilled tap dancer; one of the finest. The continuity was good, impressive editing, and the message clear: celebrate our differences, adapt to change when necessary, and don't be afraid to take on challenges, even when they seems insurmountable. That's a great message for anyone at any age."
"yegdad","7","102","167","13 November 2006"," A visual masterpiece.
","This movie set the bar at a new level for animation. This is a great companion piece to ""March of the Penguins"". (In fact, you should see ""March of the Penguins"" before seeing this one.) While the stock animated movie script still seems be 'cute-yet-quirky animals on quest', this one pulls it off better than most.<br/><br/>Arguably, the film makers tried to cram too many songs into the soundtrack. And the story didn't need to be as long as it was but the overall environmental message was good.<br/><br/>In the end, you'll look how the choices of our 'modern' lifestyles affect the rest of the world.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth the watch -- and a discussion with your kids afterward."
"Blotkey","8","119","203","11 November 2006"," Hilarious and Realistically Haunting at the Same Time
","This is the kind of movie that conceals deeper depths and vividly exhilarating emotion overall.<br/><br/>First interpretation: ""Ok, it's a movie about a penguin that dances and has trouble finding a mate. How profound can this movie be?"" Then the movie revealed themes I never thought they would accomplish such as Religious fanaticism and Human's destruction of the environment.<br/><br/>It reminded me of 6th Sense because it was so twisted yet taught a very important moral lesson.<br/><br/>Robin Williams is the highlight of the movie, his 2 characters are both well portrayed and well voiced.<br/><br/>Highly recommended. It made me want to go out and save the penguins."
"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","55","89","21 December 2006"," A well-translated 'individual vs. society' romp
","Animated comedies have become what Mike Tyson was to the boxing scene in the 1980's: a safe bet. This begs an upsurge in quality for the market and the otherwise forgettable family fluff films have begun to interweave deeper, more salient issues in their stories. Political messages about environmental problems was perhaps the last thing I expected to find rotating around in a happy, tappy romp like 'Happy Feet' but the fact is they are there, and they are superbly handled, as is much of the film.<br/><br/>Advertising the film as a propaganda vehicle would have been grossly unwise, which is why the simple template story rings true to most people. All that has been put forward in trailers and synopses is the lonely journey of the Emperor Penguin Mumble (Elijah Wood), who is an outcast owing to his poor singing voice and tapalicious feet. The rest of the tight-knit, conformist community all rely on special heartsongs to appeal to mates, and not being able to carry a tune is a fatal misstep for Mumble. When he finally finds friends in Ramon's (Robin Williams) foreign group of Adelie penguins, it becomes clear that there are more things threatening the penguin society on Antarctica  the most prominent of which being human overfishing.<br/><br/>One third into 'Happy Feet', I found myself drifting ever so slightly into indifference as the sprawling surge of R'n'B on the ice wore off. The emperor penguins all sing tunes you have heard before and it is not until Mumble encounters the eccentric party group of Adelies that Happy Feet receives a well-deserved kickstart and starts tapping into good fun. Thankfully, and admirably, it manages to avoid pratfalls, slapstick, pee- and fart jokes and instead the finely-tuned humour rests on the wealth of meticulous animation, juxtaposition, absurdist situations and snaptastic one-liners from Ramon's crew as they take Mumble in and introduce him to their kooky, fun-loving society and social guru, ""Lovelace"". This is seen in stark contrast from the emperor penguins' community on the humour side of the tapestry, and the funniest gag in the latter is Kidman returning from the long fishing journey and telling her baby Mumble lovingly that she ""has got something for him"", and proceeds to vomit into his mouth. Priceless.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is an ambitious animated comedy. It's ambitious in its scope; there are epic aerial shots of the vast icy glacier, even from outer spaces, it treats salient issues like the effects of overfishing, it takes well-deserved jabs at organized religion, in which the elder emperor penguins represent the archaic values and traditions that they mindlessly adhere to. It features a star-studded cast, it sees seamless intercutting of live action footage and stars (I spotted an uncredited Ewan McGregor cameo, look out), and it is dedicated to Steve Irwin. Certainly 'Happy Feet' carries all of its ambitions quite well, some becoming accolades like the effective punch at conformity in which all the penguins literally look identical except for the fuzzy, fluffy Mumble, while others fall flat thanks to its shortcoming cast. <br/><br/>It should only be so hard to provide voicework for an animated character, and Elijah Wood does it effortlessly as the fumbling, bumbling toddler-like misfit Mumble, who even looks like him with bright baby blue eyes. Nicole Kidman stars as Mumble's mother, with a ridiculously over-the-top voice, and she tips over into overacting at a few points. In the beginning we are given the well-condensed introductory story of how she met Mumble's father Memphis (Hugh Jackman) with a heartfelt heartsong, and she gets to reprise her romantic duet singing of Moulin Rouge opposite fellow Aussie. All of the aforementioned actors, as well as Robin Williams and Hugo Weaving, perform well in their respective supporting roles  all except the unforgivably redundant Brittany Murhpy as Mumble's perpetual love-interest (who is a bad singer to boot), a plain annoying and unlikeable character backed by an equally unlikable actress.<br/><br/>Owing to its mindblowing animation (which has been absolutely honed in the past few years) and treatment of salient issues, 'Happy Feet' could not have been made five or even four years ago. The former is translated into unspeakably beautiful sequences of underwater chases and ice slides while the latter manifests itself in apt environmental warnings. Although I was mostly entertained, there were a few too many purposely ""aww"" moments crammed in and certainly it does not quite dethrone the majestic 'Ice Age' (2002) as the best sub-zero comedy ever made. There, I've now said so little in so many words.<br/><br/>7 out of 10"

If you are looking for a movie that will make you want to laugh and cry, and will definitely have you thinking (about taking dance lessons & about the world as it is now) then this is the movie for you. While the movie has some dark turns, it tackles the environmental issues that the whole world is being confronted with in a way that is neither overbearing, nor too old for children. Not only did this movie make me want a penguin of my own, but it made me want to help our world stop over producing, and start preserving. More importantly, if you want to take kids to see this movie, its perfect. There's a good chance they will be waddling like a penguin for a week!"

","Overall, I enjoyed this movie and don't regret having gone to see it. I feel like the animators, actors doing voices and Savion Glover (hope I spelled that right!) wasted some of their efforts on an inferior-quality script.<br/><br/>I admire the environmental theme, but felt like it was being shoved down our throats .. with no real solutions suggested, either. Some portions of the script were not explained well .. like how on earth Mumbles got back from the zoo to his family. Okay .. and why can't Mumble molt correctly, and why does his face look different from all of the other adult penguins? That's never explained, either.<br/><br/>I laughed and smiled my way through the first half of the movie, and it felt like the second half dragged on endlessly and made little sense. :-< I was expecting to love this movie a lot more than I did."
"silalus","10","20","30","6 December 2006"," Breathtaking and Beautiful
","Happy Feet begins by introducing us to an achingly beautiful world and then takes us on an extraordinary hero's journey filled with laughter, tears, and unconditional love. It is a rare modern epic that goes far beyond the scope of most recent movies, family or otherwise, with amazing visuals, wonderful music, and simple but meaningful themes. Be warned: you might actually find yourself responding to this film on an emotional level that could be a little embarrassing. You might leave dancing- or simply breathless.<br/><br/>The film weaves the fantasy of a musical world inhabited by penguins, a poignant and beautiful dream in which each emperor penguin searches for love by singing a unique ""heartsong"". Mumble (voiced by Elijah Wood) is hatched into this world as one very special individual. Unlike the others of his kind, Mumble seems to be without any singing ability at all. Instead he is compelled to express what lives in his heart through an incredible gift for tap dancing (granted to the character by the great Savion Glover through motion capture). Ever positive despite rejection from his community, sweet Mumble is caught up in a remarkably deep adventure story that grapples with concepts of identity, love, and tolerance while instilling a basic sense of environmentalism.<br/><br/>The enormity of this story is quite amazing. The brilliant George Miller (creator of diverse and artful films from Mad Max to Babe) succeeds in creating what may be one of the most lovable characters ever, and then drives him to the edge of hell and back. Drawn along in Mumble's wake, we often laugh and sometimes cry with the character as he stumbles into a group of loyal friends (two of which are voiced fantastically by Robin Williams), showers his soul mate with unconditional love, and ultimately seeks out answers to environmental issues that are far bigger than one little penguin. Nothing, though, could be bigger than Mumble's heart. Unless you are made of stone, you will fall in love with this character, and you'll be cheering him along for every minute of his struggles.<br/><br/>As you come to love Mumble, you will be exposed to elegant themes that are so universal they serve as a kind of mirror. You'll see some of yourself or someone you love in his struggle to prove that being different can be wonderful. You'll remember past feelings and childhood fantasies as he shows that love can be worth absolutely everything. And you'll probably feel at least a little guilty to be a human as you remember the profound and sometimes terrible impact we can have on the many wonderful creatures that surround us. Fortunately there is a good chance that you will also come out feeling empowered to make the world a little better.<br/><br/>All in all, the experience is breathtaking."
"joesgirljeri","1","51","86","23 November 2006"," most bizarre children's movie I've ever seen
","I gave this movie a 2 because it was interesting to look at; one of the most spectacular CGI films I've ever seen. That was worth about 5 minutes of my time. The rest of the film was a complete waste.<br/><br/>This was the most poorly put-together children's feature-film I've seen in a long time. I saw the previews for this a long time ago and was excited to take my young daughter to it because she loves animals and movies. We were sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>A lot of very small children were at this movie because the previews make it look like a cuddly Ice Age-style movie that's funny and heart-warming. BEWARE! There are a lot of adult nuances and inappropriate jokes in this movie. Basically all the penguins think about is scoring another penguin with a groovy ""heartsong"" and they talk about it A LOT. The killer whales and leopard seals are pretty scary. This is not a kid-friendly movie.<br/><br/>The majority of this movie is nothing more than a ""Look what we can do with our new software!"" showcase. Penguins dance, sing and swim in formation. Different animals fly, waddle or swim around convincingly. Glaciers break off, cause avalanches and exciting falling/chasing scenes. At first it's awesome to look at but after a while the awe wears off and you start to wonder where the story is.<br/><br/>The characters are nothing short of inane. The ""Elvis and Marylin Monroe"" parents, the old- fashioned Scottish leader of the big penguins, the Latino party penguins and Lovelace, the televangelist-style leader of the smaller party penguins. So many characters were introduced but none of them had a very well-developed personality or storyline.<br/><br/>After an hour or so of showing off the technology and letting Robin Williamns have as many characters and funny lines as he can reasonably fit into 87 minutes, the story shifts gears and lurches to a conclusion. At this point 6 or 7 children all around us were asking their parents if it was time to go home. This must have happened in test audiences too because the director makes an obvious decision to quit showing off and just hurry up and end the movie. Seriously, the entire adventure, journey to save penguin-kind, reversal of the human problem and miraculous acceptance of Mumble by his friends and co-penguins is crammed into about 20 minutes. Mumble travels from his home, to some big city and back in the space almost instantly; just appearing in one location or another (confusing to say the least). Humans change their minds and stop fishing and the famine is averted..... whew! That was a lot of story to pack into just a few minutes! Finally the action then comes to a shuddering halt and all you're left with is the feeling of ""that's it?""<br/><br/>So many stereotypes and morale-of-the-story points were introduced but none of them were very satisfactorily resolved or dealt with. Mumble is never truly accepted by his peers and he waffles back and forth between changing to fit in and just going with whatever he feels like. His mom half-heartedly stands up for him and his dad wavers between guilt and denial. And what's with ""dropping the egg""? Mumble was dropped as an egg so now he's a weirdo who can't sing? What was that all about? Different tribes of penguins and different animals misunderstand and dislike each other but.... it's never really resolved. Humans are littering and stealing the fish but the answer is for all of them to tap-dance together? <br/><br/>The thing that disappointed me the most was the complete lack of emotional involvement in any of the characters or story lines. The penguins are close-minded and brainwashed; they dislike Mumble not only because he can't sing but because he's curious and seeks knowledge. Sure the point of the movie is to save all the penguins but you as the viewer don't actually care about them; there is no sympathy for them at all. Mumble saves the world and gets the girl and yet there's no emotional satisfaction; no feeling of fulfillment.<br/><br/>A great movie makes you feel for the characters, gives you something to think about and leaves you with a smile on your face. This movie did none of those things."

As a victim of childhood taunts due to birth defects, I side with Mumble and his pain as the other young birds mock his differences. When Gloria's heart song Boogie Wonderland is finally answered by Mumble's feet song, the rest of his young Emperor sisters and brothers break into dance with him, embracing him, chanting his name in joyful unison--simply stirring. To anyone who has been ridiculed or spat upon, it is a moment of sheer triumph. I can't remember feeling this good about any other film in recent years.

","I saw this with my 5 ear old son, and we walked out about 3/4 way into it. I tried so hard to give it a chance, but the lack of any meaningful story, chaotic music, and substance did me in. I am not saying that children's movies need to have a lot of substance, but how about some kind of story that our children can make sense of, instead of meaningless dancing scenes. I don't understand how anyone (with half a brain) can think this movie is good. There are also so many racial stereotypes - the physically small hispanic flock that the main character visits. This flock evidentially doesn't care about education, as they are content in trying to get in each other's pants. This is a product of marketing, hype, and Hollywood junk. It would be wise not to buy this DVD and rot your child's brain."

We were very sorry to find out that in reality it was a platform for ""teaching"" children that humans are inherently selfish and cruel to animals and any religious undertones are without merit. It made no sense when the penguins communicate to the humans (or ""aliens"" as we are referred to in the movie) that they are a scared and gentle species, the humans suddenly turn to the UN who fix everything immediately and perfectly. The plot made such unexpected turns and implausible outcomes that my children and I left the theater confused, frustrated, and without happy feet. It was actually scary and depressing.

","Just as some films can take a wrong turn early on and lose an audience, with only a miracle able to prompt a recovery, so some can grab you from the start and never let go. After about three minutes on screen, I was hopelessly in love with Happy Feet and it would have taken a disastrous collapse to change that. Thankfully, that collapse never comes and the film only gets better the longer it goes on. Without even accounting for the fact that it's been a pretty weak year for animated fare, Happy Feet is a balls-out masterpiece, easily and instantly one of the best non-Disney/Pixar American animated films ever made. It's Planet Earth narrated by way of Moulin Rouge instead of David Attenborough.<br/><br/>The theory goes that each penguin has its own individual ""heartsong"" which it needs to find a mate. Young Mumble (voiced by Daily when he's tickle and oh so cute, then Wood when he gets a bit older) is born with the worst singing voice in the penguin world, which can make for a pretty tough ride when your parents sound like Marilyn Monroe and Elvis. Compensation for this comes in the form of his love of dancing via his nonstop ""happy feet"". His mother (Kidman) is supportive but his dad (Jackman) is embarrassed by the whole affair (""It just ain't penguin son""). Marked as a disruptive influence by the elders (including Weaving doing a pretty damn good Scottish accent) and even blamed for the dwindling fish stocks, he's ostracised from the community and takes up with a group of Hispanic penguins on a quest to discover why the fish are disappearing.<br/><br/>There's nothing about Happy Feet that doesn't work, with every element just another layer of delicious icing on the cake. At its heart it's one of the most glorious celebrations of individuality, diversification and acceptance ever committed to film. But then it gets wrapped in a blanket of breathtaking visuals and a level of artistry that's almost photo-real in its beauty. The voice work is exemplary (Robin Williams does three different characters and doesn't annoy) and it will either have you laughing or on the verge of tears throughout. Then, just when you think it can't fit anything else in, we get a sharp eco-message. And if that's all a little too preachy and worthy for you, then just revel in the sight of tens of thousands of penguins bursting into pop and soul classics every five minutes. Sublime."
"jackson-0","4","27","49","24 November 2006"," It could have been cute
","If this movie had stuck to being a cute story about a penguin trying to find love, it would have been great. I love the idea of penguins finding their perfect match through song. Having a penguin who can't sing and still overcomes being different to get the girl is a great theme. Turning the film into a critique on the religious right and an environmental awareness drama was where I lost interest. It's almost like they couldn't get enough people to buy tickets for ""An Inconvenient Truth"" so they had to trick people into seeing it by dressing it up as a kid's penguin movie. If you want a cute movie that doesn't strive to make itself political, avoid this one."
"Chrysanthepop","Null","6","8","13 January 2009"," Bad Vocals But Happy Feet
","Happy Feet' is a delightfully cheerful little movie about an emperor penguin who has an unappreciated gift of tap dancing and his inability to sing causes others to look down upon him. While the penguins suffer from food shortage, he aims to rescue the fish that serves as their daily meal. The animation is excellent. Very few such CGI animated films have looked so real to me but in 'Happy Feet' it is almost hard to tell. The characters are fun (though a little out of place and unnecessary at times). The voice-casting is great with Robin Williams and the Hispanic adelaides stealing the show. Nicole Kidman lends her beautiful voice as the loving mother while Hugh Jackman's dad character is a little clichéd. Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy are annoying but you get used to it. The story could have been better developed as there are a few plot holes now and then and the ending is a little too optimistic, too unrealistic and too abrupt. 'Happy Feet' is meant to be a family film but it could have been a stronger movie and at the same time remains enjoyable to the family had the story been given a little more focus. There are a range of songs, most of which are popular numbers. Even though the visualizations were fun to watch, they were at times distracting and deviating from the main plot. Yet, 'Happy Feet' was still an entertaining flick and it had that adventurous feel. There was not one boring moment and the viewers wonder how Mumble will rescue the fish from being stolen (I just wished that the conclusion was done differently)."

","Without giving away the plot of this glorious and beautifully photographed animation, this is one film that should break all records for attendance, by young and old.There is an overall message inherent in the film, which is very topical to today's environmental and political milieu. The famous cast of actors and actresses voicing the ""happy feet"" penguins are very creative and strong. Robin Williams maintains two separate roles, and he is terrific in both. The magical, dancing penguins, (in the thousands), are a miracle of CGI and choreography. One cannot help but think of Busby Berkeley, Riverdance, or Chorus Line, in the precision and joyful abandon that are rendered by all the penguins, young and old. For anyone not liking this technically brilliant, funny, and beautiful movie, there must be a mental disconnect. If you're expecting a childish cartoon with no depth, or don't understand/like advanced animation technology, then stay home and watch simpler fare on Saturday morning television."
"dogwooddude","10","6","8","28 November 2006"," Happy Feet - Strong Messages
","I have just returned from watching Happy Feet and found it an exhilarating and moving experience. There has been a plethora of animated movies recently and few have really appealed to me, but Happy Feet should please even the least interested in ""cute"" animated creatures. A review by the Chicago Tribune suggested that the movie was not really suitable for children younger than 7 or 8 and I would certainly agree for the most part. There is one part where an attack by a Leopard Seal is maybe more than young eyes should witness! There are underlying messages in the movie and most would focus on the obvious one that even when you are different you can succeed. The other message that I particularly focused on was that ""man"" is depleting the food source of these adorable penguins. Having traveled to the Antarctic area I can certainly testify that huge factory ships are scooping up the squid that penguins rely on. I only hope that this message is received by those that might make a difference. The choreography is wonderful and my feet never stopped tapping the whole time. With the arrival of Mumbles ""Latino"" friends the films laughter factor raised by an enormous degree. One could almost describe Happy Feet as a ""Musical"" and certainly the songs flow fairly frequently, but they are well chosen and only add to the magic. I would recommend this movie to all ages but suggest that my comment in paragraph two be heeded by parents of young children. On a side note, I noticed that the scenes depicting the Whaling station are based on the disused whaling station of Grytviken on the island of South Georgia. The images of the church and disused buildings are clearly taken from that location."
"obscurifer","1","20","35","11 December 2006"," I wish there were a word worse than ""abysmal"" that wasn't obscene
","Happy Feet had a strong message, which was, ""Gee, what powerful rendering engines the filmmakers had."" At the point the camera panned back to show North America, then the whole Earth, with a somber, percussive soundtrack, I leaned over to a friend and whispered, ""The End."" I realize that over-analyzing a film for children is a certain path to inanity, but you'd think the filmmakers could have done some analysis of how to avoid some of the sheer awfulness thrust upon an unsuspecting audience.<br/><br/>My 11-year-old son, a longtime fan of Spongebob Squarepants, told me that this film was, ""really bad."" And he liked Barnyard.<br/><br/>Just so it's clear, I believe strongly in biodiversity, conservation of natural resources, recycling, etc., so the political and moral message of the movie would have resonated with me if it hadn't been for the blatant penguinization of Elijah Wood, the sad, weird stereotype penguin ethnicities, and the jarring introduction of humans into the penguin world. Plus, Robin Williams has sort of declined since Dead Poets Society.<br/><br/>This isn't a movie to see. If a friend offers to show it to you for free with popcorn, feign illness."
"diodata","9","15","25","17 November 2006"," If you can ignore some plot holes and certain undertones, it's a fun movie to watch!
","It's hard to say who the movie was made for. I just saw the movie and definitely enjoyed it, as did my wife and kids. However, the movie doesn't seem to be made for either kids or adults, but gets caught somewhere in between. I felt like it was missing something.<br/><br/>From a kids' perspective, it has plenty of cute penguins doing funny things. It has great dance numbers and fun music and cool graphics that kids will recognize. Kids will even be able to follow Mumble's journey and understand what is happening to him. They stay interested. Although it may have been too long for them (my kids and others in the theater started to get ancy about 3/4's into the movie.) Kids should be able to pick up on the message of being different is OK and negative effects of pollution. So, looking through a child's eyes, a very good movie.<br/><br/>For an adult looking through a child's eyes, it is still a very good movie. Many adults will recognize the songs and artists (as well as voices) and laugh at most of the jokes. They aren't many jokes since they are mainly replaced by song and dance numbers. Again, visual effects are spectacular and the characters are great and yet familiar. So, if your idea of entertainment (at least while watching this movie) is to not think too much, ignore undertones on politics and religion and enjoy what's on the surface, then you'll love this movie.<br/><br/>For an adult looking through an adult's eyes, we run into problems. There are numerous messages about foreigners, traditionalist religion, acceptance, human indifference to nature, etc..., which the movie doesn't go far enough on any of these topics to make any real argument. It's like they just stated their opinion without evidence or logical argument and moved on. They have scenes here and there with the relevant symbolism, mostly biased in one way or another, and you're left wondering why the symbolism was even there at all. It was obviously put there intentionally. There may have been deleted scenes that would have helped. However, that wasn't the purpose and the plot and themes fall short. Simply by extending the movie another 45 minutes with some thought provoking explanations, without the biases, this could have been a very good movie for adults wanting more.<br/><br/>It seemed to be two movies mixed into one. As a kids' movie, great job. If you analyze the plot and the messages it tries to send (and it obviously tries to), then it falls short. Since movies are all about entertainment, and more people will find this movie entertaining than not, it does its job. Should this be considered a great movie? No. Does the plot have holes? Yes. Is it a great kids movie? Yes. Was it fun to watch and did I enjoy it? Yes. I hope others do to."

They missed the casual movie-goers demographic with numerous plot holes and missed both demographics with the nearly absent amount of humor (Robin Williams had a few good lines). The trailers show penguins havin' fun, but the movie shows humans invading and hurting penguins and their homes only to change their minds when the lead character tap dances for visitors and the zoo. This can't be called a movie so much as hippie propaganda. Do not ever see this movie!"

Then when goes to penguin school, Gloria lets out her beautiful heart song. Then when its Mumble's turn he blows it and everyone starts laughing except Gloria. Then when they tell him to look deep in his soul he starts dancing. I'm not going to tell anymore if you want t find what happens then go watch the movie. I'll just say its a touching movie.

"Edu-16","9","7","10","27 December 2006"," Extremely good - and not too preachy at all.
","I've read a number of negative comments out there about HF being too preachy. For those yet to see the film - don't let this put you off. HF is fast, funny, clever, witty (musically) and visually stunning.<br/><br/>Yes - there are a few messages about over-fishing, and how this is a bad thing - and that (,this just in...,) it's humans who are the perpetrators ! Im not sure that this is a theme you could possibly over-fish myself - and it was as palatably presented here as anywhere else I've seen. My 8 and 10 year old girls were not patronised, and as adults, my wife and I did not feel we were back in church.<br/><br/>Anyway back to the real themes of the movie. The power of both music and dance to cross cultural and language divides - and the importance of being different. When so much of world culture is being watered down to a brown mush - and the pressure to conform is so strong in some countries that children commit suicide rather than suffer being different - HF raises some excellent points. The main character's 'difference' is what saves the entire colony. HF says diversity is important - and having the courage to be different in the face of massive peer pressure is the real message of this movie.<br/><br/>A few points about the music. From the opening strains (taken from Abbey road) - to the last, HF has a thumping good score with plenty of cleverness. The scenes of penguins musically trying to find a partner with an empathetic theme are extremely well done. A lot of melodies were placed in counterpoint (inter-twined with another), with sometimes four or five ideas going on at the same time. Ill be getting the DVD for this alone I think. This scene happens twice - but the second time we have the melody being counterpoint to the tap dance rhythm from Mumble. Superb.<br/><br/>The last idea I took from HF was the power of both dance and music to communicate across the divides. Rather than the inexplicably negative conclusion that some have come to in reviews here - I took great optimism from the fact that humans were in the end able to relate to the penguins, and decide to stop their bad old ways.<br/><br/>A fine movie - one that both adults and children will enjoy."

A kid watching this movie, would probably fall asleep; it started off really cute and funny-ish but then the writers went off on a completely irrelevant curb that made the movie super long and super pointless for any kid under 10.

","I was really disappointed when I left the movie, but I thought maybe I was just missing something. After reading these comments, I realized I wasn't.<br/><br/>I had high hopes for this movie. My 7-year-old daughter had been looking forward to it for months...I got absolutely sick of seeing and hearing the trailer of the baby Mumbles dancing to Stevie Wonder on our ""March of the Penguins"" DVD.<br/><br/>Where do I begin? The Good: The animation was nothing short of spectacular. I'm continually amazed at what is happening in computer animation. The scenery was beautiful.<br/><br/>I found the protagonists generally likable; I've always been a fan of Robin Williams and he did not disappoint.<br/><br/>However.....<br/><br/>The Bad: Some scenes were way too intense. After the attack by the leopard seal, my daughter (the same one that had been bugging me for months) was so scared that she wanted to leave.<br/><br/>The sexual innuendo was not subtle. I know that a lot of animated movies throw something in ""for the adults"" and it usually flies safely over the heads of the kids. Not here.<br/><br/>Anti-religious undercurrent. The characters in the movie that displayed any sort of religious belief were portrayed as either hateful (like the Elders), or phony (like the penguin with the 6-pack ring around his neck). It's not that there's no truth there. I'm certainly no fan of religious fundamentalism but it bothered me that the ONLY depictions of religion were negative.<br/><br/>Environmentalist propaganda. If I want to pay $20+ dollars (with snacks) to get preached at, I'll go see ""An Inconvenient Truth"". Add to that the fact that it was completely unnecessary; they could have made a wonderful movie about respecting others' differences without tacking on some story about evil humans destroying the planet. Also, I didn't appreciate how it was the United Nations that heroically made the evil fishing boats go away. Remember, these are the same people who enriched Saddam Hussein through Oil-For-Food and failed to intervene in several African genocides in recent years. Yep, they do a bang-up job there at the UN, don't they? During the big debate montage, did anyone else notice that the only distinctive voices arguing against helping the penguins had American accents? Give me a break. I resent being charged money to swallow leftist propaganda disguised as a kids' movie.<br/><br/>Misleading marketing...what looked in the trailer like a fun movie was often dark, scary, full of propaganda, and had none-too-subtle sexual innuendo."

Why did the director cut the cute trailer of Mumble's dance in the movie? We just never felt connected with the characters, ergo we just didn't care! And the idea, as subtle as a steam roller, that humans are ""aliens"", perpetuates the idea that humans somehow are not a part of the balance of nature. (Many of these folks tell us that we ascended from monkeys ;) Well, thankfully the penguins can dance, so the humans, lead by the United Nations, save the food chain for the penguins. What if these birds had no redeeming entertainment value? If you insist on seeing this, wait to rent it from the video store, or better yet, the library. That way you can turn it off when you've had enough. Save you time and money. There have been numerous good animations.

Some of the biggest issues are penguins and Antartica just don't make for an interesting setup as long as this. Do you know why mumbles didn't lose his down?

Covering tracks from Hip-Hop, to classic rock, to Opera. It's not just the catchy tunes that make Happy Feet dance, it's the way they integrate the heart pounding choreography with mash-up style song numbers.<br/><br/>The films several plots are your same song & dance, however one side plot tends to get a little preachy. (Al Gore would give this film a seal of approval). The one feature that sets Happy Feet apart from other CGI Counterparts (Barnyard/Chicken Little/Over the Hedge) is its mix of Live Action and CGI. It's almost difficult to tell whats real and what isn't.<br/><br/>So if your in the mood to chill out at the local cineplex: Happy Feet offers a cool time for all.

It lost focus.<br/><br/>I'm not sure what I expected from the previews other than a sweet story and a few laugh out loud moments.(I got to laugh out loud, but for the wrong reasons.)<br/><br/>The setting was Antartica, right? So why was the Penguin leader Scottish? And why did we have the country bumpkin Penguin and the LATINO Penguins? And when I say it was full of stereotypes--trust me. You don't want to see the leader slap the Latino Penguin and tell him to go back to his side of the world where he came from.<br/><br/>Not to mention Mumble (Happy Feet) being told not to do his dance thing because he's different. ""It's just not penguin."" Different is bad. Different isn't welcome here. But Mumble says he can't change and asks them to accept him the way he was born. So the dad blames himself for making him different. And I never felt that was truly resolved to a point a kid would understand.<br/><br/>This movie is anti-any-religion but Christian as well. The tall Penguins worship their god ""The Great Wind"" and the Latino Penguins have Lovelace. Both are proved to be ""false gods"" when Mumbles returns to his home. And what is the first structure then Penguins see when they get to the human side of the world? A Church. Yup.<br/><br/>And if anyone can sit through the traumatic scene of watching Lovelace tossed about between two Orcas by the six-pack plastic rings around his neck without wincing, then I'm amazed. Every adult knows that penguin would've been dead. Of course, he lived...but that was honestly the worst thing I've watched in animation before.<br/><br/>And lets not forget how dark and disturbing this movie is. There were several kids under the age of 6 that were terrified in some spots. And bored in others. It's wildly inappropriate for anyone under the age of 7.<br/><br/>One last comment before I get off my soap box. This movie had a good message to deliver, if it would've just delivered it. It could've been a great ""anti-polution"" movie and global warming educator. Instead, it was a depressing (yes, depressing)and preachy. The only lesson I learned was how not to do an animated film. If you want to show your children a good anti-pollution story--see Ferngully."

","There will be spoilers, however, I highly recommend you not waste your money on this atrocity anyway, so please read on.<br/><br/>Let me preface this rant with the fact that I am neither religious nor political. I could care less that liberal Hollywood treats their movies as agenda pushing media because I like a good story. The Constant Gardener really played with your sensibilities about what is happening in African countries and whatnot and how America is the cause, etc. However, the film was about love and the union between two people, and how one tries to honor the other after death. The political undertones were second fiddle to the touching story and beautiful construction, making it my favorite film of last year. Unfortunately not all films can use a strong story to thinly veil an underlying theme or moral, sometimes they must wear their politics on their sleeves. Once again I have no qualms with this as I'll see the trailer and decide not to bother. It is a despicable thing that has been done with the new animated children's film Happy Feet. Not only do they advertise it as an ugly-duckling type tale of redemption, but also completely target it to children. I equate this travesty of cinema to Camel Joe pitching smokes to kids; it is truly appalling.<br/><br/>Through the first 45 minutes or so I was with this movie. I enjoyed the against all odds yarn, the animation was nice, the music fun and entertaining (not to mention the Moulin Rouge- like use of it to advance the story), and the reigned in absurdity of Robin Williams was hilarious. Sadly, the film took a huge dive to garbage very quickly after. All of a sudden the emperor penguins become an evil cultish Catholic Church banishing their young ""heretic"" whose blasphemy has caused a shortage of sustenance. His evil ways have made their God take away their fish and livelihood and he must be excommunicated. I should have seen signs of this when, after deftly allowing us to tell our protagonist apart from the rest by his blue eyes, they grew the penguins up and made his fur stick out completely from the crowd; Mumbles the penguin was a disgrace, and an outsider who decides to use science and fact to prove his superiority over the simple creationists he was raised with. Now I hate the Catholic Church just as much as the next disgruntled Catholic, but come on here. Do little children need to be force-fed an anti-parable about the evils of the Right?<br/><br/>The liberals behind this film don't stop at the allegory between penguins and humanity, however, no, they take it even further. Once Mumbles goes on his mission to prove humans are taking the fish and not God, he is eventually captured. Upon awakening, he finds, to his dismay, that he is in a zoo, surrounded by brainwashed penguinsslaves to fish feeding time and multitudes of human watchers that ignore his cries for help for his species back home. My gag-reflex was tested when the filmmakers cut sharply from Mumbles' face to the cityscape where the zoo resides, to Earth, and then to space. Oh for shame, what are we doing to these penguins? Only when a little girl sees his tap-dancing do the humans ""awaken"" to the atrocities they are committing with nature and free him to go search for more penguins. Now we have a melding of real live actors with the animation, people traveling to Antarctica to see these wondrous tap-dancing creatures. After a crisis of faith is averted, the humans are tickled by the showmanship of these animals and start dancing themselves. What's worse are the cut scenes shown next of people in board rooms discussing how humanity is destroying this creature's ecosystem and what can we do to stop it? This is a children's film and the creators should be ashamed of themselves.<br/><br/>When did America resort to brainwashing its youth and turning a prophet? Maybe it would be accurate to say a long time ago. I understand if you were to bill this as Green Peace sponsored, liberal approved rhetoric and allowed the parents the choice on whether to subject their children to it. Instead we are given the posters and trailers of a cute little penguin tap-dancing while trying to find his heart song. Now all the kids want to go and experience the fun. Well congratulations to the filmmakers, it seems to have worked making Happy Feet the number one movie in America for two weeks. Next time they start picketing a meat factory for herding cattle to their deaths they can take a look in the mirror and see a person who herded young minds into an ambush of political cajoling. Why let our youth grow old and become educated to the issues when we can get them now in elementary school? Have them come home crying, ""are we really killing the penguins Mommy?"" (Yes there were many crying kids in my IMAX screening) and learn that they better vote Democrat when they reach voting age because if not then the furry creatures we pay to see at zoos will lose their homes. Happy Feet is a disgrace to cinema and a guerilla tactic by liberal supporters. What kind of world do we live in when our children aren't even safe to watch a cartoon about dancing penguins?"

","I had seen the commercials and the little penguin rapping, ""Don't push me 'cause I am close to the edge..."" had me eager to see this animated film. I understood the movie would be about being different and learning how to live and love yourself and fit in by staying true to you. And I was hoping for a lot of tap dancing penguin. The movie took an unexpected and awkward turn when the main character Mumble tries to win the hearts of the penguins by finding out what is happening to all the fish. The last 20 minutes seemed very out of place and almost like an after thought as Mumble finds giant fishing boats and chases them to the United States (fron Antarctica) and then ends up in a very sad zoo situation, only to be electronically tagged and brought back to his family and friends. Apparently to get food, all they have to do is dance for the people, which will stop the fishing, and get Mumble's father to dance.<br/><br/>The voices were disappointing, neither Nicole Kidman nor Hugh Jackman ever made their characters likable, and the best characters didn't get enough screen time.<br/><br/>The animation was amazing and the scenes were there was tap dancing were lots of fun. But the confusing and disjointed message about safe fishing and animal rights made the end of the movie kind of a downer, and was something you never saw coming from the commercials."

","This movie is NOT about dancing penguins. This movie is a politically charged brain-washing attempt to persuade young viewers that evil humans are destroying the natural order of the world. There were actually young children in the audience pleading with their parents to take them home before the movie ended. One parent was overheard stating that this movie ""was not at all like the previews."" There is almost nothing ""happy"" about this movie. Not one person left the theatre laughing or with a lifted spirit. While the graphics are indeed amazing, the storyline is extremely depressing. The movie continually tries to make light of the thematic elements, but it never seems to work. Very little laughter was heard after the 60 minute mark; truthfully, with not that much before. The film mocked religion and tradition, had a surprising amount of sexual innuendo, and portrayed zoo animals as Zombie-minded creatures tortured by their fake environment. If at some point in the future you want to take your children to the zoo for a day of enjoyment, do not take your children to see this movie. I am warning you, do not see this movie. If you do, your children might start calling you (and all humans) ""ugly aliens"" as the movie claims we are."
"aaharp","1","30","59","19 November 2006"," Terrible move - inappropriate and politically charged
","What should have been a fun little movie for the kids turned out to be a long, often inappropriate, political statement about saving the environment. I thought at any minute Greenpeace and ACLU representatives were going to start walking down the aisles handing out brochures.<br/><br/>For starters, the penguins sing a lot of ""heart songs"" based on modern pop music. While this should have been a fun way to make the penguins sing - the producers chose songs that you would never let your small kids listen to.<br/><br/>For instance, at one point in the movie, the penguins start singing ""Let's talk about X baby, let's talk about you and me..."" They sang this parody of Salt N Peppa's ""Lets talk about sex"" while doing some type of suggestive mating dance! It was an uncomfortable moment for me while my 5 year old stared wide-eyed at the screen.<br/><br/>There are a lot of sexually charged themes in the movie including the ""guru"" that sounds like Barry White and mates the females like Tommy Lee. The entire reason for the penguins singing is so they can mate. That's fun to explain to kids, huh?! Then there is the religious aspect of the movie where the producers make it seem like any type of faith-based religion is silly, stuffy and a waste of time. The ""bad"" penguins in the movie are the religious ones and not loving or accepting of anyone but ""their"" kind. If you are a believer in any kind of faith-based religion  especially Christianity  you will be very uncomfortable during these parts.<br/><br/>Finally there is the environmental protection aspect of the movie. While I am all for protecting the environment - the movie was forced to end abruptly with argument between nations (like you would see at the UN) where folks are arguing to make changes that will help the penguins. The message was deep and hard for kids to understand. There was no explanation really why or how the environment was being harmed other than a 30 second shot of a barge over fishing an area. This theme seemed forced and overbearing.<br/><br/>In the end my 5 year old took away that the guru got caught in a plastic beverage holder which made him crazy, the ""religious"" penguins made the boys parents not love him anymore, and that the humans were coming to get all of the tap dancing penguins to take them to the zoo. Wow  it was a fun ride home for us while I explained what really was happening.<br/><br/>In any case -- I would stay far away from the movie. It was a complete waste of time and money!"

"mlg-t888","5","4","5","27 May 2009"," Not so Happy Feet
","What's not happy about dancing, cuddly little penguins! You may ask, well, a whole lot apparently.<br/><br/>Contrary to what the title suggests, Happy Feet is really anything but. What really should have been a heartwarming and funny film ended up being about as funny as a funeral and as heartwarming as ""An Inconvenient Truth"". <br/><br/>At the end of the film, myself and the other viewers I was with all came to the same conclusion, this film was really quite depressing. The depression this film inspired really had nothing to do with the overtly ""Al Gore-esque"" message, it just simply was an upsettingly dreary film. Toward the ending, I started asking myself ""what kind of movie is this? While somewhat disturbing images flooded from the screen, as the film's protagonist is caged in a zoo and seeing strange images floating in front of him.<br/><br/>One of the films features that really caused the traumatic end result, was simply the complete unrelatability of any of the characters. Mumble, the would-be lovable protagonist, simply has nothing relatable about him, the character has no passion, no soul, simply a pathetic sounding Elijah Wood voice that adds nothing to the character. Due to this characterization Mumble feels alienating, because you can't relate to him, you can't get inside his head, thus none of his decisions throughout the movie make any sense (eg. randomly dissing his girlfriend).<br/><br/>Among the rest of the unrelatable ensemble is Lovelace, A sex obsessed, narcissistic, gospel preacher who, although somewhat entertaining, is extremely unlikable. There are the hyperactive ""amigos"" who, while adding some visual entertainment, really serve as goofy stooges who don't fit with the rest of the movie's bleakness. There are the protagonists parents. The mother is simply a background character that doesn't seem to have an effect on anything in the films plot. The father is an obnoxious Elvis caricature who is so shallow it's not possible to take him seriously. The protagonists girlfriend is the typical, uninteresting girlfriend we get used to in any sort of movie. And then there's the Catholic-esquire Elders, the film's primary antagonists. Your typical religious stereotypes, judgmental, power-hungry, and elderly.<br/><br/>The entire bleakness of the movie is capped off with an unrelentlessly happy ending that the word ""disjointed"" can't even begin to describe. Aside from being ridiculously happy, the ending was also just flat out stupid. It was so random in fact that it felt as if the director had been on the verge of suicide while directing the rest of it, then suddenly started tripping on acid right before the ending. <br/><br/>The ridiculous ending just added to the film's depression, it left me with this empty feeling that took a while to get over. I had been subjected to a movie that felt self-destructive at points, and then had something that felt drug-induced just launched at my face, and then the credits started rolling. I really had almost no clue what to make of it until further reflection (which took place much later), this movie serves no purpose, it had it's human-induced destruction message, but even so, it felt distinctly empty, there was no real heart behind it. All there was was dancing penguins and world destruction, that's about it.<br/><br/>5/10 stars, visually well crafted, otherwise, pointless."

"paulscooler","1","21","40","8 December 2006"," Happy Feet - a movie that truly blew ass
","For those who say the second half is what ruined the movie, I shall begin by saying the first half of the movie blew just as much as the second half, just in different ways.<br/><br/>The first half was uneventful, and carried the core plot of a good half of every children's movie ever made. A character is different and faces adversity in what you think is a movie-long plot about him finding his place and being beautifully unique. YOU THINK this is what you're in store for with Happy Feet, and for the first half of the movie I sat there thinking ""Wow, this is really unoriginal, there isn't even any side plot happening or anything really interesting at all, but the seal part was cool. Wait no not really. Yeah that blew too."" Mumbles, the main penguin who has his own set of flaws that are never addressed, (that i will certainly address later) has an object of desire, and I forget her name. She is the most beautiful penguin ever, he is an outcast and weird, you get it. So once she decides that she wants to be with him, he turns her down. I suppose this is because he doesn't want her to come with them out of concern for her safety, but he was unnecessarily dick in how he went about doing it. So, she doesn't come, and you are left with a big WTF at this point as to why that scene was even there. She should have never come after him and that whole thing never should have happened. This lovely scene brings a close to act 1 of this masterpiece, and the second half begins.<br/><br/>This half was a lot more entertaining, plot-wise, too bad it was the equivalent of watching a pile of compost decay. Key errors in plot are how a penguin who isn't even fully grown manages to swim from Antarctica to wherever he landed, Australia or New York, either one is way out of reach, and how he got back to his home. I assume the zookeepers/whoever put him there wanted to see other penguins like him, but how did they know where to put him? Did they just drop him in Antarctica somewhere and check on him now and then to see if he was near other penguins? Sure was convenient how the helicopter swooped down right as he was closing in on his home turf. Wait he never closed in on it, he just appeared there suddenly. In addition to the plot flaws, the original plot is completely abandoned, and in comes Greenpeace. I'm all for global conservation, but fishing in Antarctica really isn't that high up there on the world issues meter. Anyway my personal favorite part of the movie is when the world leaders get the message that the penguins are starving because they can all dance. They love the dancing, yet say ""MAYBE ITS CUZ WE IS TAKIN ALL THEY FISH"". So, immediately they pull out all fishing vessels from Antarctica in an effort to stop them from dancing. Didn't they all love the dancing? Isn't dancing usually a sign of happiness rather than starvation? Wait, no, I am clearly wrong. Next time I get hungry I will do a little jig and perhaps someone will take note of it and provide for me a slab of ribs. Anyway back to the matter of removing all the vessels. Now this is a kid's movie, but you ever wonder why kids are so naive and improperly informed with concerns to how the world works? Maybe it has to do with something like the media they are fed tells them that if penguins start dancing, immediately all the companies with fishing vessels in Antarctica will throw their investments away, probably along with their businesses, just to save the penguins that they knew they were killing in the first place. Come on. If you're gonna put Greenpeace ish in your movie at least provide a viable solution to the problem.<br/><br/>I said I would address the problems with Mumbles, and sure enough I am. Definitely don't get why his face is different from all the other penguins. Or why his mom keeps saying HES NOT DIFFERENT whenever his dad says he is. Are you kidding? All the other penguins are two cgi images, one male one female, copied over and over. i.e. IDENTICAL. This penguin looks nothing like them and there is debate over whether he is different or not. Of course he is different, there is no question, this is just nonsense to fill time, much like 90% of the movie. And how come he gets to have the voice of tommy from rugrats as a kid. That was dead on, and that lady who did his voice can do a lot more voices than that. Also he should have figured out to stop trying to sing sooner. He blew ass. Just like this movie."

","Compelling story and characters, superb animation, toe-tapping soundtrack. Good clean fun. The only flaw I can call out would be Nicole Kidman doing an imitation of Jennifer Tilly as Mumble's mom Norma Jean. I also wanted Mumble to lose more feathers as his character matured. I understand that his character was unique and needed to look different from the other penguins. And I appreciate that he lost most of his newborn feathers by the end of the movie. But I think he matured beyond his peers and the remaining feathers didn't seem in keeping with that. Otherwise, an animated delight that should stand as a classic. At least it will in my book. Impressive work from Animal Logic on all counts -- especially the elephant seals and interaction with non-animated human characters. It's not hard to imagine that the March of the Penguins documentary inspired the screenplay, or certainly assisted in supporting the script with regard to the winter migration of the empire penguins. Both tied to Warner Bros. so not that unlikely."

Of course, had honesty come into play, then the box office sales wouldn't have been as high. Seems like an underhanded maneuver that the ""evil"" humans that are portrayed in the movie may have demonstrated in accomplishing THEIR own agendas as well...........<br/><br/>I give the first half of the movie a 5. I found the animation, music and plot to be fun and enjoyable. I give the second half of the movie a 0. The animation went completely away in some scenes, the good music disappeared and the plot completely changed to a different theme and focus altogether. Overall, that averages out to a 2.5 (rounded down to 2) for the entire movie.

While I won't give away the ending, the film's conclusion was wrapped up in a flash forward mode with a heavy dose of political correctness that made it feel bolted on. It was obvious that the makers were searching for a story conclusion when there was none.<br/><br/>All in all, the first 2/3 of the movie were good entertainment. I would take any child to it.

This movie wasn't meant to be funny, but I laughed so much, because this movie is so ridiculous and stupid. Surf's Up was meant to be funny (and it is).

The old penguins (who act like a cross between an old priest and the annoying old man who lives in the apartment upstairs) are concerned about this child who is ""different"" and predict that he will be the downfall of the entire colony.<br/><br/>Mumble can't sing, so he can't take part in Penguin School, and feels very left out. He was also hatched late and is late maturing. When all of the other young penguins are ready to graduate and go off to the feeding grounds by themselves, he is denied the ceremony. He follows them anyway and ends up separated from the group.<br/><br/>Somewhere in here (I forget when) Mumble gets a clue that there is a real-world source for the fish shortage. Something is happening to them, but what, he has no clue.<br/><br/>Then he meets a group of smaller penguins. They lead him to their colony and he discovers *gasp* that not all penguins do as his colony does! They actually collect rocks instead of sing! This confuses the poor young penguin.<br/><br/>This new penguin colony has a religious leader who can answer any question. Think Holy Roller (a strong physical resemblance to Rev. Al Sharpton) with six pack rings stuck around his neck (a gift from the gods, he says, and the source of his powers). He answers everyone's questions (basic stuff) until he gets to our young freethinker, who quickly figures out that the nonsense that this penguin is spouting is not an answer and calls him on it. Which gets Mumble kicked out.<br/><br/>So, Mumble returns to his colony with a plan. His initial plan fails, but he manages to get all of the penguins dancing and wins the heart of his girl. However, the priestly penguins are horrified, certain that this upstart will bring the wrath of the Great Penguin down on their heads. It doesn't help when Mumble starts trying to use reason to explain that the fish are disappearing due to an earthly problem, not a godly one.<br/><br/>So, Mumble is exiled from his colony and the real adventure (and environmental message) begins.<br/><br/>I won't tell you any more, the story is pretty decent. The kids might or might not see the whole freethinker v religion theme, but it's worth it to have a movie that has a theme where reason and investigation (science) triumph over superstitious beliefs.<br/><br/>There are also strong environmental themes in Happy Feet, mostly int he second half of the film. Occasionally we're hit over the head with it, but it doesn't detract much from the storyline.<br/><br/>Some scenes it's hard to believe it's animation, it looks real. The Orcas are especially convincing. Some scenes are very intense, possibly too scary for a young child. I would recommend that children younger than 6, or sensitive 8 year olds, might not handle parts of this film well. It is rated PG, not G, for a reason. There is also a distubing section of the film where a penguin is visibly and graphically slowly choking to death. <br/><br/>If you are a freethinking person/parent who accepts responsibility for the damage humans do to the Earth, this is a great film for you and your kids. YOU will love the music, the kids will enjoy the movie. If you're religious or aren't convinced that the world has massive human induced problems, you might want to skip this one."

","With all of the media hype and heavy marketing of this movie, it is not a surprise that Happy Feet is a severe let down to audience members of all ages. While marketed as a sweet, fun, family oriented, toe tapping movie, the previews actually make the selected scenes look better than they are in the real movie. There is very little plot line and what ideas are conveyed are definitely not geared for younger children. There are several instances of adult-themed dialog and the fun dancing scenes you came to expect from the previews never extend beyond what you saw in the previews. I would not recommend this movie, but if you do still decide to go, be sure to engage the babysitter for the younger children. They will find the 2 hours you'll be spending in the theatre the longest in their little lives and you won't be finding the movie any shorter without them either. Overall, if you're needing 2 hours to fall asleep from sheer boredom, this is the movie you'll want to go to, however, most people will admit that their sofa is much more comfortable than theater chairs."

","Wow, was I shocked at the overwhelming Left Wing agenda in this film and particularly the anti-Christian bigotry. It's pretty sad when Liberal Hollywood has to stoop to brainwashing little kids' movies to get their bias across. This is about as low as it gets. Hey, all I wanted a funny, cute animated film and I got all this other junk thrown in my face.<br/><br/>Every single ""religious"" reference in this film, and there are a number especially around the one-hour mark when ""Mumble"" appears before ""The Elders."" Then, you hear a slew of Biblical words (""brethren,"" ""backsliding,"" ""sin,"" ""pagan,"" etc.) all used by unlikeable old fuddy-duddies who are portrayed in a very negative light. The idea is obvious: associate anything religious with ""bad"" or ""restrictive"" or ""mean"" and the opposite - secular thought - with ""free"" and ""good"" and ""happy,"" on and on. <br/><br/>This is brutally heavy-handed propaganda, and its subtle but relentlessly inserted throughout this movie, not just in that one scene. Secularists will have no clue nor an ear to hear this bias, but it's there. If this were as anti-black, or anti-gay as it is anti-religious, you would have heard a huge outcry.<br/><br/>The whole movie is so politically correct, it's sickening, yet these Liberal writers are so clueless (a la Don Imus), they stereotype Hispanics something fierce. Many times I thought Al Gore made this movie, with the in-your-face environmental baloney. Did I mention all the sexual innuendos, too, with this ""cute little penguin"" movie? <br/><br/>There should have been an outcry against this hypocritical sick mess. Perhaps even worse than this script is the apathy of the viewers to see this bigotry for what it is. Thankfully, some reviewers here saw it, too. Good for them for speaking out. More people should have been offended at this piece of crap."

","This movie was advertised as being a cute little animated story. Instead, it was an anti-religion environmentalist propaganda film made to target young audiences. The authority figures were purposely made to sound like fundamentalist Christians who believe in strange supernatural beings are completely inept, out of touch with reality, and are out to spoil everyone's fun. As a result, the young characters reject all advice that the older generations may have and go their own way at all costs. Humans are made out to be thoughtless destroyers of the environment lower in intelligence than birds. Though the behavior of the main character is innocent enough, it is obvious they are attempting to equate it with some of the serious moral problems of society today. Even without the underlying themes, the plot is poor even for a child's film. So, unless you want to teach your kids a morally bankrupt world view, or you value the environment more than all humanity, I don't recommend you see this movie."

"Benjamin_Cox","8","2","2","3 March 2008"," Makes you wonder why more films don't have tap-dancing penguins in them - 82%
","Going over the last few movies I've seen, I noticed a worrying pattern. ""PS - I Love You"", ""Monster's Ball"" and ""The Horse Whisperer"" are very female-friendly, dramatic movies with little room for light humour. So I was looking forward to this as nothing says 'light humour' more than tap-dancing penguins and once you get used to the rather unconventional set-up, ""Happy Feet"" reveals itself to have a traditional fairy-tale at its heart and a stark ecological message wrapped around it. Oh and lots of funky musical numbers.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood voices Mumble, a fluffy Emperor penguin who is unable to sing like all the other penguins in his community. His parents Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) try their best to encourage Mumble to sing but his real talent lays in tap-dancing which upsets the elders who then force Mumble into an icy exile. Stumbling across a group of Adelie penguins with Hispanic accents, Mumble finds his gift for dance is treasured instead of feared and his quest for acceptance is complete. But Mumble isn't content with that - determined to win the heart of Gloria (Brittany Murphy) and the acceptance of his own kind, Mumble and his new amigos are joined by Rockhopper penguin Lovelace (Robin Williams) in a quest to discover the reason for the shortage of fish which threatens the extinction of all life in the Antarctic.<br/><br/>Like I said, it's an unusual world we're introduced into but once you're used to the sight of singing penguins and Broadway-style dance numbers, ""Happy Feet"" has plenty to offer for viewers of all ages. Kids will love the fast-paced action scenes, the comic touches between the Adelie Amigos (primarily supplied by Robin Williams as Ramon) and the sheer energy and enthusiasm of Mumble as he taps, moonwalks and boogies his way through the film. Whether the message that being different is OK will go down is up to them - it's pretty much rammed down your throat from the off so only the stupid can miss it. Adults will appreciate the ecological moral of the story as well as the truly fantastic levels of animation. At times, it's impossible to tell what is live-action and what isn't - until the montage of bickering humans appeared, I thought it was all animated. It's so good that you forget its a cartoon and although I'm reluctant to admit it, it looks better than anything Pixar has so far produced including their latest effort ""WALL-E"".<br/><br/>It might be ""The Ugly Ducking"" on ice but ""Happy Feet"" is as good a family film as I've seen in recent months. The music is superb and performed with reasonable competence though Murphy's voice cannot match that of Freddy Mercury during her version of ""Somebody To Love"". But unless you're in a straight-jacket, you'll find it impossible to stop yourself tapping your feet or even singing along with our feathered friends on screen. It's cute, it's smart and it looks absolutely fabulous. The only real issues I have are with character recognition - nearly all the penguins look the same with the exception of Mumble, Lovelace and the Amigos. The other problem is with Williams - voicing two characters in the same film was always going to lead to them sounding similar and throw in his trademark machine-gun delivery and it's very difficult to understand what he's actually saying - Ramon is practically incomprehensible though Lovelace is much clearer. But ""Happy Feet"" is still a quality family film, filled with enough adventure, excitement and reflection to satisfy younger viewers and their parents."

","... This movie, is not only drawn so beautifully that i almost fell out of my chair, incredibly much good music, hilarious comments (Robin Williams was perfect for this movie), romance, but also had a serious side. In so many ways. How, its hard to fit in if your different, how, if your not accepted in one community, there is always somewhere else where you will fit in. And father not accepting his son and just wanting him to be normal like other penguins. I mean, come on! What more can you ask from a movie? Im like most guys, hate musicals. But holy c**p, even the musical part of this movie is insanely entertaining. I got the chills several time, and i don't get chills often when watching movies.<br/><br/>I absolutely love this movie, no doubt about it. I agree as many people say that the first part of the movie was the best, and that some of the story is badly explained, but it's still unquestionably one of my favourite. It takes up big concerns about humans messing up how the nature should be. If every kid in the world saw this movie, that problem would be gone in 20 years.<br/><br/>If you are wondering whether or not to watch this movie, don't even blink. You will have the best 2 hours you've had in a long long time. How it's only rated 6,8/10 here at IMDb is scandalous if you ask me."
"vip_ebriega","10","2","2","8 February 2008"," A beautifully charming, yet also surprisingly smart animated entertainment.
","My Take: Stunning animation and terrific musical numbers worthy of Gene Wilder make for a great time at the movies. <br/><br/>After MARCH OF THE PENGUINS, a movie/documentary about real-life penguins and their Antarctic perilous journeys, which was released just previously, audiences might have already seen enough penguins, even just for this year. But another penguin fairytale is just at hand, with its trailer already out at the time. HAPPY FEET, by the looks of the trailer, may just be a corny animated movie which relies heavily on the cutesy than a proper story and more elaborate creativity. I missed HAPPY FEET on the big-screen, but I was sound surrounded by the fact that it was a hit. Of course, the appeal of famous actors like Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy and a soundtrack of famous pop songs (old and new) performed by the best of computer-animated penguins. If you think as much I did back then, well wrong are we.<br/><br/>I didn't think I was going to hate HAPPY FEET back then, but I didn't expect much from it. But, when I finally saw, the surprise was sudden. Armed with the usually reused charms of talking animals, HAPPY FEET takes some of the things much further, turning it into an actually clever musical adventure, where there are a lot of singing, dancing, but doesn't lack the importance of good characters and a somewhat charming storyline. Sure, the story gets quite corny and silly, sure too much of the singing and dancing will get some of the viewers bogged down. But the penguins never get boring. In fact, viewers might find themselves forgetting that the characters are penguins, due to their much diverse personalities that almost makes them human. Pity on the humans of course, since most of them are reduced to blue-eyed, motion capture drones, but no matter, HAPPY FEET has a place for them just as well.<br/><br/>The success of its genius come from the fact that, on the helm, is director George Miller who, as you might remember produced the highly-acclaimed talking animal movie BABE then directed the sequel called BABE: PIG IN THE CITY, which were the smartest in this somewhat popular sub-genre. Miller, unlike some others who might get the job, gives his ""kid's movie"" characters with much maturity, giving them more appeal to the old as much to the young. Although the preachy message might have been more improved, there couldn't be much more of a thing to be done with it, so let's leave well enough alone. The voice actors all do well, blending in with their characters and do quite well with a specially hilarious and yet cohesive script.<br/><br/>Does HAPPY FEET change to world, as it might have been described in the movie? Definitely not. But it doesn't have to. It does what it was intended to do, and transforms it into a more remarkable result. For its success (and its penguins), I'm grading this ""happy feat"" a *****.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

","I've recently come to realise that the recent new style of big-screen animation is something that is best enjoyed several times to bring out the full flavour. Happy Feet is a very good example of this. On first viewing, I came away slightly dissatisfied, for two reasons. One was the slightly awkward live action shots near the end that drive home the environmental message. It's a good message, but it felt a little out of place to have it done this way. The other reason was that I missed some of the dialogue, including the crucial moment near the end when Gloria informs Mumble that she is not spoken for: the result was that I ended the film thinking that they never got together, which as you can imagine was a strange experience.<br/><br/>When I watched this a second time, I fell in love with it. I couldn't believe the error I had made about the plot, and was kicking myself. I also was so blown away by the animation (another reviewer mentioned the blizzard shot - that's my favourite too), the music (John Powell is my hero), the dancing, the comedy - well, pretty much everything really - that the awkward scenes mentioned earlier just seemed to flash by and not matter to me at all.<br/><br/>This is a truly wonderful film in almost every sense, and the tribute to Steve Irwin included on the DVD was genuinely moving. Steve was an incredible man, and I salute Mr. Miller for including these words.<br/><br/>Movies are important. They represent one of the pinnacles of human collaboration, and those of us who enjoy knowing what effort goes into them almost as much as watching them can fully appreciate huge projects like this one. Especially when we watch them several times.<br/><br/>Very highly recommended!"

","Extremely adept animated musical-comedy continuing to ride the adorable penguin wave of popularity proved masterful when compared against it's obnoxious, tiresome, and relentless add campaign that had turned so many adults away merely from previews. Not surprisingly, the movie will still have it's share of nay-sayers ridiculing an excessive cutistry (yes I made that word up, as I sometimes deem appropriate!) whirling around the singing chorus of birds for lengthy periods of time in a barren Antarctica... but in that ignorant cynicism, will have missed so much more that the movie has to offer. A dazzling array of content breezes through in the 109 minute run time that, whenever feeling overlong in it's song and dance sequences, balances out splendidly with delightful humor (complete with superb back-chatter), sincere romance, spectacular action sequences, and quite the little adventure of a plot thrown in with all of it's understated social, moral and religious ramifications shining through in a very natural, unpretentious way.<br/><br/>Obviously for a movie that sold itself on musical numbers, Happy Feet had to deliver, and throughout the celebratory routines the music stays at it's utmost crowd-pleasing best. The producers knew what kind of event they wanted to induce for parents and their children when selecting the infectious songs that often combine to form supremely entertaining medley's that wisely pay ode to pop radio in a way that will engage viewers. It is the constant emphasis on Fun that prevents these sequences from becoming stale, often animated in a completely complimentary manner to the upbeat rhythms. For all this talk of the main uniform locale keeping aesthetics to a minimal variance, the animation team does an outstanding job at diversifying and beautifying the icy tundra in ways that keep each scene sacred and varied in it's humble homage to Earth's pristine state. Conecentrating on one specific set of components has obviously let the animators refine the penguins themselves to a charming physicality, no greater exemplified then in our lead Mumble ""Happy Feet"" himself and his infectious tapping.<br/><br/>Finally credit must me given to the man responsible for elevating a near-ridiculous concept into the year's best family animated feature. George Miller has truly come full circle in his quest as a director, having branched out through the Road Warrior trilogy starting in the late 70's only to find himself receiving an Oscar for best animated film of 2006 for an opus on singing and dancing penguins. That, is the mark of a diversified filmmaker."

Fluffy feathers that look totally real, penguins with bona fide personalities. Hugh Jackman's talent knows no bounds. The trick is to look beyond the penguins, and at the scenery beyond. This is Art. I would buy those sunsets to put on my walls. The story is boy meets girl on the road of trails, and with double edged ending. Yes, the 'alternate' ending is rushed, but think about it...would it happen? Maybe. We would be as enthralled by the reality more than the animation.

"general-melchett","9","2","2","21 December 2006"," Brilliant animation and great characters make Happy Feet a sure-fire hit.
","Happy Feet has taken the box office by storm - and it's easy to see why. The animation is absolutely top-hole (and the budget isn't astronomical either), the characters are all vivid, enjoyable and the kids quickly identify with them, and the film carries an important environmental message - we are slowly destroying the penguins' world and must recognise them for their true beauty before it is too late. From the very start of the film, you know that Mumble is going to be different, and when he does arrive on the Earth, the film does a grand job in making the other penguins ostracise him for his lack of singing skill, and we quickly feel sorry for the young Mumble, who is thrust into a nasty world straight from birth. The start of the film is very touching, but lacks on the comedy and general interest, and therefore, the film could not have continued in that way forever. And it quickly changed - with the film being best having Mumble as a teenager. He then realises that people are sick of his uniqueness now and that he is making the others feel humiliated, and that he could well be on his way to an early death. The film started to have more comedy from this point on - thank God for the Latino penguins. If it wasn't for them, the film could hardly even be called a comedy. Though it is meant to be touching, some of the action is extremely high-octane - when the penguins slide down cliffs into the sea, it makes for an overwhelming experience on the silver screen, and it may even thrill you. Though this film tries to be a masterpiece with its important message and generally effective characters and script, it is the animation that makes it brilliant - it is easily the best I have seen this year. It is all beautiful, and it truly raises the bar for animation in the future. Though the humans seem a bit surreal and strange, the way live action is mixed with animation is pretty well-done, and should be seen to be believed. Happy Feet isn't exactly a monumental film and probably won't have any effect on the environmental problems we suffer now, but the animation and story are brilliant, and we have a Christmas smash hit in Happy Feet. I thought it was absolutely riveting. If it receives a worthy DVD release, this film could well be as successful as things like Ice Age (though maybe not so as Shrek or Finding Nemo). Happy Feet makes for a truly great cinematic experience and you will never see penguins in the same way again. Spiffing! 9/10"

Abandonment is a theme, and at one point the main penguin is put in Sea World, where the narrator talks about his mind practically going numb.

","I saw the movie last night with a group of friends. We've been looking foreword to seeing it for several months, since the first trailers came out. The trailers looked funny; really funny. The dancing looked fun, and it had the potential to get songs stuck in your head in a Moulin Rouge-esquire manner. Finally, yesterday, the day came. It started out slow, but picked up alright. We begin with two penguins meeting each other for the first time when they sing to each other (something all penguins do to find their 'soul mate'). Soon thereafter the ""elders,"" as we come to know them send the women away to fish, or something, while the men stay and incubate the eggs they're waiting to hatch. No doubt that's probably the way it happens in nature, the manner in which it's enforced by the elders is clearly making a statement about gender rolls.<br/><br/>In the midst of the incubation the father loses the egg. When the egg finally hatches, ""Mumble"" can't sing. He only tap dances, an ""Abomination"" as the elders describe it (Soddom and Ghemmora?). Coincidentally, there is also a shortage of fish during this time period. The elders decide that the fish shortage is punishment from the penguin god who is angry with Mumble's deviation from the norm. When Mumble refuses to ""change,"" at the request of his father, he is cast out of the community.<br/><br/>Mumble sets out to find the source of the fish shortage. On the way he meets a crew of Latino penguins who take him to a Polygamist, penguin guru who's supposed to know everything because of his communion with the ""great beings"" (he has a plastic coke ring around his neck, slowly choking him). When he gets frustrated because he can't answer Mumbles questions, he instead retreats to his couch of ""eternal pleasures"" with his six penguin wives, presumably to have sex with them- which we can infer from his statement while leaving, ""alright ladies, who's first?"" Mumble, with a small posse of Latino penguins sets out to find the answer to his question. He eventually finds gigantic fishing boats, quite literally stealing all the fish. He follows them all the way to Florida where he is captured and put in a zoo. After months in the zoo, he goes crazy. Eventually, entertaining a small girl watching him, he starts dancing for her. His dancing attracts the attention of many zoo goers and literally within a matter of seconds, hundreds of people are crowded around all presumably calling the UN to tell them about the mistreatment of animals.<br/><br/>Somehow, (we really don't know much of what happened) Mumble ends up back home with a tracking device on. He somehow convinces everyone that dancing will bring back the fish. The elders protest and let out a very monk-like chant, while the rest of the penguins dance. Before long, a helicopter shows up and watches them all dance. Presumably, they call someone awfully important who makes all the evil fishing boats go away (in fact, we even get to see a nice little diagram of the fishing boats sailing away with arrows and everything).<br/><br/>The redeeming qualities of the film are that the dancing (although it's rare) is entertaining. The Latinos are extremely funny and witty, and the music is pretty fun- when it's appropriate.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the problems are much worse. The sexual innuendo is extremely thick. Even young children would probably pick it up (for example, at one point a penguin attempted to gain another penguins affection by singing ""I'll Make Love to You"" by Boys to Men). Then, on top of that, the movie primarily stood as a pulpit from which to speak and condemn. The bashing of the Christian church was extremely obvious and almost everything else just pushed environmental gung-hoedness that was seriously vile and even poorly stated.<br/><br/>So, in summary, if they would remake this movie with Mumble and the Latinos dancing, singing and making jokes- it would get 10 stars. But as is, children should NOT see it, and only adults willing to sift through the crap should even venture to try."

","this movie was not at all what i thought it would be. i went in to the movie expecting a fun, exciting movie about a dancing penguin. well the first 5 minutes were like that and then it all went down hill from there. what the previews neglected to tell everyone was that this movie contained theological ideas that children really don't understand. the storyline was confusing and not very well put together. overall this movie was horrible in my book. here is some advice for the writers if you are going to write a children's movie about happy dancing penguins keep it cute and leave out all the theological and environmental nonsense. this movie is not for children."
"AidanAndRyleighsMom","10","9","16","22 November 2006"," MY kids LOVED this movie
","I took my two year old and my four year old to see this movie this week and they both absolutely loved it. My little girl was dancing along to the songs in front of her seat the whole movie long! Neither one of them were scared at all. They both have seen some animal shows on Animal Planet and Discovery so I didn't worry too much about any scenes with Leopard Seals or Killer Whales. They both know that sometimes animals have to hunt other animals to survive. I explained that to them when they were asking why their chicken at dinner had the same name as the animals on the farm. Not that any of the penguins get eaten anyway. Yes, there was an environmental message but I personally thought it was done so that the younger kids wouldn't understand all of the undertones. My son (the older of the two) asked if it was still OK to eat Fish and I told him that it was as long as we didn't eat ALL the fish. He was happy with that answer. As for the religious aspect, they didn't even get that at all from it. It went right over their heads. I got it, being an adult, but if anything I think it was more of a ""Don't blindly blame everything on God"" message more than an anti-religion message. I think it was one of the funniest movies I have seen in a long time. Better than Cars even and that was our current fave around here. The animation was simply AWESOME! The soundtrack will be coming home on our next trip to the store. I loved Boogie Wonderland! Anything this cute that makes my kids dance and sing is good in my book."
"Skycoaster","7","8","14","12 December 2006"," Tappy Feet
","To run the list of propaganda-related issues in the new flick ""Happy Feet"" would take as long as the movie itself, so allow me simply to say that the film is politically oriented towards the far left. Of course, this is to be expected on some degree; most hero-journeys have some liberal affiliation towards tolerance, understanding, and acceptance. Here, however, these messages are not a means to convey a moral but an interference into the otherwise charming tale.<br/><br/>So what's to like? Don't worry, a lot. As we have come to expect by the sudden upsurge in animation quality, the penguins and their environment are becoming more and more realistic, and here in particular the attention to detail shines. Some nice examples are long, mobile shots of penguins swimming, sliding, and falling around the icy Antarctic landscapes while completely ignoring the laws of physics. As long as we have an omniscient camera, these wild rides through computer imagery are a treat.<br/><br/>But there is a trick to it, which was meant to be a sly stylistic move but instead cheapens the film's climax, of all things: humans, who do make appearances, are shown in live action. At first, I believed them just to be a superb example of the already stellar CGI, but no, says IMDb.com, they are real people, and they don't belong here.<br/><br/>Thankfully, the live-action humans are not shown with the penguins, but in the segments most packed with the aforementioned propaganda. Here, the range of narration shifts away from the penguins, so rather than following the struggles of our protagonists, who are designed to appeal to children for their rebellious and individualistic natures, we get grown- ups in authority dealing with grown-up issues. This shift is so abrupt and unexpected that I fear some may be confused as to what happened to the penguins. Well, at least for that segment, they're gone.<br/><br/>I haven't discussed plot very much in this review, probably because it has all been done before. Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) dances instead of singing and thus deserves exile from the colony, as in ""Footloose,"" finds acceptance with a gang of outsiders led by Robin Williams, as in ""Robots,"" and must combat indifferent humans to save his family, bring unity to his community, and get the the girl, Gloria (Voice of Brittany Murphy, who does her own impressive singing), as in every Joseph Campbell story. Even the characters are familiar, at least to anyone who has seen ""March of the Penguins."" Thankfully, plot comparisons to the latter movie are limited.<br/><br/>Again, don't worry; ""Happy Feet"" borrows the best points from every movie mentioned in the previous paragraph and combines them into an okay family film. It may not be original, but it does shine for its adherence to its roots as a traditionally entertaining animated feature with a few adult-oriented jokes thrown in. My advice? Forget political affiliation or age-appropriation and see the film, if only to watch thousands of penguins doing the wave. Sweet."

"DonFishies","6","13","26","17 November 2006"," Amazing animation, but a disappointment otherwise
","In the never-ending quest to appease all the filmgoers by throttling them with the same beloved idea over and over again, we have Happy Feet, another movie involving penguins as main characters. Despite not being too hyped to see the film, I was intrigued by all of the praise it was getting. But after seeing it, I really beg to ask why.<br/><br/>The film begins much the same as the entirety of March of the Penguins, with the Emperor penguins mating rituals. Only these penguins can talk, and can make the audience actually understand their mating calls - singing. After a particularly interesting opening musical sequence, we meet Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman). They fall in love, and they conceive a baby. After Norma Jean leaves to retrieve food, Memphis is left with the egg. Not so long after just barely saving the egg from a fatal accident, it hatches, and Mumble (Elizabeth Daily as a youngster, and Elijah Wood when older) is born. For some reason, Mumble has issues singing. But he does not have any problems dancing, which only brings trouble from the rest of the penguins, including his parents. The rest of the film chronicles Mumble's ups-and-downs, and how he confronts his ""problem"".<br/><br/>Despite its cuteness, I just thought the movie was way too silly for its own good. The singing and dancing was alright for the first little bit, but just did not work nearly as well as the film went on. It wants to be the focus of the film, but feels way too awkwardly placed in between intervals with the actual plot. Even worse is the fact that the plot randomly deviates about halfway through the film, and brings in points that barely any child would be able to understand. To me, it felt out of place in the film, and just felt like it was thrown in as an after thought to make the film even longer than it should have been. I knew the trailers really left a lot to the imagination (as does the actual concept for the film), but I am fairly certain they could have pulled off something much better than they did. I do not want to reveal just what it is that happens, but despite the good intentions with the message, it just does not work.<br/><br/>The voices are all fairly well done all around. Robin Williams is zany as always in his three roles, but of course, he pulls them off with such excellence that you can barely tell that he is voicing more than one (if any at all). Wood is great as Mumbles, and Brittany Murphy does an adequate job as the love interest Gloria. Kidman does alright for herself (if you can even tell its her voice), but I was really stunned by Jackman. His Elvis impersonation is gold, and he just rocks the screen anytime his character says anything. For such a busy actor, you really can tell his commitment to pictures like this, and it only helps to show the good things he has coming for him in the future.<br/><br/>The real standout of the film however, are the CGI effects. These penguins look amazingly real, and their backgrounds look even better. Just looking at the penguins, you can barely tell whether they are digitally fabricated or if they are real. They walk and move like penguins, and they look pitch perfect in comparison with March. Mumble's body is particularly awestriking, as it shows off individual strands of fur in every shot. When he jumps in and out of water, it is very noticeable, and never falters once. It reminded me a lot of how excellent the original Toy Story film looked back in the '90s, and how things have improved even more since then. The snowy landscapes are also particularly good and realistic to boot. I was amazed by just how wonderful this film looked, and even more impressed by its realism. The other animals, from seals to whales, also look amazingly realistic. I felt like I was watching the real thing, not just an animated film.<br/><br/>If anything, the film fumbles when it attempts to mix in some live-action footage late in the game. It may look like it was digitally created at first, but soon after you can see how blatantly obvious it is that it is not. It just looks weird, and it takes away from the excellent work done throughout the rest of the film. Why the filmmakers would insist on ruining a perfectly well animated film, I am still unsure. But as it goes along with the random misplaced subplot, I really begin to wonder why it was thrown in at all.<br/><br/>To me, Happy Feet is a movie made with good intentions, but just does not end up fulfilling them. It ups the stakes too high for itself, and it just really builds up to nothing. I was disappointed heavily by it, and am still puzzled by just what the critics were thinking. Maybe I missed something? Or maybe I am just seeing through the shoddy job done on the film? Obviously it will go unknown, but just do note that there are far better animated films that have been released this year. Feet just feels subpar and inadequate in comparison to them.<br/><br/>6/10."

","What a disappointment - and boring to boot. We were really looking forward to this, and it was a complete let down. It has all the signs of a movie that has been hacked about, and ended up a total mess. One only wonders what was lost in the year since its delayed release. Any film heavily sold for children that considers it a Good Thing when a penguin gets put in a zoo, then has a radio control device surgically implanted in its back in order to lead the 'aliens' (i.e. humans) back to the rest of its tribe, is making a Big Mistake in my book. I also think the music was inappropriate, and the whole movie would frankly scare the pants off any really young children, despite the U Cert. It also has a lot of suspect moral preaching. Considering the available technology, and what could have been done with this story, it just seems a huge shame. Penguins, CGI, music - surely one Busby Berkely-style number just waiting to happen?"

","What an odd movie.Actually this is two movies, one great and the other just okay.<br/><br/>The first half of this film is the story of Mumbles a penguin who can't sing but can dance. This is the source of most of the promos and its what the studio is pushing as what the film is about.Can the penguin find his heart song if he can't sing? Well thats the first half of the movie. The second half of the movie is an odd left turn thats foreshadowed, but doesn't really belong, and thats Mumbles attempts to find the ""aliens"" and make them stop taking the fish. Its a weird detour that puts mumbles in a zoo.<br/><br/>I really liked the first half of the film. Its an infectious story about finding your place in the world. Sure its been done to death but the characters and the music push this film from run of the mill into something special. Its a great one hour movie.<br/><br/>The second half of this film is another story. Its not the second half of the film its a second film tacked on to make up the running time.The problem is that once Mumbles ends up in the zoo everything is contrived. What happens is done just to get to the ending. It doesn't work. I went from loving the movie to liking it. Yes I know I'm being vague but to really explain why it doesn't work would require explaining the ending and thats not fair. Lets just say that they should have stopped at an hour.<br/><br/>Story aside this is probably the best animated computer film (technically) I've seen all year. Its amazing. Its simply beautiful to look at and its clear that the animators took great pains to make a visually arresting film. The performances are top notch, with Robin Williams pure joy in two roles. And of course the music is wonderful, with some really nice rearrangements that are so clever it takes you a few minutes to realize what the song is.<br/><br/>I highly recommend the first half of this movie. Its magical. The second part has moments, but mostly its contrived nonsense you'll want to push out of your head (though not the ten thousand penguins dancing to Stevie Wonder).<br/><br/>Worth a trip to the multiplex if you can ignore the second half.<br/><br/>First half is 9 out of 10. The second is 5 out of 10. Split the difference of 7 for IMDb purposes"

All of these down-voters have forgotten the fundamentals of film reviewing- YOU REVIEW THE CONTENTS OF THE FILM. It doesn't matter that this film opposes religion- the penguins religions were false.

The soundtrack is particularly impressive offering the hits from rock, rap and a particular emphasis on soul and disco.<br/><br/>The only things that let the film down are the somewhat out of place humans which are basically integrated video clips that have been blended into the 3d environment, and the idea that the UN actually cares about penguins/the government will react to protesters enough to make a change.<br/><br/>With only a small number of mistakes and many memorable scenes I can happily give this film a 10/10.<br/><br/>Also, Elijah Woods has certainly improved his voice acting since LOTR."

","I admit, the creators were aiming for a movie that taught acceptance and taking care of the environment and all that. The problem is, the story was poorly constructed.<br/><br/>I remember that I heard tons of wonderful things about the movie. I heard it was cute, the graphics were fantastic, the soundtrack was slammin'. I went to the movie, and was completely disappointed. For their soundtrack, they chose fabulous artists such as Elvis and Stevie Wonder, but they picked the wrong songs. They came from no where, and didn't fit the story. For example, there was one scene when Mumble was tap dancing to ""Boogie On Raggae Woman"" by Stevie Wonder. Great song, but the first thing I thought was, ""Isn't Mumble a boy?"" So, you know. And the song isn't even about simply dancing. It's about this girl getting together with this guy. Mumble was too little to Mate. I also didn't even get the whole Heartsong thing. That made no sense to me.<br/><br/>Now, back to the story. I remember practically half the time, asking questions that were never answered. I was also asking questions like, ""What was the point in that?"" and thinking, ""That's impossible!"" and ""I don't get it."" Once scene had Orcas. The penguins were in the Orca's mouth, and they escaped. That could not have happened in real life, and the only point in that scene was to get some stupid six pack ring off Lovelace's neck.<br/><br/>They also did not develop the story with the global warming or whatever enough, but put a lot of emphasis on it. They made the whole father thing over dramatic, and mumble danced because of a birth defect instead of just being that way or having it be genetic.<br/><br/>Even the ending was unbelievable and lame! In short, the whole movie was pretty much unbelievable (I know I use the word a lot, but there's not really another way to say it) and weak. I don't care if the disgusting cake (the story and characters) is covered in buckets of frosting (the visual effects and razzle dazzle), a cake is no good if it is no good. The story was just completely weak."
"D_Burke","10","3","4","2 April 2007"," I loved loved LOVED this movie!
","I have to say that when you have an animated film where one of the voices is Robin Williams, you can't really go wrong. When he's the voice of one of the characters, you can usually tell it's an exceptional animated movie. It was true for ""Aladdin"", ""Ferngully: The Last Rainforest"", and ""Robots"", and this movie is no exception.<br/><br/>There aren't enough good things to say about this movie. The story line was intriguing, the animation was phenomenal, the music was excellent and fit the story surprisingly well, the vocal acting was tremendous, and the message of the movie was great. This movie is up there with ""Toy Story"" and ""Shrek"" as one of the best computer animated films ever made.<br/><br/>I'm pretty critical when it comes to movies too. In fact, I know from seeing many recent animated films that just because a movie is computer animated and all-star celebrities voice the characters doesn't make it a great movie. It was true for ""Doogal"", which had a slew of A-List talent but wasn't very good otherwise.<br/><br/>If there was one thing I'd change about the movie, though, it would be how the characters looked. I didn't like the fact that every penguin except Mumble looked exactly alike. That doesn't mean I'd bring my rating down from a 10 to a 9, because the realness of these penguins in image and movement compensated for this slight grievance.<br/><br/>I was a little worried in the beginning, too, when Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman were singing ""Kiss"" by Prince. I thought this movie was going to be an animated ""Moulin Rouge"" with the same plot line. Although all of the music was taken from other sources, the music and the movement of the penguins made me want to get up and dance, or at least take tap dancing lessons somewhere in the near future. The song that fit especially well in this movie is ""Jump, Move"" by the Brand New Heavies, with ""I Wish"" by Stevie Wonder coming in a close second.<br/><br/>In short, I would definitely recommend this film to everyone.

The singing and dancing, which I thought I would dislike, were delightful. The story had a point, this wasn't some pointless romp and the animation was probably the best I've seen. <br/><br/>The baby penguins were quite possibly the sweetest creation ever animated. Baby Mumbles stole my heart. Brave, sweet teen Mumble has my vote for president."

","It is an animated movie, but i sat through the whole thing without ever thinking that it's animated.<br/><br/>It is a musical, but i sat through the whole thing without ever thinking that it's a musical (i HATE musicals).<br/><br/>Best of all - don't read any reviews or comments about the movie. Not even this one. That way you'll get the most from this masterpiece, 'cuz ANYTHING that you will read about it will be a spoiler.<br/><br/>But if you insist ...<br/><br/>After loving the penguins (and not much else) in Madagascar, i thought that it won't hurt me to go and see this cute kiddies movie about dancing penguins. What i got is a superb story of love, courage and ambition that made me cry. This is a movie with a strong message and not just an environmental one.<br/><br/>It is not flawless. Some plot lines go unexplored. For example, i didn't understand what exactly is that huge vicious animal that chases Mumble to the Latino penguins. I didn't understand why exactly Mumble looks so different from the rest of his nation. The resolution of the plot is a bit too quick and easy. (Maybe those things will be solved in the DVD.) But there are just enough parts in this movie that are so strong, that all flaws seems unimportant.<br/><br/>This great film is a proof that the animated movie industry is growing up very well."
"rocket10","10","3","4","5 January 2007"," A truly outstanding and moving film for everyone.
","I have seen this movie 4 times and I leave the theater wanting to go see it again; I thought this was the best movie of the year in my opinion. I loved the story, it was cute, hilarious, and well put together. I laughed mostly through the whole movie and the graphics were amazing, best animated film I've ever seen. Happy Feet has become my favorite movie and stands out above all others, it has a very important message everyone should pay close attention to about the environment and what lives within it. This movie is great for all ages, (well, almost) and If you have not seen the movie already, I recommend you do, you'll get more than a laugh or two out of it. They picked awesome actors to fit the roles of each character, for example Robin Williams, he's great at altering his voice to make a perfect match for his roles (He plays Lovelace and Ramon, the head of the Latino penguins). Elijah Wood was a great choice for Mumble, I can't think of anyone else to do the job. I believe in everything this movie shows and I might add, I've become a very huge fan of this film. There's nothing I did not like about this movie, though it does have a few parts which may or may not be appropriate for all, but that is not for me to decide. George Miller has done a fine job with this movie, I think it is at his best."

A movie for all the family. Some might think this is a children's movie with a few penguins dancing and signing here and there. But you need to see beyond that: embrace differences; accept others as the are and encourage them to bring their best. I loved Mumble's blue eyes (was that on purpose given that Elijah Wood has the same beautiful eyes?). I watched the Spanish version and they also did a great job on the translation. I'm already waiting for the DVD so I can watch the English version."
"danddinmont","9","3","4","2 January 2007"," An audio-visual treat for adults and children, keeping in mind the film is PG not G rated
","We saw the film in a small theater with stadium seating and a projection system that had all the bells and whistles, this of course heightened the scary scenes, enlarging the size of the monsters and raising their noises to truly fearsome levels; following one of these scenes a family with two youngsters in the four to eight year age range, were unable to control the children's crying and left the premises, never to return. However when it becomes available on DVD, the monsters won't be as large, and the scary bits can be skipped, so it would be suitable for younger children. The filmmakers are obviously in love with the musical genre, there are numerous touches that might be considered homages to the MGM musicals of the legendary ""Freed Unit"". However, my highest praise is for the artists who so seamlessly translated the distinctive footwork of Savion Glover from real life to animation, superb! This, aside from the above caveat, is definitely a film worthy of a first viewing in a state of the art theater, and a DVD to be looked forward to with happy anticipation."

"Robert_duder","8","3","4","25 December 2006"," Funny, moral, bright, cheery, thrilling and brilliantly created...Happy Feet scores!!
","Now I don't quite think Happy Feet is the feat of animation that some other Pixar or Disney classic films have been but nonetheless for it's time and place it is a wonderful kids movie. I think it loses some of it's points because it doesn't necessarily try to prove itself to the wide demographic like many other animated stories do as of late but even still kids and adults of all ages can enjoy Happy Feet on a different level. Happy Feet is almost heavy laden with it's moralistic message of acceptance, being different and those you love and there is NOTHING wrong with that. The characters are adorable and enjoyable and the remade classic Penguin tunes from classic rock to modern day gangster rap is deliciously funny and different and I might also mention that Happy Feet just screams Broadway show mark my words!! Veteran but sparse director George Miller takes the helm and does a remarkable job with animation and mixing a few small scenes of live action to create this vivid and thrilling animated ride. I would have loved to have seen Happy Feet in an IMAX because there is some truly stunning moments.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood is the voice of the lead non-singing but tap dancing penguin Mumble. His timid and shy voice is perfect Mumble and suits him very well. Mumble's character is a small package but a big hero waiting to escape and loves and accepts everyone even when they don't do the same for him. Brittany Murphy is Gloria, Mumble's childhood sweetheart who loves him unconditionally but they hide their feelings for each other. Murphy's recognizable animated style (King Of The Hill, Good Boy!) adds some experience and great talent to the character and to the story line. Hugh Jackman is also excellent as the Elvis singing Dad who is devastated to learn his neglect might have caused his son some damage being unable to sing. Jackman's voice is almost unrecognizable with this southern drawl but he does a great job. Nicole Kidman is the voice of Mumble's mother and I'm sure it has nothing to with her performance but the character is quite small and timid and barely has anything of any significance to say. She's almost barely a supporting character. Robin Williams as he so often does completely steals the show as both Penguin Prophet Lovelace and the swinging Mexican sounding party animal Ramone. His crazy antics always tend to steal the scene and he gets some great lines too. <br/><br/>Happy Feet has some scenes of true awe where your mouth will fall open at the glorious animation or thrilling action scenes and most of the music scenes are downright hilarious and touching. The characters are cute and the moral is as well and that is only my shortcoming. That's not to say I have ANYTHING against a strong moral message or cute characters but I am reviewing it from the perspective of an adult and as such I found it a little too cute and the characters for the most part were a little on the empty side. Negatives aside Happy Feet is brilliant and well worth seeing for all of it's positives which is plenty!! Go see it and take little ones. 8.5/10"

","Adorable. I loved it from start to finish, even if some parts made me sniffle ;) I recommend it to everyone who loves things like this. The beginning when he came out of his shell and started to dance was so cute. And the baby Gloria was simply gorgeous :) Robin Williams was great as two different penguins, and the songs were well performed. I especially loved the first really big one that says ""DANCE! Mumble, boogie wonderland"" or something :) Im thirteen and a self confessed kid film addict. Finding Nemo was my favourite, but now this is. Maybe a tad long, but still brilliant. It had plenty of suspense, like the lion seal and killer whale scenes, and sad, and funny moments. Perfect balance in my opinion. The ending was lovely. His father finally accepted him. But the first big song was my favourite part. And the bit with the northern lights :)"
"jluis1984","8","3","4","20 December 2006"," One of the best animated films of 2006
","In animation, like in most arts, whenever a new technique is invented and succeeds, it doesn't really take too long until it becomes a widely used standard as everyone begins to explore it. That's exactly what happened to Computer Generated (CG) animation, to the point that now, 15 years after the release of ""Toy Story"" (first animated feature made entirely with CG), this kind of animation is not as exciting or thrilling as before as most of the recent animated movies begin to look the same. Fortunately, ""Happy Feet"", Warner Bros Studios attempt at CG animation plays definitely a whole different tune, as it uses CG imagery not only to animate its characters, but to create a vivid world attempting to use (or to mimic) elements of the art of cinematography. It may not be a huge step forward, but at least it's a step forward.<br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" is the story of Mumble (Elijah Wood), a young Emperor penguin with an uncanny natural ability for tap dancing, but unable to sing at all. The problem? Emperor penguins live in a society based on singing, where the use of the singing voice allows them to find friends and eventually a wife. As Mumble grows up, his inability to sing and his uncontrollable desire to dance make him almost a pariah, frowned upon by his friends, his father (Hugh Jackman) and the Elders of the community. Exiled, Mumble finds new friends in a different community of penguins (that sees dancing as another way to socialize), but also finds a mission: to discover who is causing the fish to disappear. To find it, he'll have to travel across Antarctica to find the mysterious ""Aliens"" that seem to be behind all. <br/><br/>Mainly written by director George Miller and John Collee (although with the collaboration of Warren Coleman and Judy Morris), ""Happy Feet"" is an ambitious film that attempts to be funny and entertaining for the kids while at the same time being deep and intelligent enough for adults to enjoy as well. Not an easy task to accomplish, but for the most part Miller, Collee and their team of writers succeed almost flawlessly on their attempt. ""Happy Feet"" can be seen basically as the classic tale of a young character and his trip to find his place in the world and his purpose in life, as well as the many problems and allies he finds during his odyssey. However, it is also tackles important topics such as tolerance, self confidence, and mainly the disaster we mankind are doing to out environment.<br/><br/>While the script is certainly a bit contrived (mainly because its over ambitious goals), the direction of the movie is almost flawless. Almost 30 years after his breakthrough with the now legendary ""Mad Max"", George Miller keeps being an effective and original director (despite the few number of movies he has directed) who doesn't seem afraid to try new and fresh things. Like a hybrid between his ""Babe: Pig in the City"" and ""Mad Max 2"", this movie is an adventure of epic proportions that while aimed to the kids, it's dark and meaningful, yet charming and very accessible at the same time. As I wrote at the beginning, ""Happy Feet""'s most amazing feature is the simply perfect use of CG animation to create gorgeous settings and landscapes. It's use of lighting sources and textures is really breathtaking, and this is probably the closest CG can get to real life cinematography.<br/><br/>The use of the voice is one of the main themes of the movie, and the work done by the cast is for the most part excellent. A big surprise are the work of Hugh Jackman (Mumble's dad) and Brittany Murphy (Gloria, Mumble's best friend), who deliver not only great acting performances, but also offer remarkable singing when necessary. Murphy really being outstanding, and probably the best voice of the film right after Robin Williams, who lends his voice to two important and very different characters. Elijah Wood as Mumble and Hugo Weaving as the Elder are OK, but nothing really amazing or unexpected of their talents. The only slight disappointment is probably Nicole Kidman, and not because her performance is bad, but mainly because she doesn't really show the amazing vocals of previous singing efforts (""Moulin Rouge!"" for example).<br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" has received a lot of criticisms due to the no-so-subtle way it presents its message, to the point of being called cheap propaganda; however, I find that kind of criticism unnecessary and out of place, as ""Happy Feet"" does offer a good chance to talk and discuss the movies's inherent message with the kids, who probably will find the movie visually attractive. True, ""Happy Feet"" is a bit heavy handed on the handling of its message, but one can't deny that it still is a good attempt of telling an animated epic story with a morale behind. As it stands, ""Happy Feet"" is a really good animated movie that not only will entertain, it will raise interesting questions and discussion with the younger ones, as it treats them intelligently.<br/><br/>Since the beginning of time, fables and stories have been used to carry on messages, moral lessons, or parables; ""Happy Feet"" continues this tradition as an excellent movie that is both entertaining and intelligent, and surely will deliver good fun if seen with an open mind. The breathtaking animation and the gorgeous landscapes are really a big plus that makes this movie one of the best animated films of 2006. 8/10"
"jesse8479","10","3","4","18 December 2006"," Great Movie But..........
","We took our son to see this movie and it was wonderful movie. My son was dancing in his seat and waving his hands and signing of course. And the fact that more than one language/culture was in the movie made it more enjoyable and educational. Though the movie was a hit there is one subject or action that worried my husband, other parents who attended the same movie time as we did and myself. There was a scene in the movie where I am not going to say when but all the adults noticed and we looked at each other (it was a small theater) where some sexual positions between certain characters were displayed, not intentionally I hope. But as mentioned in the past and seen with Disney movies such as Lion King and Little Mermaid it is very sad to see that animators would draw that type of actions for a movie that is mostly for an audience of children. My son who is 6 , thank god that he does not know what it is, but its just the point they put it in. I suggest that the editors be more careful especially since children are watching this film. Now if its an adult film who cares but its not. THey should be more careful. Thank you for letting me comment."
"lassia","10","3","4","15 December 2006"," Don't Read Too Much Into It
","I thought that it was an excellent movie for children and I don't feel that it sent out any subliminal messages. I took my two young nieces to it and they really enjoyed it. But please, don't forget that this movie is for the young ones and any message I see it projecting is even though you are not like others, you are still special in your own way. Come on now, people, it's a movie for the children to enjoy, and not ALL kids are going to like ALL animated movies. I know when I was younger I didn't rave over every animated movie that came out. Let kids be kids and just enjoy the movie for what it is. Why can't the children enjoy it, or not, with their own discretion? They're just looking to watch an interesting movie that piqued their interest at some point and let them choose themselves if they like it or not. Sometimes we take things too seriously, and we all need to sit back and let things be as they are. If you don't like it, that's fine, not everyone is going to like everything out there, but you can't analyze things too closely because you won't find many things enjoyable out of life if you don't sit back and appreciate things as they are. It's just a movie."
"ah-melody","10","3","4","12 December 2006"," At last, a new animated classic
","Like most people, I went to see Happy Feet for the cuteness factor. Not only were my demands met in that regard, but I was surprised to find a high quality film, that I think will become an animated classic alongside the likes of The Lion King, Bambi, and Snow White. The Bambi comparison is the most important one here. The film, as it turns out, has a strong environmental message, which makes it much more than a cute cuddle-fest. Like Bambi, it raises awareness about the negative impact that humans can have on wildlife. In both films, the main characters must live through some extremely perilous situations, in which humans are mainly to blame. Perhaps Happy feet will inspire a new generation of environmentalists? If the environmental theme doesn't entice you, see it for the gorgeous computer animation (probably the best i've seen in a mainstream film), the wonderful characters, and the awesome music (an original song by prince!)<br/><br/>Also, Happy Feet doesn't make you gay, contrary to what some (crazy) people have said."

","Well, this film really was great! They are incredibly cute, and even though it is not completely realistic there is enough truth in it to be able to enjoy it without going ""sure"" every other minute. It is a marvelous story about being true to who you are, being tolerant, and a bit of critic towards our way of life and an appeal to us to not destroy for other inhabitants of this world. ...animals might be a lot smarter than we think... Of course this is a children's movie, so it shows reality as it is supposed to be, instead of how it truly is, but I believe that it is nice to sometimes get a look about how it is supposed to be, to give us something to strive for!"

","When Happy Feet took the Oscar for best animated film of 2006, I became extremely interested in seeing this movie. But I kept on hearing that this didn't deserve the Oscar, so I was a little scarred about seeing it, but I figured, everyone has a different opinion of what deserves what award and such. So I rented it anyways and I watched it last night, I have to say that this was such an adorable film and so much fun, why all the mean reviews? It had great animation, fun songs, and an adorable story that I'm sure anyone could enjoy.<br/><br/>On the Emporer Penguins Island, they are known for singing, not only that, but they are terrific at it, but when Mumble is born, he's a bit different, instead of being a singer, he's more of a dancer. But no one is buying it, in fact he is even sent away from the island, but he meets several penguins who are also outcasts. But there is also a bigger problem, the fish population is winding down when humans keep taking them, the penguins are starving and Mumble will try to use his tap dancing skills to communicate and save the island that has isolated him away from his friends and family.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is all in good fun, I think people really should give it another chance. Out of Cars and Monster House, I would pick this for the Oscar, but I guess I might be alone on that one. But like I said, everyone has a different opinion, but I think if you just give this movie a shot, you'll find yourself laughing and having a great time. It's a great family film, I loved the animations, the story, and the songs, they were just terrific.<br/><br/>8/10"

"madmaxmedia","8","4","6","2 January 2007"," Great imaginative feature from George Miller
","This is a great animated feature from George Miller, and displays the same energy and imagination as in his 2 BABE movies. I had read some comments about the 'environmentalist angle' and suitability for younger children, and completely disagree with these comments. My 5 year old daughter chose this movie over CHARLOTTE'S WEB, and I'm glad she did (and I'm glad I took her anyways despite the comments.) Wonderful story, first and foremost centered on Mumbles the dancing penguin (never thought I'd write that.) There's a pretty obvious story about following your heart, but it's done really well and doesn't feel by-the-numbers at all. Some have derided the environmentalist subplot, but I really don't agree. This is not about electric cars, global warming, or deforestation, it's about a dancing penguin that lives among singing penguins. It's a local story about what is happening to the penguin herd, and how the protagonist sets off to try to set things right after being unfairly blamed for the problem.<br/><br/>The resolution of the story struck me as being very whimsical as in the BABE movies (I mean that in a good way.) With all the hoopla about environmental issues, I think there is a tendency to bring outside baggage into the movie. Pro-environmentalists might see the movie as not providing any 'answers' or not being strong enough, whereas as others might ironically see the movie as being overtly pro-environmental. I guess this is understandable, but I personally loved the story.<br/><br/>What is more impressive than just the plot, is how everything is presented in the movie. George Miller and the other writers have taken many of the natural behaviors of the Emperor penguins (their breeding song, migratory behavior, caring for eggs) and dramatized them for the story. Yes, they are of course anthropomorphizing the penguins, but it is done in a particularly creative and inspired way that minimizes the Disney cuteness factor. There's a feeling of the harshness of the elements that is lacking in otherwise pretty good movies like BROTHER BEAR.<br/><br/>Some people have commented on the suitability of the movie for younger children. There is nothing overtly sexual at all in the movie. The movie shows penguins singing their 'heartsongs' to try to attract a mate. I can perhaps see how some scenes might be construed as 'sexist', but the scenes worked for me because, well, that's what Emperor penguins do. And ultimately the movie's main message on this is about finding your soul-mate by finding your kindred heartsong. Anything else is really just played for laughs.<br/><br/>Finally, the animation is absolutely top notch. Some scenes are very close to photo-realistic. More importantly, the art direction is great throughout. I loved the wide shots showing the entire penguin herd. And of course, great dance numbers. Music plays a large role in this movie, and they do a great job of characterizing the penguins that are otherwise not very physically expressive- the penguins are drawn pretty realistically, so they don't have too much in the way of facial expressions.<br/><br/>Speaking of characterization, the voice characterizations are great as well (as was also the case in BABE PIG IN THE CITY). Very effective and entertaining, without getting too overly cute (Robin Williams is borderline but is otherwise very funny.)"
"julest1","10","4","6","27 December 2006"," Outstanding in every way
","Whether you have children or not, this is a treat. The makers use the latest technology to the full (and the results are stunning) but they never let visuals or a stunning soundtrack overwhelm a proper hero story, possibly the best pure example I've seen since the era of Luke Skywalker and Indiana Jones. Most of the excellent characters have believable arcs and overall the pacing, twists and message are just right. I wanted to know what was going to happen next so much that I know I missed a lot that to savour in the unbelievably rich, credible (if tap-dancing penguins can be described as credible!) and detailed animation - and in the truly awe inspiring soundtrack, which was clearly created by a team of music-loving technical geniuses with a great sense of humour. I want to see it again immediately to appreciate all this properly.<br/><br/>I intend to buy it as soon as it's on DVD - it's a must-have family film that for me beats every other CG animation bar Shrek and Toy Story into a cocked hat (even Finding Nemo, Ice Age and Monsters Inc, good though they are, are not in this league). Like Shrek and Toy Story it doesn't fall into the tedious trap of working painfully obviously on two levels to keep the adults happy - it is just so fabulous that it engages everyone completely, whatever their age.<br/><br/>Oh, and my children (aged 8 and 12) loved it too."

"Aznsmack27","1","17","39","26 November 2006"," I thought it was a pretty bad film
","I watched the movie today with a group of friends... and i thought it was a pretty bad film, which was geared towards adults more than kids. The film's advertising made it seem like it would be a fun movie with dancing & singing penguins, but I couldn't help but feel deceived when I the movie ended.<br/><br/>The movie was visually appealing (at some points I wasn't able to distinguish whether it was CGI or real filming... except for the ending where you can clearly tell they pasted in the dancing men in red outfits.) But visually, I thought it was pretty good.<br/><br/>The plot made sense in a way, but it did not need to be that long of a movie. And the ending seemed somewhat random and didn't flow to well with the whole movie. Too often it felt like the storyline was dragging and there were a lot underlying themes you wouldn't want your children to grow up on. For example there was a lot of racial humor I would not want my kid's to think was okay. The film uses skewed stereotype(which is sadly becoming more acceptable nowadays) to make a lot of their jokes.<br/><br/>Here are just a few stereotypes that the movie uses:<br/><br/>That Italians are oppressive and violent and viewed as typical Mobsters. (I don't even know why they put an Italian voice behind the hawks, they could have easily removed that.) That Hispanics/Chicanos are in large groups and act randomly, talk really fast etc.. That blacks (Lovelace) are religious and hypocritical at the same time That they also pick up a lot of women. That Christianity or religion in general is bad/old/supercritical/cause your parents not to love you if you were different.<br/><br/>I did like the way the movie wanted you to think outside your own little bubble in life but if you notice the racism/stereotypical humor, sexual oriented (more than a few times) lines and bad flow of storyline thats behind the whole film then I don't recommend it(especially if your a parent with kids watching). My friends and I left the movie theater with a very bad feeling, reflecting over the fact that we wasted $7.50 and 2 hours of our life. Note: 1 of them is a grade school teacher and the another babysits kids, both thought the movie was very bad and they also thought it was too adult for the kids to enjoy. I thought it was a very bad film too and I've worked with hundreds of kids. (Another Note: The kids in the AMC theatre laughed less than the adults and the adults didn't laugh much) <br/><br/>The best way I could describe the film is that it's kind of like reading a very very VERY bad version of Animal Farm (FYI I think A. Farm is a great book) to your kids. Just because there are a bunch of cute animals that do things like people, doesn't mean you should show it to them at such a young age. I don't recommend this film at all and quite honestly I don't think this movie should get a score higher than upper 5's.<br/><br/>And also, I thought it was amusing that they would have Robin Williams do the Latino and Black impersonations. yea... it's pretty sad that they would do that."
"guerrosos","4","7","13","8 December 2006"," Loved Music, Hated Movie
","Am I the only person in this country that didn't like this movie? I loved the music though. But the plot was just so, I'm looking for a word...let me think...idiotic. After watching ""March of the Penguins"" and suffering with the penguins ****spoiler**** a lost egg is lost, period not ""rescued yet born with a defect"". I thought that there was no need to explain Mumbo's problem, like any kid that is born with a defect. Why was he/she born like that? Well, we don't know, period. I thought that would've been more intelligent. I couldn't stand Nicole Kidman's voice trying to emulate Marilyn Monroe and Hugh Jackman (a man that I fantasize about, that's how much I like the guy) talking like Elvis, I wanted to rip him off the screen. The only good thing about this movie are the Mexican penguins, those are worth a spin off. Lots of laughs there! Out of nowhere, it appears that the penguin community is really mean to Mumbo, the weirdo guy who can't sing and has not molted (which I thought was done only to make him look cute as all the penguins look exactly the same, and let me tell you, animated penguins do not translate well with this technology, they're pretty much ugly) because somebody is eating their fish and Mumbo decides that he can save the world and the whole thing turns into the ""Iron Penguin"" with his transmitter and all. Uuuggghhh. Fortunately I had seen Flushed Away a couple of days before and was able to overlook this ""faux pas"" and forgive Jackman."
"hamlet2b","8","7","13","24 November 2006"," happy feet and appreciating difference
","Happy Feet may not please some fundamentalists. Its underlying message is to question orthodoxy, oppose the hierarchical paternalistic church and deity, and to embrace diversity. The message is delivered deftly and some of our more somnolent brethren may not pick up on the ""subversive"" message. Mumble is just not ""penguin"", and is shunned as a sinner, despite being born ""that way"". He tries to change but he can't. His mother wants to accept him the way he his, but his father sides with authority to shun his son. Sound like anything? What's another word for ""happy""?<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning in IMAX and I highly recommend seeing it in that format. Robin Williams shines in all his roles. A great film for the whole,""accepting"" family."

Egarly sharing my you-tube clips with anyone who would watch them, and gushing like a 11 year old girl at my husband saying I simply ""HAD TO HAVE A STUFFED BABY MUMBLES""....<br/><br/>That changed about 45 minutes into this movie.

Yes they have the cute little dancing episodes, but that was severely MINOR in the story line.<br/><br/>This movie mis-represented itself and severely ruined my experiences as a whole.<br/><br/>Please understand this.

","While most seem to like the surprising issues confronted in this movie, it mostly seemed to spoil it for me, seeing as all I knew about it beforehand was that there was a bunch of dancing penguins, which isn't just borderline silly. There was absolutely no way I could take it seriously. So when the darker story played out, It was as if someone had set up a knock-knock joke, in which the joke is that my mother had died. Of course, should you be interested in this movie, remember that it's not the silly penguiny dance-fest that the previews make it out to be. It was really expectations that ruined it for me, but if you go not expecting a lighthearted, purely silly anthropomorphism of the penguin species, then the film won't ruin your mood."

Instead, it was just a visually appealing cartoon that bored my grandkids and was a disjointed waste of time and money. They would have preferred to see Cars (I never saw) or Nemo again. The movie took a long time to really get started and then had about 20 minutes that looked promising but never delivered. Perhaps I was expecting too much (I was hoping for a ""Nemo"") but my grandchildren, ages 5 and 6, happiest moments were just before the movie started when they were all excited about the dancing penguins and when the credits rolled up so they could go home. I know it's not working when the boys ask me if this is going to be over soon. In all honestly, I like it much better than they did. And I mainly liked part of it because I was impressed with the CG.

","No, this probably wasn't the worst film of 2006, but I'm quite sure that it claims the prize for ""worst animated film"" of the year. Of course, I still haven't seen BARNYARD or THE ANT BULLY. Granted, if I can say that FLUSHED AWAY and CARS were the two best cartoon films to hit theaters this year, that's saying something about the diminishing quality of animation these days. But I digress.<br/><br/>There's no point in summarizing HAPPY FEET, as I'm sure you already know what's it's about. What you probably don't know, as most of the big time film critics haven't mentioned, is that this film is pretty boring and bland. Make no mistake, director George Miller wants his audience to know that he is more an artist than a filmmaker, and the first 15 minutes of HAPPY FEET will draw you in with some beautiful scenes and intriguing musical sequences. Unfortunately, the quality of pic loses momentum when it becomes evident that no real plot is being established. This film is just an endless string of characters, song-and-dance numbers, chase scenes, etc. While the computer animation is above average, there is much left to be desired in that there is virtually no variation in color, just different degrees of blacks and whites.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure who the target audience of this film is, but I can safely say that it is not little children, as there were some intense and frightening scenes involving a leopard seal and two killer whales. It's important to note that the point of said scenes remains unclear, as they were simply temporary conflicts with no real purpose to the ""story"". I'm also unsure what the message of this film was. There were blatant racial overtones as well as those concerning religion, conformity, and environmental conservation. Um, a little too much for a film about a tap-dancing penguin, don't you think? If you're looking for quality film-making, look elsewhere. If you're looking for mindless matinée entertainment, I also advise you to look elsewhere. However, if you're hoping to find an hour and forty minutes of visually and emotionally unstimulated and incoherent scenes involving lots of indistinguishable penguins, HAPPY FEET may be for you."

"MartianOctocretr5","6","6","12","19 November 2006"," Playful premise marred by some unnecessary content
","Happy Feet starts out good natured and upbeat. The characters are very well defined, and likable. The storyline breezes along with lots of fun action at the outset, but the movie stumbles badly in the latter stages.<br/><br/>It's a typical story about a misfit, who, through good will, resourcefulness, and perseverance, endeavors to prove himself and win acceptance. In a community of a species of penguins who select mates through singing, the hero of the story, appropriately named Mumbles, has about as much singing talent as William Hung, although he dances like Fred Astaire. Unfortunately, dancing is verboten to these penguins. The food supply of fish is diminishing mysteriously, and our hero hears legends of aliens who may be responsible for the problem. He embarks on a mission to learn the truth, and encounters a variety of oddball characters and adventures on his quest.<br/><br/>The obligatory comic relief characters turn out to be a bunch of small penguins with East L.A. accents who are very funny and amiable; their leader is voiced by Robin Williams, who voices this and two other roles very well. Best strengths of the movie are the wide variety of music styles, and superior animation technique.<br/><br/>The results of what Mumbles learns involves some adult political issues that will go right over children's heads, and possibly bore them. Cheap shots are taken at various religious and political beliefs. The collision between the story's exaggerated and silly fun with a sudden diversion to overly stark matters is awkward and unnerving for the audience.<br/><br/>In summary, the first half of the film sticks to the kind of amusing fun you'd expect from the title, the latter part of the movie delves into serious matters that don't fit here. OK for a one time family viewing, but not on a level with similarly toned movies like Finding Nemo."
"fdog9","10","4","7","6 December 2006"," Glenn Beck and Michael Medved are idiots
","More proof conservatives are a joke.....its a dancing penguin movie guys....lighten up Conservatives attack animated penguin movie, Happy Feet, as global-warming propaganda Cultural conservatives, led by CNN's Glenn Beck, Fox News' Neil Cavuto, and syndicated talk-show host Michael Medved, have all criticized Happy Feet, the new Warner Bros. animated movie about Mumble, the tap-dancing penguin, because they say the movie is laced with liberal overtones and tries to ""indoctrinate"" children. Specifically, conservatives claim the movie is pushing a global-warming agenda. Yet the film makes no references to global warming. Instead, the movie's conservationist subplot revolves around Mumble's attempt to combat man-made pollution and overfishing in his quest to help his fellow penguins. The blockbuster movie, which has already earned more than $100 million in U.S. ticket sales, is silent regarding the issue of global warming.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, Cavuto and Beck, who referred to the film as ""propaganda,"" both complained that the movie amounts to ""an animated version of An Inconvenient Truth,"" a reference to former Vice President Al Gore's critically acclaimed documentary about the threats posed by global warming. Cavuto said that while viewing Happy Feet, he ""half-expected to see an animated version of Al Gore pop up."" Cavuto also stated that he found the movie ""offensive"" and asked whether it pushed ""a far-left message."" Medved, who is also a professional film critic, complained in a November 17 entry on his Townhall.com web log that ""the propagandistic theme suggests that the biggest menace for the lovable penguins is the human race -- stealing the fish on which the birds depend, or ruining planet earth through pollution and global warming."" Medved also claims the movie has a subtle gay theme as well.<br/><br/>None of the commentators supplied any examples from the movie to support their allegation that Happy Feet pushes a liberal, global-warming agenda. In fact, no scenes from the movie mention the issue. Happy Feet is void of any global-warming references, there are no obvious allusions to it, and global warming is not one of the movie's themes. Global warming plays no part in the film."
"Quinoa1984","10","7","15","22 November 2006"," what Mad Max/The Road Warrior was to the action/exploitation picture, Happy Feet is to the animated family/comedy/musical: Miller's back!
","Wow, was all I had to say after leaving this movie. I mention the director, George Miller, in the opening one line because it's of note, at least in my line of thinking, to notice where the bending-genre-conventions comes from for Happy Feet. We have seen this, to be sure, in the Babe pictures, where a pig went to great lengths to show that he was more than what his environment defined himself as. But there's even the sense of the outsider coming to save the day, against all odds, ala Mad Max in those crazy Australian films. And, like all of those previous works, Happy Feet actually works, very well, and not just for one set. Going into it maybe my expectations weren't too high, despite seeing Miller's name on the credits- his first directing a practically all-animated (computer no less, in a time where it's as common as bugs in a tree stump)- because seeing commercials I thought it would just be another cute kids movie. It also has penguins, which I thought would be sort of appealing, and the possibility that Robin Williams might finally get some good voice time in more than one role. Boy does he ever, but the film has much more for its whole audience, including even some political commentary amid the wild comedy and set pieces.<br/><br/>What I ended up getting was some kind of bizarre, unique hybrid of the central concept of Dumbo (the loner cast-aside from his world, has to use his individuality, likely an influence of the Babe pictures), the jukebox mania of something akin to Moulin Rouge, the facts and environment of March of the Penguins (to be sure, as one can't separate one without the other), and even current events. We get the story of Mumble (Babe voice EG Daily, and Elijah Wood), who is born from an Elvis impresario (Hugh Jackman) and a supportive mother (Nicole Kidman), in a world where all the penguins sing, not just for mating but for some kind of right to live and hunt for fish. Mumble, however, can only dance, fantastically (in style via Savion Glover behind the scenes), but it doesn't sit well with Noah (Hugo Weaving), head of the elder penguins. He's first cast out by his fellow penguins for not fitting in, and being a terrible singer. He meets up with outsider penguins (headed by Ramon, voice by Williams, in one of the roles), and tries to appeal back to the group of penguins- knowing that aliens are involved somewhere. But when he's rejected again, even more harshly, his journey to find the aliens goes on, which leads to...<br/><br/>Oh, what's the use. To go on about the plot would be fruitless, but you might get the idea from reading this how silly the movie sounds- at first. But I think Miller and his team are going for a smart ridiculous spirit, one that is actually successfully irreverent for all ages, which is one of the toughest things that any filmmaker can try for. Even tougher is to see Robin Williams tackle roles and actually succeed comically. But it's his best, most rip-roaringly hilarious (and I don't use the former term lightly) performance since Aladdin. He goes between a solemn narrator, Ramon the penguin, and Lovelace, the possible link to everything with the 'aliens'. The musical side of things could be a challenge too, as it is in the Moulin Rouge mode of not being at all original-songs, but done in an extreme, over-the-top manner with the visuals. Imagine dozens and dozens of penguins singing ""Somebody to Love"" by Queen, sounds risky, but it actually works, well. In fact, Happy Feet does what Moulin Rouge did better than that film actually went for- it's a pop-culture shake-up for characters who see humans as aliens, most especially due to a lack of food.<br/><br/>But then there's even the touch of political commentary, which is most surprising. It would be one thing to have an over the top fantasy comedy with bits of romance thrown in (and there's even some genre-breaking with what ends up between Mumble and Gloria), but it's another to be making a kind of underlying point to it all that while lost on the kids won't be lost to some in the audience. This is even something that goes back to the Road Warrior, only here it's perhaps not as explicit- one could read into the 'leader' penguins who cast out Mumble with his 'outsider' friends who are not at all like the others, or the significance when Mumble finally comes back from his self-imposed mission, as being like the now- and the control over what the fish does to the group. But that's only a side-bar- however interesting- for what's really appealing about Happy Feet. It's unexpectedly, even outrageously in its silly way, funny, and it's based totally on the characters, and building on it how ridiculous- yet within the logic of the picture believable- how singing/dancing penguins can be in this world.<br/><br/>Too often, especially in 2006, the slew of computer-animated movies for kids that just don't seem appealing. Granted, I'm not a tot anymore, but just on the level of anything in the subject matter being anything more than 'hey, they're animals, they make stupid jokes, its worth it' is lost on me. Happy Feet stands above all the other animated pictures of this year, including Pixar's work, by delivering truly successfully excitement and absurdity in equal measure, while not doing so to a lower common denominator. I can't wait to recommend this to most of the people I know, and they're not even kids. Miller- welcome to the 21st century!"

There was better this year, but 'Happy Feet' is okay.<br/><br/>In 'Happy Feet' we are given front row seats to the birth and growth of a penguin by the name of Mumble who is voiced by Elijah Wood. He's different from all the other penguins. In a world where finding your ""heartsong"" is crucial, poor Mumble isn't able to keep a tune at all. Interestingly enough though, he can dance up a storm. Unfortunately this is frowned upon and ends up causing him great distress. Eventually the elder penguin Noah, who is voiced by Hugo Weaving, accuses Mumble of bringing on the famine that is currently afflicting the penguins. Mumble attempts to explain that he believes ""aliens"" are the real cause. Noah doesn't take him seriously at all and banishes him, claiming that once he is gone, the famine will end. Mumbles then promises that he will return, and when he does he will bring proof that the alleged ""aliens"" are to blame. He then embarks on his journey where along the way he makes some new friends and learns the world outside his own is much different than he could have ever thought possible.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Happy Feet' is amazing. Almost every landscape down to the smallest icicle look so very real. Even the penguins themselves are highly detailed, but obviously aren't real. Aside from that and the direction from Greg Miller, everything presented in 'Happy Feet' is just okay. Nothing in it evokes a wholehearted wow. The plot itself takes what seems forever to be revealed. There's a forty five minute wait before anything about a famine is even mentioned. Watching the film is a lot like riding a roller coaster. No, I don't mean its a thrill ride. The way the story is set up, it goes up and down. Each time it begins to drag, something comes along to get it going again. And when the ending finally comes, it appears forced. The whole addition of an environmental issue still has me wondering. I guess because without it there would be nothing for Mumble to do on his journey of discovery.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with 'Happy Feet' though revolves around the music. Yes, I know it's a musical, but he music seemed to really exceed the film itself. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. The reason being is because the films suggests that there actually is a real story behind it all. Either way, it doesn't really matter because it's the singing and dancing that will have people returning to see it all again. So despite having some assuredly bad qualities 'Happy Feet' does indeed have its moments. It does what it was supposed to, and that's entertain."
"castlemshelties","1","9","21","27 November 2006"," Horrible movie for any age!
","This movie was horrible from start to finish. The penguins were awkward in character and in their actions. Deadpan songs with no warmth at all between the characters. I took kids from 6 to 15 and they were actually hoping the lion seal would end it all in a bloody slaughter by the end of the movie. It was boring, plot less, and just lacked a central story line that made us care about the Penguins. The commercials for this contain every single drop of cute that they could squeeze out of this bomb. This is the second kids movie in six months that just wasn't worth watching, even for free at home on my own television...much less for the cost of seeing it at the theater. I advise anyone to NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY. I saw it in a packed theater and all anyone could say as they were walking out was ""HORRIBLE""."

","I recently got to watch this movie. I've been counting down to see it for about 80 days or so, I was extremely excited for it, so I came into the movie with high expectations. Did the movie reach my expectations? No. Almost? No not really.<br/><br/>First of all I would like to say I loved the cuteness of this movie. The way the penguins went along with their jokes and looks was adorable. That is the part of the movie I loved and just because of it I will go see it a few more times. Also the animation was beautiful except for in a few spots I could tell they didn't give it their best to make it look as great as they could, but no ones perfect are they?<br/><br/>But now what I didn't like about this movie. The plot was kind of bad. I'm assuming what the producer was trying to do is put as many big names into the movie to try and make us forget about the plot. But if you do pay attention to it, it's not the greatest, it's actually a disappointment.<br/><br/>Next I don't know why but I didn't really like their choices in music. Like in the trailers I thought I would have loved it, I thought it would have been amazing but it also disappointed me. Some of the songs are kind of rusty and not performed as well as I was expecting.<br/><br/>Overall this movie really didn't live up to my expectations for it, but there were some parts I really did enjoy about this movie so I will see it maybe....2 or 3 more times."

Talk about bait and switch! You would have no idea from looking at the ads that the second half was nothing more than an Al Gore screed denouncing people and their polluting ways. Ugh! It was ""An Inconvenient Truth Lite"".<br/><br/>If you are looking for a fun film for your child to enjoy, rent Shrek, or Toy Story 2, or The Incredibles.

Including my four year old son. The movie is eerie at times because of how real some scenery looks. Very well made movie and ORIGINAL.

","I did not like this movie. My toddler cousin enjoyed the previews that played more than the actual movie we paid for. There were a few laughs, but just way too much going on while, at the same time, nothing really happened. Way too long; kids were crying and asking if it was over when it was only at the halfway mark. It seemed way too politically correct and ""socially acceptable"" for a children's movie; they don't worry about that stuff! I would have loved to have walked out if the tickets weren't so much. The mother (Norma Jean) cleverly bringing back a glimpse of Marilyn Monroe (the voice was obnoxious; I love Nicole Kidman, but do not like hearing Marilyn Monroe speak) was irritating and pointless.<br/><br/>Might have been better if they focused more on the baby penguins; they were cute."

","I took my 7 year old to see this film. The seal sequence scared her with its violence and ferocious attack on the penguin. The movie wasn't funny, it wasn't happy, and just the opposite it was pretty depressing. I didn't like the sexual references that all the penguins kept making. I found the representation of the Hispanic penguins to be offensive (they all spoke like a cross between a bad Ricky Ricardo impersonator and working men on a job site with references to women). It was long and boring. My daughter didn't get where the movie was going, she didn't laugh at all throughout the movie and covered her eyes in several parts because it scared her. Then it goes into this long drawn out public service announcement about how the ""aliens"" are evil and gobbling up everything. Then the whole UN story, my daughter didn't understand any of that. She didn't understand the parts where the penguin in the zoo goes crazy either. Totally lost. I think the reason they called it happy feet was to mislead people into thinking it was a happy go lucky kids movie. As I remember, the only trailer I ever saw for it was the 5 penguins singing ""My Way""... Don't waste your money or your time. If you want to teach your kids about conservation then sit down with them and teach them...don't think this movie is going to trigger anything in them! Hollywood needs to go back to making REAL kids movies. If parents won't take their kids to a movie for the sole sake of spending time with their kids then parents are to blame...Hollywood should not be trying to put adult situations into kids movies to get more adults to take their kids to the movies and sell more tickets."

Why would such a travesty be beating Casino Royale, easily the best film of the year? Because children are stupid and they have no taste. Parents stop taking your kids to see this and go see Casino Royale or rent Saw III. Now that's entertainment. Movies like this are the reason why kids are so dumb.

Issues such as immigration, segregation, and religious influence in politics. Thou it is not a popular opinion with the group of friends I saw the movie with, I feel that children should not be exposed to such themes nor should they be exploited to push political issues.

","The first half was so great! My daughter loved the previews and clapped/danced/smiled throughout the entire first half.

From that point on there were exactly three lessons that the movie taught: 1) Religion = ignorance + stupidity + intolerance, 2) Everything humans do = evil, and 3) Seaworld and/or zoos = evil. If only they woulda kept the politics out it would have been a great movie. I'm all for environmentalist movies, like An Inconvenient Truth...just don't disguise them as movies for little kids."

Also, the movie is sort of cute (I actually chuckled two different times, too) in a childish sort of way. However, it all completely falls apart near the end when, well, it becomes abundantly clear that the movie is primarily a propaganda piece, using the technique of personification of animals to evoke guilt and the compulsion to turn responsibility and control of environmental issues over to ""them"". Watch for the UN logo to flash quickly before your eyes in the last part of the movie.<br/><br/>There is a great message in the movie, though: we don't have to change ANYTHING about our marine harvesting habits until we see the penguins dance!"

It's about our relationship with nature, art, the human spirit, and that which is beyond us (perhaps all films, or works of art can be, but this one does it well, and I happened to notice that). All in all, a great movie! Definitely one of my favorites, if not my favorite.

","I was amazed to find myself seeing a 21st-century equivalent to The Lion King. Happy Feet is a milestone in animation, and the music chosen for this movie was something for 60's and 70's children. The storyline was a classic; an outcast who won't give up or conform when life gets rough. Each character had personality, and even though they looked similar, each penguin has his/her own distinctive characteristics. From hilarity to tragedy to suspense to in minutes, I loved every minute of Happy Feet. Staying true to the tag-line, Happy Feet was one of the few movies nowadays which not only cause toe- tapping, but tap dancing, all the way out of the cinema."

Instead, what I got was one of the most engaging, enjoyable, thought-provoking and visually astounding films since ""The Lion King"". The characters are believable, the absolute cutting-edge animation makes it seem like you're watching actual penguins at times, and the story provoked feelings I never thought I'd have during a movie about dancing and singing penguins.<br/><br/>Not only that, but it also has a globally-relevant message attached to the whole thing, making Mumble a character who tells us that we can be ourselves and change the world at the same time.

","So what is Disney's deep message here? Children, if you have something which makes you different from your peers, you'll have to learn to exploit it. OH, but that's ONLY once you have NO other choice. Happy faces will greet your happy feet, so dance, dance, dance and be as cute a penguin can be. Certainly children should be taught to know that pleasing your captors is THE most important thing in life sends a great message. Captors rule. Remember that Disney taught you this, so it must be true. Can anyone come up with any other message--excepting the other obvious underlying sexual message?! A five year old picked up why the dancing was important--and it was not to be cute and alternatively attractive. Bambi's Mother dying couldn't beat this--that, however sadly, had a moral. Old Yeller getting rabies and then shot rates up there, but at least it too had a reason, a grim reality of life. This is the worst Disney movie ever."

I really regret spending money on this when I could've been home watching hockey or ranting incoherently about other movies I hate on IMDb's poorly structured message boards.<br/><br/>The fact that the commercial says ""Novembuuurrrr"" takes away all the limited credit this movie doesn't have. Seriously, if you're thinking of going to see this, pick up a video game controller or a shot gun and do something useful with your time.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 0/10, but since IMDb does not allow for this, I'd give it a 1/10.

","So I'm going to this movie called Happy Feet, and all I know about it is that its about a penguin that can tap dance and it features the voice talent of Robin Williams. Now how could anybody, with that given information, not have high hopes? Actually my hopes weren't all that high, but I still really wanted to see it.<br/><br/>As I left the theater, I had no choice but to scratch my head. Hard. What was it exactly that I just saw? On one hand, it was one of the most beautifully animated movies I've ever seen. On the other hand, what exactly was this movie about? I mean seriously, it had like nine themes it was trying to explore, each offering their own moral. One minute, we're talking about a penguin trying to find his voice(literally)in a communisitic society of antarctic poultry, then all of the sudden we're addressing environmental issues via a gang of albatross..es (albatrossi?). And if that wasn't enough, I felt a definite vibe of ""screw you conservative religious people""..ism with the elder penguins kind of being jerks about everything.<br/><br/>Whatever the message was, it was about as subtle as the kool aid drink busting down a wall. *OH YEAHHHHHHHHHH IM THE MESSAGE!!!! BUT I Don't KNOW WHAT I AM!!!!!!* On a more serious note, I am just going to go ahead and say I did not like this movie. The plot was, on all accounts, not original at all. Not even a little bit. There were no villains, even though they introduced like three potential ones. I was really hoping for some original music, since no one makes musical cartoons anymore, but alas, I was stuck with an hour and a half music video for a half dozen r&b artists featuring penguins. There were about 5 too many dance/musical sequences, and they really didn't further the story. The way it went was that they'd have a sequence of music and dance, then the penguins would stop and take a breather, agree on a time and place for the next day, then go on with the story.<br/><br/>Robin Williams was funny. Way funnier than he was in Robots. If he wasn't in this movie, I would not have liked it at all.<br/><br/>After all that's said and done, I still like penguins, and I still like Robin Williams. This movie was not bad enough to ruin my taste for either of those things, but I'm waiting for the next Lion King."

","Something that has bothered me about some movies like happy feet is that they're assumed to be for kids. Sure, kids wouldn't mind seeing dancing penguins, but that doesn't mean the movie makers were about to limit themselves to topics only kids would understand. As a teen, I loved this movie, and themes that may have disturbed kids seemed more important. The darker theme of the environement issue is going to be this generation's problem. It's not something any kid should be hidden from. The movie had plenty enough happy to balance the weighty issue, and it ended on a hopeful note. In no way should it be denied to the eyes of children, or limited to them. It is a movie for all ages, showing the good with the bad, happy and sad, and a misfit hero who tries to fix it all with the universality of dancing. The graphics are stunning also. If only more people had happy feet"

The influence of March of the Penguins is obvious, and the underwater scenes are so impressive you could easily forget this is a cartoon.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film tries to make up for its less than original story with several cutesy song and dance routines. Don't get me wrong. The song and dance routines were fun to watch. I will probably never forget Memphis' impersonation of Elvis. <br/><br/>But it seemed after a while the music was there to ensure this is a full length movie. While the characters are very likable, the story could have used more development. Mumble's short life with humans was pretty disjointed and not very believable. Better, methinks, it might have been if Mumble could have bonded with one at arms length than through a piece of glass.

"bbSouthstreet","10","4","8","18 November 2006"," The Best Animated Musical in Years
","The 90s was the decade when animated musicals were prominent in the movie theaters. Disney being the highest of them all in the animated musicals business, with immortal films, such as Beauty and the Beast, Aladdin, The Little Mermaid and Hercules and Don Bluth with his less popular films, All Dogs Go to Heaven, Rock-a-Doodle and Anastasia. After the year 1999, the last animated musical to appear in theaters was Disney's Tarzan and all other animated films to follow would be straight dialogue with a few songs by popular celebrities, i.e. Wynona Jud's rendition of ""Burning Love"" in Lilo and Stitch. Happy Feet brings back the days when animated musicals flowed into movie theaters like wine. Not only that but with the miracle of motion capture, the technique used in The Polar Express and Monster House, we get the most visually amazing tap dancing since Gene Kelly. <br/><br/>Many people feel that a movie is ruined by over casting, which is when they get big shot celebrities to be in the film. In actuality, the film would not be the same without all these celebrity actors for they have that prestige and presence when they come on the screen. Elijah Wood brings the shy charm to our hero Mumble, Brittany Murphy brings to us her hidden talent of singing to the screen as the beautiful Gloria, Hugh Jackman gives us the best Elvis-esquire performance since Jim Carrey in Man on the Moon as Memphis, Nicole Kidman gives us a sensual feel to the sweet hearted mama Norma Jean, Hugo Weaving is back with his dramatic force as the hard headed and tradition oriented Noah the Elder and, get this, as if this wasn't enough we have Robin Williams brining his brand of funny to the egotistical Ramon the lead penguin in a Latino gang of Adelie penguins and the all knowing sham of a guru Lovelace. The story is very familiar to E.B. White's The Trumpet of the Swan, being that is about a community of birds that must sing to find a mate and one who uses unique method to find their true love. But the story doesn't matter, what matters is that everybody can relate and will enjoy the story. I'm happy to say that both parents and children will fall in love with the story of finding your place, following your goals and loving all the things that make you unique. Kids will love the adorable antics of Baby Mumble, voiced by E.G. Daily, and parents will love all the songs from long ago and the frenetic humor of Robin Williams, singing a Spanish rendition of Sinatra's My Way. Of course, the story becomes tense near the end and may be too frightening for the little ones but I can name a lot of films that were dark and not as innocent as the advertisements make them out to be. But thanks to the good people at the MPAA we have them giving us a PG rating that basically says, ""Children 7 and up will most likely be less shocked."" <br/><br/>Finally,the best part of the movie is, of course what I addressed before, the songs. Unfortunately, there are no original songs by award song writers like Alan Menken or Danny Elfman, but I ask you, did Moulin Rouge have original songs besides Come What Way? Much like Moulin Rouge, the film has creative renditions of songs from back in the day, including Elvis's Heartbreak Hotel, Queen's Somebody to Love, The Beach Boys' Do it Again and A Mi Manera, translated to My Way. Many great songs used in marvelous musical numbers that's just too extraordinary to feel like being in a Broadway theater. You'll feel like you're at a rock concert, with all these songs recreated for an awesome experience.<br/><br/>The best way to spend time with the family is not to take them to a movie made just for kids, but by taking to them to a film that everyone will enjoy. Take them to see Happy Feet for the wonderful cast, the awesome music and the story that will melt your heart, despite it being set in the coldest place on Earth. Seeing this film will have kids being like Stevie Wonder, wishing those days would come back once more, when animated musicals run rampant through the movie theaters."

In that contempt, ""Happy Feet"" is a failure as an animated movie, and as a children's movie.<br/><br/>A really good children's movie, a really good animated movie, and/or a really good movie about the natural world MUST do this one thing: it must create an alternate world that makes you forget other worlds you've ever been part of.<br/><br/>Disney classics like ""Snow White,"" ""Bambi,"" and ""Pinocchio"" create their own worlds, their own aesthetic. They aren't imitations of other works of art; other works of art imitate *them.* These films, in creating their own worlds, become touchstones. We talk about deer as ""Bambi."" For example, when states try to cull deer populations, politicians say, ""Voters don't want us to shoot Bambi."" <br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" does not create its own world. It is a cheap, plastic knock-off of grade B movies, television sitcoms, and commercials we've seen a zillion times before. How many times have you heard someone do a really bad Elvis Presley imitation, as Hugh Jackman does in his voicing of his character? How many times have you heard a woman do a bad Marilyn Monroe imitation, as Nicole Kidman does? And -- Robin Williams? Doing tacky ethnic schtick? Does the world really need more of that? <br/><br/>""Happy Feet's"" humor is drawn from ethnic stereotyping. The ""bad"" penguins are white Southerners -- I guess -- thus Aussie Hugh Jackman's bogus Southern accent. The ""good"" penguins are barrio Hispanics. These Hispanic penguins are so stereotypical you expect them to be depicted costumed as Lou Diamond Philips in ""Stand and Deliver,"" or ""La Bamba"" and driving low-rider cars.<br/><br/>The point - if this movie really loved and cared about nature, its humor and its interest would be drawn from real penguins' real lives. This shouldn't be so hard to do -- who hasn't laughed or been touched while observing penguins in a zoo? But the movie just slips penguin costumes over stereotypical urban Hispanic Americans. So much for nature.<br/><br/>""March of the Penguins,"" 2005's brilliant documentary, transported viewers to a completely different world -- the world of penguins of Antarctica. For the moments that I was watching that film, I felt completely apart from modern America. That's because that movie was really about penguins, not ethnic stereotypes in penguin costumes.<br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" drags penguins and Antarctica down to the level of a slum and uses rehashed ethnic humor to amuse its audience. The film has no faith that any authentic depiction of penguins or Antarctica would interest anyone.<br/><br/>There are horror scenes that are much too intense for young children. The main character, a defenseless ball of penguin fluff named ""Mumble,"" is drawn practically in the mouths of predatory skua and seals. I'm an adult, and I found these scenes hard to watch.<br/><br/>Grant the film this: the animation is superb. The film's beautiful images, though, can't rescue its desperate plot."

","A cute penguin, a gift for dancing, how can you go wrong? Just ask Hollywood. If I can be first in line to help limit the harvesting of fish that will help species in the polar regions, help with pollution, I'd be glad to do that. But to take my child to a movie that has to contain such horrors just to get a message out that will never be heard by politicians or industry seems like a waste. When I went in, I figured the moral message would be acceptance of differences, which is an important and good message, when all was said and done, it was hard to tell which soapbox the director was trying to leave in your mind, including something about whether we're driving animals insane by placing them in aquariums. I want my child to learn important life lessons, I'm just not ready for her to know how terrible and greedy industry can be, especially if we're not given any information on how to help fix the problem.

","You can parse this into three bits I think.<br/><br/>The first is what people normally see, the story. Miller and many of the Oz New Wave don't pay much attention to this. They put something there of course, otherwise we would get distracted. Here it is an amazingly clever fold, referencing another movie ""Flight of the Penguins."" Now as it happens, I really disliked that movie. It was cast as a documentary, but was really an exercise in making these animals ""human."" Its a bit disgusting and something of the ultimate in human-centrism. We turn these birds into performers for us.<br/><br/>Miller grabs this and turns it on itself. The story has penguins in crisis because of human- caused environmental damage. They are saved because we think them cute. Literally at the end, we have the makers of that earlier film arriving at the end and capturing their cute human mannerisms. Our environmentalist urges are largely just refactored racial superiority.<br/><br/>If we just had that one component this would be worthwhile, but he goes a step further by making these birds yet more human in the way they perform for us. Like a million Judy Garlands on speed, they get their whole identity from performance. This provides an opportunity for a narrative complication: the priests of one performance religion holding against another. Its a pretty sweet and intelligent notion.<br/><br/>We literally have humans as birds. We have the voices as usual. By an accident of technology, we accept this readily. The relatively new idea is the motion. Cinematic grammar is primarily about motion, presence and absence of light, motion and environment.<br/><br/>Miller's cool idea has us working with novel motion in two ways.<br/><br/>The first is in motion of the objects. We see birds, but they move as humans. Its all human motion, both in normal and performance mode. We used to call this rotoscoping and it involved tracing a film. Now we do it with digital rigging and captured kinematics, but it is the same idea we had with Betty Boop's dreamfolk whose movements are Cab Calloway's. Its nice enough for us to fall into the trap Miller sets up because we like these performances.<br/><br/>The second is the motion of the camera. 2003's ""Finding Nemo"" was a major step forward in how the camera dances. That obviously was the inspiration for this not only in the even more radical camera sweeps but how they tighten for the underwater chase scenes.<br/><br/>I wish he had decided to innovate instead of exploit. But still, with all this focus, on watching and dancing, its a rare treat.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 3 of 3: Worth watching."

","First off, I have to qualify this comment by saying that this film is probably critic-proof in the sense that parents will rent it for their young kids (of the 6 and under crowd), and that these kids will no doubt enjoy it for one reason or another.<br/><br/>But as an adult watching this film, I couldn't help but find it uneven, patchy, tonally out-of-whack, and ultimately unfulfilling. And I'd probably dismiss it all the more if it wasn't for the fact that ""Happy Feet"" was directed by none other than George ""Mad Max"" Miller (and ""Babe,"" but I'm not holding that against him).<br/><br/>A few flashes of brilliance aside, it's as if ""Happy Feet"" was made by a focus group. This is especially evident when you consider that this film was released just barely a year after the successful documentary ""March of the Penguins."" Okay, we've got our penguins, let's have them sing pop songs in a manner reminiscent of ""Moulin Rouge."" And to top it all off, let's make it relevant by tacking on a third act that deals with environmental responsibility (Miller's heart is in the right place here, but it just doesn't gel with the rest of the film).<br/><br/>What you get is a hodge-podge of elements, which conflict with each other.

","I actually planned not to see this. Not because I think it's leftist, blasphemous propaganda (WTF?!!), but because I just think Hollywood has saturated the public with too many 3-D/PIXAR/TOY STORY/MONSTER'S INC/FINDING NEMO/SHREK/CARS/computer animated films. My particular generation (younger than the baby boomer's, but older then the GenXers) grew up on cell animation, the cartoony, 2-D stuff. Now not only do most persons under the age of 30 not know (or care) what that is, but the old style of animation is apparently obsolete in film-making nowadays.<br/><br/>So there you are. But the story is deliciously simple, straightforward, and in the end very moving and sentimental. We have a pride of penguins. They communicate by singing. Literally. That's your 'buy-the-bit' premise. The Emperor penguins of Antartica sing. Some sing better than others, but in matters of solidifying your identity and wooing your future mate, they MUST sing. They sing rock 'n' roll. They sing jazz and blues. They sing Elvis, they sing Queen, they sing Stevie Wonder. Unfortunately, one newly hatched member of them cannot sing. But he can tap dance, almost magically- with feet as fleet as Savion Glover (your humble ghost tapper). Unfortunately, this difference is enough to make him an outcast in his community, and there's your fable and moral in one fell swoop. But the film pulls this off wonderfully, from small comic bits of tone-deaf vocalizing by Elijah Wood (voice of our hero), to supporting bits of hilarity by Robin Williams- the voice of no less than THREE characters, including a sort of elder penguin evangelist who sounds a great deal like Barry White. The film's most joyous scenes are Wood's tapping penguin meeting and befriending a group of lusty Latin penguins (their leader also voiced by Williams), who not only accept the non-singing Wood, but actually regard him as ""accidentally cool."" When the film develops into its more dramatic second half (resolving the penguins' food famine as well as the future existence of the penguins themselves), some of the movie's lighter-than-air pace comes to a screeching halt. But it's worth it to hear tributes to some great music, including Elvis's 'Heartbreak Hotel,' Prince's 'Kiss,' Stevie Wonder's 'I Wish,' and the disco-influenced 'Boogie Wonderland,' which may illustrate the best scene in the film: a full-blown staccato courtship done entirely in song-and-tap dance between two penguins falling in love. A true charmer, with a lesson about embracing your differences and accepting them in others-- a premise that, unfortunately, has already been interpreted by some critics as some kind of secular, liberal agenda to pounce upon the masses. Oy gevalt! Hopefully, you will just watch the film and find it as entertaining as I did."

","If you watch this film in tandem with 2005's ""March of the Penguins"", you'll be amazed to discover that the film makers for this animated movie got a lot of the science about Emperor Penguins exactly right. I'm talking about the breeding habits, the 'heartsong' business, care for the egg by the male penguin and how they survive those brutal, wintery conditions by rotating huddled bodies in and out against fierce windstorms. Since I saw 'March' not long ago, those thoughts are still fresh in my mind, so it's easy to make the comparison.<br/><br/>For kids, this has to be a generally warm and fuzzy movie, though for impressionable youngsters, there's also some danger present with predatory hunting birds, leopard seals and a particularly clever, though brutal badminton game played by killer sharks with two of the film's penguin heroes. Fortunately, all the picture's 'good guys' make it through to the end in fine form.<br/><br/>Somehow though, there seems to be some sort of disconnect with the way the picture arrives at it's conclusion. With a plot element involving the disappearance of the penguins primary food source, and a connection made to 'alien' human beings as the cause, there's a hasty resolution to the problem whereby the world community gets on board with the penguins plight and everything is made good again. I didn't see that connection, and I don't think you will either, but if you can disregard that inconsistent flaw, you'll probably have a good time with those colorful Emperor penguins and the clever animation."

","In 2006, Warner Bros and Animal Logic teamed up to make a CGI motion capture animated feature film known as Happy Feet, a story about a tap dancing penguin named Mumble (voiced by Frodo Baggins - I mean Elijah Wood) who, after being born from an egg, has an ability to tap dance everywhere he goes and embarks on a quest to make peace with the humans who took their food while learning to accept himself as he really is.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is still as good as I remembered it. However, before I can get to the good stuff, there is one problem I do have. And that is the environmentalist message. The story is supposed to be about acceptance, but the whole ""humans stealing our food"" concept did get really preachy and the whole movie could've been stronger without it. I'm not angry about it. It's just that they didn't do anything new with it. Just a nitpick. Everything else still holds up. <br/><br/>The voice acting is top notch with great performances from Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, and the late Robin Williams, who committed suicide in August 2014, stealing the show as both Ramon and Lovelace, two hilarious and entertaining characters since the Genie from Disney's Aladdin. The animation is gorgeous with a great scale on Antarctica and the penguins even though the human motion capture doesn't have the same level. The best part, however, is the musical numbers which consists of cover versions including the Boogie Wonderland sequence and with the help of John Powell's lush and beautiful musical score, it's still the most memorable scene. <br/><br/>Overall, Happy Feet may not have anything groundbreaking to make it stand out from the likes of Pixar and DreamWorks, but with lush animation, endearing characters, and memorable musical cover songs, it still tap dances perfectly on it's 10th anniversary.

","I first saw this film with a staff member from my former care home when it came out in 2006 and we both enjoyed it. I watched this again today when I rented it after having already rented 'Happy Feet Two,' which is just as good with some parts better than others.<br/><br/>The penguins, birds, leopard seal, elephant seals, killer whales and backgrounds were realistically modelled and rendered with true-to-life colours. Although the dark scene during 'Somebody To Love' was the least detailed part of the film, it was saved by the beautiful green lighting that resembled the Northern Lights, the lovely singing and the amazing choreography, particularly from Mumble. While he is unable to sing, he can still tap dance very well. He and Gloria were cute as children while Ramón and his Amigos were amusing. Besides 'Somebody To Love,' my favourite musical numbers by the penguins were 'Kiss/Let's Talk About Sex (which was changed to something else to make it more family friendly),' 'Boogie Wonderland,' 'If You Leave Me Now' and 'I Wish.' Further to Ramon and his amigos, it was funny when one of them called the leopard seal, ""rubber butt"" and also when they tried to run away from him in a way that played with the slow motion cliché. Another cliché that was played with was 'liar revealed' when Mumble was mouthing to Ramon's Spanish version of 'My Way' in order to impress Gloria. This film has some stunning and thrilling scenes such as Mumble jumping out of the water and saying, ""Watcha waiting for?"" (which made me think he initially sang Gwen Stefani's 'What You Waiting For) thus leading to him and the other penguins swimming underwater to the Beach Boy's wonderfully harmonious and underrated 'Do It Again;' the sliding scene with Mumble and the Amigos albeit causing an apparent avalanche; Mumble and the Amigos being flipped and nearly eaten by two killer whales; and the inclusion of live action elements, especially zoo visitors watching Mumble dancing. I loved Mumble's interpretation of them as aliens and his own language as 'plain penguin' as opposed to 'plain English' due to the visitors interpreting his plea to stop overfishing as squawks. The environmental message of not overfishing and polluting the Antarctic are valuable but Lovelace being choked by the six-pack ring may be distressing for very young children and certain parts of the film may be too daunting for them. They may also find the scene of Mumble being washed up on the beach and put in captivity confusing and I can actually remember a child asking his/her parents if Mumble was dead at the cinema. As an adult, I found the elephant seals confusing because I couldn't tell which was which and I saw that they had similar-sounding names in the end credits. I also found the ending rather abrupt and baby Erik, who has a larger role in the sequel, was hard to spot.<br/><br/>In spite of the abrupt ending and certain parts being distressing, confusing and daunting for very young children, this film deserves an 8/10 for realistic visuals, beautiful musical numbers, impeccable choreography and a valuable environmental message."

","Happy Feet made a big splash back in 2006 taking home the Animated Academy Award. For what it is, it's pretty delightful. I quite liked the initial story and it's semi-musical style, taking time out to sing a song or dance a dance. It's efficiently cute. Kind of strange for the first song to be a Prince song though it fits the context. The detail in the animation is terrific and they make the colour-less landscape really work. However, the film kind of feels surreal when humans get involved, known in the film as aliens, and it ends up quite heavy handed with its environmentalist themes. Granted, that kind of bigger picture message is inevitable in a kids film like this, especially when the big love story isn't really compelling and the outcast having an adventure is much more interesting. I do love the irony at the end where the film itself is now responsible for passing along its message. I wonder if it worked. <br/><br/>6/10"

","The movie was alright. The story is good for children, learning to be yourself. The animation is really nice. The whole experience was average. However, all the sexual innuendo in the music is not really acceptable for children. It blows my mind how people are just okay with putting music about ""making love"" into a movie that's meant for children. I do realize it has a PG rating, but this movie is about cute penguins, and children are drawn to this. People complain about girls having sex at an early age. It's movies like this that help make them like this. I know there's other things that cause this, other television shows and movies, but this is supposed to be for kids. It was obviously made for kids. <br/><br/>I do appreciate the story and the wonderful animation, but I don't recommend this for your kids. There's plenty of other movies that teach the same basic moral, and aren't filled with all of this inappropriate music."
"tieman64","Null","1","1","5 December 2011"," Postcards from the edge
","How does director George Miller go from directing the ultra grim ""Lorenzo's Oil"" and the ultra violent ""Mad Max"" movies to directing an animated film about a tap-dancing penguin? Oh yeah, he once made a film about a talking pig. The universe makes sense again.<br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" is an environmentally conscious animated children's film about a tap dancing penguin. It's first act is your typical ""ugly duckling"" story, in which a penguin called Mumble learns an assortment of oft-repeated values: ""its okay to be different"", ""be who you are"", ""stay true to yourself"", ""never give up"" etc.<br/><br/>But then the film switches gears and becomes a weird sex-obsessed (with subliminal penguin-on-penguin sex positions) tale in which highly aroused penguins preoccupy themselves with bedding, enticing, seducing, inseminating and arousing each another. During this portion of the film, the film's singing and dancing literally becomes re-directed sex energy. The penguins are largely self-centred, horny and stuck in their ways.<br/><br/>But then the film switches gears again and becomes a kind of multi-ethnic, pseudo-religious parable, in which a race of hard-lined, ultra parochial, super-traditionalist penguins begrudgingly replace their ""holy singing"" with ""modern"", ""trendy"", ""liberal"" and ""vulgar dancing"", taught to them by a gang of Latino midget penguins. Why do they replace their traditions? Because over-consumption and steadfast conservatism equals, apparently, extinction.<br/><br/>But then the film switches gears again and becomes a precursor to ""Wall-E"", Mumbles embarking on a quest to convince humans to stop over fishing, polluting and destroying the penguin's habitats. This portion of the film ends with a creepy sequence straight out of ""2001: A Space Odyssey's"" climax.<br/><br/>Then the film morphs yet again into a kind of unintentional parody of ""March of the Penguins"", a nature documentary which mercilessly anthromorphisized penguins. Ethology generally focuses on behaviour and not emotions in animals, but here was a film that went to creepy lengths to paint penguins as little human beings. People just like us. What ""Happy Feet"" does is have the penguins exploit this objectification. Miller has them become creatures of showbiz, entertainers and performers who take to the stage in order to sucker humans into feeling empathetic toward them. The film's humans, who don't care about the penguins unless they've been reduced to song-and-dance machines, performance puppets squeezed into a very rigid humanocentric framework, are the only ""live action"" things in the film (ie, not computer animated).<br/><br/>Beyond this the film has some good virtual camera work, some moments of wonder, some good jokes, some good ambiance and designs toward the second half (a ship, a whaling station, a zoo) and a few good set pieces. Comedian Robin Williams has fun as a fast talking Latino penguin.<br/><br/>8/10 – Cinema by committee or George Miller pet project? Incidentally, the past 2 decades have seen a huge rise in environmentally conscious ""art"" (mostly children's films), not a response to massive corresponding pollution increases during this same period, but a kind of unconscious abjuration or denial of responsibility. Worth one viewing."

","I just saw the movie with my fiancée and felt compelled to write a review about it. Naturally, I first had to read other reviews prior to posting mine, because I was in doubt of my own evaluation of the movie. Seeing the extensive positive feedback I had received prior to seeing this movie, I just assumed it would be good. Unfortunately, it was awful and merited a grading of ""zero"", although a grade lower than 1 is not possible.<br/><br/>As stated by a few others, it is boring and the feeling of stopping the movie occurred frequently.<br/><br/>To re-state what has already been said by others, it is also shockingly inappropriate for children. At approx. 27:30 in the movie, the penguins jump out of the water, which results in the main character, Mumble, to jump onto Gloria and ""slip"" multiple times which result in a 69, missionary & doggy position. Very unsubtle. Although the culturally stereotyped hispanics were the only comic relief in the movie, the also are constantly thinking of ""scoring"". This movie is meant for children???? Most bizarre!<br/><br/>And naturally, as stated again by others. The plot veers from one scene to another to try and speedily conclude the end and bring the political message of ""lets stop over-fishing waters in order to save this cute, cuddly and dancing penguin population"". Bravo. All other species can go to hell. If you want a similar ""native"" tale of saving indigenous species, watch Avatar. Much better.<br/><br/>All in all, it is difficult not to give this movie a zero."

","Animated films are becoming real great in this past 20 years. Warmful and moving stories, nice developed characters, a fantastic use of songs are many aspects of why every person should watch animated films these days. And ""Happy Feet"" is one of those.<br/><br/>A little penguin named Mumble (voice of Elijah Wood) can't sing and singing is what makes a real penguin. But he can tap dancing just like Fred Astaire, something he does since he come out of the egg. His father (Hugh Jackman) disapproves, but his mother (Nicole Kidman) likes the dancing finding very cute. The problem is that penguins must sing his love song, because that's why they fall in love and eventually the specie evolutes. Mumble falls in love with Gloria (Brittany Murphy) a female penguin that has the most beautiful voice between the penguins. But a penguin couple can only exist if both penguins sings. Cast out of the group, Mumble found new friends, a group of friendly Latin penguins. But he can't give up Gloria because he's still in love with her and he's gonna fight with the elder penguins showing that he is also a penguin.<br/><br/>This a moving film about love, prejudice, friendship, loyalty, and also about social preservation of the environment. Everyone will love it because it has funny moments, the animation is well made (it includes a very good segment with real actors) and there's many songs of artists like Prince, Queen and Earth Wind & Fire (sanged by the penguins). Here you can find action, adventure, romance, drama, musical, almost every cinematic genre in one movie. And, of course, a good message of what love can do to us (here in the form of penguins). Received a well deserved Oscar of Best Animated Film in 2007. George Miller (well known as the director of ""Mad Max"" series and ""Lorenzo's Oil"") debuts with animated films with the right foot. 10/10"

","What is it with these movies that want to personify animals with love, emotions and even a god? Penguins live in the Antartic and do not act at all like this movie. Why do we have to endure movies with talking and singing animals. I guess I am too old now as I grew up with Snow White and Sleeping Beauty, etc. I had heard that was a very good movie but just a few minutes of seeing a penguin imitating Elvis and calling for 'wives' and offering prayers to something or other. Surely this last past was a message to all Christians to the effect that ""Look, even the penguins have a need for a supreme being. Why is yours and different?"" But they won't get it."
"StartingAllOver14","6","1","1","25 December 2009"," Spectacular visuals makes up for a so-so movie
","After hand-drawn animation was declared dead by most of the Hollywood studios because it wasn't hip enough, CGI features were churn out and they all, more or less, felt as the same movie. Elements as adult-in-jokes, pop references and gags to kids made the audience stand in line to see them theatrically, but in my opinion, few of the features really distinguished themselves. I'm not sure which category I should place Happy Feet. It's a cute and entertaining flick, but yet a schizophrenic one at the same time.<br/><br/>From a visual standpoint, this movie is one of the most gorgeous-looking CGI features to date. The animals have a very authentic and realistic look and some of the background looks almost real. The design of the humans are less detailed, though, but they look far from cartoony as the humans in the Pixar film does. This is certainly one of the most jaw-dropping animated features ever made.<br/><br/>But there's a component which is called a story. To be honest, I never became fond of the plot. For the first, it was a about an outcast. Several animated films (both CGI and hand-drawn) has been about an outsider, so the theme has unfortunately been worn out and feels nothing special or fresh in this film. I also felt the story was overall a little weird, including singing and dancing penguins. But on the positive side, though, while the characters aren't memorable, they're still likable, especially the Adelie Pinguins. <br/><br/>I'm not claiming that this is a overall bad movie, but it has so many balls in the air; there's drama, there's comedy, there's action and there's music numbers. The latter component actually works. And this is a nice family film, with a serious tone in some sequences which will appeal to adults. But in a jungle of CGI animated films, ""Happy Feet"" doesn't distinguish it self from the rest. The sweet moments are too sugary and the grave moments are... well, grave. Of course there's some humor, but nothing that made me laugh hysterically. And there's the cheesy components. All of these elements are combined into a mixture that seems overall schizophrenic instead of telling a coherent story. But of course there are far worse movies than this. At least the characters and the music makes the movie watchable.<br/><br/>But the visuals is undoubtedly the biggest strength here and the film should be recommended mostly for the visuals."
"ja_kitty_71","10","1","1","4 December 2008"," One of the best animated musicals
","This film I thought is one of the best animated musicals I had seen. This film is also about one's creativity, which I do not mind a bit. Now, this film is based on fact, since emperor penguin couples court each other and recognize one another by their unique calls or a ""Heartsong"" as it was known in the film.<br/><br/>Anyway, set in an emperor penguin colony, one female penguin, Norma Jean, sings the song ""Kiss,"" whereupon a male penguin named Memphis sings ""Heartbreak Hotel."" Norma Jean chooses him as her mate. They couple and Norma Jean lays an egg. The egg is left in Memphis's care while Norma Jean and the other females leave to fish for several weeks. While the males are struggling through the harsh winter, Memphis drops the egg, briefly exposing it to the freezing Antarctic temperatures. The resulting chick (which is Mumble), has a terrible singing voice. However, Mumble has an astute talent for something that none of the penguins had ever seen before: tap dancing. This ability is frowned upon by the colony's elders, who don't tolerate deviance of any kind. As a result, poor Mumble is ostracized throughout his childhood, with only his mother and his friend Gloria to turn to for help.<br/><br/>Mumble then grows to an adult, still half-covered in fluffy down. Through a series of mishaps - mainly getting chased by a hungry leopard seal - the penguin finds himself far from his home and within a carefree colony of adelie penguins. He quickly befriends a small group of bachelors who form a club of sorts called the Amigos: the leader, Ramon, the brothers Raul and Nestor, and twin brothers Rinaldo and Lombardo. The Amigos quickly embrace Mumble's dance moves and assimilate him into their misfit group. So that's all I am telling you, you will have to see it for yourself.<br/><br/>Overall I love this movie. I don't have a favorite scene (as I said many times), and it does have excellent musical scenes and toe-tapping fun. Also Mumble & Gloria became one of my favorite animated couples."

","This is one of the most stirring films I've seen in a while, and its no shock that its George bloody Miller directing, writer and director of the Mad Max series, the Babe films, and Lorenzo's Oil. It also shouldn't come as a shock that this movie bares a lot of similarities to ""The Road Warrior,"" either. But, we won't get into that here.<br/><br/>Like most of Miller's films, this is a story about the 'underdog hero;' and again, like most of his films, its not afraid to mince around issues of the time. Like Mad Max and the oil situation, this film confronts matters about overfishing without pause. And, by all rights, it should. It's not just a 'Greenpeace' matter, anymore. This is important, the world over. <br/><br/>The film's also one that takes its inspiration from many sources, some of the most noticeable being the Jesus/messiah story (don't believe what you've heard from most of the other 'this film is anti-Christian' reviewers. This film is essentially a Jesus/messiah parallel, right down to the Pharisee-like Elders and 'resurrection.') and 'Joseph Livingston Seagull,' among others. They're not 'ripped off,' though, so to speak, and this is good. I suppose you've all seen the film, so there ain't be no summary on this here review. I mean, come on. You can read a summary on any one of these other schmoes reviews! Cam'aaaan!<br/><br/>Some people are labeling this film ""liberal propaganda."" I'm not even gonna get in to that, as I still wanna keep my IQ where it is. But, this quote from the man himself will suffice: ""Look,"" Miller says, dismissing low-brow criticism Happy Feet got as eco-propaganda, ""any story worth its salt has to have more to it than meets the eye. I mean, it's got to have a lot going on in the subtext.""<br/><br/>This is a heartfelt and moving film, and a giant step for c.g. films both technically and storytelling-wise. Miller's made another masterpiece, and that's really all I can say."

They took what's happening in real life, what penguins do in real life and mash it together so it's understandable for us to comprehend. It also had good actors like Elija Wood, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams, and of course our good ol' Steve Irwin who's not really an actor, but it's just easier to put him listed like this.

I think that there are way too many songs cramped into a film, way more than I would've expected. This film makes me really dizzy, now I mean really!

"StarDragyn","4","1","1","11 April 2007"," *Another cliché pun on ""feet"" here*
","To be polite to this popular film, I will give it credit insomuch as the graphics were indeed stunning. And what tidbits there were of Robin Williams were quite humorous.<br/><br/>However, I honestly did not care for the film much. There were 3 main points I have complaints about.<br/><br/>1. It wasn't so appropriate for the age it was advertised to. For one thing there was a little suggestive material, but more so there were lyrics in the songs that were inappropriate for children (like ""I need your body, baby""). Also there were 2 particular scenes that were very intense for young children, with very fierce, large, realistic-looking animals. These were not even short in duration, and would likely cause nightmares in young kids. Of course this all depends on what you think is fit for your children, but personally I was a little shocked. And I thought they could have made it more age appropriate without taking away from the movie.<br/><br/>2. The plot was lacking. Greatly. And the length of the movie made it all the more agonizing. At one point I thought the movie had reached a wind-down, for the ending, but then looked at my watch and realized it was only halfway through! Unfortunately I was not in a situation I could leave (as this was something I took someone to as part of work), but otherwise I think I would have given up on it at that point. Honestly, the plot was irregular, and didn't seem to have a consistent goal in mind. At one point it seemed like the plot was going one place, and then later another. Plus, even what plot was present had a number of holes. I didn't even think the ending was all that satisfying.<br/><br/>3. I know a lot of people are commending the music, but there is an awful lot of sitting there watching a penguin tap dance. If you like that, fine, but be prepared that it is almost like they tried to combine a movie and a music video...and it didn't blend that well. hahah<br/><br/>The plot is only interesting enough for young kids, but like I said other things may not be all that appropriate for them, so the target audience is skewed. But, hey, if you want to watch something that doesn't demand your attention, you may like it. My expectations, considering the reviews I had been hearing, were perhaps too high.<br/><br/>Here is a formula that I think would sum up whether or not you will end up liking or disliking the movie: Teenages/adults who go into it for the purpose of enjoying the music and visual effects may very well enjoy it. Those who go looking for a movie (not, like I said, a patched music video) will probably be disappointed."

","As an animated picture, it's one of the best I've seen, but as far as the story goes, I wish they would have focused on the 4-year old mumble who is much cuter than the teen-aged forever molting ""Mumble"". I've watched a dozen or so nature documentaries on penguins and while this movie was fun to watch, real ""Emperor"" penguins just stand around in a huddle most of the time trying to stay warm, making this film just ""cute"". Anyway, I didn't mind the environmental message so much but they could have told the story in a less depressing more humorous way. After all, in reality every animal eats every other animal. The penguins eat fish, seals eat penguins, sharks eats seals and humans eat fish that those animals eat and no fish, none of those animals survive either. ""Happy Feet"" deserved it's Oscar for the animation but story-wise, it could have been ""happier""."
"ankita167","10","1","1","7 April 2007"," Ultimate animation i ever seen
","2006 has turned out to be the year for digital animation. From talking cars to suburban turned forest animals it seems like we've almost seen it allor so we thought. The fresh and upbeat penguin-filled musical 'Happy Feet' is the thirteenth digitally animated film to be released this year. And as expected, people are eating it up. Some have gone as far to say it's the year's best. There was better this year, but 'Happy Feet' is okay.<br/><br/>In 'Happy Feet' we are given front row seats to the birth and growth of a penguin by the name of Mumble who is voiced by Elijah Wood. He's different from all the other penguins. In a world where finding your ""heartsong"" is crucial, poor Mumble isn't able to keep a tune at all. Interestingly enough though, he can dance up a storm. Unfortunately this is frowned upon and ends up causing him great distress. Eventually the elder penguin Noah, who is voiced by Hugo Weaving, accuses Mumble of bringing on the famine that is currently afflicting the penguins. Mumble attempts to explain that he believes ""aliens"" are the real cause. Noah doesn't take him seriously at all and banishes him, claiming that once he is gone, the famine will end. Mumbles then promises that he will return, and when he does he will bring proof that the alleged ""aliens"" are to blame. He then embarks on his journey where along the way he makes some new friends and learns the world outside his own is much different than he could have ever thought possible.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Happy Feet' is amazing. Almost every landscape down to the smallest icicle look so very real. Even the penguins themselves are highly detailed, but obviously aren't real. Aside from that and the direction from Greg Miller, everything presented in 'Happy Feet' is just okay. Nothing in it evokes a wholehearted wow. The plot itself takes what seems forever to be revealed. There's a forty five minute wait before anything about a famine is even mentioned. Watching the film is a lot like riding a roller coaster. No, I don't mean its a thrill ride. The way the story is set up, it goes up and down. Each time it begins to drag, something comes along to get it going again. And when the ending finally comes, it appears forced. The whole addition of an environmental issue still has me wondering. I guess because without it there would be nothing for Mumble to do on his journey of discovery.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with 'Happy Feet' though revolves around the music. Yes, I know it's a musical, but the music seemed to really exceed the film itself. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. The reason being is because the film suggests that there actually is a real story behind it all. Either way, it doesn't really matter because it's the singing and dancing that will have people returning to see it all again. So despite having some assuredly bad qualities 'Happy Feet' does indeed have its moments. It does what it was supposed to, and that's entertain."

My only critique was not that Robin Williams was used as a voice-over because he does great work but the fact that he was used for two ""ethnic"" voice overs. I am African-American and as the voice of ""Lovelace"" he sounded like a ""white person trying to sound black"" and the same with him doing the voice of ""Ramone"" and trying to sound Latino. In that respect I found it to be quite insulting and a mockery. Come on guys spend the money and try and get an Eddie Griffin, a Tommy Davidson, an Issac Hayes, a Ron Glass, or a James Avery (Uncle Phil on ""The Fresh Prince of Bel Air"". And as for ""Ramone"" I'll bet you Carlos Mencia, Paul Rodriguez, George Lopez, or maybe even Cheech Marin would have done a bang-up job.

","The family has been waiting for...oh, just about forever to see this movie. Somehow, we missed it in the theaters. But frankly, I'm kinda glad we did. I would have been upset if I'd paid a movie theater price for the family to see this. The anticipation was really high, and although the movie was good, I expected more. Over all it was a fun movie. The animation, graphics and all the effects were top notch. It gets a 10 from me for all of that.<br/><br/>It's all the underlying things that bothered me. Oh, I get the environmentalist agenda, and I do not disagree. I think we humans need to be a whole lot more responsible with the earth than we have been. And yes, the whole ""humans are bad"" theme often seen in these kinds of movies was toned down a little at the end, but not enough. I am tired of the human bashing in so many kid movies. And yes, it was present in this cute little flick. There were some mixed messages in here that could confuse the still forming minds of young children and teens.<br/><br/>On one hand we are force fed (for the one hundred millionth time) the almost religious mantra that ""I am what I am and don't you dare make me change."" On the other hand we discover (also for the hundred millionth time) that humans are the source of all evil! So if I'm supposed to be proud of who I am, accept myself for who or whatever I may be, but humans are bad and I'm human...(gulp) Yikes! I must be bad! <br/><br/>Huh? What's wrong with this picture? <br/><br/>I kept hoping to see at least one adult human turn into a good guy. When poor Lovelace has a plastic six-pack holder around his neck choking him to death, and the penguins arrive in a place where humans obviously existed at one time, I was hoping some kindly environment-friendly scientist or such would be the one to take the thing off of the little guy's neck. But no. Humans only became ""good"" (well, sort of) once they saw the penguins dancing.<br/><br/>I think a good message of taking care of the environment, showing what has been done wrong and is still being done wrong, can still be broadcast. But without villainizing the entire human race! Our children already grow up with so many negative ideals thrown at them. The fact that they are human should not be pounded into their heads as a reason for shame. Frankly, I thought that aspect was highly irresponsible of the writers/producers. <br/><br/>Of course, the poke at religion is a huge yaaaaaaawn. You'd think Hollywood would get tired of poking fun at people of faith. I know a lot of wrong has been done in the name of religion. ALL religions. But I think replaying it over and over. And over and over. And over and over and over and over and over...Well, you get my drift. Enough is enough. We get it. Any kind of religion with rules and traditions (namely Christianity, for that's the only faith Hollywood likes to poke fun at...you didn't see any of the evil elders with, say, turbans on their heads) is bad. Funny thing. To be a non-conformist now days you have to actually LIKE organized religion. The Hollywood crowd, with few exceptions, is the most conformist group around. Conform to their thinking or else...<br/><br/>And lastly, the song that the movie was advertised all over with...not at all appropriate for a movie targeting children and young teens. Hit Me Up? Please. Not a very responsible move in a society that is already at its wit's end, trying to fight teen pregnancy and STDs.<br/><br/>So now that I've completely obliterated the movie, I must say again that it was, overall, an enjoyable watch. lol. I won't push DH to buy it for the kids, but I'm glad we saw it."
"Michael Kenmore","7","1","1","31 March 2007"," Fantastic visual but fatuously overwrought in expositionary dialogue & dizzying visuals at times
","I love the Mad Max franchise -- The Road Warrior the best action movie ever produced next to Terminator 2. I loved Lorenzo's Oil, a genuine epic of a medical drama that, like Zodiac, is rarely or never repeated in the sense of ""engaging epicness"" tackling a complex subject in strict dramatic work. I loved Babe: Pig in the City as a flawed masterwork.<br/><br/>The latter bombed at the box office so bad I thought George Miller have been sent to the proverbial ""movie jail,"" recollecting Elaine May's last directorial effort in Ishtar that was one of the biggest commercial flops in cinema history 20 years ago.<br/><br/>No, Mr Miller have returned in full form, and his massively immense directing talent is evident throughout the film, with astonishing photorealistic visuals and often silly humor to boot.<br/><br/>But there are a few scenes that I thought are so overscripted it borders on annoying. Particularly Adélie Penguins as the Spanish amigos (however amusing the group of five amigo characters are in their way, which is one of the highlights of the film in entertaining storytelling) talking incessantly & commenting on the main characters' interaction in love and needing space, as if small children in the audience should know the nuances translated aloud. And the visual gets quite excessive with the continuously revolving camera movements that literally fly all over. There are some amazing FX shots, but there are dizzying and rapidly confusing shots that serve almost nothing but resemble an elaborately designed Six Flags roller coaster ride. And the environmental message as well as commentary on religious matter, while pointed, come off fairly contrived but saved by Miller's near impeccable directing style without beating the heads over a lil' too much.<br/><br/>Overall, Happy Feet is a good film that makes the viewer tap his or her feet in intuitive response to the film's music and visuals featuring singing & dancing penguins, albeit with minor flaws. I think consistently entertaining story and dazzling visuals by Animal Logic & other FX houses contributed to Miller receiving a Best Animated Feature Oscar, which may be deserved. I haven't seen Cars & Monster House but will be sure to catch up with these, despite my reservation about the movies. It's about time Pixar lose the monopoly on Best Animated Feature Oscars (with the exception of The Incredibles).<br/><br/>Happy Feet is a fine achievement in CG animation and visual aesthetics to date, because there are a few times when I was momentarily stunned by the splendid creative vision while watching the movie without influence of unnecessary real-world cynicism. George Miller and the production crew at Animal Logic did a fantastic job realizing their vision that pass for photorealism in near-perfection. Story, however, remains a tad maudlin for my taste, but humor - especially the amigos - help to overcome the saccharine element.<br/><br/>Be forewarned, Happy Feet is properly rated PG for scary scenes of peril, rude humor and mild language with brief underlying sexual innuendos that children may or may not catch. May be offensive to devoutly religious conservative viewers (parents & individuals) whose faith is questioned by the movie (I know, typical unsubtle Hollywood imposing values). Still a good picture for the family to enjoy on a relaxing night.<br/><br/>*** 1/2 (close to 3)"

","I really like this movie, more than I thought I would. It's very upbeat and the actors/actresses chosen for the voice overs is just awesome! If you have not seen March of the Penquins and have already seen this movie, I would suggest that you try to watch that first. The fact that this movie closely followed the life styles of penquins is truly an added bonus. If you've already seen Happy Feet, then March of the Penquins is a must see. Both movies are completely different from one another in the story lines, but being able to see some of those things really did make it that much enjoyable.<br/><br/>I give high props to the producers and actors for this film. No, I didn't rate it above an 8, but it's a strong 8! Everyone in the family should enjoy this movie from age 6-106. It's guaranteed to make you smile at least once and laugh a few more times."

","The various components of human biology and behavior structure the way we interact with other people, find mates, view the environment, and organize societies. The brilliance of this movie is that it develops a comprehensively new civilization for another species based on different biological characteristics. Happy Feet is not some superficially ""light"" movie made to distract kids for an hour and a half. Like early groups of humans, these penguins battle harsh living conditions and the constant threat of death against a backdrop of religious superstition, social ostracism, physical disability, ingroup/outgroup conflict, sexual pressures, and the possibility of destruction by another species. Its depiction of Antarctic wildlife and climate are phenomenally biologically realistic, with of course some dramatic liberties taken. This is a complete movie that will satisfy anyone willing to think about human society through the critique of a dancing penguin movie. Which you should. Besides, the plot is great, the characters are excellent, the animation is beautiful, and the voice acting is perfect. Highly recommended."

","'Happy Feet' is yet another addition to the fast-growing stable of animated ""kids"" movies that are unashamedly able to be enjoyed by those of all ages. The formula is tried and true; combine impressive animation effects with some witty dialogue, throw in an adventure or two and you have yourself an entertaining movie. One earlier commenter mentioned that these types of films are a ""safe bet"". This is true, but nevertheless Happy Feet is good enough to be one of the best of an increasingly crowded bunch.<br/><br/>Visually the film is a masterpiece, particularly the aerial shots the icy landscapes, and it's clear that the animation process has improved exponentially in these post-Shrek days. The real highlight of this film is the soundtrack; the tag-line warning should be heeded, toe-tapping is inevitable.<br/><br/>All in all, a fun flick  the sort of movie that you just know you're going to enjoy, and it doesn't disappoint."
"alexiskzds","1","6","15","27 November 2006"," Happy Feet
","I thought this was the most insipid, banal children's movie that I have seen in a long time..Since the film has been doing so well at the box office, I thought I would check it out: I needed a break from the heavily laden feeling the holiday brings on for me. But this movie was not the antidote..It was so fluffy that I thought better of the intense dramas playing in the neighboring theaters...If you can envision MTV videos with penguins instead of people singing, than you know what Happy Feet is about. The plot was so one dimensional, there were no sub plots and if I knew there would be a plethora of birds breaking out in song and dance, I would have brought a rifle and saved the theater from one more sugarier scene. Who is finding this good anyway..just people under 12?"
"ahae-1","6","6","15","17 November 2006"," Too Real & Too Scary
","I was so excited for a nice, happy, animated holiday movie. Happy Feet seemed to deliver at the beginning with amazingly real animation of dancing, singing, swimming, cute little penguins. The opera like musical numbers were very fun & energetic. The story of Mumble becoming an outcast and having to find his own way was engaging. But then the movie turned into Greenpeace propaganda and lost all sense of the animated fun I was having. The ""March of The Penguins"" style troubles Mumble gets into are much too real for children. The animation is almost too good at this point and it's down right scary. Although the movie turns back around at the end, I still can't imagine watching it again. Another disappointing movie for 2006."
"jodisegal-1","5","8","22","10 November 2006"," Not what it could have been.
","Happy Feet was first described to me as a combination of March of the Penguins and Moulin Rouge. I have to agree, but not in the way he intended. It doesn't combine the creativity of those 2 films, it copies them. The story starts out replicating scenes from March of the Penguins, except with singing. It's very cute for about 3 minutes. Then you realize that the songs are uninventive ripoffs or just songs by the artists themselves. The story has too many elements shoved together, none of which really engage. It tries to be the story of the kid who doesn't fit in, the environmental story, the cross-cultural story. It's fine, but not nearly as original as it could and should have been. Brittany Murphy has an incredible voice, and Robin Williams never ceases to amaze as 3 different characters."
"Scrooge-3","6","9","26","7 November 2006"," Great CGI - Mediocre Story
","The CGI was some of the best I've ever seen. The natural beauty of Antarctica and the animal life there was truly spectacular. At times it was hard to tell that this was not live-action photography. For this reason alone, Happy Feet is worth seeing.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this is about the only reason for an adult to see the film. The story and characters are tepid; even Robin Williams can only muster occasional excitement with his two wacky characters. Once again, a big budget animation feature falls flat with celebrity voices instead of professional voice talent. The story, such as it is, doesn't really start to take off until the second half of the movie. The first half is seemingly endless vignettes of exposition and set up. The dancing sequences, particularly the one featured in the year-old teaser trailer, liven things up but don't move the plot along. I was annoyed at the inconsistent juxtaposition of musical styles; one moment it was hip hop, the next blues, the next rock, with few, if any, lasting through an entire song. One of the story problems I had was a lack of a consistent villain. Mumbles is attacked early in the film by a vicious seal. I kept expecting this scary bad guy to reappear to get his comeuppance, but he just disappears. There was not even a hint of what turned out to be the real antagonists until halfway through the film. Finally, I felt the ecological disaster moralizing was just too preachy. Maybe you have to be that blatant for children, but as an adult I felt like the film was talking down to me.<br/><br/>Happy Feet tries to be a nature film, a musical, a love story, and a sitcom, but fails to effectively deliver any of those. I really came away thinking that Happy Feet was little more than a glorified Afternoon Special. It makes me appreciate all the more how films like Shrek and Flushed Away can successfully combine action, romance, comedy, and drama on levels that both children and adults can enjoy."

","This movie started out cute. The main plot seemed to be about a penguin who didn't have a heart song but could dance. Then they decided to make this movie into an environmental agenda.If that had kept to the story about the penguins having a heart song and the penguin not being accepted because he didn't have a heart song...it would have probably been fine. Even the environmental issues wouldn't have been so bad but they totally ruined this movie for children by having so much sexual content. Examples: The penguins at one point were slipping on the ice in various sexual positions. One male penguin had numerous female penguins around him. It was mating season and he asked ""okay, ladies...which one wants to go first?"" I think that is a little too much for a movie that is geared for children. <br/><br/>If you have children under 13, I wouldn't recommend seeing it. Big disappointment and waste of money & time!"
"rob_nicoski","2","4","9","28 November 2006"," Political Propaganda
","This is the first time I have written a formal movie review, but I felt compelled after viewing Happy Feet with my 5-year old twins. While the movie had some endearing characters and several genuinely funny lines, the overt pro-environment, anti-Christian propaganda was shocking.<br/><br/>For instance, the penguins are faced with a severe fish shortage, which we learn is (of course) caused by humans wanton destruction of the environment for their own monetary gains. Before this becomes evident, the penguin elders contend that they must appease the ""great wind"" to bring back the fish. It is clear by the context of the movie that they are meant to represent Chiristians appealing to God. The elders are depicted as narrow-minded, bigoted idiots. Regardless of your viewpoint, the characterization was extremely offensive.<br/><br/>Everyone is entitled to their opinion, but personally when I take my kids to a movie we are looking to be entertained, not slammed over the head with a partisan, mean-spirited political message. My recommendation is to go see Flushed Away instead. It may not be as dramatic, but it is good clean, non-political fun."
"tvtiguy","3","4","9","25 November 2006"," This film is not for young children
","To me, this film seems like it came together in 10 marketing meetings. All of the songs are of ""an older generation"" - if you're 40 you'll recognize them all. Making you want to buy a recycled sound track. By getting all the big names together they assure a big opening weekend too.<br/><br/>I took a 5 and 7 year old and of course they loved it. The animation was SPECTACULAR. And Robin Williams (in his many roles) was very funny. And the ""overt"" story is good - be yourself, you don't have to fit in to be happy, don't give up when things get tough.<br/><br/>But the entire sub-text is that finding a mate is the most important thing in life. Plus, the sexual innuendo was WAY to strong for me to feel comfortable with my young kids. Since when did Prince became acceptable for children? I love Prince, but I'm a 40 year old father of 2. The themes are just to ""adult."" I do think that if my kids were 11 or so, I wouldn't be writing this. But I use the comments on IMDb to help determine what movies might be OK for my kids before I take them. In this case it was spur of the moment and I didn't do my usual research. I admit that I tend to be overprotective when it comes to my kids and mass media. But if this review keeps someone from taking a 7 year old girl - then it's worth the time.<br/><br/>And I don't even have time to get into the silly ending (with the real humans) that entirely simplifies what would be a complex debate. And the stereotypical portrait of Hispanics that gets painted."

A lot of effort went into the detail of each character, including the ""bad"" guys. This film has to be seen on the big screen for the full affect, sort of like the opening sequence to Lion King, only 10x better. The choreography is brilliantly done, between the underwater chase scenes through ice floes and bergs, and aerial acrobatics, to the courtship rituals of the penguins. The choice of songs for the film blends in really well and some of the lyrics have been altered to fit the theme. In all a feel-good movie with a bit of everything in it."

","Neither the commercials nor the marketing do this film justice. ""Happy Feet"" is simply the greatest animated film since ""The Lion King"" (remember those Disney films that had such depth and complexity that they actually made you cry?). It's so much more than the Hollywood musical version of ""March of the Penguins.""<br/><br/>Baby Emperor penguin Mambo is born with the gift of dance. Unfortunately, dancing is looked down upon in this society, and Mambo is mocked, scorned and eventually expelled from the tribe by the heads of the Established Penguin Church.<br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" gets quite dark and somber when Mambo is captured and forced to live in a zoo where all the animals eventually drift into a glazed dementia. But I promise that most of the film is funny, beautiful, enchanting, and a total treat from start to finish.

The theme of the movie, overfishing, is currently in the limelight due to reports of fishing stock depletion making this a timely film. Overall, I enjoyed it. I think I liked March of the Penguins a bit more, but I would definitely give this a solid 7 as an enjoyable film. The film also has anti-establishment and self acceptance themes that are very powerful. Mumbles faces opposition from an old elite class of penguins.

","happy feet is one of the best animated movies ever. Here's why: not only it expresses lots of, very important and sensitive messages but also it does that in a really clever,funny, hilarious, humorous, fantastic way. At long last, all children and grown-ups should be aware of how important some things are like: a healthy family, following one's heart, being proud and not embarrassed of how someone's born and raised, environmental protection, the fact that every single creature on this planet is narrowly and indissolubly connected and attached to their environment and that's why we can't survive if our place and home is being damaged, destroyed, traded on and exterminated. Humans are the smartest beings in this world, and though they have the power to do great things they always get influenced by their insatiable tendency towards bad actions. Well, that was one of the messages the movie passes. All in all, Happy Feet is definitely worth watching more than once. Great direction, great plot, technically( I'm not an expert so I can't judge fairly) amazing. I loved the voices of all these fantastic actors( Wood, Jackman, Murphy) Especially Robbin Williams. Man, he's a piece of gold! My favorite was Nicole Kidman. She has a perfect voice, ideal for the role of the caring and loving mummy. H a p p y f e e t f o r e v e r"
"jamie-650","3","3","6","2 January 2007"," Happy Feet makes Jamie sad
","I'd love to say this film lived up to the hype and apparent ""rave reviews"", but it most certainly failed to meet even the most modest of my expectations.<br/><br/>From an adult perspective, the movie lacked the humour that made animated titles such as Finding Nemo and Shrek so enjoyable. Through a child's eyes, which I can also speak on behalf of quite confidentially, it lacked the colour and character diversity that brings a good children's story to life. There just isn't much entertaining about a bluish-gray landscape and a few hundred identical penguins.<br/><br/>Visuals aside, the over-use of cheesy pop-songs near turn the film into a b-grade musical, and aren't always entirely appropriate for younger audiences. Disjointed and going no where fast, attempts are then made to fill the questionable direction and conclusion of the film with over-the-top and poorly delivered messages concerning environmental awareness.<br/><br/>Happy Feet winds up being unamusingly long and emotionally void despite the efforts of some the most charismatic voice actors alive today. I wanted to believe it was good, I really did, however it falls short of both a children's favourite or enjoyable light entertainment for older generations."
"ConStar8788","3","3","6","31 December 2006"," Not what I was expecting, unfortunately...
","In any cartoon with talking animals, one must suspend disbelief in order to be able to enjoy what they're watching.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, with ""Happy Feet,"" that suspension of disbelief requires a quantum leap outside the bounds of logic. And that's before we get to issues with the script, the cast, the acting and a subplot that could be construed as offensive to people of faith.<br/><br/>The crux of the plot -- that one penguin could basically affect the fishing habits of humans around the globe -- is unlikely at best and jaw-droppingly insipid at worst.<br/><br/>If you can believe a penguin could swim to what looks like the U.S. Atlantic or Pacific coasts, you might have a good time watching this film. Otherwise, if you're looking for a cartoon -- even a cartoon that throws messages in with its entertainment -- spend your money elsewhere.<br/><br/>The potentially offensive subplot in question involves a villainous penguin who represents a quasi-religious figure, and who comes to stand for backwards thinking and bigotry. Two other ""penguins of faith"" are portrayed as a hoaxser (Lovelace) and dim-witted (Memphis).<br/><br/>The movie also fails in its casting; Robin Williams gets two roles and does neither very well, although his Lovelace James-Brown-meets-Jimmy-Swaggart is slightly better of the two. Hugh Jackman's Elvis schtick as Memphis is poorly done.<br/><br/>One of the movie's best features, the realism of the animation, actually hinders its execution. The penguins are completely realistic, but in doing so, the animators robbed all but Mumble of readable facial expressions. Considering that small children will make up much of the audience for this film, that's a critical shortcoming.<br/><br/>There are other issues, including the lack of character development for Anthony Lepaglia's character, and sea lions, seals and whales that show up just long enough to intrigue, then disappear.<br/><br/>On the good side, the soundtrack is a winner, the melding of live action and animation was sharply done, and the movie carries a message of non-judgmentalness concerning Mumble's uniqueness.<br/><br/>But the movie may go over the heads of many youngsters, and some scenes could be disturbing for some children -- hence, the PG rating.<br/><br/>If you're looking for cartoon movies with messages, see the excellent ""Over The Hedge"" or ""Cars"" instead."
"jdkraus","5","3","6","9 December 2006"," Great animation, but not animated in other aspects
","In this film, I expected every other animation film has had in the past: humor, a good story, talented voices, and great animation. This film, right of the bat has some of the most excellent animation I've ever seen on the big screen! Even more superb was the use of real-life footage of actual people moving around in the background, later on in the film. It was just fantastic.<br/><br/>Another aspect the film granted was a good morale story of a penguin named Mumble, who is isolated from his fellow penguins because he can't sing, which leads to his journey of exploring the icy slopes and landscapes of Antarctica, coming across very unusual obstacles, which leads to the battle between nature vs. man (I don't want to give away more of the story).<br/><br/>But what damaged the movie, in my mind was the lack of humor, and the film lacks it because the story intervenes with it. The story is so mature, that it invovles politics, global warming, and the whole deal with humans starving the animal kingdoms (the penguins in this case). This blackened the film, which looks like an ordinary kids film to a film of controversy that is not meant to be. And not to mention the talented voices, which were honestly nto that great. <br/><br/>Okay, Robin Williams was his usual self, but to break some hearts, he was extremely limited in the film, not as funny as he usually is, despite the fact that he does two very talented voices. Some other cast voices were good like: Hugh Jackman and Nichol Kidman, and the singing lyrics were good, but it involved a lot inappropriate inneuendo (the penguins talking abou sex, even though its left implied, but you get the idea of how physical they act around one another.) IT all felt weak compared to recent films like Madagascar or Over the Hedge. <br/><br/>Previously said, the humor was limited, and since it was limited, it wasn't that animated. (Even in the theater, I noticed kids dosing off because they weren't seeing any action.) Since this was all absent, the film dragged on and on, and my butt starting itching.<br/><br/>it was an okay film, but lacked the entertainment of making an animated film. my rating **1/2 out of **** this movie is not really for kids. The penguins may act all ""cute and cuddly"", but they aren't over the top hysterical."

","First some background on me: I'm a 15 year old filmmaker form Vancouver, BC. (also featured on Cinematical on Nov.4th ;) )<br/><br/>This film was AMAZING, and I don't care what others say. Everything, from the cinematography to the photorealistic-ness of it all was a real testament to what's possible with today's technology. Some parts were so effectively creepy, and the fact that this was made by a visual effects company was evident by the flawless water and environments. I really 'felt' like I was in Antarctica, away from all humans, and the water just 'felt' cold, something very rare in films; to actually be able to communicate environments and scale so well. <br/><br/>I'm so happy that the ads didn't tell the whole story - that would have ruined it for me, I think - the last bit of the movie was so jarring an unexpected, in the best way possible! I was so happy that the filmmakers didn't shy away from showing kids some stuff that they did near the end there (I really don't want to ruin it for anyone), but I can honestly say that that was extremely inspiring and, as a teen filmmaker myself, just taught me what a big difference camera moves can make while communicating story and emotion.<br/><br/>Overall, an excellent film, and definitely a recommended see! Should you take your kids to it? Be warned: If you do, all other animated films may seem too simplistic and boring. Elijah Wood + Robin Williams are great, and DANG can Brittany Murphy SING! That said, there are some pretty scary bits for the cinema, I guess, but this may be one of the first movies I actually buy on DVD. And maybe buy a nice, BIG HDTV for. Yeah.

I found it to be very amusing with a great and clever sense of humor. It had a great message (Possible spoiler)--that humans are overfishing and interfering with the food chain. People who have written that this is ""propaganda"" need to open their eyes and understand that this is actually reality. Furthermore, I found the religious humor hilarious and very true.

Yes, of course. Some hip music? Yes. But the plot just didn't seem to click. I found myself never getting engaged in the story. It was as if the movie's creators said ""Hey, wouldn't it be cool if we animated March of the Penguins"", then another said ""Yes, and wouldn't it be really neat if we could show penguins dancing to pop music"". Then someone said - ""now let's try to wrap it all up in some ""coming of age/fish out of water"" story + ""pro-environment"" message. Sure, each individual element sounds OK on paper, but they were asking too much to bring all these elements together. It just didn't click for me.<br/><br/>No doubt about it, the quality of the animation is superb. But beyond that, there wasn't much rewarding about this. The jokes were few and far between - and not that funny. The ""Latino"" penguins were too stereotypical for my tastes. But most of all, I'm disappointed that this film is mis-marketed as a sweet, cutesy picture about cute dancing penguins suitable for the Nemo audience. In reality, young kids won't get engaged in this plot like they did for the good Pixar flicks and the action sequences (particularly the seal chase) will leave them at risk for nightmares.

I already saw March of the Penguins, I don't want to see it again with them talking. And they had to use real people, what a way to ruin animation. Also for those religious folks out there, this may be the movie for you. I don't think the penguins have to sing, come on. I could watch The Incredibles and March of the Penguins over and over, but I had to walk out from the movie. But that's just me, check out other folks observations and comments.

","Excellent and well done. This movie has humor in it ranging from crude, adult humor to entertaining slapstick and kids humor, making the film very funny at times and melancholy at others. Hard to accomplish, but the Warner Brothers found a way to pull all of it together in ""Happy Feet"". The comic relief being neither to extraneous nor too single-audience oriented was very well scripted, and the talents of robin Williams shine once again.<br/><br/>The plot throughout the movie seemed to be rather unclear until one specific scene came along, though - twenty minutes or so into the movie. After the plot was introduced, it seemed to be no more than an irrelevant curiosity of a small number of the characters, ergo the plot was rather equivocal during much of the film and until the main character blatantly states his standing on the seemingly unimportant fact, turning the audience's attention in the general direction of the film. As the film turns to a conclusion, the last few scenes are rather ridiculous and unnecessary, and it seems as if the director and scriptwriters forgot to remember to construct and script a sufficient and / or montage resolution.<br/><br/>The ideas, characters, and music were superbly developed, thought out, and intertwined throughout the entire movie, and the musical-like scenes were very well done and perfectly animated as well. A very original and entertaining movie, just work out a few scenes and ""unrealistic"" patches and it'd be a nine out of ten; work a few scenes in and work out a few scenes and it'd be a ten out of ten."

","OK, the movie Happy Feet gets the 2 points - 1 for the music and 1 for the graphics. The rest of it stank. The plot was predictable, and I was actually looking forward to the ""tense/scary"" scenes others mentioned so it would at least wake me up. Didn't work.<br/><br/>The film was a vehicle for a very strong left wing environmental message about the evils of humans with our polluting and over harvesting of natural resources - we are the source of all the problems in the world.<br/><br/>Saw this flick with my husband, 2 kids - aged 15 & 11, and our friends (one with a master's degree in Nature Science) and their two kids - aged 13 & 9. Not one of us enjoyed ourselves. Live and learn, I guess. The ""anti-religious"" themes were not specific at all, more a jab at tradition and generation vs. generation.<br/><br/>So, unless you are a big PETA or GreenPeace supporter, I would avoid this movie. It is not a cute and funny movie about dancing penguins."
"benblue-2","3","3","7","1 January 2007"," Quality Sacrificed for Message
","Sadly, as a Christian, I see this all too often. It is nice however to see a ""secular"" film make the same mistake as the majority of ""Christian Filmmakers."" I'm talking about sacrificing quality to get a message across.<br/><br/>I said I'm a Christian. And yes, I am conservative. That being said, I've got nothing against preserving the Earth and its natural beauty. But when a movie is made with the express purpose of making humanity feel guilty about what we do to survive INSTEAD of trying to make a good movie, what's the point?<br/><br/>The story was weak and was made weaker still by the fact that the story itself took up only about 45 minutes of the film. The rest of the movie was made up of action scenes and music videos that had virtually nothing to do with the plot.<br/><br/>ON THE MUSIC VIDEOS...I felt that they tried to make an animated ""Moulin Rouge"" style musical starring Penguins and failed miserably. The song choices were pathetic. The only good choice was Queen's ""Somebody To Love"" and maybe the Stevie Wonder song. The rest of the songs were practically a Top Forty hodge-podge thrown into a blender and served with a side of cheese. It just didn't work.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the filmmakers made a crucial mistake when they decided that they were going to send a message. In getting that message across (which they most certainly did) they sacrificed the quality of what could have been a good movie. If they had simply made a good, solid, cute musical starring Penguins, it would have worked. But instead they decided that the MESSAGE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN QUALITY. And that killed it.<br/><br/>PS Some of the animation was absolutely beautiful. I wish they'd taken more creative liberty with the character modeling though."

","This film feels like it would have made a nice 8 minute short. But at full length, by god it's bad. I am not one of those Conservative nutters who are hating on this film for it's ""liberal"" conspiracy plot. Trying to teach h The Kids about the bad things mankind is doing to animals and the environment is noble and good. But could it not be done in a GOOD movie? The plot is ridiculous. The voice acting is passable at best (but why is Robin Williams voicing both of non-white characters?). The actual dancing is just silly, Mumble's supposedly impressive dancing seems to consist largely of him waving his foot in the air whilst they loop a clicking sound effect. The ending is more than a little preachy and they resolve all the problems of the film in a MONTAGE. It's a horrible mess of a film.

","I took my children and young cousin to see this movie and they, as well as myself loved it! My youngest child is five and she sat through the entire movie. From the reaction in the audience, it seemed that the adults enjoyed the movie more than the kids did. The singing was fantastic. And the Mexican penguins were too funny. Kudos to Robin Williams. You really couldn't tell that the accents were fake. He sounded very authentic. I would recommend this movie to everyone, even those people without children.

","Okay, I understand we all want to take our kids out to enjoy a cute animated film in the theater. This movie offers that. I think the greater strength is not its entertainment value, but its ability to illustrate and dramatize some truths about our society. The movie was obviously written to make some statements, and I liked those statements. Not to get too deep about this because it is entertaining --I left this movie saying, ""Wow. That was intense!""<br/><br/>Our kids did enjoy the film. I wish the director had kept children in mind and used more discretion with regard to Lovelace and his ""women"". Even some of the dance moves crossed the line of what is appropriate for children up to age 12 --- the penguins are human enough that some of the dance moves are blatantly sexual in nature.<br/><br/>Even with all of that, the fact that Mumble is true to himself, happy, socially conscious, good-natured (despite despicable treatment by so many of his own) and innocent gives this movie such a charming flair.<br/><br/>Children should see this with parental guidance.

"laxpenguin5","9","3","7","24 November 2006"," penguin costume anyone?
","I love penguins so much. I have since second grade when my teacher read us ""Mr. Popper's Penguins"". My friends all know i love penguins and every year I am flooded with pajamas, socks, toys...all penguins. When I first saw the trailer for this movie I nearly cried, I was so excited. I'm not sure if that's when i decided to get a penguin costume for Halloween or not but I did anyway. I wore it to school, and trick-or-treating and I won 'cutest costume' at a costume party. <br/><br/>I decided a month before the movie came out I would go to Opening Day wearing my costume and bring as many friends as I could. Well, November 17th came around-Opening Day (and my anniversary) and I was walking around school wishing everyone a Happy Penguin Day and telling them all to go to the theater later that day. I waddled through the parking lot and up to the doors. My friends all shrieked with joy and took pictures of me. People in the parking lot turned, confused and amused. I took a picture in front of a Happy Feet movie poster, in the same pose as Mumble. Just to be funny I asked for a different ticket to throw off the man working in the window-""I'd like one for Saw 3 please....No, no just kidding I'm a penguin! I want to go see Happy Feet."" He chuckled and I, sadly, gave him my $6 for my ticket. ( I had hoped my costume might win me a free ticket, or at least a small popcorn) I walked through the lobby with my 8 friends behind me. One child asked, ""Did you lose a bet or something?"" that one i ignored. People looked and pointed and I smiled and waved. <br/><br/>We got into the actual theater with my pop and goodies and i slowly ascended the stairs. One large step at a time. You should have heard the giggles from people eagerly awaiting the beginning of the movie. I sat down casually and waited too. It started and I smiled constantly. Not one part of the movie disappointed me. At the graduation party scene when one penguin tells everyone else to put their flippers in the air, I did as well. My friends looked at me and laughed. In another part, when Lovelace tells all the penguins to hug the penguin next to them, I hugged my boyfriend right next to me and encouraged everyone else to do it too. <br/><br/>At the end of the movie, my friends told me to get up and dance like Mumble. I wanted to but i told them i couldn't. They told me to do something so i did a heel click off the stairs. Apparently, that wasn't enough for them. So i did the Cotton Eyed Joe right in front of the screen. Meanwhile the cleanup staff were trying to do their work but I saw them peeking. I finished my dance and did a little bow at the end. We all went to the bathroom and my boyfriend waited outside. When the staff came out they were talking about me, he said, and how cute I was when I danced and how funny it was for me to dress up. Then he said they went and talked to the food staff after that. I walked out into the lobby after that and everyone was just staring. I panicked a little and then just casually waved like there was nothing peculiar going on. Finally, we left the theater and I waddled out to the car and hopped on in, avoiding the puddle underneath the door to the best of my penguin abilities. Monday at school, everyone had heard about my courageous adventure and they said how funny it must have been to see me. <br/><br/>But the moral of this comment is, this is a great movie and it brings families, friends, and complete strangers closer and gives them something they can all smile about, no matter what mood you're in or what age you are."

"superduperspit","8","3","7","22 November 2006"," A very original and imaginative film!
","At first, it may be easy to pass ""Happy Feet"" off as just another random computer-animated offering from a year crowded by the genre. However, despite a familiar premise (outcast finds acceptance), ""Happy Feet"" is a surprisingly fresh, exuberant film, and among the cream of the massive 2006 animation crop. The only thing that stops ""Happy Feet"" from becoming an instant classic is a misstep in the third act. However, disappointing finale or not, ""Happy Feet"" is the kind of movie with such a large heart that it is all but impossible not to like.<br/><br/>If there's one thing ""Happy Feet"" is in great supply of, it's ""liveliness."" With the exception of Pixar's ""Cars,"" ""Happy Feet"" is the most ambitious animated film of the year, and judging from the well-done story telling and impressive visuals, one might even mistake it for Pixar's latest offering, a testimony to how far the non-Pixar companies are coming in the quest to replicate the things that make Pixar great. The filmmakers set out to do a great deal of film deeds with ""Happy Feet,"" and succeed with a number of them.<br/><br/>The visual effects in ""Happy Feet"" are also well worth mentioning. The Antarctic setting is breathtaking in its presentation. The choreography of the singing and dancing sequences is extraordinary to watch, as it is done so expertly one might mistake it for a live action sequence if not for the fact that it features penguins. There are also action scenes that are very impressive, such as that of a sea leopard chasing Mumble, Mumble and the amigos sliding down large mountains, and an escape from a killer whale. The visuals in ""Happy Feet"" have a wow factor ideal for the most prominent display possible (which, in the case of ""Happy Feet,"" is IMAX, where it is showing, but in 2-D, as opposed to the 3-D that other animation products ""The Ant Bully"" and ""Open Season"" showed in).<br/><br/>For the most part, the voices work. Elijah Wood is appropriately cast as the brave, but unsure hero Mumble. Though it seems Wood was cast because of his role as Frodo Baggins in the ""Lord of the Rings"" films, it ends up working well for the film. Robin Williams is entertaining and over-the-top as always in three voice roles (Lovelace, Ramon, and the Narrator, who may actually be Lovelace), showing viewers a sign of comedic life that has been lacking with his 2006 efforts, which included the laugh-free ""RV"" and serious-toned misfire ""The Night Listener."" Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, and Nicole Kidman all work in their roles, though they don't stand out as Wood and Williams do.<br/><br/>However, as mentioned above, the third act of ""Happy Feet"" features quite a significant misstep that ends up souring what could have been instant classic status for the film. Instead of offering a real solution or continuing the uniqueness of the rest of the film, the writers opt to give an anti-climactic, uneventful ending that tries to dodge clichés, but ends up becoming one, indirectly. The ending seems just a tad bit incomplete, as if the filmmakers just threw something together, which is a stark contrast to the rest of the movie, which had planning, layout, and most importantly, execution that was nothing short of intricate. It should also be noted that though computer-animated human beings often tend to look clunky when done by computer, live action humans should not be the alternative in a movie that is otherwise completely computer-animated. In fact, real, live action settings have no place in computer animation. It doesn't show realism; it instead displays laziness.<br/><br/>However, despite whatever misstep it may take, there's no denying that ""Happy Feet"" is a unique film full of life that is slowly being drained from the computer animation sub-genre that once displayed perhaps the most uniqueness. It's a film that is difficult not to like, and a fun film for viewers of wide age demographics (though it is advised for parents to heed the PG rating- as the film is a bit intense for moviegoers under the age of six or seven) that is as much fun for children as it is for older moviegoers. In the computer-animated battle that seemingly every studio has been in on in 2006, Warner Bros has made quite an improvement over maiden outing ""The Ant Bully"", and with ""Happy Feet,"" has crafted an enjoyable, irresistible film that ends up near the very head of the yearly animation pack.<br/><br/>Review posted by W.

","This is a very visually impressive movie. I saw it on the Imax and really thought the visuals were well done. <br/><br/>Now going into the movie, I knew nothing about it other than that It was about Penquins and there was some dancing. That's it. After the first 5 minutes I was just totally unimpressed. While the movie is visually great, the story is what really suffers. It seems like the movie was really rushed out because of the current popularity of penguins.<br/><br/>The story itself is unconventional, not necessarily in a bad way, but in a uninteresting way. The whole ""heart song"" aspect was particularly difficult for me to swallow. It made the movie seems like a large itunes commercial. The story's flow was also very inconsistent. They started at with one theme and tried to add too many others thus making everything underdeveloped. If you asked me 15 minutes in what the movie was about and 15 minutes before the movie ended, I would have had 2 totally different answers for you. The movie had a message to it, but it seemed like an after thought.<br/><br/>All in all the movie was visually cute. If you go to see dancing penguins you won't be disappointed. However the movie itself is very predicable and trying to do too many things to actually make it a good movie."
"pattonisgreat1944","5","3","7","19 November 2006"," Beautiful and rhythmic, but lacks original story
","Here's a film that keeps your attention simply by its sheer beauty and rhythm. And....that's about it.<br/><br/>George Miller's ""Happy Feet"" is one groovin' flick, chock full of rapturous R'n'B dance sequences brought to us from the frozen wastelands of Antartica, performed by thousands of chillin' penguins. They hop, jump, sing like they're in a music vid, and dance n' move better than any Hollywood choreographer could ever get people to do. Some of them do actually make you want to sing or tap (take your pick) along with them.<br/><br/>This is all wrapped in some of the best animation I've ever seen. Snow moves under the penguins' feet. Blizzards are incredibly dense particle effects. The lighting is masterful. The detail on the faces of seals and orcas are almost sickly good. The scope of some FX shots are simply awesome. They just make you go ""WOW!"" <br/><br/>But that's about all there is to the film. The story is standard animation film fair at best, and finally resorts to save-the-animals-environmental wishwash. <br/><br/>We follow, from birth, a cute little penguin named Mumble (Elijah Wood), who was stricken with a defect that made him unable to sing along with all the other penguins. Singing, you see, is the way that these penguins attract a mate. The film opens with a slightly dirty dance sequence with a bunch of guy 'guins chasing after a ""chicka"". (This was a little marring in a animated PG flick.) Mumble's only gift is an unstoppable tap-dancing talent that other penguins see as a disgrace. So Mumble is an outcast, rejected by all the other youthful, vocally well-endowed penguins. He is chased by a seal and runs into a group of seriously- kewl hombre penguins, lead by the swaggering, Carlos Mencia-like Ramone (Robin Williams). They think Mumble's tapping abilities are the bomb, so they agree to help him gain back respect from the other penguins. That happens pretty smoothly, with the help of a huge musical number. <br/><br/>Then the story jumps into environmentalist humans-are-evil mode. Apparently, there is a dire fish shortage, and somehow Mumble is accused of causing it (the movie never really makes this point clear). So Mumble goes on a huge journey to tell the humans to stop fishing in Antartica. This adventure takes up a surprisingly small amount of screen time, possibly because the first story wasn't enough to make an entire movie. The screenwriter needed to add a little something more. Unfortunately, the film ends with the completion of the age- old formula. Animals win the hearts of the people, they're saved, we're all happy, cue big musical number, roll them credits. <br/><br/>This is REALLY unfortunate, because the movie had such rhythm, style and beauty that if they had taken the time to inject some Pixar-caliber characters and an original story, the movie would have been simply marvelous."

","This movie really surprised me. I was expecting it to be good, but instead, I found it to be great.<br/><br/>It incorporates so much music from several eras of popular music, and it features gorgeous animation. Top that off with a story and characters that are endearing without being buffoonish or sappy, and you have Happy Feet.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away any plot elements, for the story is simple yet effective.<br/><br/>The music element sort of reminded me of Shark Tale -- remember that animated movie with Will Smith as the voice of one of the fish? The differences, however, are many. I thought that the Shark Tale movie was a little ridiculous with characters that were not sympathetic or endearing in the least. The story was also a bit stupid, in my opinion.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is a totally different kind of movie. Yes, the plot vehicle is not wholly original, but the execution is flawless, and the voices are perfectly suited to each character.<br/><br/>This movie is ideal for any family member old enough to sit through a feature-length film. One of the best I've seen this entire year! Go see Happy Feet. You will not be disappointed."

It would be very easy to lose the 30 min. ecological message that seemed to be thrown in -- it doesn't show up til the ending of the movie and it doesn't fit with the fun stuff at the beginning.<br/><br/>I'm glad to have seen this and my 6 year old liked it -- she even said in the middle ""Is it done yet?"" I'd recommend seeing this at home where you can skip the stuff the kids don't understand and keep with the fun music and dancing."

They've turned the animated show from teen-like humorous to completely stupid and disgraceful. Happy feet has some good treats for the family & children & people should love how Mumble find a way to the humans. I hate the fact that Shark Tale has become more of a drug user/weed smoker teens & losers who have no life ever. Ocar's become less funny and has become more childish.

"jyoung-49","3","2","4","28 September 2007"," The thing that saddened me the most...
","The thing that saddened me the most about the film, is that I did not care about any of the characters. I felt no warmth towards them, unlike other notable animations in recent years. It's sad but, I felt more concern for a big green, bigoted, farting ogre than these fluffy creatures. Also, as pointed out by many, many others, this is not really a suitable film for very young children, even though we where lead to believe otherwise. On a more positive note, some of the animation depicting the ice floes, space and sea where some of the best I've seen. However this does not make up for the fuzzy plot, lack of characterisation and warmth in this so called children's film."
"eched","1","2","4","23 April 2007"," A point to a film is well needed, but do you really have to beat me over the head with it?
","Is this movie about a penguin who can't sing, but can dance and becomes an outcast because of it? Why yes. Is it a light hearted film that you just sit back with? Why yes. Is the 3D animation better then ever. Yep.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is exactly what the adds for it promised, for the first 50 minutes, and it's not hath bad either. After those are done though the film just transforms into a completely different show.<br/><br/>Ya see, the film has a bone to pick with the fishing industry for over fishing and causing many species of fish to go nearly extinct. Well, this is a good bone to pick and if the film wants to make an argument against these guys it should go right ahead, but the film becomes so obsessed with this theme that it becomes no longer a theme, it becomes the plot of the film, and the original plot of this little penguin not being able to fit in isn't only forgotten, it's thrown right out the window.<br/><br/>As a result the thing feels like two different films mixed together. One is the light hearted thing I was expecting, and the other is an in your face one sided documentary that is more blunt in its point then a South Park episode(not making fun of that series. It just gives you a good idea of how dedicated this show is to its theme.) In short, the second hath of the film just bashes your head in with its theme, again, and again, and again. It just keeps on going on about until you can't take it anymore. It simply shoves its own view point down your throat, and as a result you end up with a bad taste in your mouth.<br/><br/>And that's the film in a nut shell. One big long rant that I wasn't up for.<br/><br/>Also adding onto this is the painfully out of place anti Christian themes. The Pagan comment that is thrown in just for the heck of it really came out of left field and right out makes no sense. Come on Warren Coleman, please tell me? How in the world is Mumble symbolic of the Pagan faith? I'm waiting.<br/><br/>Like really, how? Heck, he's more symbolic of being gay then anything. I know you may be thinking I'm nuts right now, but if you have seen the film just take a deep breath and actually think about it. It oddly makes a bit of sense. Hey, if Mumble was symbolic of being gay then all the anti Christian stuff would be kind of fitting, though still to rude and blunt for me.<br/><br/>And yes, I'm not over thinking things, the film is pretty anti Christian, and hey, if they had a good enough argument against that faith they can make it, but what in the world does the Christian religion have to do with the fishing industry? Ya see what I mean. The Christian stuff is just kind of there and has absolutely nothing to do with the main point of the film. So please, save that debate for a different movie. It just doesn't make any sense here.<br/><br/>Anyways, you get what I mean. The film is just really messed up with its point of view.<br/><br/>And what was with using real human actors at the end? Seriously, what was with that? In short, this film isn't for kids. What kid in their right mind enjoys having a heavy symbolic theme bashed into their head? Plus there's a tone of sexual related comedy that is so blunt everyone can get it.<br/><br/>1 out of 10. Right now, I sure wouldn't mind living in a world without penguins."

It just doesn't flow, and I found myself quietly seething when YET ANOTHER song 'n' dance routine started up, getting in the way of the plot - well, I *think* it was a plot? The reason I'm not sure about the story is that I had great difficulty understanding the dialogue. It was indistinct and often very 'mumbly'. I honestly couldn't tell what the characters were saying! Finally, can we *please* see an end to these films which attempt to plant politically-correct ideas in our children's' heads? It's getting very wearisome now.

","I'm sure it would have been o.k. a couple years ago, but it turns out that most people have a penguin limit and most of us reached it before this movie came out. Bad luck, but there it is - any normal person (if normal people have seen at least two other penguin related movies in the last year) will take about 15 minutes of this - what with the singing and bathetic attempts at emotional involvement - before they have to turn it off or decapitate themselves just to make it stop. Whoever decided that penguins were easy enough to anthropomorphisize that we could just start telling whichever stories occurred to us using penguins in lieu of people was sadly mistaken. There was a similar run on dolphin stories when I was a kid, one with whales a few years later, and one that ended very poorly involving dinosaurs not long ago.

"trinatee357","6","2","4","15 January 2007"," Savion Glover the true star of the film ""Happy Feet:""
","I give props to Savion Glover the true STAR of the film ""Happy Feet"". Overall I was disappointed by the subliminal race messages in the film. The hero of the story is the sole penguin with a white face and blue eyes. The humans depicted in film are almost all white. The message I got from the film besides the environmental message is to celebrate diversity and tolerance. So why didn't the film producer/film maker do this by hiring African Americans actors. There is no African American actors voiced in this film. I felt the film had a lot of African American derivatives plus dance is deeply rooted in the African American community. The CD is full of tap-dancing music from the Beach Boys to R&B hits made most famous by Prince and Stevie Wonder. In a full-page ""Happy Feet"" advertisement in The New York Times there is a giant picture of Mumble. The stars who provide the characters' voices (Elijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman and Hugo Weaving) are listed twice, once in the middle of the page above the title and again down below but no mention whatsoever of Savion Glover. Since the entire plot is base on dance, I am shocked the director-producers Mr. Miller gave so little billing to Savion Glover. He is the greatest living tap-dancer. Savion is Mumble's tap-dancing master moves. If it wasn't for Savion, I don't think there will be a ""Happy Feet"". The Macaroni/Amigos penguins (Mexican penguins) that really steal the show. Yes, I found myself LOL but did I laugh for the right reasons. I was bothered by the ethic and sexual stereotyping. The film is full of stereotypes that all Mexican are short, a different species and are really silly party-loving animals. All females swayed their hips and breathe heavy to get a man. Don't get me wrong Elijah Wood does an excellent job as Mumble but clearly Savion's dance moves is what the film is base on.

","The songs in the movie could have been a nice addition to an nice movie, but is instead the framework around which a patchwork that should be a movie arises. Then after somewhat more then an hour the creators are out of money and end the story without any logic between upcoming events in a few minutes. The watcher is left behind with the feeling he must eat somewhat more fish to be sure the penguins will starve and save the world from a prequel to this movie. Some characters are fun. This does, however, not include the main character and his beloved. Why she loves him isn't clear at all, but that can be said about many other things in the movie as well."

","I read this line(Summary) in a review once and for me, it explained the reason why this movie made more money than Casino Royal at the box office. This is for me a perfect example off a Christmas holiday family movie. The story is fairly minimal in terms of the Humans vs Pinguins. The thing that makes the movie good is for me the singing !! Offcourse the singing, every time you see those penguins going at it, you just keep laughing and laughing. Thumbs up for the voice actors : Hugh Jackman, Nicole kidman , Brittany Murphy and last but certainly not least ROBIN WILIAMS !! He makes the movie funny off course, with his Ramon character stealing the show. It will never be anything like a Pixar animation movie but it's still very entertaining. Also the graphics are of the highest quality again. ( the snow storm !! ) and I like those cute little penguins... oohhh<br/><br/>I have one negative point I like to add. The way they wanted to mix the 2 story lines : on the one hand you have all penguins that sing their song, one who can't and tap dances his way into a girl penguins heart...and on the other hand you have the political matter of the humans that are responsible for their fish shortage and that has to be stopped... OK OK , no problem.. in the end the movie worked... but the way the had to pull strings to make the 2 stories into 1 again was pretty lame ... releasing a penguin with a transmitter after he's captured..come on...<br/><br/>But aside from that I found it a very amusing, romantic, funny, family animation picture for the whole family !!<br/><br/>8/10"
"teenagemutantninjapeter","6","2","4","10 December 2006"," at least the animation was good...
","Being that I am a huge fan of penguins and virtually everything penguin-related, I knew as soon as I heard about ""Happy Feet"" that I would end up seeing it. Once I finally came across a trailer for it, and watched the trailer, I was even more excited. So some friends and I decided to go see it.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is well done. The script is funny, the characters are well developed, and the imagery is extraordinary. My only problem with this part of the movie is that there are too many songs crammed into it.<br/><br/>When the movie goes into the second half, it gets a lot more serious and there is an overplayed attempt to get a message across. The characters' quest is a little cheesy, and I was very disappointed by the end of the film.<br/><br/>The animation is amazing throughout the entire movie, but the end sort of kills it. I can't see young kids enjoying the last bit at all, and it seems like that would be the target audience. So, all in all, I'd call this a movie that had potential... until the writers took a big dump all over the end of it."

","This is one of the best, most creative movies i've seen in a very long time. Seldom does a movie come along that is fit for the whole family, kids will love this film and there are plenty of jokes in it for the parents and even the teens (although they'll probably pretend to dislike a movie about musical dancing penguins) Any of the idiots claiming that this film is liberal are simply paranoid imbeciles. Why environmental concerns are deemed liberal is beyond me. Some people think this film is inappropriate for children, claiming homosexual, anti-religious, and liberal undertones.

"aworldtouched","9","2","4","4 December 2006"," ""I'm Happy. They're Happy Too.""
","""Happy Feet"" is one of the best films of the year. With a star-studded cast, a killer soundtrack and beautiful animation, it has raised the bar for all future CGI films.<br/><br/>With people like Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, Hugh Jackman and Robin Williams, the movie was bound to have great comedic timing and flow. Trying to point out any particular part that stood out would be difficult to do, however, I can say with confidence that there are moments of both physical comedy as well as some one-liner zingers.<br/><br/>The eclectic amalgamation of music is something I didn't think would flow too well, but the music team has done an excellent job coordinating melodies in a way somewhat reflective of ""Moulin Rouge."" With it's sweeping landscapes and ever-more-approaching-realistic realism, the animations of the movie are the best I have yet seen in any fully-CGI movie. This movie really captures the flow of the different species of animals, but still allows for the personification of the actors. My only complaint with this is when the humans are on screen. Combining the real with the animated in this movie was a bold step, unfortunately it took me out of the world of the movie.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I did not think I would like this film. I liken my apprehension to the apprehension I had to go see ""Cast Away,""...<br/><br/>""What kind of plot or dialog is there going to be with a guy stuck on an island?"" ""What kind of plot or dialog is there going to be with a bunch of dancing penguins?"" Luckily, in both cases, I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Quick Plot Synopsis: In a society of Penguins where singing is how you find your mate, Mumble is unlucky as he can't carry a tune but the li'l bugger can dance up a storm. He becomes a social outcast amongst his community and seeks answers to life elsewhere. In the process he hears about strange ""aliens"" who have giant machines and who have been abducting animals. Mumble believes that these aliens might be the cause of the food shortage, instead of the community's belief that the ""Penguin Mother"" is simply denying them food. This heretical theory forces him into exile, but he vows to make the long journey to try to discover where these aliens are, and to convince them to stop hurting his friends and family.<br/><br/>Three social issues are topics of this movie: Being an outcast, Religious Fanaticism, and Humans' effects on the environment.<br/><br/>Whether or not we admit it, everyone has felt like an outsider at one point. Mumbles' struggles with his tone-deaf-but-toe-tapping self are the struggles we have all felt if we ever believed in something those around us did not.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Happy Feet"" has some overtones directed at religions... not any particular ones, mind you, simply religious fanaticism and the evils and pitfalls of them. This should only be an issue with religious fanatics as it does target the core of their beliefs. If that is you, that is fine ~ embrace your thing, but penguins arguing that the ""Great Giver"" is the punishing them for having a tap dancer in their midst is funny no matter how you slice it.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Happy Feet"" does target humans' selfish behaviors by displaying how we can destroy an ecosystem without batting an eye. But realistically, are you going to say that you think a movie that teaches kids to consider the repercussions of their actions is a BAD thing?"
"AnimatedEvey12","8","2","4","3 December 2006"," Does it cause toe-tapping? Indeed it does.
","WOW, cool film I think it has stunning animation compared to most films today. I hope it wins the Oscar for Best Animated Feature, though many people are saying it won't. But I sure hope so.<br/><br/>The story is about Mumble, a penguin who can't sing but has the ability to dance. The other penguins treat him as an outcast and he gets banned from his land because he can't sing. He then teams up with the amigos and learns to accept himself. At the same time it shows a good message about the environment.<br/><br/>I hope people who think that they'd rather see James Bond would take the time to go SEE this movie and NOT JUDGE it. This movie is worth the money to go see. And by the end of the film I kept on toe-tapping =)"

","What a great movie! It started slowly and I was wondering whether it would ever get started, but once it did it had me enthralled. Excellent graphics, brilliant song track and voices, and a fantastic holiday season movie. What is even more important is the underlying messages in the movie. Messages about accepting those who may be different to us, and the importance of conservation. Even deeper are comments on religion and superstition. I recommend this movie to everybody - not just the children. We can all be entertained by this film and, what's more important, we can all learn something from it too. 10/10 from me - a brilliant movie with no faults."

","I would very rarely rate a movie 10/10, but this was worth it.<br/><br/>In short this film has it all, Comedy, drama, love, music, visual fx, action and most of all a brilliant story. <br/><br/>The story is mainly about being different and being fine with it, different makes us unique. The story is not like some of the films handling the same topic, nor is it like any other animation. It stands out completely since it has more of a human touch to it. Human Touch? Although the movie is a bout Penguins a lot of the cultural and human problems we face daily is being addressed. The movie brings a message of hope and really opens once heart to these penguins. <br/><br/>Yes its animation, but not all of it. A lot of the background scenes is photography and is brilliantly blended into the story.<br/><br/>In life we get judged so easily when we are different, and when we face challenges, but when we are true to ourselves we really can be free.<br/><br/>When a small penguin can make a difference, not give up and go to ends for his friends, So can we.<br/><br/>This truly is a brilliant movie."
"schneesmom-1","10","2","4","2 December 2006"," Great message, but not for the sheep
","This movie is definitely not for kids. That's why it has a PG rating, folks!! The message was one I was glad to see someone had the guts to say. I loved the fact that not only was it a statement about the environment (with, the unrealistic scenes of, as someone else already mentioned, humans doing the right thing at the end???) but about difference and how humans deal with it. The movie was realistic in how it showed the mindless masses turning to religion rather than thinking to solve their problems. The poke at blind following rather than leading was also a good one, especially given the current political climate in America.<br/><br/>The animation was great and the big dance scenes resembling Riverdance were very cool. This movie was meant for thinking people, so I guess those who blindly adhere to the ideas that religion and government will solve all of the problems in the world should not spend the money."

","I went and saw this movie on a Sunday night so there were like 20 people in the entire theater...not many kids...so I actually got to sit down, relax, and watch it. When I was watching the trailers for this movie I just laughed! Just watching the penguin dance gave me the giggles. Then I went and saw the movie and I laughed through the entire thing! When Mumbles first hatched and said that he was happy and his father asked him what was wrong with his feet and he said that they were happy too...I just laughed and laughed! It was the cutest movie i've seen yet this year. Now it might be a little scary for some of the younger kids...it got a little tense every once in awhile...but I would definitely pay to see it again. It just gave me a good feeling inside. The penguins seem almost human. I also think that this movie is a good way to raise awareness about what is happening to the penguins. Now, granted the movie was a little longer than I thought it would be...but I never once checked my cell phone to see what time it was and that is a sure fire way to know that a movie is good. I would definitely have to say that everyone should see this movie...it's not just for kids! Actually teenagers might like it better...they would understand more of it than a five year old would! It's the must-see-movie of the season! I suggest you go see for yourself!!!!"

When I left the theater, I felt so excited and happy. It really made my day.<br/><br/>I don't have kids, but I can see how some children will absolutely love the huge singing and dancing scenes, be scared by the predator parts and not understand the environmental issue parts. Any sexual innuendoes are subtle enough that a child would have to be pretty sophisticated to ""get it."" It seemed more like LOVE than sex or mating.

","Happy Feet was just a pure joy to sit through. It had everything a movie should have- great music, lots of laughs, a little drama, great actors for the voices, action, cute animals...hello penguins?!, and lastly great messages to us. Kids will enjoy this movie because of the penguins and music, but more importantly it shows them that you can be different than all the other kids, but they are still special in their own way! Then for us adults, well you'll get the message at the end. To put it simple, this world wasn't made just for us humans who have a tendency to think we rule the earth and can do whatever we want.

","There are so many things about this movie that made it amazing. For starters the voice actors all well known and well respected actors. I forgot to mention Robin Williams doing the voice of a Spanish penguin. I don't know if I have ever laughed so hard watching an animated movie.<br/><br/>This movie is not meant for little kids. It is not curious George with penguins and your 5 year old will not understand anything past dancing penguins. There are many sexual references verbally and visually. To some they may seem inappropriate but to me they were hilarious. I could not get enough of this movie, namely robin Williams, i went to see it twice.<br/><br/>If you're an adult you may not like it because most adults are snooty and over opinionated. If you're a teenager or a preteen, go see this movie. You will love it just as much as I did. I cannot stop quoting this movie and it is driving my family mad. On top of all the hilarity what it boils down to is that it opens our eyes to a world we can only speculate about. You will walk away from with movie with a plain and simple statement running around in your head. Preserve wildlife, especially penguins. Go see it, you'll love it."
"rupertgrint_roxmysocks","10","2","4","28 November 2006"," A movie that all age groups will enjoy!
","Happy Feet is one of the best animated films yet. Robin Williams does a brilliant job with all three of his characters: Lovelace, Ramon, and Cletus. Ramon's character is brilliant and is knock your socks off funny. Brittany Murphy's singing is amazing, and you find yourself asking why she does not make a CD. Throughout the film you are taken on a wonderful journey. Although animated this movie does show how the life of penguins really is. Minus the singing and dancing of course.<br/><br/>And who would of guessed that Hugh Jackman was such a good singer. While Nicole Kidman on the other hand is very well known for her vocals because of the hit movie Moulin Rouge, I must admit I did not recognize her at all. She sounded like a completely different person to me rather she was singing or talking. Although I would catch teeny weeny glimpses of her voice here and there. I must say the entire cast did an amazing job. Mind my surprise when I found out that Elizabeth Daily did the voice of Baby Mumble.<br/><br/>I thought this movie was amazing, and it can not only be enjoyed by children but by all age groups."

","Now this is a movie....despite it just being a cartoon, I think The Simpsons taught us that cartoons may be animated but be more relatable then most nonanimated media! I'm an animal lover and conservationist, also a music lover down to my bones so this movie was sheer perfect in my eyes. I loved how it didn't just portray happy little penguins, the movie showed that penguins fight to survive in a world where they are both predator and prey. I also loved how the movie had a real soul, not just musically but you felt the penguins plight to get figure out why their main source of food (fish) had grown so scarce. Not only did the movie have a soul the animation was the best I have seen since Shrek and it even made the Shrek animation look like it was from the 1950s....this movie was by far superior on all levels.

","In the words of the nine year old I took with me 'It was thumbs sideways'.<br/><br/>Happy Feet, like The Incredibles, is a cartoon with nuances that play to adults. This is an adults cartoon. Using many catchy tunes that adults grew up with, and most kids never heard, this story is cute but ultimately not targeted towards kids. The movie is a bit long with a number of scenes that could be shortened or cut out.<br/><br/>The MPAA should mark not only the recommended age range in the PG ratings but also require the producers to say who the target audience is. I know many children will not be excited after this movie from the combination of adult themes and the long running time.<br/><br/>As a cartoon for adults, I also have to say it is 'thumbs sideways'."

"filipemanuelneto","5","0","0","14 June 2020"," It's a good movie, but it collapses completely in the final 45 minutes.
","Once upon a time there was a land in Antarctica where penguins knew how to sing wonderfully to mate... once upon a time there was a penguin who did not know how to sing but, instead, danced tap dancing wonderfully. Once upon a time, there was an animated film with penguins (another one) that wanted to tell an incredible story but didn't know how to finish it.<br/><br/>In short, this is how the plot of this film comes down, another one that uses penguins to attract the children, which has a predilection for this cute and friendly animal. The film intelligently addresses group social behaviour, the creation of patterns, what is acceptable or unacceptable in a community, social exclusion and the acceptance of what is different, and the film is excellent at exploring all of this and gives rise to many interesting moral lessons for the minds of children and young people. But, if we exclude this more didactic and formative point, the script is very thin and hardly sustains an 100 minutes feature film. To make matters worse, the script was unable to decently complete the story: the main character's journey to the human world is something so unrealistic and unlikely that it completely destroys the film.<br/><br/>The voice actors all did a good job, especially Elijah Wood, the veteran of the 1000 voices Robin Williams, and also Brittany Murphy. The visual quality of the animation is very good, but the use of digital resources, CGI and mass computing already made this to be expected, as it is the new standard of modern animated cinema. The film knows how to use light and color very well. The characters were designed to appeal to the little ones and look cute, making the film profitable and giving rise to a merchandising machine eager to make the children ask their parents for anything with a penguin on it. Strongly based on music, the film has a lot of rhythm and the soundtrack is probably one of the richest in the animated movies that decade, but it is a soundtrack heavily based on well-known songs and covers by artists like Elvis, Prince, Earth Wind & Fire etc. As far as I can tell, the film has few or no original songs. Still, it is a good soundtrack and an excellent film, good enough to win the Oscar for Best Animated Film, in that distant year of 2007."

As a result, Mambo and his father had a big fight, until they encountered another penguin group-Adelie penguins, they found the lost confidence, and truly discovered the inherent advantages and love of dancing, so they were completely new. This also made Mambo, who was once cowardly and inferior, feel the new meaning of life and find his life love. To sum up in one sentence, Mambo's life is-God closed a door for you, and he will definitely open a window for you.<br/><br/>Then came the second conflicting point of the film: the emperor penguins believed that the shortage of food was caused by Mambo's disrespect, and Mambo insisted that this was caused by a mysterious ethnic group. As a matter of course, Mambo and Adelie penguin friends embarked on a journey of exploration. Mambo alone went deep into human beings and became part of the human tourism industry.

They are fighting against the cold, they are fighting against the natural enemies, they are fighting against hunger... But they are happy because they are living in their own world. But when we see mumble being locked up in a place similar to an aquarium, when it runs into walls, It's sad to hear that humans are arguing that they are just animals in Antarctica.

This is an inspirational film. This is a story about an ugly duckling turning into a swan. It's a lonely little penguin who can't be understood. He pushed open the window of the whole penguin world.
This is a movie called communication. Whether it is for parents and children, or a close lover. There is also the collision of music and dance, the dialogue between the penguin world and the human world-this is really a difficult problem."

George Miller has proven that he can direct a fine animated film with a gripping and emotional story. Animal Logic are very particular with their animation making sure that all the colours, details, motion and textures are as crisp as possible.<br/><br/>The writing is also sharp and very funny with some very good voice talent including a cameo from Steve Irwin. The film turns from a musical, to an adventure film and then gets surprisingly dark towards the end with an ending that is equally emotional as it is uplifting.

","'Happy Feet' won the Oscar for best animated feature back in 2006 over the much more popular 'Cars'. While both were equally good, but I do the feel the strong message and catchy music of 'Happy Feet' gave it slight advantage. 'Happy Feet' is the tale of a dancing penguin 'Mumble' who gets rejected by the society which considers singing as penguin-thing and dancing as something horrid. Mumble's singing is quite pathetic and thus decides to leave the society. Well the story line may follow the typical ""odd-different guy finds his true potential and becomes hero"" path still the number of interesting characters and lively songs keep you hooked. The voice- cast is splendid with likes of Elijah Wood, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams, etc. The screenplay later delivers a strong environmental message with the penguins not having any fish to eat due human interference. But I feel the film should have been about 10-15 minutes short as the pace tedious in the first 45 minutes.The animation is simply beautiful, watching thousands of penguins dance together in a wave was really a wow-moment. 'Happy Feet' finally with heart-warming story and beautiful animation is worth a shot!<br/><br/>RATING: [3/5]"

","Even though the story is a little jumbled and the message is a little too obvious, the animation quality and incredible voice cast make this a treat for kids and their parents. The story is about Mumble, born into a colony of penguins that woo each other through song, but unable to sing himself. Instead, he knows how to tap dance, which makes him somewhat of an outcast. At the same time, the fish supply is dwindling. After being banished, he goes on an adventure to figure out why the fish are disappearing. If that description makes it seem like the plot is a little confused at times, that's because it is. The movie felt like a mash-up of two movies instead of one. The first half is about Mumble's attempts to fit in, while the second half goes into an almost preachy mode about humanity's impact on the environment. Still, the penguins are so charming that the kids probably won't mind and their are a wealth of singing and dancing sequences that are sure to put a smile on your face. Overall, while the story isn't the tightest and the environmental message might be a little heavy-handed, everything else about the movie screams quality entertainment, for kids and parents alike."

"Horst_In_Translation","6","0","0","18 August 2014"," Not perfect, but entertaining funny and lots of depth
","I watched this for the first time not too long ago as double feature with the Academy Award winning documentary ""March of the Penguins"". While the Academy Award winner for Best Animated Feature ""Happy Feet"" was certainly the weaker of the two, it still has its pros. I will come to that later. Lets continue with an interesting snippet that ""Happy Feet"" is from the director and writer of the Mad Max movies starring Mel Gibson, although he got help from two lesser known actors as co-directors.<br/><br/>The film starts right away in a funny manner with Mumble dancing in the egg and goes on by touching all family relationships of the central character, such as his mother, father, girlfriend, but also his interactions with penguin friends and humans. I especially liked the way humans are included. Always a difficult approach for animated movies, but they succeeded well here, much better than in Wall-E for example. The change from animation to live action was truly well done and I particularly liked the way when the perception is switched and we see and hear the transformation in speech, the way the humans perceive Mumble. This is one of the factors that makes the scene in the zoo truly sad. Add to that the illusions he has about his family of course.<br/><br/>The central character, color-wise, looks like a young penguin from start to finish. This not only helps to distinguish him from the many other penguins in the film, but also adds lots of cuteness. One of my favorite scenes early on is when we see Mumble in music lessons (with a truly funny teacher) and all the other kids are laughing. All the others? No. His love interest is not, which is quite a major point implying the direction into which this film develops. The songs and choice of music is not exactly my cup of tea, but that's just personal perception and still I believe they fitted the scenes nicely most of the time.<br/><br/>One scene that did not work too well in my opinion was the one where Mumble has the talented mini penguin sing for his girlfriend. The way she reacts angrily just feels over the top and not credible to the extent that you start to wonder if she really is the right girl for him. This mini penguin and his friends provide decent comic relief and keep the film from getting too serious for an animated movie. One of these more serious parts is Mumble's relationship to his dad. There's several scenes that focus on their interactions, just like near the end where his mother tells him to dance with his father (had to think of Luther Vandross) and also earlier when Mumble looks at his father thinking he is going to step up for him, but dad does the exact opposite. You could also add the egg-falling-down scene very early in the movie, although I did not perceive it as that significant as it tried to be.<br/><br/>Aside from the mini-penguins, the film truly has quite a bit serious tension. Another almost tragic scene is when Mumble pushes away and insults his girl to protect her. As much as Mumble stood out thanks to his looks, I had occasionally difficulties to define who is who for the other penguins, especially when it came to his girl and mother, but that may work better on rewatch. Maybe it was just me. Also, this film makes you wonder what the makers' position towards religion and church exactly is. On several occasions you could find criticism which wasn't even subtle: the great deity, the penguin pope... Another funny thing, maybe the funniest, was a Dalai Lama penguin which accompanies the bunch in order to be freed from a noose around his head.<br/><br/>This film is an exception to most animated movies as it has no real one main antagonist. Maybe the closest to it would be the penguin pope, but he doesn't really have that many scenes as most of the action takes place outside the village, obviously after Mumble's ban. So, there's many smaller enemies like leopard seals and skuas and humans of course too. Before I finish the review, I would like to add to my comment that the mini penguins are mostly there for comic relief that they also offer more than that. My favorite scene probably involving them was when they ask Mumble to come with them as they accept him despite him being different in opposition to the people in his village and even his family. All in all, it's a decent movie with a good message at the end and certainly worth a watch, especially if you like animated films."

","This is a good animated movie, just not a great one. So the premise is this, each penguin has a heart song in order to find a spouse and to fit into penguin society. But the penguin named Mumble doesn't have a singing voice but backs it up with tap dancing and his funk. With the penguin society finds to be blasphemy. But Mumble uses his talents to try and help the penguin society while falling in love. The dialogue and direction is also very corny even for a family movie though but after a while it doesn't seem that bad. The animation is fluid and cool to watch as well, which is the highlight of this movie. What I found funny though was how for a kids movie it has a lot of sexual or slightly provocative lines even when it came to the music sometimes but the audiences just seemed to let it slide because it goes in a very cute direction. To sum it up this is like a animated musical with penguins. Some aspects of the story I found to be laughable how the older generation of penguins look down on younger generations of penguins for getting into a bit of modern style of dancing. Cause it comes off a bit cliché and found it funny they put the same thing for a animated movie with penguins. And how having fun is looked down upon by older the older penguins and thought of as a bad thing for penguin society. This animated movie seems a bit drawn out and a bit dull but when it's finished overall it's a good movie that is worth seeing.

","The first thing to note, and perhaps the most impressive thing about the entire movie, is that it features absolutely superb animation. The second impressive thing about the movie are the songs - a good selection of popular songs that, when they're being featured along with dancing penguins, adds a good deal of spark and fun to the movie. Unfortunately, those two big positives were really marred by two other things: a lack of any truly interesting storyline (I spent a good chunk of this movie wondering what in the world ti was trying to accomplish) and then also a sense that I was being preached at; that this was trying to use a fun sort of concept to push a very manipulative political message - or, actually, several messages. It's not so much that I disagreed with the messages. I just didn't like the way it was done.<br/><br/>The first obvious political piece was around the whole idea of inclusiveness. Mumble is an out of the ordinary penguin. Most penguins have a song they use to attract a mate. Mumble couldn't sing - but he could dance. He was an outcast, different and looked down upon by everyone else and judged very harshly by the elder penguins, who came across as the stereotypical religious types - dour and mean-looking and unsmiling, determined to make sure that everybody else leads as miserable a life as they do. So we're to celebrate individualism and look down on those who try to enforce conformity. I get it. The second propaganda point was around the environment - and particularly overfishing, which was depleting the food supply of the penguins. I get that too. Both points were - for me at least - a little too in your face.<br/><br/>There are certainly things about this movie that can be enjoyed. It's just that, overall, I didn't find this to be an especially enjoyable movie. (3/10)"

However, this did not happen in HF. For example, in HF the depiction of what happens to the rebel dancing penguin and the attitude of the parents is completely human. So penguins are impersonating and reproducing human ways. That's OK if your target is children. You need more than that to engage adults. There are so many stereotypes, seen for the hundredth time in animated and non animated movies, that I felt disappointed.<br/><br/>This is a Warner Bross movie, and I was thinking, WB animation characters of the past were absolutely brilliant, why is WB coming with this Diney-ish film?

","After finally watching ""Surf's Up"" earlier this week, I decided I would soon watch ""Happy Feet"" after that. Both are computer-animated family movies about penguins, and I heard of both of them long before finally seeing them. This one was the first of the two, and shortly before I watched it, I knew that George Miller, a filmmaker who was behind the ""Mad Max"" trilogy and ""Babe"", was also heavily involved in the making of this CGI effort. This is not one of the most popular films of its type from recent years, but it clearly does have a following, and knowing that, I wasn't expecting it to be great, but probably still pretty good. There are things I can praise the movie for, but to me, it could have turned out slightly better than it did.<br/><br/>In Antarctica, all Emperor Penguins must come up with a heartsong in order to get a mate. Norma Jean and Memphis attract each other with their heartsongs and soon have themselves an egg. While the female penguins are out fishing, leaving the males with the eggs for the winter, Memphis accidentally drops his egg during a harsh Antarctic storm! When the time comes for the eggs to hatch, it doesn't look like Memphis and Norma Jean's egg will at first, but it does. The two penguins now have a son named Mumble, but unlike the other penguins, he can't sing, which means it would be difficult for him to find a heartsong! He is a very talented tap dancer, something no penguin has seen before, but others do not find this acceptable, so Mumble is widely looked down on by the other penguins. When he grows up, he still has a horrible singing voice and is still stuck with his down feathers from birth, unlike everybody else. He still has a hard time trying to fit in with his peers. Can his tap dancing talent ever make a difference? <br/><br/>The animation in this particular CGI film is absolutely amazing! The penguins look very realistic, and the backgrounds are gorgeous with the snow and blue sky! However, apart from the animation, I don't think there's anything about ""Happy Feet"" which I could describe as amazing. I didn't care much for the musical numbers in general, and the film may not have the most outstanding characters, even if some of them are likable, including the protagonist. Also, the film is supposed to be partially a comedy, and some parts made me laugh a little, but nothing here made me laugh that hard. The story is not a bad one, but some of it certainly could be better. It features at least some mild excitement, and certainly didn't make me want to turn of the film before it was over, but for some reason, I found a lot of it to be maybe just a LITTLE dull. Some parts certainly could have been better written, including the way Mumble's relationship with Gloria begins, and the two of them talking to each other underwater.<br/><br/>I know this particular CGI penguin movie came before ""Surf's Up"", but now that I've seen them both, I have to admit that I think the latter is far superior. I noticed that the animation in the 2007 Sony Pictures Animation effort isn't always perfect, but I still thought that it was mostly great, and the film has a lot more than the animation to keep it entertaining. ""Happy Feet"" may have slightly superior animation (I couldn't find ANY flaws in this movie's animation), but ""Surf's Up"" is basically better in every other department. I may have expected the two of them to be about equal in quality before I watched them, but it didn't quite turn out that way. I certainly didn't find this 2006 release bad enough for me to be confused by its popularity, but overall, I would say it's only just above average, even if most of those who have seen it would disagree."

","I usually love a good animated movie, however, this stinker left our entire family cold. Animation allows the creator of the movie to plum emotions and subject matter that regular movies have a difficult time with. Miyazaki's ""Spirited Away"" is a great example. In ""Happy Feet"", however, we are expected to swallow some stupid notion that penguins social system is based on the ability to ""sing"" nicely, and when we are presented with a penguin who can't sing, but can only dance, we're expected feel some sort of sympathy for him. What? I do realize this is meant to be a metaphor for being ""different"" in our society, but of all the lame plot devices, this one is perhaps the worst.<br/><br/>Then, due to his ability to ""dance"" (actually do a penguin version of a shuffle) he is able to save the entire Antartica penguin population from overfishing by humans .... by his ability to dance while in captivity. Perhaps they should have had him be able to sing, and all the other penguins able to dance, because then he could have launched into a stirring rendition of ""Somewhere ... Out There ... You're Eating All Our Fish!!"" From what was perhaps the worst opening scene in any major animation production ever ... a musical number with no lead up, no explanation, and worst of all, no reason to care ... this movie just never makes it. The Mexican penguins, led by the voice acting of Robin Williams, are brilliant, but are the rare successful touch in this entire overly cute-for-cute's-sake production.<br/><br/>Take a pass, unless you really, really like so-so hip-hop covers of mediocre oldies."

Basically in Antarctica live the Emperor Penguins who express themselves in song, and Memphis (Hugh Jackman) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman) are looking forward to their baby being the same. Unfortunately, Memphis dropped Baby Mumble (Rugrats' Elizabeth Daily) as an egg, and this ruins his singing voice, but he does develop a talent for fast dancing. Grown up, Mumble (Elijah Wood) feels very different because of his lack of singing talent, but has a connection with the best singer around, Gloria (Brittany Murphy). He is cast out of the community however by Noah the Elder (Hugo Weaving), and Mumble manages to meet a posse of fellow penguins considered different, led by Ramon (Robin Williams). After trying to get an answer to the lack of food or whatever from Lovelace (also Williams) in Adelie Land, Mumble and the gang set out to find a new source of food, and ""alien"" (humans) that could provide it. They travel all across the icy lands, until Mumble goes alone, managing to wash up on a shore, go into an aquarium, and his dancing skills win the hearts of humans around the world, and the rest of the penguins get their food joining in. Also starring Anthony LaPaglia as Boss Skua, Miriam Margolyes as Mrs. Astrakhan, Carlos Alazraqui as Nestor and Steve Irwin as Kev. The voice casting is very well done, the animation (including a little motion capture) is most impressive, the music and dance sequences are likable, and the story does have its moments, so some good family adventure fun to be had. It won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, it won the BAFTA for Best Animated Feature Film, and it was nominated for the Anthony Asquith Award for Film Music for John Powell, and it won the Golden Globe for Best Original Song for ""The Song of the Heart"", and it was nominated for Best Animated Film. Very good!"

","I have to comment on the incredible tapping in this movie. Finally a great movie with some tapping in it. Savion Glover choreographed this movie beautifully (he's a genius). Although it was difficult to tell exactly what Mumble was doing with his feet, it was great to listen to. If you get the chance, look on the special features to see Savion tap himself. Great effects overall. Amazing music too. <br/><br/>This movie has great effects and a wonderful story. Mumble is an extremely lovable character. Packed full of wonderful actors and actresses. Everybody does an amazing job. The movie is a real feel good film. Full of fun music, singing, and of course tapping. It makes you want to get up and dance along. <br/><br/>There is also a religious and environmental undertone, but most importantly an acceptance of those who are different."

","This is a stunning CGI animation which sadly loses its way in the final one third. After some gorgeous images of Antarctica and an enjoyable storyline of a penguin who's 'different' because he can't sing, but enjoys tap-dancing, the last half hour turns stridently preachy and dampens the fun. There are some excellent musical set-pieces as the penguins sing and dance. Robin Williams is alright in two different roles (apart from narrating). While the ecological theme is relevant, the way it's presented is what's slightly annoying. Enjoyable nonetheless.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

","Ever have one of those moments when you see a movie that's been getting a lot of attention and you're overwhelmed by it, only to revisit it on video and realize it's not all that great? Well, Happy Feet is one of those movies. When I saw it in theaters three weeks after it opened, I loved it. I thought the inclusion of the environmental stuff was as genius as the music and dancing.<br/><br/>I just finished watching the movie in its entirety for the first time since then, and time hasn't been kind to it. Not that I'm saying it's dated, since we're still dealing with global warming and stuff. I'm saying that this film could have used less of the environmentalism and more of the fairy tale whimsy that was prevalent during the first third. Hell, as I was watching the damn thing, I was imagining this story done in the style of Leo Lionni and his brilliant, albeit sadly overlooked, book Tico and the Golden Wings. (Maybe they should have had a wishingpenguin?) Don't get me completely wrong, it still has great music and terrific dancing, but George (Mad Max) Miller really missed the mark here. That's my opinion, and I'm sticking to it."

I refrain from saying it was a high-water mark for CGI, but it was very, very well done. The artists did a wonderful job. The underwater animation was AMAZING.<br/><br/>It is a shame the screenwriters, director and producers didn't do as well with the meat of the movie.

I can't say I hate this, but I would have hated it if there was no soundtrack. However, some of the music is part of the plot, but I was confounded at some of the logic this flick had. Such as Mumble not being able to sing because he was dropped as an egg. Also, in the scene when Mumble was put into a zoo area for humans (REAL humans) to watch him, it looked really weird.

","We have to admire the amount of detailed research and preparation that goes into a magical piece of film work like this. No doubt the MARCH OF THE PEGUINS was a good starting point on which to build ideas. Penguin characters need names. They need voices. They have to be distinguishable from each other. There has to be a story with perhaps a message or two. Various emotions to make us laugh and cry. There has to be an interesting setting. Music and songs to delight us. Adventure and action.<br/><br/>This film has it all. We salute the team of artists who made it all possible.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have adequately described the story. Bits and pieces of well-known songs have been woven into a simple love story in which Mumble could not express himself in the usual way (through song) but had the gift of nimble feet which tapped out his feelings in a kind of Morse code which finally infected everyone even the intruding ""aliens"".<br/><br/>We learn a lot from this film quite apart from the life cycle of the penguin. We learn that everyone is not the same. People have different feelings. We must respect the feelings and opinions of others. Mumble was late in hatching from the egg. His Pa did have an accident with the egg; and the penguin colony was quick to remind him. The one thing they forgot was that everyone is different. We all have different talents.<br/><br/>Due credit must be given to the actors who gave their voices to the penguins. They seemed just right. Watch out for the elephant seals who seem to be in a most pessimistic mood when Mumble decides to seek out the ""aliens"" who are stealing their fish. There is a real change in mood here as every doubt is raised about Mumble's plan to negotiate.<br/><br/>This film won many Awards including an Academy Award. Don't miss it. It's a real winner."
"jpschapira","7","0","0","10 August 2007"," Honorable...
","The last time Matias and I randomly voted for who we thought would win the Academy Awards, he chose ""Cars"" in the Best Animated Feature category; I chose ""Happy Feet"". The funny thing is that I hadn't even seen it but, coming from Pixar, ""Cars"" was a disappointment. Now I've seen ""Happy Feet"" and it's not great, but it is so much better than ""Cars"".<br/><br/>I've got to say, though; there's something about penguins. Either they're really cute or they're beautifully simple, but for some reason the public has developed an affection for penguins. ""Happy Feet"" shows penguins living in their own icy world, speaking their own language ('penguin') and, as not seen in other animated films, actually unaware of the existence of human beings and speaking of them, as 'aliens'.<br/><br/>It's probably these and other things that seem truly new (the movie looks gorgeous and the sea and the sky look 'live action') what differences ""Happy Feet"" from the other animated movies. I mean, when have you seen a penguin dancing like Mumble? Mumble is the film's main character who, unlike all of his friends, can't sing. Singing is the only way he could find his true love, but Mumble dances; and this may not give him love, but it will take him far.<br/><br/>Yes, like in a classic animated film, our hero meets some friends along the way; he wins them over with his contagious dancing ways. I remember the hero in ""Cars"", who was pursuing a selfish dream and then realized that life was full of loveMumble knows it from the beginning and his crusade is utterly giving and noble; ironically turning everyone against him.<br/><br/>The screenplay is a bag of fun, written by people who know about friendship (John Collee, ""Master and Commander"") and by George Miller and his co-directors. Director Miller has produced and written movies like ""Babe"", so it would be fair to say he knows the field. But this script is non-stop one-liners and non-stop jokes; and most of the time they work.<br/><br/>The music is another main element that plays more importantly than in your usual animated movie. ""Happy Feet"" could also be a musical with fresh and original songs and very intelligent versions of old and new classics from every type of genre (we get Pop, Rock, Hip-Hop, Salsa, Mambo), courtesy of the masterful John Powell (the fantastic ""The Road to El Dorado"" and ""Antz"", among others), always backed by some nicely choreographed tap-dancing.<br/><br/>However, the highest point of ""Happy Feet"" is its message. I won't say what the message is, but even when it is simple and not completely explored, it has the best intentions and, more importantly, shows that we can say something even in animated films. Honorable work!"

","OK, it really is probably worth watching for the cute baby penguins and the dancing is fun. However, the best draw is Robin Williams as all of the smaller penguins. He is, as always, hilarious. However, I felt the ""acceptance"" theme and environmental theme were very overdone. It didn't have the tastefulness of Finding Nemo but had to result to hitting us over the head. Now I realize that overfishing is a very serious problem, but a movie should be able to tell us their message with some subtlety. I have to admit that the alien abduction story told by the evil bird was very funny. I would have really like to see an homage to Independence Day when Tom Arnold flies into the alien ship and yells, ""I'm ba-ack!"""

","I especially detest the cutesy marketing for this film that would lead one to believe it's a happy musical tale, a children's cartoon with good dance music and a happy, feel good story. It is not. It may have feel good graphics, overall animation and a few good tunes. I give it a 2 for its technical achievements. <br/><br/>But this film is a mix of tiresome, thread worn Hollywood themes, the same old hack ideas they've used for years. For example, ""religious"" people, er penguins are stupid, backward fools who oppose reason and worship some unknown, hateful god. And they look like undertakers, too. Historically, Hollywood has portrayed Christians as ax-murderers, so perhaps it's a step up to have a religious character be merely a detestable Ichabod.<br/><br/>The environmental preaching is insufferable: Man is bad, while nature, and the all wise penguins who represent it, are good. Man imprisons them in zoos and pollutes the polar ice caps. Penguins, representing all the wisdom of nature, represent The Way. The premise is not Man versus Nature, rather it's Nature versus Man. The film is neither cute, nor funny, it's preachy, the worst kind - Hollywood. It tangles around the viewer's neck in politically correct theology, and obscures and diverts what's left of a very thin, convoluted and unclear plot line. This film is not for kids. Don't let the cover fool you. Skip it."

"KUAlum26","7","0","0","2 May 2007"," Wished it had stuck with ONE agenda
","IN my summary,when I say ""agenda"",I'm not just speaking in political terms(though that does apply),I'm talking about agenda in the very ""theatrical"" sense: in other words,agenda as in what the plot wants to do,where it wants to go,how it wants to go about it and at what speed it will get there. In those regards,this movie,while quite charming and technologically eye-popping,seems to have too much ambition that and a half.<br/><br/>The ordinary origins of an Emperor Penguin named Mumble(voiced as an adult by Elijah Wood)wouldn't seem to be a harbinger for his uniqueness. It seems that he cannot do what most of his species can of,namely sing ""Heart Songs"" to attract a mate. He can,however,dance,very well in face. It's the polar(no pun intended)opposite of a stat-kept secret that Mumble's talent makes him an oddity and a pariah,and he ends up becoming an outcast,finding solace with a group of smaller penguins(two of whom,including their mystical leader,are voiced by Robin Williams,who appears to be everything lately) on a neighboring ice floe. Away from his own kind,he encounters various dangers as well(starving carnivorous terns,a fearsome leopard seal come to mind),and along the way discovers that a fish problem(i.e.shortage)and the question of aliens/extraterrestrials(which,of course,are actually humans to these species on this corner of the world). <br/><br/>With added voice support of Brittany Murphy(probably the best here,as Mumble's would-be love Gloria),Hugh JAckman(as Mumble's father,Memphis),Nicole KIdman(unrecognizable as Mumble's mother Norma Jean),Carlos Alozraqui,Elizabeth DAily(As the baby Mumble),Hugo Weaving and Anthony LaPaglia among others,this movie is about as subtle as a sledgehammer. The message--or rather,messages--here are thus:tolerance of differences is good,superstition/blind faith is no substitute for scientific knowledge,bravery to be individuality yields the best rewards,and human usage of the oceans(in this case,over-fishing)threatens to endanger those who need its resources. <br/><br/>Co-dir4ected by George Miller and co-written and co-directed by Warren Coleman,this movie has BIG ambitions and I think that's what hurt it. If it was MERELY a story about a penguin struggling to find his identity and purpose,that would be enough. If this film wanted to be PURELY an environmental message film that would be fine(though maybe a little less marketable to greater audiences.Maybe not),too.But to make this film as broadly ""message""-based(yet,always marketable as possible,don't forget!),I feel like HAppy Feet turns itself into a polarizing movie when it really shouldn't be. As for my personal opinion,it's pretty basic:I overall enjoyed it,but had reservations. I know(from reading many previous reviews)that I am not alone."
"Thunderbuck","7","0","0","23 April 2007"," I really wanted to love this...
","...but alas, I'll have to settle for a ""strong like"". Now, granted, the idea of dancing penguins is a little ""out there"" to begin with, but then, so was a talking pig.<br/><br/>George Miller's BABE is one of my all-time favorite movies (and, yes, I feel a little weird admitting that). Not only was BABE cleverly, believably rendered, the message of tolerance grew very naturally from the story's characters. When I heard that Miller was the guiding hand behind HAPPY FEET, I was really expecting something special.<br/><br/>I almost got it, too. The animation is absolutely gorgeous here, with creatures that come to life on the screen more realistically than anything else this side of FINDING NEMO. Some of the sequences are just amazing, particularly a couple of underwater scenes. And while some might find the whole pop music thing a little odd, it worked for me much the same way the same kind of device worked in Baz Luhrman's MOULIN ROUGE.<br/><br/>Some have described the environmental message at the movie's climax as ""heavy-handed"". I wouldn't exactly put it that way, but I will say that I'd have a much easier time buying into HAPPY FEET's message if I cared more about the characters. And that's where this movie falls down.<br/><br/>There's more contrivance here than I really care for. The main character of Mumbles is set up as a penguin anti-hero without much explanation. He's just ""different"", and that is somehow intrinsically offensive to his community. He is fortunate to find helpful friends instead of becoming someone else's dinner. Of course.<br/><br/>He manages to defeat the conventions of his community, find his true love, and single-handedly (single-flipperedly?) draws the world's attention to his species' plight. Of course.<br/><br/>Granted, the sequence where Mumbles starts to go insane in captivity is fairly compelling, and in particular the scene where he finally captures the attention of a young girl is quite moving, but even these scenes would have meant so much more if we cared just a little bit more about the central character.<br/><br/>I think part of the problem here is that penguins are pretty cute, but there's only so much you can do to render individual birds as characters. They all look pretty much the same, and it gets hard to understand how they can all be so different after a while. The reliance on ethnic stereotypes for humor is a sure-fire hint that the writers were having a tough time moving the story along.<br/><br/>Worthwhile? Yes. Great? Not quite, I'm truly sorry to say."

Directed by George Miller (Babe: Pig in the City, The Witches of Eastwick), this adorable movie kept the kids in the theatre squealing and the parents on their seats with laughter. The movie was a PG-rated musical/comedy/animation about Mumble (Elijah Wood), a young penguin who is unlike all the others because he does not have a ""song in his heart"", instead Mumble tap-dances. His parents don't appreciate what he does and the people around him label him as a misfit. The plot then follows Mumble trying to win the heart of Gloria (Brittany Murphy), his love interest. Then it changes to him trying to figure out the mystery behind the food shortage and therefore prove himself to his family and clan. Along with him are the Latino penguins, Ramon (Robin Williams) and his gang. The movie was dedicated to Steve Irwin and therefore had lots of people to come see it, grossing a total of $138 million since its release. Some people think this was not a good movie because it had a lot of controversial arguments over it because of some 'disturbing' scenes where Mumble is stuck in a zoo and goes 'mad'. But overall I think this is a very good movie to watch with your kids especially after a long day of work or a very tiring week. I give it 4 singing penguins out of 5."

If you're spending time with the one you love, this movie is for you. However if you're having the time of your life and can not possibly think of anything more entertaining to do, then you're already watching it.<br/><br/>Together with friends this was a really nice movie, because there are many humorous scenes in it.<br/><br/>Don't take my word for it, just watch it and make sure you've got a nice TV as well as a great sound system."

","BY FAR the best children's movie we've seen all of 2006 (except for maybe...Flushed Away **HUGH JACKMAN***) Favorite Effect: The fact that they animated the Penguins and filmed the Humans (I mean... common... COOL!). The story was really cute and THANK GOD it had SOMETHING to say about us SCREWING UP our environment!! and BY THE WAY Elvis Hugh Jackman was...THE COOLEST even though he dropped Elijah Wood's egg when he was a little baby penguin (wow...that came out wrong) ((wait isn't his name like Mumble??)). BLAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHH Brittany Murphy!!!! (that's all we have to say, precious)!!!! We didn't like how Elijah (aka Mumble) tried to SING CONSTANTLY and might I add VERY ANNOYINGLY!!! (I mean GOD take a HINT!!! YOU SUCK AT SINGING!!! DANCE FOOL, DANCE!!!)<br/><br/>(Julia) P.S. I didn't think it was possible for a PENGUIN to be sexy but Hugh Jackman proved me wrong!!

","2006 has turned out to be the year for digital animation. From talking cars to suburban turned forest animals it seems like we've almost seen it allor so we thought. The fresh and upbeat penguin-filled musical 'Happy Feet' is the thirteenth digitally animated film to be released this year. And as expected, people are eating it up. Some have gone as far to say it's the year's best. There was better this year, but 'Happy Feet' is okay.<br/><br/>In 'Happy Feet' we are given front row seats to the birth and growth of a penguin by the name of Mumble who is voiced by Elijah Wood. He's different from all the other penguins. In a world where finding your ""heartsong"" is crucial, poor Mumble isn't able to keep a tune at all. Interestingly enough though, he can dance up a storm. Unfortunately this is frowned upon and ends up causing him great distress. Eventually the elder penguin Noah, who is voiced by Hugo Weaving, accuses Mumble of bringing on the famine that is currently afflicting the penguins. Mumble attempts to explain that he believes ""aliens"" are the real cause. Noah doesn't take him seriously at all and banishes him, claiming that once he is gone, the famine will end. Mumbles then promises that he will return, and when he does he will bring proof that the alleged ""aliens"" are to blame. He then embarks on his journey where along the way he makes some new friends and learns the world outside his own is much different than he could have ever thought possible.<br/><br/>Visually, 'Happy Feet' is amazing. Almost every landscape down to the smallest icicle look so very real. Even the penguins themselves are highly detailed, but obviously aren't real. Aside from that and the direction from Greg Miller, everything presented in 'Happy Feet' is just okay. Nothing in it evokes a wholehearted wow. The plot itself takes what seems forever to be revealed. There's a forty five minute wait before anything about a famine is even mentioned. Watching the film is a lot like riding a roller coaster. No, I don't mean its a thrill ride. The way the story is set up, it goes up and down. Each time it begins to drag, something comes along to get it going again. And when the ending finally comes, it appears forced. The whole addition of an environmental issue still has me wondering. I guess because without it there would be nothing for Mumble to do on his journey of discovery.<br/><br/>The main issue I have with 'Happy Feet' though revolves around the music. Yes, I know it's a musical, but the music seemed to really exceed the film itself. I'm not sure if this was intentional or not. The reason being is because the film suggests that there actually is a real story behind it all. Either way, it doesn't really matter because it's the singing and dancing that will have people returning to see it all again. So despite having some assuredly bad qualities 'Happy Feet' does indeed have its moments. It does what it was supposed to, and that's entertain."

","I saw this movie and absolutely loved it! Even though I am 14 years of age, I have seen this film 5 times and counting! Even though the tap-dancing sequences are a bit lame, the film is a MARVOLLES blend of a love theme, comedy and adventure. The movie does go on for a bit but unlike other films each scene is interesting unlike other films. The idea is very well thought of, and I am glad I have seen an Elvis singing penguin. The animation is extremely well done and should raise the standard of other animated films. Some children though might not understand some key phrases and words that relate the the penguins god, the great 'Guin'.I cant wait for it to be released on DVD.<br/><br/>I recommend this film for any person of any age thats loves a good piece of entertainment to see this film!!"

","This film is awesome. I love penguins so this was a fantastic film for me. Mumble is cute.<br/><br/>This film is about a little penguin named Mumble.He can not sing like the other penguins, but he can dance. He is kicked out of his group. He then meets five short penguins. They have a leader named Lovelace. And he has a pop holder around his neck. Then Mumble is taken to a zoo by aliens, or in real life humans. The humans are taking the penguins' food. They like his ability to dance. Mumble somehow gets back to Antarctica and the humans track him down and follow him. All of the penguins dance and the humans are amazed. The humans stop the food shortage. I love this film and it is a great family movie."
"ytbufflo-1","7","0","0","22 January 2007"," A Secret Alien Plot?
","I could almost give this movie a ten - the animation detail on those exquisite penguins is mind-blowing - except for the bizarre ending. They seemed to be saying that if the talented, oppressed minorities would just submit to being tagged with electric boxes and singing for their supper to the Alien Aryan oppressors, they would be allowed to survive. Shades of early Hollywood's treatment of some of the fine Asian, African American, and Latino performers who were never given proper credit for their consummate skill and humanity - only for their entertainment value to mainstream America.<br/><br/>This is one of the most surreal child movie endings I think I have ever seen on film, and I'm really not sure if I can even come up with a logic for why they chose it. To make such a point of demonstrating how awful the imprisonment at the zoo is, and then expecting me to cheer when our young dancing penguin protagonist appears, fully wired, to make his fellow species accept the inevitable, is so sci-fi to me that I began to think I had wandered into an elaborate modern Twilight Zone episode. I suppose the idea was that technology has given humans the ability to observe animals to such a degree that we can actually have empathy for them, yet all I see from the plot leading up to this conclusion is that technology - ie. the plastic beer can holder strangling the charismatic spiritual leader - is that technology is the brutal oppressor of all things good and great and natural. <br/><br/>I hate message films that contradict themselves at every turn, but I love great computer animation, so I am giving this a much higher rating than I feel the strangely convoluted, fake unity message merits. I also think the little ones will be so happy from the song-and-dance cuteness of it all that what I think makes not a whit of difference. Also kudos to giving a truly great tap artist, Sabian Glover, some very deserved screen time. Next time I hope to see the actual Sabian and his buddies on screen - so we can see what the real artistic fuss is all about. Fun to about three quarters of the way in, and a bit long for a kid flick, but definitely great, heartfelt animation art."

","The main problem i have with the storyline in happy feet is that the ending was very weak. I didn't think it was realistic that the fishing companies suddenly left The Antarctic, just because they saw the penguins dancing. The whole film seemed to build up to this ending, then it just suddenly happened in the last few minutes. It was a worthy message which was poorly presented. I also didn't understand the bit about the Penguins having a ""Heartsong"". It all seemed so pointless. <br/><br/>The main attraction of Happy Feet is it's animation. It was superb. I love penguins and have watched many nature documentaries about them. Happy feet made the penguins look just as real as they do on a documentary. <br/><br/>I can't wait to get the DVD so i can admire the animation and ignore the storyline"

","I was first intrigued by Happy Feet through the previews. I thought it would be a cute movie, following along the lines of Madagascar & Over the Hedge. Although it was a funny movie, it differed from its cohorts.<br/><br/>Happy Feet tells the story of a courageous penguin who is a bit different than the penguins in his colony. He is ridiculed because he does not possess certain qualities that are considered quintessential to his colony. He is an outcast who eventually joins other outcasts on a search for belonging; as they all set out on a journey to find more fish.<br/><br/>Mumble is a penguin who is outcast from his colony because he is considered different. The themes of acceptance, originality, & trust are prevalent throughout the movie as Mumble moves A true heart warmer, this story is good for any age audience. Not only does it teach children about the importance of preserving the earth but also of loyalty & originality. Mumble's struggles to fit in teach children & adults alike the importance of being oneself, doing what one is best at; even if it's not what everyone else is doing. It serves as a reminder that it is okay to be different; a wonderful lesson! THe graphics are stunning as the penguins move in such ways as to appear very real. The only drawback I had was that it was slow in getting started. Certain parts took too long as the plot unfolded. However, I would highly recommend this movie as not another children's movie or a ""feel good"" movie but rather, to serve as an example of what really takes place on our earth."
"MrTAToad","8","0","0","11 January 2007"," Good film
","This isn't always an easy film to watch - at the start, the harsh living conditions of penguins is shown and then later attacks by seals and whales (who have very nasty open wounds), is joined by Mumbles inability to fit into the colony of penguins and at a low ebb when put in a zoo along with various other penguins who have lost their mind through boredom (one penguin talks in the same non-emotional way like the computer from 2001 - ""Try the water, Dave! Its real"").<br/><br/>Aside from the many bleak and downcast times there are some pretty funny moments including the dancing, a small penguin Guru (being choked by the plastic from a 6 pack) and 5 other smaller penguins (probably Snares) who befriend Mumble and admire his tap-dancing abilities.<br/><br/>The animation, was very good. However, the ""camera"" work leaved a bit to be desired - it had a tendency to jump around a lot, with an inability to stay fixed on one point of view.<br/><br/>Humans at the end (in the zoo and when the main UN discussion meeting takes place) were either live action or very good computer generated ones - it was hard to tell.<br/><br/>So, its certainly worth seeing (as long as the people your going with aren't under 6 or so - contrary to what the BBFC say - as its not really suitable for young people). Just don't expect a constant feel-good film - there is little of it present."

","I wanted to see this movie because it was well appreciated, and I think I like penguins. Also I wanted to see the movie with a small child, and Gina  my office colleague and a good friend of mine in Amsterdam  agreed to bring her child for the movie. It was also Christmas time and I thought that it would be good to see this movie.<br/><br/>It was a story of a penguin that cannot sing, but can dance. He goes to find the solution of why the penguins are going hungry and who is stealing their fish and lands up in a zoo, but is shipped back to its homeland where all the penguins dance to impress the human race  not to fish near penguin habitats. The message is very good; to protect the environment. The human race is shown as very considerate in keeping the concerns of penguins at heart.<br/><br/>My expectations were high because of rave reviews the movie received. I liked the movie; I will not say I loved it in totality. What I loved about the movie was its creation of life like images of penguins. I could imagine the amount of detailing that had gone into its production. It was incredible  hats off to the director and production team, after a long time I saw something really good in cartoon characters.<br/><br/>The movie had all the aspects of emotions and drama in hold interest. Overall an okay feast during Christmas for children to see."

","When i went to see this movie, i was expecting to see a visual feast with great voice acting form its well renowned cast. And it didn't let me down, with some of the best and clearest animations to date. This alone is what makes Happy feet worthy of seeing, but it doesn't make it complete. The sinfgins and dancing scenes are great, but cannot old the dull story that we have seen so many times before. An outcast is isolated from his group and seeks an answer to his problems by taking the journey to Jove his resilience and worthiness. This has been seen many times before, and is seen again in happy feet. In conclusion, Happy Feet is a fun filled movie due to its voice acting and singing and dancing, but it wears thin as the dull plot combines"
"MorganGrodecki","8","0","0","3 January 2007"," New Story, same look
","In the last 3 years, there have been thousands of movies to grace the big screen, several of which, revolved around small, cute, furry animate animals. It makes sense, seeing as how little children have an almost instinctive love for small critters.This movie is really no different, and shows off just how much we can take before we realize: ""I've seen this before..."". But, before the review, some history: Shrek and Ice Age were basically the two first movies in the line of animated, child friendly movies. After their releases, other companies clued in to the new fad. Soon after that, computer animated movies had reached their peak, with Shrek 2 raking in over 900,000,000 dollars,setting records. Since summer 2004, the child-oriented animated movies have started to decline, some prime examples being: The Wild, Doogal, The Ant Bully, and several others. I as well have gotten a little tired of these movies, and, unfortunately, Happy Feet just didn't improve my opinions.<br/><br/>Happy feet revolves around the main penguin in the movie, Mumble (Elijah Woods) and his inability to sing. This of course causes problem, because, as everyone knows, if you can't sing, you can never get a mate (this explains a lot in my life). Mumbles colony considers him an outcast, and his father (Hugh Jackman) and his mother are forced to say goodbye to him as he goes to find the solution to the problem plaguing the colony, which he deems as aliens. Along the way, he finds several other penguins, but these ones, unlike his colony, are much shorter...and Spanish. Traveling with his new friends, he discovers what seems to be the answer to his problems. Now the only problem is getting anyone to believe him.<br/><br/>So, as I said, the movie could be better, but it could also be a lot worse. The upside of the movie consists of it's all-star cast, utilizing voice talents like Hugh Jackman (X-Men) Brittany Snow (John Tucker Must Die), Elijah Woods (Lord of the rings) and Robbin Williams (Aladdin). Another very noticeable improvement are the amazing graphics. Whilst watching this movie, I was dazzled by the level of realism they had attained, and I even felt a chill go down my spine during the scenes with the big open sea. One final positive comment I would like to make is in reference to the toe-tapping, rhythmic songs used through-out the movie. I found myself loving every song I heard, and laughing when the Spanish Penguins were singing. It is thanks to this movie, that I have decided my future career will be as a Spanish, Singing Penguin.<br/><br/>One more problem I have with the movie, is it's lack of responsibility. A movie that appeals to ridiculous amounts of children, bases itself on a child outcast....and pretty much fails to come up with a reasonable, logical solution. That really isn't the proper thing to be telling kids, is it? I do understand the difference between reality and fiction, but when a movie is marketed directly at children, I feel that there is a need to give them the proper impression, and saying that everything works itself out is not what I could place in that category."

","Those are the three words to sum this up.2006 was a big year for animations.We had Cars, Ice Age2, Monster House, Over The Hedge to name a few that stood out from the pack. Another animation joining this group is Happy Feet. With stellar casting voices such as Elijah Wood, Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Robin Williams and Hugo Weaving, this was already an expected success.<br/><br/>And they deliver.Packed with a story and some utterly mind blowing animations, Happy Feet has got it all for a hit. I wont be surprised if it gets an Academy Award nod. With a unique plot(penguins have heart songs) we venture into the world of the Antarctic residents. And so unfolds the story of Mumble, considered an outcast by his peers and the source of ill luck by the wise.Driven away by his fellow penguins, Mumble ventures out to find out the real cause of shortage of food, and finds out the reason.Aliens(as in humans).He is taken to captivity but somehow is able to communicate via his feet.The same reason for which he is driven away from his homeland.When he returns back, he brings with himself all glory and joys with unlimited food.<br/><br/>Happy Feet in its essence turns out to be a musical.What do you expect, if penguins are supposed to have heart songs ?? But even through the musical story unfolds with the epic journey of Mumble Happy Feet. Nicole Kidman, Elijah Wood and Robin Williams are superb in their respective character voices. Comic relief of the ghettoized little penguins are a laugh.<br/><br/>But all in all this is one movie which must not be missed. True it is a centrally focused movie. Only a few characters remain in focus, not much is available for the rest. But even then the characters play it out nicely for Elijah to punch it out.<br/><br/>The animation is groundbreaking. Nothing like I've ever seen previously. The sliding sequences and the abandoned factory sequence is just unbelievable. The story as I said was good, actors were good, animation was good. So all in all 8/10 !!!"
"rick-paulos","7","0","0","31 December 2006"," IMAX failure.
","Saw this movie today at our local IMAX theater. What a mistake. I was rather nauseous most of the time. There is way too much swinging around from the camera's point of view. Much more than is possible in live action films. I've nearly ralphed at other live action IMAX films and it often seems they do that on purpose. This is a real problem in an Imax setting where you are right there in the middle of the action. Also, it wasn't formated very well for the Imax, the corners were cut off, the top and bottom of the screen weren't filled either and it seems characters on the sides were stretched and looked fatter. I'm sure it would have been much better on a normal flat screen. Yes, it's a toe tapper for sure. Big lessons are: 1: don't eat fish, the sea life we take for our own consumption is depriving another part of the food chain. 2: humans are screwing the planet even in really remote locations. 3: there is racism, bigotry and anti foreigner sentiment in the animal world ? What? No it's fiction. But those do carry over in to real life. There were some pretty scary chase scenes too that were rather intense for kids."

","I enjoyed this movie. I took my three girls today to watch it. I particularly enjoyed the various adult themes. I thought Noah the Elder did a good job as an elder of a reformed evangelical fellowship. The insular view was very apt for the basic theme that we're destroying the marine environment and over fishing the southern seas. Giving the elephant seals Australian accents was fantastic, especially the ""crikey"" from the late Steve Irwin. I especially enjoyed some of the snow riding scenes with Mumbles and his mates traversing the snow and ice at speed. The ending was a good attempt to integrate the main theme with a good ending but I think it could have been better. Sadly my 11 and 9 year olds who are reasonably bright children didn't quite get the ending and the thrust of the story line. It's our children who have to get these messages across to the numb skulls in power, so a bit more effort on the part of the writers may have helped."
"Sabriane","6","0","0","28 December 2006"," Fantastic animation, but the story is a mess
","Talk about misleading advertising. If you've seen the trailer you'd think, like I did, that you were going to watch a cute light-hearted animated musical about dancing penguins, with the familiar-but-winning story of an outsider finding acceptance at its core.<br/><br/>Well, there's music - although not anywhere as much as the trailers would let you believe. There are definitely penguins, cute and superbly animated, with amazing intricacy of detail and every single feather fluttering delicately in the breeze. However, a few minutes into the movie something about the penguins' appearance started to bug me and soon I realised what it was: it was their eyes. There's a good reason why you so often see absurdly exaggerated eyes in animation. I thought that, in attempting to keep the penguins as close to the realistic creatures as possible, the animators robbed their ""faces"" of much expressiveness and emotion - their eyes often look nothing more than dead dull pellets.<br/><br/>The characters themselves are a mixed bag. The main hero, Mumble (voiced unmemorably by Elijah Wood), is fluffy and adorable but kinda short on personality. Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are equally unmemorable as Mumble's parents. Brittany Murphy fares much better as the sassy and bright Gloria, Mumble's love interest and a singer extraordinaire; her character also has one of the best musical interludes in the film. The Latino-sounding group of little penguins who befriend Mumble are a hilarious bunch, with Robin Williams' Ramon a highlight. Williams also provides a voice for Lovelace, an eccentric prophet-like figure who is not anywhere as entertaining as he should be. My favourite moments probably involved the random ""baddies"" - a group of bad-tempered vultures and a scary leopard seal who is not anywhere as nimble on the ice as he is in the water.<br/><br/>The story... well the story is a problem. I got the feeling that the film never manages to make up its mind on what exactly it is about. It starts off as a quiet, personal story of a misfit struggling against the prejudice and conformity but then it abruptly switches gears and whacks you over the head with a heavy-handed environmental ""message"" and an ending that's way too cutesy and unrealistic even for an animated children's movie. Plus there're plot holes galore - how exactly did Mumble get back home?? Overall, I thought that the movie was beautifully done, often amusing and diverting, but ultimately not the one to remember."

BUT BOY CAN THIS KID DANCE, so it's about finding a mate)...<br/><br/>So, there's that... lyrics in the songs are suggestive...<br/><br/>There's also an anti-conformity message in the film. The antagonists in the movie are mean-spirited and moralistic old penguins who are concerned all this joyful dancing will displease the Great Penguin in the sky.<br/><br/>So... there's that as well...<br/><br/>Anyway if a person is inclined to dislike this this movie I'm sure you can find something offensive in it. But I sat through it with my seven year old and didn't twinge once (I can't say the same for the ""Casper the Friendly Ghost"" movie or the ""Richie Rich"" movie or the ""Simpsons"" or ""Dragon Ball Z"" and so on and so on . . . things will bother me). There ARE scenes that would be scary for really little kids.Anyway, the movie is technically as well animated as any cartoon that has ever been made. I don't think there's ever been a better movie made from a technical stand point. Often it's amazing to watch. There's a lot of stuff in it that is water-ballet-esquire... That is there for the pleasure of looking at graceful patterns.... like a kaleidescope type thing...<br/><br/>I found the story to be pleasant enough but not compelling.

The direction of the story about Mumble going into the human world was weird in a way, but I think they did it just because they could! A lot of parts I seriously lost track of which human shots were real and which were computer animated.

","This is another movie about penguins, those lovely, cute, sweet-looking animals. It has gorgeous images, some of the best, most amazing animation I've ever seen. It's a joy to look at and a very enjoyable movie. The story is nice and you can relate to the penguins and feel some empathy towards them. Some of the subplots are very good: the love story is beautiful, the coming-of-age is deliciously innocent, the family/society rejection subplot is intelligent but sometimes a bit forced and the «macho» penguins subplot is laugh-out-loud funny. The worst subplot was the ecological one, it just tries too hard to pass its message. The dialogs are often very funny and intelligent, with a lot of jokes young kids won't get. The pace of the movie is mostly adequate and keeps you entertained, but it gets a bit to slow and forced in the end, which I didn't like.<br/><br/>The cinematography and the animation are beautiful. They create gorgeous images, with a wonderful dimension, cute, lovely penguins, and the humans are the most realistic I've ever seen. The water and the ice look real as do all the other animals. The angles are amazing, they make the images even better. The music sounds great and has beautiful lyrics. Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy and Robin Wiliams are good singers especially Kidman, who has the most crystalline, pure voice that fits the part.

","Emporer penguins have become a hot topic. Documentary March of the Penguins captured audiences with awe inducing beauty, (if not a very insightful or impressive documentary overall), and documentaries about these majestic animals have allured us on television. Long in the making, Happy Feet also places us in the habitats of the Emporer Penguins. Since Mumble hatched from his egg, he compulsively tap dances to his heart contents. Shunned by everyone, including his father Memphise, the Emporer Penguin sings to find their mate, yet Mumble is afflicted being unable to sing.<br/><br/>Right from the get go, Happy Feet is like no other animated film. Director George Miller has created a computer animated film of grand cinematic proportions. The sheer beauty and majestic scale of the animations is overwhelming. Pixar has constantly raised the bar of computer animation higher and higher, Happy Feet firmly plants the bar higher and a triumph of Australian animation. The meticulous detail of every penguin and harsh snow covered South Pole are unbelievably captivating; it's amazing a white covered land can draw you in so much.<br/><br/>The writing and story of Happy Feet, along with the animation, makes this film even more a stand out. George Miller along with Judy Morris, John Collee and Warren Coleman, have written a script that this tongue in cheek, heart warming and poignant. Along with the usual story arcs of acceptance, love, family and friendship, there is a hard hitting sub text of humanities impact on the environment. This is woven in subtly, from the declining food supply of the penguins and Mumbles determination to discovering why. This message though thuds at the very end; when humanities realises what they're doing is harmful, turning very didactic and losing some of it's impact and poignancy.<br/><br/>Happy Feet also injects one of the most guilty pleasures of all cinema; the musical. From the opening Prince number and highly infectious tap dancing and singing, makes this one delightfully, guilty pleasure. The voice cast is spot on and perfectly casted. Elijah Wood captures that innocence in Mumble. Hugh Jackman brings a believable southern accent to Memphis and disappointment towards his son. Nicole Kidman mixes care free and strong willed in Norma Jean. Brittany Murphy matches Gloria perfectly. Robin Williams brings his over the top antics for both Ramón and Guru Lovelace, delivering the best laughs. While there is a strong American voice talent, complimenting the Australian animation along with Kidman and Jackman with the voice talent; Hugo Weaving, Magda Szubanski, Anthony LaPaglia and the late Steve Irwin.<br/><br/>Superb animation, wonderful and poignant story and indulgent singing and tap dancing, Happy Feet is one exuberant film to behold."

It is a tradition for the penguins to use their ""heart song"" to find their soul mate by singing.<br/><br/>The film's protagonist, Mumble was born tone deaf and cannot sing but has a unique talent for tap dancing, which is looked down upon by the elders of Emperor Land. Mumble is an outcast for his entire childhood and things do not get any better when he becomes a young adult.<br/><br/>He ventures across Antarctica, meeting new friends who accept him as he is. He and his ""amigos"" face death-defying obstacles. Soon Mumble discovers that there is a shortage of fish in Emperor Land and he and his friends go on a quest to find out what is really happening.<br/><br/>Happy Feet has something for all age groups. It has the cutest penguins you will ever see for the young children, funny scenarios for the older ones, witty and funny one liners for the teenagers and music for the older generation.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is one of the best films of the year and deserves a lot of praise."

","When I got the March of the Penguins DVD last year, before watching the film I was treated to a short, computer-animated sequence showing a fuzzy penguin chick dancing, and having a heck of a good time at it. I showed it to my family, who all thought it was hilarious, and looked forward to the film that it advertised, Happy Feet, due out in ""Novembrrrr 2006."" As the film's release date came, I saw more trailers, and heard about a review on Good Morning, America which said that kids wouldn't get the film's ending. Nonetheless, I decided to go see the movie for myself, just for the sake of the dancing penguins. In this regard, I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The penguins sing. They dance. They have lots of fun, and their musical numbers have top-notch production values and superb choreography. At the film's best it was like watching a Stomp act performed by penguins, and that was hilarious.<br/><br/>From the very start of the film, though, I realized that most of the song selections were not meant for the young children who'd come to see the film. The penguins are singing to find a mate, and this is not the fluffy saccharine singing of ""The Pebble and the Penguin,"" but rather the sort of provocative fare that you'd find at a teenage dance party. The filmmakers may have intended a comic effect, in that these are penguins trying to entice each other. But their humorous intent is probably lost on small children, many of whom are already trying to become the next Brittany Spears.<br/><br/>What's not likely to be lost on small children is that the ""aliens"" are overfishing the Antarctic waters, causing the penguins to starve, and that only their withdrawal can make the food shortage abate. Some viewers will find the environmentalist message preachy, while others might disagree with a scene which portrays the UN as noble and able to act decisively. Personally, I thought the ""alien"" subplot was the most interesting part of the movie, as it really brought out the hero in the main character. And, I was pleased that it ended on an upbeat note.<br/><br/>The film was entertaining, but I won't be buying the DVD, and I suggest that parents review it themselves before taking their kids to see it."
"Mxzplk","Null","0","0","20 December 2006"," The Dance of the Emperor: in the excellent Happy Feet, a group of penguins rejects a youngling that can't sing - only tap dance
","The Australian George Miller produces little (only nine of long length) and directs even less (only seven movies since 1979). But, when he does any of the two, uses to show what he came for. Such as in Mad Max, that invented the post-apocalyptic adventure, and Babe: Pig in the City, one of the best kid movies ever made. Now, after almost five years of insane hard work, Miller repeats the feat: Happy Feet is an absolutely original cartoon - a musical and comedy that evolves into epic and tragedy, in an animation of extraordinary beauty. (By the way, also original for going into production before the March of the Penguins documentary.) Miller starts from real data - that each penguin emperor develops a distinct ""voice"". In his movie, sing well (from Queen and Prince to Frank Sinatra) is the pride of the emperors, and the reason which Mumble is born already as a pariah: his singing is direful. He only knows how to express himself by tap dancing, something that the emperors never heard about and immediately reject. Organized in a puritan and conformist society, they think that shaking the hips, or even only the feet, is a profanity.<br/><br/>Happy Feet starts, so, as a classic story - of the rejected puppy -, in a background that remembers the first times of the rock, when the United States went through scandals with the white kids that adhered to the black tradition of the rhythm. From them on it follows on the heroic journey of Mumble, that will get him to know a small community of Latin penguins of Adelia, to hear the prophecies of a group of fatalists sea-elephants and, finally, to discover that the scarcity of food, that the ancients attributes to his birth, is in truth a result of the actions of beings that moves in colossal floating devices, that captures an infinite amount of fish. Sort of like Ulysses, Mumble will see himself stuck in a deserted island (actualy an aquarium), and then will undertake a return not only triumphal, but also revealing.<br/><br/>As Mumble's horizons extends, grows also the ambition of the movie - until it becomes truly huge, as in the image of the fishermen in the mist or in the sequence where the emperor faces the attack of two whales. First time in cartoons, the director took to Happy Feet his capacity to conceive entire living worlds. To the example of the nuclear desert of Mad Max or the rural perfection of Babe, his Antarctica is at the same time realist and impregnated of amazement. What multiplies this effect, however, is the counterpoint with the intimacy and detail of how the characters are portrayed - the ""puppy factor"" that no commercial cartoon can (or want) to live without."
"valadas","7","0","0","20 December 2006"," Let's preserve penguins' food chain OK?
","Some of these anthropomorphic animal animated cartoons are good some are bad. This movie belongs to the former category. Although we know that these movies are no more handmade like the first Disney ones for instance and that the images are computerized, this doesn't invalidate them as forms of art since computers cannot do anything by themselves i. e. without human intervention. And this movie has got admirable and beautiful antarctic landscape images some of them breathtaking. The feelings and emotions of these humanized penguins are extremely well shown by the expressions on their faces. And the most remarkable feature of this movie in my opinion is made by the beautiful music and singing and the choreography of the tap dancing. The story is not particularly out of the ordinary in terms of plot, intrinsically pointing to the ecologic need of preserving the natural food chain so often broken by Man. This is a movie that can be equally enjoyed by adults and children."

","A movie about dancing and singing penguins. Sounds pretty sweet, the trailer really lured me to the movie. ""I know, size can be daunting. But don't be afraid, I love you... I LOVE YOU."" Made me laugh over and over again. <br/><br/>When I finally went to see it, it was fun. It wasn't laughing my ass off fun, but it was constant fun. Not mild parts combined with really loud laughs, just smiles all around. The singing was fun to watch, and this comes from a guy who hates singing in movies. The tap-dancing was fun as well, especially combined with the singing. All in all, a good movie.<br/><br/>The best part was that you actually see what we do to penguins (If you donate money to some charity for penguins you can change we to I) since it's from their point of view. 1 thing was horrible though, the ending.

","Its a children's movie, with morals behind it. It gets they're attention and teaches a lesson using cause and effect. Look at our society today, with everyone either going to far on holding back or holding nothing back. I've read posts that said there was ""explicit sexual positions""... omg. View it from a child perspective... it was nothing but two penguins playing. We as adults are able to turn it into something more because we are able to understand what it looks like. We need to educate our children about things such as saving wildlife. We teach them manners, respect etc, at very young ages, y not about animal preservation. And that taking to much from our resources can be harmful. Showing it like this is a way to show them in a way that they'll pay attention and understand. <br/><br/>It was a good movie. Showed that people are different yet everyone has something special to offer. I went with my 3 yr old niece, and she loved it. Asked questions and it was explained to her that he was different etc. I wish people would get over the stupid little things and be happy that others are trying to make our children see things around them that will help them grow up to be better people, in a way they'll understand instead of life is full of butterflies and fairies. It was cute, and had a lesson. Good enough for me."

","I have never been so bored at a movie.<br/><br/>Here are my reasons for not seeing this film: 1. The creators of this film never took into account how the 10 trailers before this film combined with how boring the film it was itself, might have viewers wanting to leave far before the end of the movie. 2. The ""values"" is this movie have been played out many, many, many, many times in ways easier to watch and learn from. Did I mention this movie drags? 3. March of the Penguins was breath taking and taught me more about life (penguins and humans) then this pile of penguin excrement and the trailers before it combined. 4. If you must see it, wait for it on video. The CGI (except for the seal part, which I didn't get) was amazing. This a movie does not make. :{ 5.

"NoCaDrummer","5","8","31","10 November 2006"," Who's the audience?
","I had the opportunity to see it last night in San Francisco. The graphics are well done (the elephant seals are phenomenal!) but the distinguishing features of the main character ""Mumbles"" are his blue eyes and his continuing down. All of the other characters have brown eyes, so distinguishing his ""girlfriend"" Gloria from any other penguin (male or female) is impossible without the sound.<br/><br/>The music (and there were ~45 songs - or at least snippets of songs) were aimed at the adults. Some had very adult themes, as did the Barry White-like penguin ""Lovelace"" and Mumble's father is a penguin Elvis (the Pelvis) impersonator. Contrast the highly sexual overtones of the music and characters to the minimal, childlike plot and I was confused as to who the audience was supposed to be.<br/><br/>Oh, and let's not forget the stereotypes. The small Latin girl-chasing (but otherwise lazy) penguins , the Barry White penguin with a bevy of females, etc. These are not things I'd want my children to watch or imitate.<br/><br/>Were the animation not so darn good, I'd have given it a lower score. The computer graphic artists did an excellent job on many details. The short ""environment"" message doesn't begin to make itself clear until the last ten minutes. I'd guess they thought putting a simple plot together with adult-themed overtones would bring in both audiences. In my opinion, it fails on both counts - I'd prefer seeing ""March of the Penguins""."

","Plot: Every penguin is born to sing to attract a soul mate, except Mumble, due to Memphis, his father, dropping Mumbles when he was still in his egg. Although Mumble can't sing, he can sure tap dance!<br/><br/>The animation is BRILLIANT and the plot(s) are great. This film is entertaining with its songs and tap dancing and action sequences. Sure there are some scenes that are inappropriate for children, that's why it's rated PG. This is one of the best animated films of the year!<br/><br/>Note that this film isn't cute and cuddly as it shows in commercials and that there are some serious subplots and scary scenes. Still, it's perfectly fine for everyone. This film is also unpredictable because seeing that the movie can end anytime, it makes you wonder. This film is also funny.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood and Brittany Murphy are great in the film. I didn't even know Brittany Murphy could even sing that well. Robin Williams, voicing three characters in this film, is very funny. He had great lines.<br/><br/>This film isn't filled with a lot of songs and dances and has to do with more of the story.

Environment and animals are both conceived with breathtaking quality. There is no uncanny valley effect. The expressiveness, colorfulness and rigorous attention to detail make for a visual feast.<br/><br/>The story is likewise astonishing. They could give us the penguins as roles or characters. But they actually give us the penguin culture. The ""great 'Guin"" is overseeing and guiding their lives through song and collective thinking.<br/><br/>The creatures that inhabit Happy Feet's world are very well realized. The scale of animals and environment are very consistent. When you see icebergs crashing off the continental shelf you are awestruck.<br/><br/>I am infuriated by the negative reviews on this site. If a political viewpoint differs from one's own, take it as such. But the negative reviews here discredit the entire movie as bad because its politics.<br/><br/>They had a ""Brazil"" ending all lined up. If they had left it there, it would have been a downer, but it would have been realistic.

","Happy Feet is a wonderful computer animated musical with a pro-environmental message that doesn't become obvious until the end. It also has a different-from-the-rest-of-the-pack main character in Mumble (Elijah Wood). While all the other penguins are wonderful singers (including Mumble's crush Gloria, voiced by Brittany Murphy), the only musical talent Mumble has is tap dancing (copied from Savion Glover's movements on live-action film). After graduation, Mumble leaves for another land where he encounters another group who appreciates him as he is (led by the voice of Robin Williams who does another one as a messiah-like character). Great use of many '70s and '80s pop standards like Prince's ""Kiss"" and Stevie Wonder's ""I Wish"". I especially like the ""Boogie Wonderland"" number and a brief rendition of Chicago's ""If You Leave Me Now"". So take the whole family if you want to see a good animated film directed by Mad Max's George Miller."

","This is simply an anti-religion film. Think ""Religulous"" for kids. This is an attempt at social engineering, stealth-fully wrapped up like a harmless cartoon. A cute penguin that can dance... Don't be fooled. This is not a penguin, it is a Trojan horse with a very deliberate agenda. Over 90% of US population believes in God, so this is an attempt to get your kids to join the single digit crowd. The premise of the film is that adults are stupid and ignorant, kids know more than parents and prayer is for idiots. There is also a more overt anti-industrial slant (ecology replaces religion). The CG is pretty impressive at places (a LOT of work went into the CG). However, the dialog is not fit for kids(lots of sexual references and a few references to homosexual behavior) yet is too ridiculous for thinking adults. Typical liberal brainwashing."

"katherine-103","Null","2","5","2 January 2007"," Please, I beg of you, do not see this disappointing film.
","I request that you do not go to this extremely disappointing film. My aunt, Mom, Grandmother, and 4 cousins (all under the age of 5) went to see this for New Year's. Afterwards, as my Grandma and cousins drove away, my mother, aunt, and I had a heated discussion about the underlying issues in the film. As a teenager myself, it may seem that some of these concepts would seem to go over my head, but I caught on to it myself and took the liberty to relieve you of the pain.<br/><br/>May I give you a complete synopsis at this point so you can gauge whether or not it is worth it to you. <br/><br/>COMPLETE SPOILER NOW <br/><br/>It began as a sweet March of the Penguins type tale. This little penguin was dropped as an egg and as a result this penguin Mumble can't properly sing. Singing is the cultural identity of his people who believe in something called HeartSong. He can't sing, but loves to dance, or as he says: sing with your feet. As the story evolves he is shunned from the penguin society because they believe him to be the cause of the fish shortage. But, Mumble knows that it's the aliens taking the fish and so he goes in search of them. On his travels previously he met another group of a different breed of penguin and one particular penguin called Lovelace has this mysterious talisman around his neck (a six-pack ring) that he says was bestowed upon him by the gods. Mumble knows better, again, and finds Lovelace choking due to this thing. Mumble, Lovelace and his friends The Amigos go in search of the aliens. They find a city of the aliens (humans), unfortunately, this city is deserted. After a brush with killer whales (orcas) which managed to remove the ring around Lovelace's neck. (Don't ask how, it's magic. His breathing is also immediately bettered, heaven forbid recuperative time.) Then, Mumble tells the others to leave and he'll continue on his own. They agree to this and assume he'll die. He sets off on a ridiculous journey chasing after commercial net fishing boats and goes on and on. He swims for ever and ends up washed ashore where a Jeep comes for him. He is placed in a zoo where he proceeds to loose not only his voice, but his soul and spirit. He hallucinates seeing his family and love interest, whose name is Gloria.<br/><br/>A small girl taps on the glass to draws our Emperor penguin's attention, and with her rhythm he begins to dance! A crowd draws and (magically, again, after a time skip) Mumble shows back up to see his penguin group. On his back is a HUGE tracking device with a large red light and glowing circuits and a large antennae.(INHUMANE AS ALL HELL). Mumble has decided to bring the humans to his family so they will help. But he tries to convince this huge group that the only way to save their kid is to dance for the humans.<br/><br/>MY FEELINGS TOWARDS IT<br/><br/>Part Two specifically: My best descriptor: March of the Penguins- Moulin Rouge- a twisted Fern Gully<br/><br/>He is portrayed as extremely depressed and zombie-like in the zoo. But when he dances, then he is all cheery again. If this is not enough of an enigma already, how can we explain his release back into the wild? If we found a penguin who tap-danced would we let him go, or would we put him on display and charge $20 for admission to see him? And, let's go past the whole back to wild problem. When he's in the wild going back to his family, what is he thinking? That the humans will make fish magically appear? Once there, what is he thinking? He feels the need to convince the penguins that the only way to be saved is by dancing like good little slaves.<br/><br/>Is anyone else reminded of our own American history here? In the first half of the 20th century when Blacks were given any type of rights, the only time they were allowed in a restaurant with the Whites was when they where found to be entertaining; this was the only reason to keep a Negro in the general vicinity of the good White people. This was the only time they deserved rewards or respect. And, as follows with our penguin friends, the only reason that humans give a damn about the penguins is when they do something out of their nature. The video of the penguins dancing is the only thing that will convince the humans to do a thing about the fish shortage caused by the over-fishing. that humans do. So, if the penguins do good, then the humans can afford to care. And, logically, you can't just stop all fishing worldwide as the UN suggested. That's a cultural reversal, would we make fisherman stop fishing in the Great Lakes and loose their lifestyle? Would we make areas dependent on fish as their main source of protein give it up and instead import all of their food. So the UN can work miracles and deny any social responsibilities to humans? Wow. The other basic thing is: Wouldn't humans make an amusement park and have people pay to watch these amazing penguins in their ""natural"" environment? And, the fish ""magically"" come back, in the very next shot, we see it appears to be raining fish! They are tossing fish into the air. I would have rather have had Mumble trapped in the zoo for the rest of his miserable life and despising humans. But, of course, there has to be a ""happy"" ending to Happy Feet.<br/><br/>My feet were not at all happy as I trudged from the theater."

It starts as a film about an outcast penguin and, about midway through the film, make a hard turn into an environmental film.<br/><br/>As best I can tell, this film shows what happens when too many writers put words on the shooting script.

","Two penguins Norma Jean (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Dallas (Hugh Jackman) give birth to a baby called Mumble (Elijah Wood). According to this movie the penguins sing constantly (from 1950s to present day music) but Mumbles can't sing...but he CAN dance. However the tribal elders said his singing is evil and the reason their fish supply is dwindling, and he is banished. <br/><br/>I could go on but basically you've seen this before...only with human beings. It's another story telling children that it's OK to be different and this one has an environmental message with it. There's nothing wrong with that (the kids in my audience were dead silent and seemed to love this) but I was unimpressed. The CGI was incredible, the songs were good and the voices matched the characters completely...but I didn't know how to take this movie. I mean when a bunch of penguin kids started singing ""In My Room"" by the Beach Boys i didn't know how to respond. It wasn't funny, it wasn't cute, it was just...weird.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD!!! There are also sequences where the penguins are attacked by other animals which might disturb real young kids. And Mumbles ends up in a zoo towards the end...and begins to go crazy. THAT'S for kids???? I found it disturbing and I'm an adult! END OF SPOILERS!!!!<br/><br/>It does all end on a very happy but totally unbelievable note--even for a kids movie that end was pushing it. So I (sort of) liked it but it all left me kind of cold (no pun intended) and the movie slams you in the face with its message again and again. When you see a whole colony of penguins break-dancing and it's not funny (my audience was dead silent) something is wrong. The only real humor here was a bunch of penguins (with Spanish accents) which befriend Mumbles--they were absolutely hysterical.<br/><br/>So kids will probably love this but adults should use caution. Some adult couples walked out of this when I saw it! I can only give it a 6--but put that rating higher if you're seeing it with kids."

(4 out of 10) Special Effects/Graphics: Its animated, so it's limited right off the bat, but because it is set in Antarcitca, there is nothing but white snow and blue sky and water textures. The scenery gets old real fast, I mean, how many little snow covered knolls can these penguins transverse before it becomes, well, BAD. But I guess a winter desert would be boring in real life too. (2 out of 10) Overall: Leave this movie for the kids. If you are unfortunate like myself and get dragged to it by your girlfriend, sit in the back and try and make out through as much of it as possible. (3 out of 10)"

","Alright, having come from our third showing of this film, I still just have to laugh at the close minded conservatives who are aghast at this movie. But then these are the same ones who try to find fault in many other animated films for their sheer enjoyment of subjugating others and making themselves feel better about their position in life. Yes, Happy Feet has a heavy environmentalist undertone, yes, it has story, yes, it has dancing penguins.. all the necessary ingredients to make an excellent point to how we should or shouldn't treat the one and only world we live in. With rising concerns for environmental issues, it's refreshing to see that film makers take that extra step to try and keep ourselves grounded in reality rather than being wasteful of resources, disrespectful of the world around us, and sheltering the future leaders who can actually DO something about the situations that we've managed to create.<br/><br/>I encourage EVERYone to take their children to see this! Not only is it entertaining for adults, but it helps keep children happy and harmonious with the world around them, all while watching dancing penguins.<br/><br/>10 out of 10."

A fully entertaining movie, with fun and wit conveyed a simple message of being eco-cycle friendly!

","I thought this movie was excellent, and worth waiting to see. It was well organized, and the penguins in it were just adorable! If you have any interest in penguins, you should definitely go see this movie. It's about a penguin named Mumble (appropriatly named for his poor singing) who loves to dance, but can't sing like everyone else. The penguins in the colony think that he's the reason for all of their fish disappearing, but he knows it's not true, and sets out to find the real reason why. <br/><br/>Although this movie is great overall, it does have a few things that should have been changed. The plot line changes throughout the movie, which may be a little confusing for younger kids. I found the voice of Mumble's mom, Norma Jean (voiced by Nicole Kidman), to be very annoying. I don't know, maybe it's just me... But anyways, this movie is still good, and even though it's targeted for littler kids, it's a great movie for everyone to watch."

"Jay_Exiomo","7","2","6","22 November 2006"," Dance of the penguins
","After marching to stardom last year via the hit documentary ""March of the Penguins,"" the fat birds in tuxedo - or at least their pixelated versions - are back on the big screen with the Aussie film ""Happy Feet,"" joining this year's battalion of computer-animated features that rival Noah's ark for the number of animals included. But with such dazzling visual elements (oh yes, I'm in total awe), catchy songs and an earnest story, director George Miller's (""Babe: Pig in the City"") Antarctic adventure stand out from an otherwise overly saturated film genre that has had recently become a hit-or-miss affair.<br/><br/>""Happy Feet"" is built around the premise that each emperor penguin must have his own ""heartsong."" Taught from childhood, each penguin is expected to find within him/her the song essential to finding a lifelong mate and having children. Enter Mumble (younger one voiced by E.G. Daily, and older one voiced by Elijah Wood), a young emperor penguin who finds himself a stranger to his own kind because he can't sing, although he's unusually gifted in tap dancing. This, much to the dismay of his parents - Memphis (Hugh Jackman in his nth movie this year) and Norma Jean (Nicole Kidman).<br/><br/>Soon, fish supply in the south pole is dwindling and the penguins are starving. Noah (Hugo Weaving), an elder of the penguin colony, blames Mumble and his strange talents for the curse and exiles him. Convinced that ""alien"" beings are responsible for the food shortage, Mumble sets on a journey to have a diplomatic affair with them regarding their predicament. Along with him is a group of adelie penguins, their appointed leader Ramón (Robin Williams...) and a know-it-all spiritual teacher penguin, Lovelace (... and Robin Williams).<br/><br/>The animation is amazingly done with photo-realistic environments. Also, while the characters are not overall distinctive and memorable, it's compensated by their adorable nature (cute yet not all-too-cloying) and good voice performances. Robin Williams, in particular, steals every scene he's in - which is a lot, since he does two personalities here. It's clear he's having fun, and so are we.<br/><br/>Ah, but if only the film stayed on track. Towards the end, the scriptwriters decide to do an Al Gore and impart an environmental advocacy campaign, which is in itself a noble idea. But here, it feels as a misapplied digression and taking all merits into account, it's something that hedges the film from what it should achieve.<br/><br/>Still, in a time where the boundaries of animation has very much expanded to the point that it has become mostly tedious, ""Happy Feet"" manages to enchant the viewer not only through its breathtaking visuals, but also through its charming characters and the overall innocence of the film. It's right up near ""Cars"" (I haven't seen ""Flushed Away"" yet) and that's surely one thing to be happy about."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","6","20 November 2006"," Visually stunning and downright adorable
","As you leave the theater, ""Happy Feet"" gives you exactly what its title offers. This movie is clearly intended to be nothing but fun and it delivers exactly that.<br/><br/>Probably the most enjoyable part of the film is its uniqueness. It breaks much of the mold that every CGI film in the last few years has stuck to unflinchingly through song and dance that while not presented in a musical movie style still make the film incredibly fun. While the plot is ultimately insignificant to most of the movie, it is still engaging through the action and especially the characters. While some of the action sequences feel straight out of ""Finding Nemo"" or ""Ice Age,"" the characters--namely the amigos, or a band of small penguins led by Robin Williams--are what saves this film. In fact, the film is nothing but cute until the amigos come along and add some personality and humor.<br/><br/>The most impressive aspect, however, are the visual effects. The penguin fur is remarkable and one can only sit in awe at the realism of the penguins' breathing. The non-animal elements were also incredibly realistic, like the settings, as well as the incorporation of live action footage which was a much better choice than making the humans CGI. The visual choice here was a much better choice compared to some of the more cartoon-like computer animated films like ""Madagascar.""<br/><br/>While the film is not better than those computer-animated films that have the formula down to a tee, its unique style makes it much better than the films that have merely tried to imitate with mediocrity rather than innovate, which ""Happy Feet"" truly does."

This movie could have been a hundred times better with puppets, something Jim Henson style, but they always go for the cheap and cheesy animation these days, and the product of that is a seemingly endless stream of easily forgotten movies that are saturating the film industry and turning the video game industry into a bad scene of movie games as well.

","""Haters will hate!"", ""Haters are conservative!"", ""Haters don't see it is a funny movie for kiddos!"".<br/><br/>Hello, I'm a hater, nice to meet you! I don't generally hate children's movies and literature. I find most of them great fun for both grown-ups and little ones. But this can be only achieved when the movie offers fun and action with a bit of education to the kids and something to move the adults or make them think. This movie offers nothing but very illogical ""teaching"" about environment for the children and sex jokes for the adults. Besides, call me whatever names, but I assure you, children to some extent do tell dry-humping from ""playing"" or ""dancing"". Even to think such content is all what we expect from a family movie is offensive to the intellect of any age group.<br/><br/>I finally decided to give this picture 2 stars, for I appreciate the way they animated sea and sky and all the work on choreography, but the plot, characters and dialogs deserve minus rating.<br/><br/>If I had this silly habit of talking to myself, I would have whispered ""What?"", ""Why?"" and ""Excuse me!"" quite often.<br/><br/>The major failure is the clash of anthropomorphic animals with actual humans. For me it worked in ""Ice Age"", scored a weak pass in ""Ratatouille"" and hit the very bottom here. If there are actual humans in the movie (of one kind), why are there different human ethnicities, cultures and religions mapped on the penguins? It is so illogical that it hurts. And it's also closer to offensive (stereotypes) than liberal (variety). Also, the allusions to religion are very much biased, since the leaders are portrayed as dumb, selfish and forbidding others from having fun and being themselves.<br/><br/>It is unbelievably ironic that this production won an Oscar over ""Cars"", which had no religious themes (thanks God!), but taught that there is something else in life than our personal goals that it is worth to slow down for and that the old ones have their story to tell and deserve respect and friendship. Ewww, so ""conservative""! Now I see clearly the spirit of the filmmakers and critics in general.<br/><br/>As for the ""educative"" part about saving environment and endangered species on our planet the story was also illogical and didn't lead me to expected conclusions ""we should be aware and caring"". Instead it filled my head with a bunch of ridiculous thoughts and associations.<br/><br/>If I had just discovered that there exists a colony of penguins with near-human intelligence attempting to communicate with our species I would advocate a long-term research on their abilities and tried to create and artificial language of communication between them and us. That would surely change a lot more in our study of nature than simply giving up fishing.<br/><br/>It's quite sad and unfair to make children believe that politicians or entrepreneurs will change anything because animals can ""tell"" them something. To push my train of thought yet a bit more off the rail, all animals need the resources we are using (water, food, forest). It is such a serious and heartbreaking issue that it's the high time for us as the human race to commit a mass suicide, so that aliens could carry our souls out of this Earth and we would leave it all to the animals who tap and sing Gospel songs about mating.<br/><br/>Sarcasm over. Review over."

","Me and my girlfriend watched this for half an hour and then unanimously decided to give up on it, which doesn't happen often. In retrospect I found out that this even won an Academy Award for best animated movie of the year: wow, it must have been a very dire year for animated movies - - or otherwise this is further proof how worthless the Oscar really is as indicator for good movies.<br/><br/>Basically this is March Of The Penguins as a computer-animated cartoon with a bit of humour thrown in. They tried to make this look relatively realistic and non-anthropomorphic rather than cute and cuddly. In consequence, the movie is still far too unrealistic to be educational or enlightening, and it isn't very entertaining either. The jokes are few and not that good, the dialogues not that witty, and the plot is pretty inane: a penguin couple hatches an ""odd"" chick which stumbles strangely. A little later we learn that every penguin has its ""heartsong"" (pass the sick bag, please), except for our little penguin, who prefers to dance (incidentally, the dancing isn't that impressive, probably because animated tapdancing rarely is). He is ostracised by his peers but starts to win the heart of this penguin girl. At this point I switched off. What probably would have followed is a story about inclusiveness (it's OK to be different) and to thy own self be true.<br/><br/>Incidentally, we saw another but excellent animated movie about penguins immediately afterward, Surf's Up, which I can highly recommend.

After a party of graduation ceremony, even though other penguins enjoy singing, Mumble is depressed because he sing a terrible song there and others boo at him. Then without notice, he arrives at other country. Then, he meets 5 penguins, Amigos. And, he surprised that they praise Mumble's dancing. Mumble and Amigos go back to imperial penguin's country, however the elders who enshrine tradition order Mumble to exile from a country because they think that Mumble's dancing has a bad influence(decreasing of foods) on penguin's country. From then on Mumble start to travel to find a cause of bad influence with Amigos. What's the cause and how mumble will be? <br/><br/>First, I want to say about the soundtrack. Music is necessary for this movie. From music we can see various feelings of penguins, and we can enjoy not only from eyes but also from our ears. Moreover, computer graphics are surprisingly real.Before watching, I can not imagine that penguin dances tap, but after watching it, it becomes usual thing that penguins dance. In addition, of course I recommend children to watch this, but it's never childish movie.

He is the only penguin that can dance because his father dropped his egg. The acting was good for the most part. Robin Williams as the Latin penguins is absolutely hilarious.

","Whilst I enjoyed this film at one level, I was disappointed and dissatisfied that the premise didn't gel. Fortunately for the makers of the film 3d animations are enjoyed by kids who can swallow films which have a rickety base and provide a poor foundation for the whole film. The dance sequences were great but then again, getting animated figures to synchronize in perfect time to music is no great feat unlike in the real world. The chase scenes and those which provided dazzling camera work cannot really be applauded too loudly as this is by now de facto standard in animations where anything is possible. If these elements weren't in place you would be left with a poor film with a shaky plot. I couldn't quite go with the idea of a penguin society where its members relied on song to establish a place in their society. I just couldn't buy into it. Having failed to accept that, the film failed for me as this was the basis for Mambo's adventure. I would like to say nicer things about it as on one level I enjoyed it, whilst on the other I was nagged continually that something at the start hadn't worked for me and that the rest of the film was now suffering."

I felt like a child watching it crying and laughing all the time... and made me realize how real it is. I agree with almost all the comments of this movie (except for the negatives ones) so I don't got much to say only that I strongly recommend it for any ages. I do not think it was a long movie, I rather preferred it a little bit longer, because every bit of it kept your sight in the screen. Really the best animated movie I have ever seen. I got really impressed with the details and the face expressions of each penguin, not far away from a real one. Hopefully, a lot of people will start making a difference and preserve what is left of this world."

","This movie was something special. I'm not a person that gets depressed or teary over movies, but this one did almost make me cry. I didn't, but I admit I could have.<br/><br/>The things Mumble goes through. He nearly gets eaten by birds, he gets outcasted by everyone and everything he knows and loves, and he finds solace in similar outcasts like him. (A group of hilarious Mexican penguins.) He even gets trapped in a human zoo, where we nearly loses any will to live. My god.<br/><br/>The movie was great, the messages were on the dot. The only thing I didn't like was how the humans just fixed everything all up and nice just because they saw dancing penguins. Would we do that in real life? Sadly, probably not. We'd probably just export the entire colony. The music was awesome, though random, still enjoyable."

","Just watched this with my wife, my 5 yr old & my 4 yr old for our regular Saturday night film night. We didn't make it to the end ... we all disliked it.<br/><br/>It's almost as if they couldn't decide who they were making the film for ... but one thing is for certain, it wasn't for children. Here's a few reasons for not watching it as a family film:<br/><br/>1) Way too much sexual overtone ... not the occasional clever innuendo that they often put in for the benefit of the adults, just plain sexual insinuations in songs, behaviour and speech.<br/><br/>2) The scary stuff was way too scary for little ones.<br/><br/>3) The story line was way too complex. The religious allegories, the alien allegories ... just too incomprehensible for children but too patronising for adults.<br/><br/>4) Full of the usual clichéd plot elements which seems more intent on making it's moral point than simply telling a story.<br/><br/>5) Too long.<br/><br/>Redeeming features that raise the score to 3 instead of 1 are the excellent graphics and excellent music ... but you can get those by buying a good music video compilation.<br/><br/>There seems to be a mindset now in some studios that as long as something is animated, it's a children's/family film. It's not. The best family entertainment films are those that are made explicitly with younger children in mind ... and then you weave in a few more subtle ""adult"" elements for the benefit of the grown ups. Those that seem to try and please everyone from the outset fall between two stools and fail miserably. Happy Feet is one of those. If they'd made a more simplistic, child appropriate film from the outset then I'm sure they could have weaved in a couple of elements for the grown-ups. As it is, it pleases no-one. A real disappointment."

","As a father of three young'uns I have developed (however unwillingly) quite a knowledge of movies aimed at children. It is a rare movie that can find the balance between entertaining kids and adults. Unfortunately, this movie does neither. The best, and most honest, critics are children, and my children tired of this movie very quickly.<br/><br/>Of course, the Hollywood cognescenti were falling over themselves to elevate this movie in the eyes of the public and the reason why became blatantly obvious from the first few minutes.

","I would rather put my children in a burlap sack and throw them over a bridge than let them watch this movie. I'll admit that my fondness for penguins made me eager to watch this film, but that as soon as it went into all that business with the heart-songs, I was quickly disenchanted. Why would such a noble bird be running around singing pop songs? And, why were some of the penguins Mexican stereotypes? Why did the lead females look like they had breasts underneath all their feathers? It's all beyond me.<br/><br/>On top of that, the environmental message was just so over the top. Now don't get me wrong, I love the environment and want all of our animal friends to live long, happy lives with no shortage of fish. But I think there are better ways to get that message across than sitting through a relentless lecture from a poorly written kids movie. <br/><br/>I went to see it with my little brother, and we weren't ten minutes into it before we began to give each other doubtful looks. By the time it was 30 minutes in, we knew for sure we had each just wasted $6.50 and two hours. All I can say is ""Thank God we got the matinée price."""

","It amuses me that many of the 'reviewers' complain about the message in the movie but send their own hateful message in their posts. ""If you didn't like this movie, you are a clueless (read: Republican) soccer mom!!!"".<br/><br/>Stop that. Since when do mothers with kids who play soccer have the same freakin' political point of view? I'm a mom with a kid who plays soccer. I am almost as liberal as you can get, I think. I agree with the ""message"" of this movie. And, I didn't like this movie! I didn't really like it the first time I saw it when it was called ""March of the Penguins!"" (Ok, these penguins sing and dance.) <br/><br/>Yep, the animation was superb. Some of the music was fun. I don't like musical/tap-dancing movies that much to begin with, so it doesn't make it any better for me when they are animated penguins.<br/><br/>The story didn't make sense to me - ""hey, those penguins are dancing. We must be overfishing!"". Plus, this is the kind of film that makes me embarrassed to be a green liberal. The message is delivered in a way that is guaranteed to turn off, oh, at least about 51% of the population.<br/><br/>Also, is there a word for sexually anthropomorphizing? That's what they did to the female penguins. Hollywood, you are driving me crazy.<br/><br/>Lastly, instead of hiring Robin Williams to do four characters, why not hire an actual Latino or African American? I like Robin Williams, but him doing a stereotyped Latino penguin was irking me.<br/><br/>Really lastly, some of the scenes are downright scary and sad. ""Happy Feet"" is something of a misnomer for much of the film.<br/><br/>There are plenty of animated films I've loved. This was not one of them.<br/><br/>But I give everyone else plenty of room to absolutely love it. We can all coexist without hating each other."
"missmarmite","5","1","2","5 April 2007"," Disappointing
","Whenever Robin Williams does a film or a voice, I want to see it. So I wanted to see Happy Feet as well. I didn't know what the film was about apart from being about penguins. Which probably was bad, as I sort of expected a children's film (you know, it being an animated film). I was rather disappointed.<br/><br/>What I watched was an animated film which, yes, was aimed at children, but that children probably can't understand. At least not young ones and in Germany everybody is allowed to see this film, even children under 6. There's lots of sex talk, never plainly outspoken but always there, very often underlined with gestures. I'm not prude, but what does it do in a film like this? It's not necessary for the story, is it? Has nothing to do with a story about a penguin which is different and who shows his people that being different is okay too.<br/><br/>Well, if only that would have been all in the film. But no, of course there has to be a message, too. Don't forget, this was done for children, they have right to get a message, just a good story isn't enough. And yes, the message has to be hammered home instead of being subtle. The last ten minutes were almost unbearable. What, a little penguin dances? Oh my, let's stop fishing empty the seven seas!!! Please. Why is it that this happens so very often in American films? Can't they write a message into a film without clubbing the viewers to death with it? Only a few filmmakers seem to be able to do so, most of them doing independent films...<br/><br/>The same kind of story (someone is different, leaves and comes back to help the community with his different ideas) you can find in the equally animated film A Bug's Life. The characters in this film are more lovable, although equally voiced by Americans you don't have the feeling they come from a 'hood in New York but they speak just normal American English, and the message is treated subtly here. You learn something without noticing, without being hammered into the ground. Which is very important. A far better film!"
"bsinc","6","1","2","1 April 2007"," The last 1/3 sadly leaves an unnecessary bitter-sweet flavor
","The first and the second act of the movie (the first being Mumble thinking he's not worthy of staying in his flock, and the second one restoring his self-confidence) were a pleasant surprise to me, since the trailer failed miserably to impress me. Light, fluffy, and funny, ""Happy Feet"" succeeds in bringing new atmosphere to the usually ""by-the-book"" storytelling in today's animation...and it does so with what could barely be called a plot...but I certainly can't hold that against the movie because it manages to entertain nonetheless, plus the animation looked really nice.<br/><br/>There were some moments when I found the musical portion highly annoying, but at others it gave me goose bumps, so I'm pretty evened-out on this element of the movie, although the idea was at least fresh.<br/><br/>However the last 20 minutes slow the pace, try to quickly inflict us with a feeling of guilty conscience and remorse (which they do), and then without at least ending what it starts on a high moral note, or any explanations, for that matter, it quickly wraps up the charade. It all feels terribly forced and unnecessary (albeit the topic of human pollution is one that ""shouldn't"" be overlooked) and had the movie just glanced at some of those serious topics it would have probably made a greater impact. But in this case I was left pondering if I just saw a light-hearted family movie that unsuccessfully squeezed-in some serious elements, or a failed attempt at a moral lecture that was sadly turned into a joy-ride."

"LaDanseuse","5","1","2","8 January 2007"," Neither happy nor kid-oriented
","The first half of the movie was fine. It was happy-go-lucky with cute, fluffy, singing penguins, just like what the previews promised. Then, it got intense. Sure, some kid-movies can get pretty intense (The Incredibles, for example), but Happy Feet just got one intense episode after another, and soon you have no idea where the plot is going. At first I thought it was about Mumble trying to be accepted in spite of the fact that he can't sing. But then he goes on this wild and impossible goose chase trying find out why there's no more fish for his fellow penguins, in which he ends up in a zoo tapping dancing for delighted zoo-goers (frankly, if a penguin started tap dancing to me, I'd have a seizure). I really don't know what this movie is about.<br/><br/>In addition to the confusing plot, Happy Feet has some not-so-happy-nor-subtle innuendos for the little kiddies to eat up and then ask their mortified parents about.<br/><br/>It's also got an environmentalist agenda. I must, however, disagree with other reviewers. People are NOT portrayed as evil in this people. People are portrayed as ignorant and self-centered, but in the end, it's also people who return Mumble to his home, learn to understand his colony, and eventually rectify the fish problem. As for the pollution... well, it IS true that what we dump in the oceans affect wildlife, there's no way around that. Nonetheless, the political statements should be saved for other films or other plot lines (if they wanted to make a cartoon about penguins getting choked by litter, then they shouldn't call it ""Happy Feet"").<br/><br/>This movie is better off as a fluffy kid's story about accepting differences in other people/penguins."
"peter-ramshaw-1","6","1","2","5 January 2007"," Disappoints immensely
","While the animation in this movie is, at times, outstanding, the whole shebang simply falls incredibly flat due to the lack of any sensible storyline and genuine emotional involvement. It is animation by numbers and has no heart.<br/><br/>Miller, no doubt lulled by the success of Babe and similar tales, seems to equate animals per se with cuteness regardless of how moronic and unlovable they may be. Sadly, however, simply whacking a couple of big human-like eyes in the middle of a penguin's head does not make it cute. From the moment the film starts, I was cringing internally.<br/><br/>The film is schizophrenic too, almost like two badly-conceived movies shredded and stitched back together again. The result is a hideous Frankenstein of a movie; part musical, part drama, part low-level stand-up comedy (anyone in this day and age who thinks funny-talking Mexicans/Latinos are still humorous - even if done by the redoubtable Robin Williams - should think again). Unfortunately Happy Feet fails to hit any of its genre targets.<br/><br/>From the opening scene where we are told (not shown or explained to) that these penguins wander about singing until another penguin recognises their 'heart song' and then they fall in love, until the oddly-forced 'adventure' at the end. Dancing, which is what the hero Mumble does instead of sing, is anathema to penguins apparently even though they ALL dance when they sing anyway. Obviously it is only tap-dancing which is 'banned'. Happy Feet is a dismal drudge to watch - aside from the occasional wonderful animation sequence or two. When I asked my eight-year-old daughter what she thought when we came out of the theatre she said, simply: ""It was a bit long"". Miller would have done well to test it on kids first instead of the literati who, one feels, still somehow apparently feel obligated to think that this tired old Robin Williams patter (think Aladin etc etc) is actually funny. It's not.<br/><br/>In short, the penguins are not cute. They are unlovable. The scenery is bland and an animation cheat. The story-line is so forced it almost bursts in places and the music is corny and, on the whole, inappropriate too. To make matters worse, what looks, at the end, like it is going to be mind-blowingly brilliant twist, the animation of humans, turns out to be live-action footage instead. What a let-down.<br/><br/>'Long-winded, tired and self-indulgent'. That actuate describes the movie and, sadly, it might also apply to Miller too these days. There is none of the freshness of Babe in this re-hashed mess that owes more to Hollywood vanity than it does to any real desire on the film-maker's part to genuinely touch the viewer's emotions."
"arjan-32","6","1","2","5 January 2007"," Odd mix ends up being decent movie
","Happy Feet is a good movie and plenty entertaining, but misses the boat on several points.<br/><br/>Cons: The movie begins great, with lots of sing and dance, giving great entertainment value to the start. After that however the movie slowly seems to dwindle down, instead of building up to a climactic ending. The problem with that lies in the matter of combining the two major story lines: Mumble's and Gloria's relationship and the food shortage. The two end up having nothing to do with each other at all, leaving the viewer essentially switching back and forth between unrelated story lines. This greatly disturbs the flow of the movie, making it difficult for the viewer to really get 'into' the movie. The result is that at the end of the movie, when both story lines come to a conclusion, neither is really satisfactory. Both story lines really end with a 'deus ex machina' effect, rather than the main character resolving things, it just more or less 'happens'.<br/><br/>Something I personally found quite disturbing was the whole notion that Mumble's unique ability came forth from what is suggested to be a 'birth defect', which is a great shame. Even though the movie ends up touching upon the subject, it doesn't positively get resolved and leaves the viewer with idea that mumble is truly 'wrong', rather than just different.<br/><br/>Pros: Great humor, great animation, great singing. The entire idea of 'alien abduction' of birds by humans holds up a philosophical funny-mirror that puts the ""real"" alien abduction stories in an interesting perspective. I suppose people these days are also a lot more sensitive to the ecological theme, especially in a day and age where 'global warming' is now more and more becoming a fact supported by news stories, rather than a doomsday scenario portrayed by scientist.<br/><br/>Conclusion: In a sense this movie seems a lost opportunity, animated movies are usually just laughs and a romantic story. Happy Feet tries to change that, but ends up being somewhat of a hybrid, having a bit of each, accomplishing only a mediocre result.<br/><br/>Overall, a 6/10, well worth watching, but definitely lacking."

","From seeing the trailers and looking at the impressive list of actors attached to this film, I thought I'd be seeing something entertaining. It wasn't. The movie relies too much on familiarity of the songs and cutesy animation. The story- actually, for the entire first hour, there is NO STORY. It seems like just a bunch of different scenes put together for no apparent reason. Only in the last half hour does the film finally seem to have a point- environmental issues.<br/><br/>Admittedly, the message of them film is a very good one for children to hear. I think this film will work for very small children under the age of 6, and I highly recommend it for them. But for me and my friend (aged 18 and 19, respectively), it nearly bored us to pieces.<br/><br/>One highlight: the first musical number was very cute, and the allusions to Elvis (the father, ""Memphis"") and Marilyn Monroe (the mother,""Norma Jean"") and being together was a great idea!

","If ""Ice Age"" and ""The March of the Penguins"" conceived a child, it would be probably be something along the lines of ""Happy Feet"", the latest addition to the abyss of personified animal cartoons. Although Happy Feet doesn't bring anything new to the world of animated cinema, it does happen to carry the warmest of hearts as we're stuck in the middle of a season that's full of movies that are as cold and languid as the arctic itself.<br/><br/>The film opens with a panorama of the South Pole, loaded with exotically vibrant shades of blue that are fueled by some of the most beautiful animation you've ever seen. And if that isn't enough to indulge your eyes, then those cute dancing penguins are sure to unlock a smile upon your face. <br/><br/>Don't let the fact that Happy Feet contains a slew of singing penguins make you think that it's a pure-bred musical. The harmony of music just plays as a sort of crux of the film, as the penguins utilize singing as a sort of strict social code. To penguin society, each penguin is destined to have a ""love song"", or a song that will help them find their true love and happiness. This harmonic tactic works radically for the penguins, yet, is obsolete to the film's protagonist, Mumble (the ever so youthful voice of Elijah Wood). As an egg, Mumble was accidentally dropped by his father, Memphis, and as a result, was born incapable of singing and instead developed feet with a magnetic energy towards rhythm, pouncing to any beat imaginable. Mumble's disability acts crucially towards his social status among the community, making him an outcast amongst his peers. In a way, Mumble is proud of his difference and takes accepts it as his own, personally joyful and unique talent. Yet, when it comes to winning the heart of his life-long love Gloria (Brittney Murphy) and her harmonic crescendo of a voice, his vibrant feet just won't do, leading him to embark on an adventurous journey of self discovery.<br/><br/>The film is full of star-studded voice talents, from the youthful Elijah Wood to the irresistibly comedic Robin Williams, who entertains the audience with a feast of accicents and sessions of improvisation. The animation is nothing shorter than awe-inspiring, bringing not only a lush collection of colors but also a rather large sense of realism. <br/><br/>Happy Feet carries the essential, heart-warming elements a good family film should carry. There's the underdog hero and his struggle to win his true love, the tale of morality, the comedic spine, and those impeccably cute penguins that will have you smiling long after the film has reached its conclusion. Although it does have its flaws, particularly its rather extensive running time that is built by its collection of subplots, Happy Feet is an overall congenial film for the holiday season."
"jlgriffey","8","1","2","18 December 2006"," Happy Feet, Sad Message (*may contain spoilers*)
","When I was asked to go see Happy Feet, I was not excited one bit. Seeing another cg children's film was not high on my things to do list. However, when I left the theater my opinion had changed quite a bit. This is truly one of the years best films.<br/><br/>To begin the film is in my opinion the best computer animated film ever made. Not as in the best flick, just the most visually amazing. Sorry to all of those Final Fantasy people out there who disagree. The move is extremely viceral which is hard to achieve with animation. At times it feels like a roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>That said underneath the beauty are some great voices. This has one of the finest voice acting cast that I can think of to date. Hugo Weaving and Robin Williams are the stand outs. Even with these great voices, the film manages to speak more loudly with the content of the story.<br/><br/>The film is truly in every way an expose on some of the darker sides of humans. The film begins with an interesting take on our herd mentality. I like the use of penguins instead of cattle. Through out the film we are given examples of how one must conform to societies standards or become an outcast. We are also given examples of society using religion and fear to rule the masses. Then there is an a sub plot on a dysfunctional family. Finally, the obvious attack on the way we treat the world we live in. The film does a great job, of showing the true cruelty that pollution can cause to the natural world. The scene at the ice station is truly phenomenal. I think that this is where the problem lies.<br/><br/>Without giving away the ending, it goes on too long. The film has a perfect chance to end on a more down note and force the audience to accept the truth of the film's message. This however wouldn't work extremely well in a film that is suppose to cater to the young and old. The main problem with the film is that it is a serious commentary on some serious problems in our world that pulls back at the crucial moments to not push away the younger audience members. This was a tough task I can imagine for the creators. However I applaud them for trying. It is admirable to try and get kids thinking instead of throwing gross out humor at them. This is a good film that could have been really great with a little more bite."
"irmddj","5","1","2","18 December 2006"," Happy Feet Want A Happy Story Too...
","I saw this movie at an IMAX theatre, mostly because it had been ages since I saw an IMAX-movie and I simply wanted to see what it was like again. Unfortunately, this movie isn't made for IMAX: this technology requires many grand sweeping overviews, looking over steep cliffs, and the like. There are moments in the movie when you feel the IMAX-magic, but they are far and few between and not really worth the extra price of an admission ticket.<br/><br/>Onto the movie then: the CGI-animation is (of course) well done, with lots of attention being paid to hair and patches of wet fur. Down looks like down in this movie. The tracks the penguins make in the snow are another nice touch. The animation is fluid, although you have to keep in mind that penguins are not the most difficult animals to animate.<br/><br/>Where I found the movie lacking was the story. The idea of penguins needing to have a song of their own, and that one little chick due to the carelessness of his dad when he was still an egg can only 'sing with his feet' is a little contrived, but okay---you need a background anyway, and this is as good as any. Unfortunately, the reason the little penguin is cast out (being different and therefore not one to appease the Great Guin who bestows food on the penguins) is not told very accurately. There's but a few hints that things are amiss, but when he is finally cast out it all of a sudden becomes his sole raison d'être. To that point (one hour into the movie!) the viewer is led to believe that Mumbles will somehow learn the other penguins that dancing is as good a way of singing as is having a good voice, so the shift in storyline is rather abrupt. He even rejects the most desirable girl penguin of his generation in his quest 'to bring back the fish'. Mumbles is captured, put in a zoo, and eventually begins to tap and dance for a little human girl. This allows him to return to the colony where he fulfills his quest by persuading the other penguins to dance, and thus more or less tell the humans that they should stop fishing in the region. And that's the end. Mumbles doesn't get the girl---she took another. The 'priests' amongst the penguins say nothing about their errors in judging Mumbles. None of the penguins is seen to thank the hero of the story. How a penguin who literally swam across the ocean is able to return to his colony as if nothing happened remains a mystery: he should be bored stiff in their world of songs.<br/><br/>I don't like the way this story was told: it leaves me dissatisfied and full of questions. It trails around aimlessly, and when it finally hits on something worth telling, it is more or less hammered into place like a carpet which never seems to fit. There's lots of singing and dancing of course, but there aren't many tunes which get stuck in your head. It just goes to show that even with a team of excellent CGI-animators, you cannot expect things to work out as if by magic if there's no strong story framework to rely upon.<br/><br/>I'm giving this a 5 out of 10: definite potential, but ultimately weak and not very interesting. I recommend you wait until the DVD release, if at all."

Movies like Garfield's were not interesting enough to keep her down for long. She even developed a case of Happy Feet walking out of the theatre. I would comment that the musical references are too difficult for some audience members to grasp as well as some musical numbers had to many singers singing at the same time, therefore making it hard for this age group to understand the words. Rather than coming out as well-tuned song, it turned into static sound."

","HAPPY FEET is a joyous, largely musical cartoon involving the search for a dwindling fish supply by a brave young emperor penguin. The gag is that this penguin was born with a bad singing voice in a society defined by its singing agility. But man, can he dance! The irony for the adults in the audience is that when this kid tries to sing, he sounds exactly like a real penguin. But to penguin ears, he brays like a donkey. The movie is filled with great pop tunes of the last 50 years. The animation and artistry are first rate, and it looks a lot like ICE AGE. The movie does bog down in the second half as this Fred Astaire of penguins goes in search of the ""aliens"" who have disrupted his land. We lose the music and the film's rhythm during this extended sequence. But it comes around again at the very end for a big, toe-tapping finale. It should be noted the indefatigable Robin Williams voices not one but two characters."

","Happy Feet is a heart-warming, fun for the family movie. It tells the story of Mumble, a ""unique"" penguin, who can't seem to find his penguin heart-song. Throughout the movie, we watch Mumble discover who he is and become proud of his difference.<br/><br/>The movie is filled with wonderful music that audiences of all ages will enjoy including classics such as ""Kiss"" by Prince, ""Somebody to Love"" by Queen, and a Spanish version of Ol' Blue Eyes' ""My Way"". Along with a colorful and talented cast including Eljah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving, and Robin William, Happy Feet is soon to be set in the heart of children across the nation.<br/><br/>We meet an incredible variety of characters such as Gloria (Murphy) who befriends the ""unique"" Mumble (Wood) as well as an 'Elvis' singing penguin adequately named Memphis (Jackman) and his love interest Norma Jean (Kidman). This movie will soon be on every kid's shelf next to ""Toy Story"", ""The Lion King"", and ""Finding Nemo"". The movies graphics are spell-bounding. It holds themes and messages that are current and eternal. Audiences around the world are tapping their feet to the music of Happy Feet and I can't blame them.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

","Happy Feet could almost be described as a Top of the Pops animation of March of the Penguins. But it was nearly four years in the making - as long as the latter hit documentary that moved the hearts of millions in the story of penguins ready to make every sacrifice to give love. A family film rather than kids' entertainment, Happy Feet tells the story of a vocally challenged penguin who nevertheless has a gift for dance. Against all odds, he finds a way to encourage mankind to help penguins survive. The penguins are cute and cuddly, the landscapes are realistically rendered, and the subtexts are delivered with an accuracy to make non-green authoritarians wince.<br/><br/>Investment in the film goes beyond the quickly recouped $85M. Research included sending expeditions to the Antarctic so visual effects and camera crews could capture the textures, light and landscapes. The result is a film that looks and feels realistic enough to be taken seriously - giving extra weight to its strong environmental message. But a film like this is only as good as the fun it generates. The humour is genuine and wholesome but the tap-dancing is addictive.<br/><br/>Our blue-eyed penguin hero Mumble (or Mambo) has the voice of Elijah 'Frodo' Wood but the tap-dancing of dancer-choreographer Savion Glover. In the production notes to March of the Penguins, Luc Jacquet tild us that, in real life, a penguin walks through the crowd and occasionally stops, trumpeting a loud and violent song. This is repeated at intervals until a fellow penguin answers him, upon which ensues a succession of dancing duos. Happy Feet's hero has to fast forward to the dancing bit.<br/><br/>Dance is one of the oldest means of communication, pre-dating language. As a key story element it is an ideal device for making the connection from animals to the audience but also as the pivotal ingredient of Mumble's lovableness that eventually gets him noticed by environmentalists.<br/><br/>But Happy Feet is not preachy. There are moments of pure belly laugh, such as when mamma-penguin regurgitates fish for junior. Or the extended joke about 'alien abductions' (ie contact with people). Some of the humour is more sophisticated - the high priest sounded to me suspiciously like the Reverend Ian Paisley. The knocks on dogmatic, harmful, overbearing and out-of-touch religious dogma will be too close to comfort for some of the faithful. And the parallel moral fables in the story may be beyond younger audiences.<br/><br/>Happy Feet easily crosses an ocean of feelgood and is both an ethically responsible film for children and addictive entertainment for adults. That alone is a remarkable achievement."
"Solipsisticblog","6","1","2","7 December 2006"," An admirable, sometimes entertaining mess
","Here's a misguided, muddled film. George Miller, director of the inspired ""Babe 2: Pig in the City"" and the Mad Max series, returns to kiddie fare with this tale of a unique penguin who can't fit in with his singing brethren. Little Mumble can't sing, only squawk, so he can't perfect the necessary mating call--a heart song--needed to help advance the species. He can, however, do a mean tap routine. The heart songs, in a bizarre and off-putting twist, consist of contemporary pop hits. I love the Prince song ""Kiss"" but this steamy, definitely adult song is off-putting when coming out of the mouths of somewhat realistic looking penguins in a kids film.<br/><br/>These penguins aren't just concerned with wooing each other, but also with the decreasing fish population. There aren't enough fish to feed the penguins--a problem which eventually provides Mumble with his final triumphant quest. I don't object to the movie having a pro-environment message. (What? It's insidious to instill children with a desire for stewardship of their environment?) I don't object to the time honored message of respect others differences--see The Island of Lost Toys. I don't object to penguins singing. I don't object to the conventions of kiddie animated film--the voice of Robin Williams, goofy sidekicks, sly asides to keep the adults entertained. I don't object, even, to realistically rendered wildlife.<br/><br/>But all these elements together makes for a giant mess. Mumble has not one, but two quests--neither clearly defined--sucking all dramatic momentum out of the movies nearly two hour running time. He's surrounded by goofy penguins, lifelike penguins, and a Robin Williams penguin. There are chases, dance numbers, and messages galore. The movie is both fiercely original in its climax and tired in its reliance on genre staples. You won't know where this movie is headed, but you're also going to be looking at your watch.<br/><br/>There are individual elements to admire in the film. The animation is fantastic and looks terrific in IMAX. The final musical number is fun and there is a great chase sequence involving a sea lion, but the movie feels like a rough draft. The movie needs more focus and less characters. An admirable, sometimes entertaining mess."
"animationchick","Null","1","2","6 December 2006"," Heavy Message Bogs Down Story
","This weekend I had the opportunity to see Warner Bros. 'Happy Feet.' I had heard nothing but positive reviews about 'Happy Feet' with little sprinkles of 'has a strong message' thrown in. To say I was excited to see this film is an understatement. After viewing the film in its entirety, I must say that I did not like the movie that much.<br/><br/>First, let's talk about the positive aspects of this movie. For starters, the visuals are stunning. The filmmakers obviously wanted a photo-realistic style to tell their story, and they no doubt achieved that effect. The penguins look real and the environments transport you right into Antarctica. Also, 'Happy Feet's is unlike any other animated movie I've ever seen- it's different. And that is definitely a great thing. There are too many cookie-cutter animated movies and paint by numbers story lines out there. The fact that this movie steered into new territory is definitely one of its strengths.<br/><br/>However, in a nutshell I really disliked this film. Why? First, the story had many weaknesses. And secondly, I felt that I was duped and the movie was lacking in every category. The movie that I thought I was going to see was nothing like what I ended up seeing. I felt like I was watching 'March of the Penguins with a Conservation Message' rather than an animated film aimed at a targeted children's audience. <br/><br/>The basic story is that there are penguins in Antarctica, and in order to mate they sing to each other. And by sing I mean sing. We're talking Elvis and Prince and large show-stopping numbers. So when two penguins have a son Mumbles (voiced by Elijah Wood) who is underdeveloped, looks different and is simply unable to sing at all, he is shunned by his community and sets out to prove himself to the world and to his parents. He journeys far away, makes some new friends, and discovers that he does in fact have talent- tap dancing. However, something dangerous is threatening the penguins, and it's up to Mumbles to discover what exactly is threatening them and stop it.<br/><br/>If that was the storyline, and Mumbles uncovers the dangers and saves the day, and the audience learns about tolerance, then the film would be fabulous and I would be writing a very different review. However, that is not how the movie steers. Instead, it starts out in one direction, then takes a turn in the last half and gets preachy and heavy. Suddenly the movie is not about Mumbles, and instead the audience is bombarded with conservation and anti-zoo messages.<br/><br/>Okay with the story out of the way, what about the animation? Well, in short the animation fell flat, and the characters were uninspiring. 70% of the animation was done by motion capture, causing it to feel fake and second rate. The story was largely told by music, in the spirit of the old Disney movies, however I just couldn't get into the tap dancing. And finally, it was hard to tell a difference between the penguins and for that matter I didn't care about any of the characters, besides the main character Mumbles. <br/><br/>In conclusion, 'Happy Feet' would have been more enjoyable if it had been a worldly movie about conservation from the beginning, or alternatively remained a story about Mumbles and his journey. However, instead the movie escalated into something big, something that children probably will not understand, with a large message. And because the story was so disappointing, it made me completely overlook the stunning visuals, which is such a shame.<br/><br/>:::www.animationchick.com:::"

The movie might be a little long for tiny children,but the animation is spectacular. This movie will probably become a classic because it also has a great message.

","It is clear that the idea of this movie came from the ""March of the Penguins"" documentary. I expected more...<br/><br/>The movie attempts to capitalize on the cuteness of the penguin and on amazing life cycle of the Emporer Penguins. This film doesn't even really give lip service to the almost unbelievable feats performed by the Emporer Penguin in the harshest environment on earth. Then again, the story was not intended to retell the story of the penguin... This is where the film fails - the only thing original here is the penguins themselves. The animation and CG effects are top-rate but the story is unoriginal and predictable. Even the musical selections are unoriginal, although it was interesting to hear a revival of the 1980's ""The Message"" by Grandmaster Flash - how that song relates the life of the Emporer Penguin is anybody's guess.<br/><br/>This film is ""Happy Fluff"". The shallow attempts at dealing with real messages such as pollution and overfishing are just that - shallow. Even still the movie does attempt to make us aware of these issues and on how they affect our animal neighbors which is more than I can say about other recent animated features.<br/><br/>The film does have its moments and is better than some other recent animated flicks such as ""Shark Tale"". It was not a waste of time or money but it just did not live up to the hype. If you want the real thing see ""March of the Penguins"".<br/><br/>In summary - excellent cg - but unoriginal."
"Youngbuck11","6","1","2","28 November 2006"," A REVIEW: Happy Feet
","Happy Feet is classed as an animated/comedy/family film and inappropriately so. This film went out of it's way to contain quite a few sexual references that were completely obvious. In one scene, a penguin says ""It's the males that give woman their BOOM"" and he does an awkward movement with his hips, if you get what I mean.<br/><br/>Apart from moral problems, this film's quality lacked in fresh storytelling. There was nothing new about this. It was a ""stock-animated film"" that was created to capitalize on the random success of ""March of the Penguins."" In fact, the story became slightly boring half-way through, but semi-paid off with an environmentalist climax, saying that fishing is wrong, which is completely absurd.<br/><br/>While it had fairly good animation, this film was certainly not break-through material. In fact, seeing nothing but white for so long got a little dull, but it wasn't too bad.<br/><br/>Overlooking all the bad, this film was fun and had some very funny moments.

"DICK STEEL","8","2","7","24 November 2006"," A Nutshell Review: Happy Feet
","There was a documentary last year which made waves both critically and at the box office. It was a celebration of nature, of life, danger, and death as seen through the eyes of Emperor Penguins in the Antarctica. If you had seen that documentary, then the first 10 minutes of Happy Feet will be familiar territory, as it probably summarized a whole lot of the mating game, into the introductory act.<br/><br/>Happy Feet tells the story of an offspring Emperor Penguin of Norma Jean (voiced by Nicole Kidman) and Memphis (Hugh Jackman). With that distinctive mole placement and swagger, it's actually Marilyn Monroe and Elvis done as animated feather friends, romanticizing each other and eventually have a son aptly named Mumble, born with a defect, save for those distinctively sky blue eyes of Elijah Wood. A heart song is what the Emperor Penguins use to attract their mates, but true to his namesake, Mumble can't sing for nuts and can only, surprise, tap dance, much to the chagrin of the conservative elders.<br/><br/>It's perhaps a given that those cute baby penguins which melted the hearts of many in March of the Penguins, get featured so prominently here in Happy Feet. Milking them for what they're worth, this movie pours in a lot more crowd favourites like dance. So you have yet another animated movie in this year's glut of offerings, in yet another movie about dance, a dash of comedy fused with familiar songs weaved together in a medley, and voila! Instant formula for success!<br/><br/>I must admit I was initially apprehensive that Happy Feet will be able to pull it off and had somewhat low expectations, given some mediocre Hollywood animated movies being produced. But true enough, I was sold after 10 minutes. The animation is photo-realistic, and probably is the next best thing of having being in the Antarctica, or watching the real one on screen. If the animals in the movie quit talking, you might just think that they're for real.<br/><br/>The characters too manage to endear themselves to you, with Robin Williams staging a coup with his voice performance of two penguin characters, one a smooth talking leader of a pack of Adelie penguins with Latino accents (their antics reminiscent of those in Madagascar, only a lot more laid back), and of a know-it-all Guru who answers any questions in exchange for pebbles. Brittany Murphy can sing too, as she lends her voice to Mumble's love interest, and THE babe of the colony, Gloria. Hugo Weaving too is in the movie, and so is the late Steve Irwin. It's no wonder that at the helm of this movie is director George Miller, also an Australian (say, there's quite a number of Australian's lending their voices here)<br/><br/>While it's generally a feel good movie, there's a good portion of the movie well hidden away from the trailers, in case you have the nagging misconception that there's nothing too interesting about watching a story of an underdog outcast working his way, cutting across discrimination to win the girl of his dreams. At one point, I thought the movie could have gone the way that Steven Spielberg's AI had gone, because it certainly felt that way. Also, there's a very rushed message on conservation, and in fact, the finale felt that it got truncated just to end the way it had.<br/><br/>Christmas season's coming, and a tale rooted in family ties, friendship, and the return of the prodigal son, makes it satisfyingly enjoyable. Parents would probably check out if the toy stores carry baby penguin plush toys. Should be a hit with the kids, after the movie."

","I had heard Michael Medved's review for this movie and had purposely avoided the movie. On New Year's Eve, however, my family went to the drive-in and this was the second feature on the bill with Charlotte's Web (an excellent movie), so we stayed for the movie. What a huge mistake! The subject matter and song choice (songs about spending the night together, for example) are not appropriate for small children. Fortunately, this was over their heads (kids are 2, 5, 5, 5, and 11), but it made my wife and I very uncomfortable. The kids, on the other hand, found the movie very boring. About half way into the movie THEY asked to leave. I cannot stress too strongly that this is a movie to be avoided by young and old alike."

Sadly, as liberal as the movie was supposed to be, it went overboard with the anti-religion message.I found this to be VERY intolerant. I also don't understand the necessity for so many sexual innuendos and obtrusive political view points in a film marketed so heavily to children. I can't imagine loving parents exposing their kids to some of this stuff. I definitely agree with saving the planet, but it was not worked into the plot very well.

"GSmith9072","5","2","8","18 November 2006"," ""Happy Feet"" my foot
","""Happy Feet"" may just be the most original cgi film of the year along with ""Monster House"". I have always anticipated a film that would break the slew of conventional children's entertainment. Even though this film appears to be my dream come true at first glance, impressive weirdness is not the only ingredient that makes an excellent film, and the film was flawed to the point that it settled into mediocrity with it's conventional predecessors.<br/><br/>The story was noticeably weak, but I don't think this film was created to have a good story, however. It was intended as an aesthetic animal fable, another story of the accomplishments of one individual a la ""Babe"". The universal consensus of this film is that it has spectacular animation. Although I question if this is a ""triumph"" in animation. The Warner Brothers' ""The Polar Express"" sported similar realism last year give or take a few artistic appliances, and the animation in ""Happy Feet"", I believe, is over hyped due to what was being animated and how it was being animated. It still worked though and was beautiful to look at. The point of cgi isn't to create photo-realism though. Its' focus on realism would mean the story would have to compensate for the lack of creativity in the character designs, and wellthe story was weak. ""Toy Story"" succeeds with its clever writing and wit. ""Happy Feet"" does not (""I like big tails and I cannot lie""case closed). The main message itself is typical. The ""underlying messages"" are questionable. To Happy Feet's advantage, the cinematography is superb (George Miller can certainly direct). <br/><br/>One can see the thought process involved with this movie. The creators formed the characters and said 'uh oh' when they realized that Mumble resembled all the other birds way too much, so they added a layer of baby down to his slick feathers incorporating that into the idea that his egg being temporarily unprotected altered his nature. This tiny touch, among other things, gave me the impression that this film was thrown together with the objective to create a penguin film using motion capture techniques. Different themes, religious, social, whatever, are thrown in at will and pop up in confusing areas. <br/><br/>Any film that attempts to connect serious themes with singing penguins must do so delicately and with craftsmanship. Unfortunately this film suffers from bothersome transitions and tone shifts. There are questionable turns in the plot that don't seem to flow properly. You feel as though the writer smacks you down by luring you in with cute euphoria then changing the feel of the film into a grating preach fest about this and that. It is unpleasant and irksome, by technical film standards also. The last moments of the film are sloppily written and ill conceived. <br/><br/>The constant push of making Mumble's ""amigos"" persuasively Latino was unnecessary and at times a tad bit racist. My concerns have nothing to do with agreeing or disagreeing with the blatant 'propaganda' in the film (I for the most part happen to agree); I just question why those themes needed to be there, or more, they were inserted inappropriately. The George Miller's earlier produced flick ""Babe"" could have been slanted toward promoting meat-consuming abstinence. It was however subtle enough so that you may not be bothered by it, as you enjoyed the terrific story. This isn't the case with ""Happy Feet"". I must empathize something. The film directly shoots itself in the foot when attempting to portray all zoos in a bad light. It's extremely ridiculous for a film trying to force a green message upon it's viewers when zoos do indeed aid in penguin conservation. It makes me wonder about the credibility of the creators. This may end up being one of the most destructive films for wildlife since ""Finding Nemo"". Oh the horrendous irony.<br/><br/>This film is a sign that producers are trying new ideas, and I encourage that. They are on the right road to creating film that can entertain and be spectacular all the same. It's unfortunate that in this case, it didn't quite reach that mark and succeeds only as a film to marvel in regard to the animation. The film undoubtedly warrants discussion with young children."

It's just like watching the Rudolph Christmas special where once the reindeer shines his red nose, he's considered a freak of nature. Mumble still does the things like penguins, he even chases fish until realizing that they aren't enough for the other penguins to eat. The first part of the story works like an average story about a penguin searching for answers until the second half falls to pieces where our hero discovers that maybe ""aliens"" are taking the fish with no other way but to check it out and seeing that he's at a zoo where humans can't understand what he's saying.<br/><br/>Elijah Wood provides the voice of Mumble where he's a charmer even though this film is not. The rest of the cast includes an all-star cast from Brittany Murphy as his love interest, Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman as his parents; Robin Williams provides too many voices from Spanish ethnic penguins to a fat preachy penguin where sometimes it's either really hard to tell what he's on or why he's trying hard to bring the Genie from Aladdin out of his shell.<br/><br/>This film won the Academy Award for best animated feature where either Cars or Monster House deserved the award."

","This film was greatly disappointing to me and my wife, and we are both HUGE fans of great animation. It seems like the story board had to have been created by committee, as though one of those faux pitch websites had been used. <br/><br/>Most of the characters are stereotypes, with all but one of the main characters of strength being male. The film starts as an ugly duckling type story then turns into a pro-ecology one. It couldn't seem to make up its mind what it wanted to be. Ultimately, I couldn't wait for it to be over. I just thought it was a poor piece of storytelling, which, for me, is first and foremost in any film.<br/><br/>The animation was certainly very good for CGI, with some stunning art direction. The film had been conceived originally as one to be released in 3D, and you can see by the framing of many shots the evidence for that. The studio ultimately decided it would be too expensive to release that way after all was said and done. Perhaps it will be released in that format to the theaters at some point in the future.<br/><br/>Aside from some pop culture film references near the end, this is not a multi-layered film that adults will get into as well as kids the way even Disney, at its best, can do (think of ""Beauty and the Beast"" or ""The Little Mermaid"" for recent vintage films.).<br/><br/>This film is a failure in my eyes. Too bad.<br/><br/>If you need to rent a family picture, stick with the ""Toy Story"" movies, the ""Princess Monanoke"" (sp?) or even the stunning (but for older kids and adults) ""Pan's Labyrinth""."
"croxton3","4","1","3","19 June 2007"," An incredibly preachy movie
","This movie spends a lot of time complaining about humans (""big, ugly penguins with no feathers on their flabby faces"") and their effect on the environment, and about social conformism enforced by Scottish-sounding, presbyterian-like penguins in charge of the group. It is condescending and preachy. Moreover, several scenes are kind of weird and otherworldly, which didn't go over well with my kids. I also didn't care for all the singing, although, to be fair, if you watch this movie you expect to get that.<br/><br/>I suppose if you think that social norms are a major problem with the world, and environmentalism is an obvious need, the prechiness may actually appeal to you insofar as it reinforces your values. I usually prefer films to present both sides of an argument, however; even if one argument is favoured (which is difficult to avoid), at least you get an idea of why there is a disagreement. Portraying your opponents as mindless or thoughtless is not very enlightening."
"TxMike","Null","1","3","3 May 2007"," A very entertaining animated Penguin movie.
","Following on the heels of the most excellent documentary on the Emperor Penguins (March of the Penguins) is this animated and, of course, fictional tale of a peculiar penguin. While his dad is holding the egg while mom is out for food, the egg ends up on frozen ground for a few seconds and it appears that the baby is lost. But he is in fact hatched as Mumble (Elijah Woods), who only has one problem. He can't sing. All Emperor Penguins in this story have a unique song in their heart that defines them, but Mumble can only squawk. But his feet are happy, they can't be still. He is a tap dancing machine.<br/><br/>The story has threads of acceptance of others who are different, and how perseverance can make a difference for all. The voice cast is all-star, including such actors as Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman (who also sings wonderfully), Nicole Kidman (who sings a little), and of Matrix fame, Hugo Weaving. The animation is superb.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. Predators are being unusually menacing to the penguins and they figure out it is the aliens, human boats taking loads of fish. Little Mumble follows one, ends up beached far from the South Pole, and is taken into an aquarium exhibit. After some time he begins to dance and becomes a feature attraction. Eventually he also is able to draw attention to the problem and a world conference of humans plan to do something to rectify the fishing problem. The peculiar little penguin is a hero, and others begin to learn to dance too."

","Happy Feet was strange, to say the least. I realise the movie was trying desperately to send a ""message"" but at the expense of entertainment ? Sorry, other films manage to combine both but Happy Feet missed the boat entirely. A bit like Mumble, actually. God knows what kids make of it. I can see them coming out of cinema's across the country wondering what the heck that was all about. Tap dancing penguin entertains humans at a zoo thousands of miles from his home. Penguin is released with locating beeper attached and returns home to insist that the only way to get the food chain back on track is to stop singing rhythm and blues and start tap dancing. That way the humans will be entertained and they will stop fishing in their sea ? I applaud the animators and the idea's behind this film but it needed cohesion and a decent script. Cutsie baby penguins are all well and good, but my teeth were grinding after 20 minutes of this drivel Also, was it necessary to show seals in with such realism ? We are aware that penguins are on their menu but, yikes, that seal was ferocious !"

","The story lacked development and direction, ultimately leaving me scratching my head to exactly how the conclusion, and many other details in the plot, came about. Most of the characters lacked development and depth, which led me to have little to no empathy for our protagonist and his cohorts. Instead, these staples for any good movie were replaced with a cute animated tap dancing penguin, a few cheap laughs courtesy of a washed up Robin Williams, and elaborate song and dance numbers that featured a wide variety of recognizable pop songs. And on top of that, the filmmakers had the audacity to shamelessly preach their politics as if that excuses it for its shortcomings. And that's not a slam against the liberal ideas of this movie that many have complained about because be they liberal or conservative, sloppily tacking on your ideas about pollution and the environment at the end of your already underdeveloped film doesn't qualify as a meaningful message, even if your target audience is ten and under.<br/><br/>Pixar has made it abundantly clear that family films don't have to substitute style for substance. Their competitors need to learn this as well."

","The best thing you can say about this is the penguins are cute.<br/><br/>Now like most other movies for kids, this is telling kids basically to be environmentalists. It slips in it's totally liberal opinions on pollution, witch, being a conservative, I found painful to watch. And then it gives the message to kids that we should all save the world from pollution. The reason this disturbs me is because that should be a decision the child makes, not just what the media has programmed into their brain. And then, a child shouldn't even be involved politically because they are way too young to understand anything they are told. They just believe almost anything you tell them.<br/><br/>The plot is very cheesy.

","After all the hype about Happy Feet, I'm beginning to wonder if I saw the same movie as everyone else. The storyline was poorly constructed, and no matter how good your actors are, a shallow and predictable story makes for a shallow and predictable movie. No matter how much I tried, there were huge clumps of story missing that could not be explained no matter how much thought I put into it. How did Mumble find his way back to the Emperor Penguins so quickly? How did he escape from that glass tank? Questions like these will remain with those of the Yeti and Loch Ness monster - complete mysteries. As my enthusiasm and interest in the film waned, I noticed what the children in the row in front of me were doing... one asking his mother repeatedly if the film was over yet, two walking out half way through and two who remained silent throughout the whole film. In fact, so silent were they that they did not laugh at any jokes or comment on anything at all. I did not despise the film, I was just underwhelmed. Given that the Shreks, Over the Hedge (a film far shorter, yet far more engaging) and Cars had preceded Happy Feet in the animation genre, I'd gone along expecting another A-Class film. No matter how much I saw Hollywood Gold in the stab at religious leaders and their extremist treatment of those deemed to be ""different"" (the Emperor elder is a striking caricature of the Pope), its sparkle alone did not make up for the otherwise bland storyline. On the whole, I was disappointed."

","When you see a number of messages in the discussion board asserting on that direction, you start wondering if being gay is the only way for an individual to differentiate from the rest. Each person is different on a simple basis and should be encouraged to follow the natural drives of his own.<br/><br/>Happy Feet gets right on the money when it comes to tolerance -which is not to be disposed of for the sake of a single group in particular but for everyone's, whereas some threads on the Happy Feet's forum evince, in a nearly startling manner, how much we lack it- and the necessity of putting both melody and rhythm together to create music -this resulting, IMO, in harmonious co-existence instead of perversion-. Moreover, this movie stands for the ones whose parents -to name only a pattern we keep seeing all over the world- made a hardship of their struggle to gain a position in life as musicians, artists, or even ball players since kids -these kinds of parent would say- had better attend a School of Law: all the ones who had to put up with frustration over quite a few years due to whatever society may believe is best for us could have found themselves depicted or reflected in Happy Feet. Not everyone was born to join a firm but to take a different call instead, however admitting that it also might work the other way around.<br/><br/>Anyway, Happy Feet has achieved its goal by bringing the tolerance topic on the spot. Trying to make up people's mind that Happy Feet is apologetic of homosexuality -as if a homosexual, or a Jew, or a Muslim, or a Negro, or a Latino, or anyone else who doesn't pace along with the mainstreaming majority were THE problem itself, as some may make us believe by means of an actually discriminatory and manipulative framework- is no less than an evil attempt to misleadingly simplify a yet deeper and still current issue."

","When I first saw the previews for this film, I was really looking forward to it. It looked really fun, and the voice of Robin Williams was definitely very catchy. When I walked out of the theater after having seen it, I was really disappointed. This by far was the worst computer animated movie I have seen yet.<br/><br/>Whenever I go to see computer animated films aimed at reaching out to family audiences, I look for good, innocent fun. Instead, this movie tried to depress me. The director, whose name I really don't care about because this movie was awful, tried to make me feel bad for a penguin that couldn't sing, but who instead had an innate ability to tap dance. The writers and creators of this film tried to use this as a vehicle to make feel bad for the Mumbles, voiced by Elijah Wood, and his inability to sing. It only gets worse from here.<br/><br/>The only good part of this film was the voice talents of Robin Williams and the other Hispanic-accented penguins. They were humorous, but not humorous enough to lighten up the mood of the entire film. I liked the characters: they were fun and enjoyable and they didn't try to make me feel depressed. <br/><br/>What also bothered me about this film was the political agenda embedded within the film. Sure environmental issues are important, but I didn't pay money to listen about how humans are responsible for the so-called ""depleting"" fish population, which these penguins utilize as a natural resource. To make the film even more political, the writers thought that audiences would enjoy seeing a penguin ""abducted"" by humans, referred to as aliens in the film. Mumbles, who tries to discover the true reason behind the cause of the scarce resource of fish, is eventually caught by humans and sent to a zoo. The writers tried to do their best to make the living conditions at a zoo seem so terrible for animals, and they tried to do it from an animal perspective. This, I believe, is misinforming because if you see how animals are cared for in a good number of big city zoos, animals are provided with great health-care; which most wild animals do not have. By this point of the film, I was pretty upset... I was upset because they used real footage of people, as opposed to animations. I paid to see an animated film, not an animated film with clips of real people integrated throughout.<br/><br/>I also hated the sexual references made by Robin Williams' character, Lovelace. This is a family film: that's not what I paid to see.<br/><br/>So besides the fact that this movie tried to make me feel bad for people with disabilities, hate seals, seagulls, and killer whales, and over-looking the fact that this film tried to make me hate myself; I don't see any reason to not like this movie... a lot."

This was a bit of a problem. The writer of this movie clearly had brilliant imagination. The way they had thought up the way Mumble would be rejected by the penguin colony/tribe/pack whatever you want to call it and how penguins get together, the way a penguins life works. All fantastic. But the writer didn't seem to know whether this story was supposed to be about rejection and trying to fit in, or about finding help like some adventure story (Like when mumble needed to find out where the fish was disappearing to) The story lines seemed to skip back and fourth and I found that the movie went for ages and then it got to the part where Mumble was looking for where the fish went and ended up in the zoo (was it a zoo? it was like sea-world...) which seemed to just go so quickly, I was amazed to find that it ended that quickly. One more thing... There was that scene showing cities of humans debating over fishing in Antarctica. Hello! I thought it was an animated movie! All of a sudden they're showing us real humans. Not animation, just true humans acting. I took one look at that and thought, 'What did they run out of money all of a sudden and have to cut short on some animation?

This is the set-up for a journey that does not only affect the primary character, but ultimately all others around him as it soon becomes clear (too blatantly) that ""Happy Feet"" has a lot deeper message than other computer-generated animated features of the type. Uneven and manipulative production is second-to-none in terms of the elements of story-telling and technical film-making, but it tries to do too much with what it has going for it and ultimately nearly falls through very thin ice.

What we saw on the screen shocked and even insulted us.<br/><br/>To begin with, we were very surprised at how sexual some of the content was. For an adult film, this would be tame, but for a kids' film?! The song line about wanting someone's body was certainly not something I would want my niece hearing. Yes, many kids may not pick up on the sexual overtones, but some kids happen to be more observant. Why was it even necessary? It certainly didn't help the film any. I thought it looked rather trashy.<br/><br/>The agenda of this film is what bothered both my friend and I the most. For one thing, we hated the cruel portrayal of Christians. You can bet that if the film unfairly portrayed people of a certain race, there would be theaters refusing to play it. Yet Christians are considered fair game. Making a point against prejudice is fine. I would in fact applaud a film making that point. Doing so by poking fun at a religion (any religion, not just Christianity) is tasteless and should not be tolerated.<br/><br/>The second part of the agenda, the ""saving the environment"" part, was handled wrong. I have nothing against doing a film about the very real need to protect the environment. It's an excellent idea to motivate people while they're young. However, that theme interfered with the storyline and thus was far less effective than it could have been. It felt to me like the film was trying to accomplish far too much in a single film. This negatively affected the flow of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I would not recommend the film, especially for families with children. Save yourself the money and rent a good classic instead."

I was particularly pleased with the mish-mosh of the soundtrack, capturing the somewhat blatant references to various styles of music and using them to establish characters, to drive home the concept of a heartsong.<br/><br/>The comic relief is led by no other than Robin Williams, and in the cast he plays a needed role. I was definitely surprised a great deal by the growth and change in the characters; they are far from two dimensional in more than one sense. I haven't enjoyed the layered aspects of the plot since The Incredibles; the self-conscious references to religious conservatism, various cultural norms and all sorts of goodies for those who've spent more than 12 years on this planet.

But it was a really clever way to create a musical with popular music.<br/><br/>Of course, if you don't want your kids to be concerned with the environment. Or if you believe it's alright to ostracize individuals based on their differences. Or if you really believe that your kids aren't being exposed to sexual themes every time you turn on the TV or radio. Then this movie is probably not for you. <br/><br/>But if you can enjoy a movie based on it's artistic merit. If you want something to talk to your kids about. If you're tired of paying 8.50 on movies you won't even remember in a week. Then see this fun little film full of humor and energy. I recommend it highly."
"Quentintarantado","9","1","3","30 November 2006"," Typical Miller, a worthy addition to his oeuvre
","I remember when I saw Babe: Pig in the City I rather liked the movie. This is a children's film unafraid to show death and bad things happening to innocents, a bit like what Sesame Street did when Mr. Hooper died. That's the real world. We might want to delay that realization for our children's sake, but where do we really want to raise them? In unrealistic fantasy lands that ignore the fact everyone dies or gets hurt? So Happy Feet gets the same abuse from parents for intense films. Hurrah for Miller! He certainly doesn't go extremely explicit the way a documentary would (the penguin is caught by a Leopard Seal and ripped apart and devoured while it's still struggling to live) but he doesn't shy away from the idea Leopard Seals and Killer Whales are predators and they are out to kill (and eat) their prey.<br/><br/>That's why I was recommending this film to the science teachers. There are clearly fantasy elements (dancing, singing, conversing penguins) but they do get their details right. The seal is king underwater but he becomes helpless on land. The penguin is fast, though not as fast as the seal underwater, but he has a special ability to swim fast AND walk on land, unlike most of his predators. I like the harshness of the environment as portrayed and I especially like how the penguins interact in it. It's a bad neighborhood, but it's their home.<br/><br/>The ending goes beyond what you'd expect from where the movie started. It reminds me of another movie that goes in unexpected directions, James Cameron's The Abyss, though I think Happy Feet managed the change better than The Abyss did. I admit it's a tad bit unrealistic to expect humans to stop fishing but I hold up my country (The Philippines) as an example of sudden, unexpected mass actions (the 1986 EDSA revolution)that betrays the notion human history can only move in gradual, grinding steps.<br/><br/>I think what separates this movie from all the other computer-generated films this year is eloquently told in one scene, when Mumbles asks Gloria to dance to the rhythm in his steps. It's a wordless scene (yes, Gloria is singing, I guess I mean there's no dialog). Miller cuts and moves the camera with the precision of a wonderful storyteller. This is the director of Mad Max back in the territory he knows best, a musical number cut clearly and precisely (like an action scene SHOULD be cut!) to show that the two unmatched penguins ARE meant for each other.<br/><br/>I'd definitely buy this in Blu-Ray. With commentary from Miller, please!"
"PhoenixSeraph","7","1","3","26 November 2006"," Funny, but a bit too angsty
","I liked this movie. At least, the parts with just the penguins and just the ""happy"" stuff.<br/><br/>I didn't find the angsty doom and gloom of the penguin elders necessary, nor did I find the whole human angle necessary at all as well. Did anyone else feel the environmental vibe to this? I loved Ramon, and Lovelace, and Mumble and all the funny bits with the one liners but Mumble's quest that included deep sea angst was a bit too much. I don't think that a fun kid's movie should've been overshadowed with messages about preserving nature and animal cruelty in zoos.<br/><br/>And was Mumble's face staying baby-like throughout the entire movie on purpose? All the baby penguins were adorable but maybe Mumble's face was suppose to reflect Elijah Wood's face in real life? Perpetually baby-like?<br/><br/>The singing and dancing parts were, however, delightful. I love musicals like this and the penguins put up quite a show. Bravo to them. :) The amigos were a favorite part of the film and were a great laugh all around."

Talk to your kids about it after the movie.<br/><br/>On the movie, it was awesome! The graphics were magnificent. Especially the underwater and ""sliding"" scenes! This is a masterful movie, and the soundtrack will blow you away. I did find myself tapping my foot often during the movie. And Robin Williams just topped it off, especially his ""Ramon"".

","I recently saw this and thought why it should be a movie for little kids to see. There were too many dark moments that as a child would of scared me a lot. This could of been a great movie about understanding others differences, but none of the others really did. It was yet another movie that did not live up to the funny light-hearted trailers. The fight scenes with the seal and whales were more violent than cartoon and caused some of the little children to become very upset. Especially the point at which lovelace is basically being hung by the soda plastic on his neck. Finally I hated when happy feet got by the propeller of the ship, that made me mad because that was too much to add in to the movie. I would not recommend it for children.

","Oh no, not another wasted two hours of my life. I wanted to turn it off 15 minutes into it, but since I was entertaining a guest who seemed to be enjoying it, I just sat through it.<br/><br/>The singing and dancing was plain annoying. The supposedly talented tap-dancing of the lead penguin looked to me exactly like it looked to all his fellow penguins - stupid. And why on earth the female lead penguin felt so attracted to the obvious loser slow-developing twitchy-leg squeaky-voice male lead penguin, when there were plenty of buff penguins around, I have no idea. Too bad all the penguins looked alike as well. Or what was the point of those five short hispanic penguins? Why five? Two would have sufficed. Or was the point to reaffirm, that hispanics only travel in gangs? Anyway - hispanic penguins? Or Scottish penguins? Australian penguins? Please. Or how come all the different species (seals, penguins, birds) were able to talk fluently to each other, yet they couldn't communicate with humans? As for the voice acting, I've never understood the point of hiring well-known actors to voice animated characters. There was a Nicole Kidman? Where? Elijah Wood? Really? On the other hand, it was beyond annoying to hear Robin Williams' voice come out of more than one character's mouth. His voice is just too distinctly recognizable for that to work. The point is - ""superstar"" voices either get lost or become distracting, whereas hiring talented voicers without big names lets you just concentrate on the movie without having to guess who's who or becoming annoyed by the too recognizable voices.<br/><br/>Oh yeah, and wait till you see the most twisted depiction of a seal. Killer sharks don't even hold a candle to the seals that seem to be living on the south pole.<br/><br/>And the conclusion? Humanity decides to stop fishing where penguins live, so that they'd have more food available - because people discover that penguins can tap-dance and they think its cute and funny. Oh and the penguins are sooo happy to please people with their tap-dancing too. Disgusting. Because what about all the other endangered species in the world? Do they have any hope of survival only if they learn some circus acrobatics or clown tricks to amuse humans? And if they don't, they'll be driven extinct because they are not ""cute and amusing"" enough? My god. Who on earth came up with this plot.<br/><br/>My rating - two stars. One for the effort - I mean people did work on this movie after all, so that has to account for something. The other for when the lead penguin was small. He was kind'a cute, even with those annoying twitchy legs."

"the_Poppuns","9","1","4","2 December 2006"," Some people either aren't getting the point or hate the point this movie makes
","Look, we are depleting too much of the world's fish. Don't blame the movie for telling the kids about it. The city I live in is a major fishing port, so when I saw the message coming across loud and clear I knew exactly how much it was going to aggravate people. But too bad, it's true. Do you want to know how they kill them because I've been on a fishing boat? Well they reel in the net and as the fish flop on the deck you're supposed to hit them in the head with a stick that has a nail in it. Tell your kids that if you hate propaganda.<br/><br/>Anyway, the story is about a misfit penguin who is in serious danger of never finding a soulmate because he can't sing his heart song. He taps it. Well it wouldn't be a problem if it wasn't for close-minded people, er, uh, I mean penguins. So he becomes an outcast and finds some friends who aren't like him but they don't have the same rigid standards as his original group. So he learns to believe in himself and at a crucial point in the movie he decides to do the right thing for those who shunned him even if it means certain death. I mean, come on. That's the real message for the kiddies. Self-sacrifice for the greater good. The other message is for us grown-ups. And that message is, we're not the only ones here who have lives to lead and babies to have and songs to sing, or tap. So stop acting like you are. In order to get the message across in the movie Mumble had to get his point across to humans and talking or singing wasn't going to help so he had to find a way to communicate with us. See, bridging gaps, self-sacrifice, the greater good. Who wants that message in a movie right? <br/><br/>The voice talent was great. I was surprised how little Jackman and Kidman were in it. Brittany Murphy is awesome. I've been saying this for a long time so now you all know. And well, Elijah Wood never got to sing. I was 100% sure he would by then end. That made me a little sad so I took a point off for that. The animation is top notch. Some real roller-coaster type action sequences. The music was good. You know I might have picked a few better songs myself, but ""Boogie Wonderland"" was the only choice for it's intended purpose. I did notice that the smaller kids never really settled down. Someone brought a stroller sized kid and he never stopped crying after some scary stuff and had to be removed. So I guess it isn't really for the wee ones. And in a way I thought the movie would be more enjoyable for adults anyway because the song selections were from our collective mental jukebox. I mean if you hate the environment, and singing and dancing, and cute little furry things then it probably isn't for you. And if you can't tie your own shoes, you might be too young. Otherwise go see it and break out some old-fashioned tappin'."

","The film looks cute at first glance, but once you see what these penguins can do, you'll be blown away and say: ""Hey, this isn't just a kid's movie..."" Who knew Brittany Murphy could sing so well? The basic plot: Mumble (Young: E.G Daily, older: Elijah Wood)is raised in a world where penguins find their soulmate through song, like his mother (Nicole Kidman) and father (Hugh Jackman, also in Flushed Away). Well, he can't sing, that's for sure...but he can dance something fierce. This leads to rejection of his peers, like the lovely Gloria (Britanny Murphy), and the elder penguins. He finds friends in a gang of Rockhopper Penguins (One played by Robin Williams). They persuade him to look to the so-called ""Penguin Guru,"" an emperor penguin called Lovelace (Robin Williams). He doesn't get his answer right away and is blamed for the shortage of fish just because of his ""Happy feet."" But is it...or is it something else...<br/><br/>This film has very funny yet sad quality to it. Robin Williams handles dual roles very well.

","I enjoyed the movie mainly because I'm a HUGE penguin fan, but I don't think this is a kid's movie at all. The songs got really annoying after awhile too. They had too many short frags of songs and not enough dialog. Also, I'm really confused as to how Mumble got out of the zoo and back to the right place in Antarctica. I mean, obviously the humans took him back, but what happened in the middle? Too much glossing over of important parts and too many music scenes. I also don't think that many of the scenes were appropriate for young children. For example, Lovelace getting hung on the bell was not suitable nor were the obvious sexual references."

It was all the effort the film makers put into it to show how devastating the commercial fishing is on our oceans, with the hopes that it would make a difference. That's what is the funniest part.

","Went with my 7 yr old daughter to watch this film last night. Animation quality was cute and adorable, especially the baby penguins. It was actually the appearance of the lead character Mumble as an young adult that was left unexplained, since he never matured in appearance even towards the end. I personally loved the song and dance numbers, which was what this film is expected to deliver and does not fail.<br/><br/>For smaller kids, there are very scary scenes with the violent leopard seal, who looks like a swimming T-Rex! The Orca scenes are also scary for kids, but better executed.<br/><br/>The point of view of the animals from inside the oceanarium was very touching. Those scenes regarding the fishing industry and pollution of the oceans was admittedly heavy, adult and unexpected in a film like this one. But truth be told, it was quite eye-opening and could serve to be the springboard for discussion with older kids.

The story tells a story of a group of penguins that live by singing, and when a new penguin was born, all he can do instead is just dance with his happy feet, which kind of pisses the other penguins off. Then, sets out on a journey to find the ""aliens"" who have taken all the fish from the penguins, which might have been his fault because of his dancing. But throughout the journey, he learns to always believe in yourself, no matter how different you are. In other words, it does not matter if you sing or dance, you are still one important person. So mainly, the whole movie is just a bunch of singing and dancing penguins. George Miller has made a brilliant animated movie that he must have made with his own special heart. He organized a cast with a special charm that had Eijah Wood, Robin Williams, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, and Nicole Kidman. I enjoyed the rocking soundtrack added in the movie, and I also enjoyed the classic dancing scenes with the penguins. I was entertained by the movie for it's comedic humor, strong heart, and rocking dance moves. ""Happy Feet"" is a movie that should be recommend to the people who sing and dance along in their seats...oh, and also loves penguins. ""Happy Feet"", in my review, ""a heartwarming dance movie for the whole family""."

","Watch out! There are spoilers, so read at your own risk! Over a year before 'Happy Feet' became known (early 2005) I swear I had this nocturnal dream about a dance-oriented movie called Happy Feet albeit the characters were all human. Exactly a year later, a commercial for a CGI movie ala 'March of the Penguins' shows and would keep advertising until November of that same year, 2006. As it turns out, that movie was also named 'Happy Feet,' leading me to the notion that my dream had unexpectedly come true even though this was a mere coincidence.<br/><br/>So in November I go to the theatre to see 'Happy Feet' and encounter a wide variety of CGI Antarctic species besides the hierarchal emperor penguin: there are Hispanic-based Adelie penguins; a shamanistic, Barry White-inspired rockhopper penguin; chinstrap, little, and Magellanic penguins at Mumble's ""site of incarceration;"" (including a HAL ""2010"" inspired Magellanic) a gluttonous leopard seal, Australian-accented southern elephant seals plus a wandering albatross of the same vernacular (Steve Irwin, no doubt); Brooklyn-accented, Mafia-inspired south polar skuas and two killer-whales who fight over their food before consuming it. For the emperor penguins, Mumble's parents speak with a southern US (or hemisphere; after all it's Antarctica) accent; Noah the Elder is supposed to be Scottish; Miss Viola is British as is her voice actress and, saving this for last, Mrs. Astrakhan is Russian. Her actress (Miriam Margolyes) is British though fully Belarussian in ancestry. In my opinion she's my favorite character because I'm a Russian and love the traditional folk-music, which you hear during part two of young Mumble's singing lesson. I also like the mispronunciation of ""spontaneous"" to ""spontanuous"" which I thought parodied one of Russia's archived films which, in this case, a harried businesswoman exclaims ""here's the confidentuality statement you forgot to read."" She obviously meant ""confidentiality,"" though English was hardly spoken and often mispronounced. Altogether, the movie was quite realistic considering it has elements of 'March of the Penguins,' plus Warner produced it just like they did 'March.' As an endnote it did exhibit that ""dream-come-true"" characteristic because dance was the main medium.<br/><br/>And now for the spoilers... The end of the movie was, well, epic! Mumble, though developmentally delayed and unique given his perceived appearance and behavior, espoused Gloria (along the way) and the couple have a son, Erik. To be continued via 'Happy Feet Two' in 11/11."

","Apparently, Emperor penguins select their mates via the medium of pop songs so, when young Mumble turns out to be tone deaf, he becomes an outcast. However he is also a dancing fool, and this not only ties him up with a group of latina Adelie penguins, it is also instrumental in repairing a break in the food chain (don't ask). If penguins singing pop songs and taking part in mass - and I do mean mass - dance routines is your thing, then you are going to love this one.<br/><br/>I mean, it's barking mad, isn't it? But CGI features have given us equally barking mad stories of robot romance, and balloon powered houses, so I suppose dancing penguins night be regarded as only mildly eccentric by comparison.<br/><br/>And, let's be fair, it is extremely well done - it looks fabulous, the music is all great, the voice talent does well (although Robin Williams is getting a bit too ubiquitous for my taste), the dancing is fun, and there;s a decent subtext about exclusion for simply being different.<br/><br/>Sometimes we need something that's barking mad, especially if it has something worthwhile to say, and a sense of charm to say it with."

","Ever since I was a little girl I had an obsession with penguins. I couldn't help it, I thought they were so fascinating and cute. And you know what, I still do. Happy Feet was a film I really wanted to see, and after finally seeing it, I really liked it. It is a shame though that the plot is as thin as a block of ice and the ending is too abrupt and preachy. Other than that, contrary to some of the negative comments, it is a good film. The animation is dazzling; the backgrounds are colourful and the character movements are excellent. The music by John Powell was memorable and fun. Sometimes it brought a sense of fun, sometimes it even enhanced the drama. The characters are endearing. Mumble when he was a child was adorable, and Gloria is a beautiful penguin with a lovely voice. The dancing is a wonder, boy can Mumble tap. I didn't care that Mumble was different from the others, he had a talent of his own and made good use of it. The voice acting is impressive. I don't care for Elijah Wood but he does a good job as Mumble, and Robin Williams is especially funny as Ramon and Lovelace. Brittany Murphy is sweet as Gloria, but I was shocked that Nicole Kidman voiced Norma Jean. All in all, good film, nice premise, lovely animation and music. Shame it crashes down in the final twenty minutes. 8/10 Bethany Cox"

","OK I suppose this contains spoilers so I'll say that now and the only reason I've come to this site is to ask questions about the movie.<br/><br/>The main character, it seemed like he couldn't get a break at ALL which really made me kind of angry.<br/><br/>Anyway around the end,(spoiler)Aight, so he sees his would've been gf OK? Now here is the questions, did she have kids while he was gone or what, in addition when the movie ends did the main guy end up with her? I know its such a stupid couple of questions but its really really annoying not to know what all happened lol, if people can help me out I don't know if you can reply to comments or anything, send me a message or something, whatever. peace"
"Stampsfightclub","2","0","1","14 February 2009"," the jokes on chocolate bar penguins are funnier
","Mumble grows up with an unhealthy singing voice and a tendency to tap whenever he is happy which makes him an outcast in the penguin community.<br/><br/>With CGI so easy to maintain these days it is all about the story for animations. Wall-E is perhaps the finest made animation of the last 10 years with barely any faults. It has a great music score, is artistically handled and the preaching issues of human's relaxed attitude towards destroying the planet are finely driven. The plot is not only entertaining for the family but relative, a complete contrast to this picture.<br/><br/>The appeal of this Warner Brothers 2006 Oscar winner is quite strong. Lovable looking characters, some catchy music and a potential to convey an important message about the climate, but it fails to achieve any of these.<br/><br/>Targeting the family should be relatively simple for a picture that has singing penguins and Robin Williams in but no, the encoded humour is tried and tested slapstick and horrible singing that feels cruel rather than funny. Robin Williams' Ramon and Lovelace are excellent and the only bright spark of the entire hour and forty minutes.<br/><br/>Starting in outer space (why?) we zoom down to the arctic where penguins are singing and dancing and all love each other and are doing fine. Then along comes Mumble, the penguin who can't sing who (because of his unnaturalness) is accused of driving away all the fish. Cue cheesy storyline that conforms to the typical unlikely hero has a problem to overcome and everyone hates him apart from the popular female and he desperately wants to make it right etc. Occasionally you can have a film that conforms to formulaic plot planning that still works if a couple of twists are thrown in or there is a decent score.<br/><br/>No such luck with Happy Feet as everything is obvious, misjudged or painfully unbelievable in its context.<br/><br/>The score would be appealing if they weren't rip offs of other songs e.g. one is Wild Wild West with penguins or if they were not so disgraceful for a family audience as lyrics such as ""You turn me on"" and ""I'll make love to you all through the night"" appear. OK classic songs, but appropriate? The message of animal cruelty could have been constructed in a more meaningful manner as the film tries to go from entertainer to good nature preacher. Happy Feet goes to show that with an obvious story and terrible characters, that animation only works if there is meaning and feeling. Looking for a fun family film that's funny and has meaning? No one does animation quite like Pixar."
"Els_Me","2","0","1","4 January 2009"," Awkward
","How could Elijah Wood go from starring in Lord of the Rings to this rubbish? It saddens me really. I went with my mom to see this movie, which may be why I despise it so much. I thought it would be a cute movie, but it ended up being a stream of endless sexual innuendos. The whole thing was just awkward to watch. The only reason this movie is worth a 2 is because of how beautiful the animation was and the good message at the end, which really could have been carried out better. But, what also bothered me, was how Mumble was fuzzy like a baby penguin even when he grew up. The fact that he couldn't sing effects his overall body? It really bugged me throughout the whole film. He could have been cuter too....My advice, don't waste any money on this film. Watch it on TV sometime just to see the art of it..."
"huffg","1","0","5","16 November 2008"," Boring! Buy a good children's movie instead.
","I bought the Blu-ray version of this movie after reading a positive review in a home theater magazine. This movie was so un-involving that I quit watching it after about 30 minutes, and just gave it to our grandchildren. I've been feeling guilty ever since--too much like giving children a bag of potato chips to eat.<br/><br/>This movie is not good enough to warrant a discussion of its technical merits (Blu-ray video and audio). In fact, it would be charitable to say that the characters in Happy Feet are two dimensional (as opposed to three dimensional). It is difficult to care about what they are doing or saying. They never jump off the screen and become real to the viewer.<br/><br/>Then there is the music. What a disappointment! Audiences have become accustomed to the wonderful soundtrack music of movies like The Lion King, Rodgers & Hammerstein's Cinderella (TV 1997), and Monster's Inc. What we get instead with Happy Feet is unsophisticated, artless, and often crude, especially so for a children's movie. At best, the music is un-involving, at worst repugnant.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money on Happy Feet just to get a Blu-ray children's movie. In fact, just don't waste your money at all."
"ron-514","7","0","1","16 October 2008"," A later comer's review: Wanted to love it, only liked it. (SPOILERS!)
","Back in 2006 I actually had every intention of seeing it. I love animated movies, the preview seemed very funny, and the cast was chock full of some of my favorite actors (and some I loathe, but I digress). Regardless, I wanted to see it but never did a chance to get to the theater. It looked like it was going to be awesome and the imagery and graphics work was obviously phenomenal judging by the preview alone!<br/><br/>But I didn't see it.<br/><br/>But, now that my daughter has the DVD, she watches it...daily. It's her evening routine, and this is her film of choice at the moment.<br/><br/>So, I've seen the film now about 5 or 6 times straight thru, and probably another 10-12 times total, but in bits and pieces. Since 2 months ago.<br/><br/>In short, I've seen Happy Feet, whether I was a fan of the film or not, and I've seen it a couple dozen times (as a lot of parents have to endure when a toddler fixates on a film!). I figure I have justification for rendering an opinion on it now since I've viewed it so much in such a short time frame.<br/><br/>My first viewing yielded one opinion: I didn't like it that much. Gave it a preliminary 5/10. Was very disappointed. I guess I was expecting something different, something else. Either way, Viewing #1 had me bummed out. I genuinely expected ""gold""...but got tin. (I eventually rated the film 7/10 after subsequent viewings, mainly due to noticing things I hadn't noticed before, and just ""getting"" the characters more.)<br/><br/>What struck me the worst at my first viewing was the jagged flow of the storyline. The story was very clear and obvious enough, but did not flow well. Some scenes came and went, leaving you with no emotional impact, or even a humorous impact. Just a literal sorta ""Oh, OK..."". <br/><br/>Baby Mumble was cute, and seemed genuinely imprecise and innocent. Older Mumble was a let down, as Elijah Wood seemed to be phoning it in as far as I could tell. Bummer, because he is great.<br/><br/>In that same vein, I really like Hugh Jackman and have always enjoyed Nicole Kidman's work. But their ""impersonation"" voices in this film annoy me to no end. It's not their fault....Elvis and Marilyn's speaking voices have always annoyed me too, so...<br/><br/>Hugo Weaving, however, was quite good as Noah the Elder!<br/><br/>Robin Williams. He was hilarious. And this is hardly surprising. Sure, people either love or hate Williams, but I for one love him. Ramon was his best voice in the film, as Lovelace seemed a little contrived. But still, it's just fun to listen to Robin Williams say just about anything.<br/><br/>Robin's band of cohorts were hilarious too! <br/><br/>But here's my issue with the cast: The movie is more of a ""talent variety show"" than it is a strong, cohesive, compelling storyline. A lot of the actors are VERY fun to listen to...but..everything as a whole just didn't ever gel into something....left you kinda flat, but at least I got quite a few laughs.<br/><br/>I also figured out quickly that the film was basically a musical. Cool, I thought, I like some musicals, so this should be entertaining. Sadly, while the music in the film is produced and performed at the utmost level of professional pop production...it's all Top 40 songs from the past few decades. Mind you, mostly great songs! But a musical, in my opinion, should be original music, or mostly original music. Penguins singing and dancing to well known pop songs is fodder for TV commercials, not a 100 minute film. As good as the songs were, the fact that the same gimmick was played again and again (""penguin performs old hit song"") just got old - quick. <br/><br/>The extended ""one-cut"" animation sequences were VERY cool. Several minutes of the swimming for fish scene is one long, seamless sequence. I thought that was an original touch and was impressed. They played this out again, though shorter, with Mumble escaping the leopard seal, and with the 5 penguins and Mumble sliding down the mountain and into the water to discover the old crane. Great scenes. But the first one fishing would have done just fine, I think, and made you want to rewind it and see it again.<br/><br/>The live action footage didn't bother me. But even in the context of the film, treating the penguins behavior (dancing) as if it were happening in 100% actual reality was flawed. The penguins did and acted in non realistic ways, but the humans were somehow totally normal? OK, so let's say that was the whole point...but...not exploring (explaining) the reasoning for that left me with a big hole in the movie and totally took me ""out"" of it. <br/><br/>But it LOOKED fantastic! In 2006, this film clearly had raised the bar for photo-realistic outdoor CG scenery, lighting, and movement. Wow! The water particle fx were dead on and rival Finding Nemo, and the snow felt real and the feathers felt fluffy. Etc etc. GREAT work! (Only since been topped by Wall-E, IMO, in terms of photo-realistic imagery and realistic movements.)<br/><br/>But it just never came together like the amazing film I was hoping for when I saw the preview. Instead, it was a well executed pop culture exploitation extravaganza woven loosely into a decent story. Fun to watch, but not strikingly memorable. 7/10 for sure."
"didi-5","7","0","1","18 August 2008"," tap your flippers for this penguin piece of fun
","'Happy Feet' is a bit of a one joke short stretched out to feature length, but you can't really complain when it is done so well. Fun, cute, and full of music (Elvis, Prince, Aretha, you name it), this tale of a penguin who doesn't fit in because he can't sing his heart song (but can tap a tune with his feet like nobody) has a fit of the cutes and almost comes to a halt until the appearance of some funky boogie-ing birds and a sojourn away from the land of ice.<br/><br/>It's minor, but it has some lovely animation, high production values, and a few memorable characters (Memphis, the dad penguin, Mumble, the tap dancer, and Lovelace, the guru). And I really laughed at the appearance of Mumble, who bore more than a passing resemblance to LOTR's Frodo (and of course, Mumble is voiced by Frodo himself, Elijah Wood)."
"phantopp","4","0","2","8 August 2008"," Falls apart when the environmental message appears
","In Antarctica, a colony of Emperor Penguins are living peacefully. A female penguin named ""Norma Jean"" (voiced by Nicole Kidman) finds a mate named ""Memphis"" (voiced by Hugh Jackman) by singing a ""heartsong"" (""Kiss"" by Prince), to which ""Memphis"" responds with his own ""heartsong (""Heartbreak Hotel"" by ""The King of Rock 'n' Roll"" Elvis Presley). The two hatch a child named ""Mumbles"" (voiced by EG Daily).<br/><br/>""Mumbles"" is not your typical penguin, as he is unable to carry a ""heartsong"" if it had handles on it. He becomes an outcast, but a female named ""Gloria"" (voiced by Alyssa Shafer) becomes the only penguin who shows him a shred of respect. It is also obvious that ""Mumbles"" has feeling for the female penguin.<br/><br/>Years later, the fish population the penguins live off of is dying out. And ""Mumbles"" goes on an adventure to find out just exactly what is happening with their food.<br/><br/>But, what he finds not only affects his colony, but other species he comes across on his adventure and what he learns are ""aliens"" (humans).<br/><br/>The first thing I have to say is that the animation is pretty good. The characters move realistically, and they do get the smallest detail in the look of the character. The problem is that, thanks to the location the movie takes place, there is just too much white. You get a few shades of blue, some blacks and grays, and a little yellow and brown. But, there is just too much white, and the scenery is pretty boring.<br/><br/>Like I said, the characters are designed nicely. The actors enhance the characters with their performances. Fortunately, some actors were able to provide multiple voices for different characters. One that stands out is Robin Williams, who provides a voice for about three characters -- including the narrator, which is not in the movie that much.<br/><br/>For the majority of the movie, you get some popular tunes from the last 40 years. Many of the songs are used fairly well to set up scenes. Those who sing the songs do a pretty good job with the covers. However, Prince, who provides at least one original tune, should have been used to perform his hit ""Kiss"", which ""Norma Jean"" uses as her ""heartsong"". Unlike recent movies I've seen, the soundtrack is memorable thanks to the use of many well known songs. I would have liked to have seen a few more original songs to help advance the mood of movie.<br/><br/>And speaking of the movie's mood, it changes when the environmental message comes into light. This is when the movie completely falls apart. In my opinion, the movie makers completely forgot to develop characters and story lines that were presented earlier in the film. For example, instead of ""Gloria"" going with ""Mumbles,"" she stays with the colony. They completely missed a chance to advance the blossoming romance between the two. Other characters, who are introduced as the environmental message begins to appear, have no chance of development at all.<br/><br/>Another thing that is wrong with this movie is that this really isn't for a young audience. You get some adult humor that should slip past children, and some larger species of Antarctic animals chasing and almost killing a main character.<br/><br/>As for my recommendation, I am somewhere between Yes and No. Prior to the environmental message, I would say yes, but only for a rainy day movie. After the environmental message appears, I can't recommend it."

","Just in points my views on this film: 1) It is not a true children film. I was fooled by the cover and the fact of ""dancing and singing animated penguins"" as well. No, this movie is far more. Kids might enjoy the cute animation and all sorts of flashy-stuff, but be prepared, that not necessarily.<br/><br/>2) If you see propaganda and conspiracy everywhere, this movie will set you off. If you can take things more lightly, do watch.<br/><br/>3) I loved this film. I take points down to 7, because so many - me too - are fooled by the covers and presentation of the film, that we wait to see something Ice Age or Madagascar - like, but no.

"therankines","5","0","1","25 May 2008"," Good, Not What I Expected It To Be
","This movie is a great film for all ages but..... If you think this movie is all about the tap-dancing penguin and everything that happens to him... it's not. It is for about the first 45, 50 minutes or so but then it gets all into this stuff about how the penguins are losing their food and how it's all disappearing. I mean I thought the movie was good but if you were just looking for the story of Mumble well, that's not all the movie's about. The movie was teaching you about stuff like the food chain and how stuff like disappearing food happens when another species takes it all which is educational which is good. I think this is a good family night movie to watch, but I still think Cars deserved to win that Oscar."
"Boba_Fett1138","6","0","2","17 March 2008"," Good enough but hardly the best the genre has currently to offer.
","This is a good looking and also rather cute movie. However the story is lacking and I just can't help seeing this movie as a missed opportunity.<br/><br/>Like often is the case with animated movies, there is a morale to find in the movie as well. They did not only tried to put one moralistic message into the movie but more than a couple of them. The story suffers from this, especially toward the ending of the movie. It also has as a result that not all of the messages work out well enough in the movie, because the one is more obvious and prominently featured than the other. Perhaps the movie should had stayed put more to its main story-line, instead of diverting so much with its side-plots and characters. It would had made the movie overall more consistent and the its morals and messages all the more powerful as well.<br/><br/>The movie showed some more potential really with its songs. The movie uses some famous evergreens and combines several songs brilliantly (done by John Powell himself). The dancing routines from the penguins all add to this as well. As a purely musical orientated movie, this would had been a great movie to watch I'll bet. But like I said before, the movie chooses the divert constantly from its main-plot, in order to develop and create some overly present morals and messages.<br/><br/>It's a good looking movie, so nothing wrong in the graphic department but it also isn't exactly anything new or spectacular looking. When computer animated movies were still new, they really put some time and effort in those movies, with as a result some visual spectacles. When the big studios realized some serious money was to make from those movies, dozens of movies got created each year, preferable for less money and done in less time, in order to raise the profits even more. ""Happy Feet"" is obviously one of those movies. Nothing wrong with this if the movie actually still entertains and knows to grab you.<br/><br/>Overall this movie does entertaining but I also must say that the movie could had been made way more entertaining as well. The movie isn't filled with an awful lot of jokes and more leans on its cute looking- and odd characters. However when the movie makes some hits, it really hits and knows to entertain and make you laugh.<br/><br/>Like most animated movies, this movie also has an impressive A-list voice cast, with people such as Elijah Wood, Brittany Murphy, Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Hugo Weaving and of course expert Robin Williams.<br/><br/>It's an overall watchable and entertaining enough movie from George Miller but the story just didn't do it for me.<br/><br/>6/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"wolfentertainment","5","0","2","4 February 2008"," Animation: Good, Story: Bad
","Regarding the animation, it was very good, interesting to see how they tried to make photo-realistic penguins and adapt them to make them do these dance moves and sing and everything. What also impressed me was how they also made the humans in the story realistic, unlike most animated films that make the characters look cartoon, they went for a more down to earth feeling. And also always, the special effects were good, good use of lighting and the way they made them dance.<br/><br/>Regarding the story, the good animation and the fancy dances moves by penguins weren't enough to keep the story up, there were moments where the storyline had to be strong but it always turned up a little weak, they really did try to make it seem like a musical but seem like the traditional animated movie with a zero that becomes a hero and all. But sadly I think they didn't make it strong enough.<br/><br/>Conclusion: I was amazed that this film won the Oscar for Best Animated Movie when it was up against Cars, which was much better, if you think penguins are cute and you wanna see them dance, I guess you can watch this film, but if you're expecting a fun time with the family, I suggest you bring pillows because it tends to get boring."
"the-gossip-king","3","0","3","5 January 2008"," What a load of rubbish
","DO NOT SEE THIS MOVIE! The story is stupid and the concept is ridicules. Pretty much a penguin tries to tell people to stop taking fish because there isn't enough for the penguins. He believes that by tap dancing for some weird un-explained reason the world will immediately know to stop taking fish. If that isn't stupid enough I can even see where director George Miller is going with it. He is trying to give over a message about the penguins and their life-style and to tell you the truth I am quite over the penguin movies who do exactly the same thing. 'March of the Penguins, Farce of the Penguins and Surfs Up.' Give me a break! The pace is also terrible. It is too slow in some parts and too quick in other parts to the point where I don't have any idea how something happened or how someone got to a place. The only thing that is restraining me from giving this a one is the voices and soundtrack. The great cast and classics sung by penguins is irresistible. However, it does not sustain the movie. That would be impossible even with a great cast. This movie falls on its face."

Britany Murphy is better seen and not heard. And please, no more Elvis songs. Fat Joe is Fat Joe. They captured him quite accurately as a penguin. Even in an animated film, you want to punch him in the face.<br/><br/>I can't believe this film beat out Cars and Monster House for best animated feature - at the Oscars.<br/><br/>If you like a lot of singing and dancing, then this is the movie for you.

","I heard some people consider this movie racist because a group of penguins that had Latin accents. in my opinion, even WORSE than the Latino penguins (wich had too many stereotypes and all, but at least were funny)... the whole message of the movie is really weird. At the end it's like 'ok, so let's respect this penguins because they can actually dance and that entertains us humans'. Doesn't this situation remind you of how black or Latins in movies seem to be considered 'great... because they can dance'?? Even if you don't think that's the idea... it's a bad message. Does it mean you shouldn't protect species that can't dance? So then organizations such as Greenpeace are all wrong about trying to protect animals that haven't demonstrated they 'deserve' it? What are you telling the kids? They obviously were too busy with creating dances and forgot about the plot and message and EVERYTHING!"

","'Happy Feet' could have been (should have been?) an all-time classic if it wasn't for the last 40 or-so minutes. Had the writer/director/producer stuck to the basics of the misfit-integrating-into-society part, and had accentuated this issue going a little deeper into it rather than trying to squeeze in an inappropriate environmentalist message which totally messes up the ending and leaves a sour taste in the spectators mouth, it would have been a great movie rather than just a good one.<br/><br/>On the positive side, the cinematography and sound are phenomenal (the Academy should have taken notice here) and the computer animations too. The human acting (voices) where also excellent, especially Robin Williams and Brittany Murphy, who is also responsible for the vocals in a large number of awesome singing numbers. This girl might be a good actress, but I think she should have been a singer!<br/><br/>All in all, very good entertainment but also a movie left with a lot of unrealized potential."

""Happy Feet"" is essentially a super-extended music video starring animated penguins, who are unanimated creatures to begin with. To its credit the artwork is stunning. Unfortunately, the musical numbers are awful and the story doesn't take form until the 70th minute when Mumble finally decides to do something with his life, turning the film all badass-""The Lord of The Rings"". Mumble, voiced by Elijah Wood, AKA Frodo, sets off on a treacherous journey with his hobbit-sized penguin buddies across lands never before waddled, directly into the hands of imminent danger. For this brief moment, the film reaches the dramatic heights of a ""Finding Nemo"", but quickly recedes back into the depths of a hellish musical underworld I'd rather forget.

","I rarely am offended by movies but this one managed to do just that. Happy feet could have been a great kid's film. A story about a young oddball penguin that has to overcome a social difficulty that is no fault of his own could make for a wonderful story of growing up and being yourself. But then we get the stereotypes.<br/><br/>It should be pointed out that EVERY character Robin Williams voices pokes fun at some group or another; a rock-hopper penguin that rips on black Baptist preachers, an Adele penguin that stereotypes Mexicans, and of course his religious leader emperor penguin that is all that is bad in anyone who holds to religion.<br/><br/>There are also a number of things that make this movie inappropriate for young children. There is way too much sexual innuendo. And the sequences with the leopard seal and killer whale may be too scary for the target audience.<br/><br/>My last gripe is the fact that once again, humans are the villains. I am sick and tired of being portrayed as a monster just because of my species.<br/><br/>So, except for the offensive stereotypes, the sexual references and the political demagoguery this was a semi-decent film."

","Cute dancing penguins make my daughter happy.<br/><br/>That being said, I was shocked at the stereotypes, the long winded ""green"" message even calling humans ""aliens"", the complete mishmash of a musical score including sexual innuendos, and most of all by the class system portraying penguins speaking English with over the top Spanish accents.<br/><br/>The messages to kids (whom this is directly marketed to) were anti-religion, pro-individualism/ non-confomity (not that there's anything wrong with that!"") C'm,on the father was so embarrassed!

","im not a big fan of this movie, but i saw it and noticed another goof. penguins live in the south, not in the north. during the movie, they are watching the NORTHERN lights!! i am pretty sure they don't have any southern lights, so yeah, they messed up there. <br/><br/>even though i am not a big fan of the movie, i will say they did a pretty good job with the animation, the background looked really good. I also noticed that the sea lion or seal that attacked the penguin, was GIANT! they usually aren't that big. but back to the animation, yeah i hated how they mixed live action with cgi, that is just kinda stupid to me."
"mcsheehey","5","0","1","6 June 2007"," Unbelievably Overrated
","""Happy Feet"" is a lively, song-filled, and visually stunning story of a group of penguins. It's also incredibly overrated, long-winded, lengthy, bizarre, and it has no real heart.<br/><br/>The film starts off well enough, and the first thirty minutes would have tempted me to give it an 8 or 9 out of ten. The opening scenes are fun and lively, filled with good tunes and an interesting storyline. Basically, ""Happy Feet"" is the story of Mumbles, a penguin who just doesn't belong in his community. While the other penguins can sing amazingly well at an early age, Mumbles has a terrible voice and can only tap his feet. In the beginning, his voice and the voices of his friends all sounded very cute to me, and the penguins themselves were as cute as can be. Unfortunately, when Mumbles grows up, the film goes downhill. Elijah Wood does a terrible job at voicing Mumbles, and his speeches and dialogues seem to drag on forever. As the story progresses, he first falls for Gloria, but leaves his penguin community to fin a place where he belongs. This is the start of the long and dragged-out plot of the film, which I found completely dull and strange.<br/><br/>Eventually, as always, the animated penguins come in contact with humans. This is the low point of the film because the humans are not animated, which is very creepy, and the director tries to bring in an environmental spin on the story.<br/><br/>Overall, the film is too long and the plot stops being interesting the second Mumbles and his friends become adults. The voice acting is great for the most part, but I found Robin Williams's different voicings kind of racist and stereotypical, and Elijah Wood does an awful job as the leading male. Still, the song and dance numbers are very fun and I enjoyed the animation for the most part.<br/><br/>5/10"

","Mumble is a young Emperor penguin who loves to dance, but is shunned by his tribe because he cannot sing. Befriended by a gang of little Adelie penguins, and curious about the outside world, Mumble is determined to find out why the fish are disappearing and if he can use his talents to restore the natural balance.<br/><br/>World's best animated dancing penguin movie. Whilst I might not like it as much as Shrek or Cars, this Australian flick is still pretty irresistible family fun, and the quality of the computer animation is outstanding throughout. Some sequences - such as when Mumble and the gang slip-slide down the mountain - push CG techniques to the absolute limit with breathtaking visual imagination. Although the film has a fairly limited pictorial scope (it's all penguins and ice-floes) it's never less than eye-popping. However, the plot, which borrows heavily from two Hans Christian Andersen stories (The Ugly Duckling and The Little Mermaid) is a bit thin for a whole movie I'm afraid - how many musical penguin numbers can you stage before getting repetitious ? There are a few fine action scenes, a great score by John Powell, some cool use of songs (The Beach Boys' Do It Again and Grandmaster Flash And The Furious Five's The Message) and gifted director Miller pulls off some stunning moments, such as the sudden three-shot pull-back of Mumble in the zoo to the Earth from space, but overall it's a bit too cutesy. The voice cast are good, with Jackman doing a great Elvis take and Weaving as a dour Scottish zealot, but Williams steals the show (as in Aladdin), as both narrator and two separate characters, such as when he berates the Emperors for ostracising Mumble with, ""We sing the heart of our true friend, Mumble. Joo are a nation of peeny-weeny, pibbling, pickolini, piddly-diddly !"". Dedicated to Australian naturalist Steve Irwin, who plays one of the elephant seals, and who was tragically killed by a stingray just prior to release. I'd really like to see this on a double-bill with my favourite of Miller's movies, Mad Max 2."

","I just saw this movie today on the television on my CD and wow, I loved it. The story is completely different, not like Cars and other Disney movies, which normally have the same plot with a change of characters.<br/><br/>The movie was dark but not scary and it really hooked me to the screen. I felt sad when the characters felt sad, felt happy when the characters felt happy and thus, felt their emotions.<br/><br/>Unlike Cars, Happy Feet doesn't have style but has lots of substance. The story was deep but understandable and the movie was not too flashy. <br/><br/>There was nothing extra in the film and the film was not too long at all.<br/><br/>The were also not too many characters and they mostly focused on the main character, Mumble. Eijah Wood has done an excellent job in playing the role.<br/><br/>Robin Williams and Brittany Murphy were also good in playing their role. I felt that Nicole Kidman could have spoken a bit louder, her voice was too low.<br/><br/>The jokes were really funny and the four short penguins were hilarious.

","The little Happy Feet is funny when it dances. The mix with musical scenes was a good idea and the animation is wonderful done as in ICE AGE, POLAR EXPRESS or MADAGASCAR. The story itself is therefore not fast paced and could have been shorter. What I liked was the well packed and clear message to anyone that humans invade more and more the area of the nature and destroys lives and environment. At the end of the movie real people play a role with the penguins and I found it as an interesting and original placement. Anyway, I think this one is worth seeing for little and adults. My wife and me rate it with a solid 6/10."
"redeyedtreefrog","3","0","1","4 May 2007"," Disappointing
","I like a song as much for its strong lyrics as for its music. Happy Feet was all music and no lyrics of substance. The story had a beginning and end but no middle. 2006 produced far better animations in Barnyard, Over the Hedge and Cars. Even Flushed Away trumped Happy Feet. It can be argued that Mumble had to find his own way in the world. He went on a journey to find himself and his own way to fit in, in a society strongly steeped in unbending tradition. It did accurately portray some of the reality of an Emperor Penguins existence but then again March of the Penguins did so in a sublime way. I have all criticism and little way to express it. The lack of story was like sitting down to a meal where your taste buds are tantalize by the promises of a grand meal. Out comes a waiter carrying a tray with two plates, one of a nice hot mouthwatering steak - which he passes to your dining partner - and one of a displeasing frozen, raw slab of meat plopped down in front of you. If the kiddies decide, well, there are mixed opinions there too."

"Zeldaholic","4","0","1","29 April 2007"," Cute, but certainly not without it's flaws
","Like other viewers, I was attracted to this film when I read that it was directed by George Miller, aka ""the guy that brought you Babe"". Unfortunately, Happy Feet does not even come close to Babe in terms of quality and storytelling. <br/><br/>I know that MANY viewers will have a problem with the following comment: Happy Feet was too sexual. And yes, other animated films such as The Lion King, Lady and the Tramp, exc... also had a few sexual themes, but the latter films presented those themes tastefully, giving only a VERY slight hint as to what was happening. Happy Feet did exactly the opposite. While I didn't have too much of a problem with the opening ""Norma Jean"" scene because it used an ""oldies"" song which made it rather humorous, I did have a problem with a particular scene that showed Mumble and Gloria sliding across the ice, landing in four obvious positions. Oops, I meant to say, they were just playing, right? It's not like the animators intentionally made Mumble and Gloria fall that way, right? This is likely to be the weak answer you'll get if you confront other reviewers on the subject.<br/><br/>Another problem with Happy Feet is that it had two conflicting story lines: the first storyline about Mumble growing up, the second storyline about the environment and the fish. After the scene where Mumble grows up, the second plot completely overshadows the first one, what with all the ""save the planet"" messages that persist from then on. The one thing that I DID like about this plot was the ""Man is evil"" theme. This honest message has become a rare trait in animal films, having not been seen since the days of Bambi. It represents the true relationship that animals share with Man, and the relationship that Man shares with himself. <br/><br/>The ""aliens"" (aka Man) are live-action, not animated like Happy Feet and the gang. This made both being on screen together rather awkward. Not the best choice, Miller.<br/><br/>I do not regret buying this DVD because of the beautiful animation, but this doesn't save Happy Feet from being mediocre when compared to classic animated films, unfortunately. Buy at your own risk."

","Happy Feet from 2006 is everything I'd hoped it would be. It was funny, cute, fun, and charming all at once. I enjoyed this film immensely and it is definitely a film parents should watch with their children. The plot is pretty simple. Memphis and Norma Jean are penguins who have given birth to their baby Mumble. But Mumble is no ordinary penguin. One day in class his teacher and all the other baby penguins realize that Mumble can't sing. But he can dance. But they think dancing is out of the ordinary so they all treat Mumble as an outsider and forbid him to dance. And one day while he's out looking for food he becomes hunted by a hungry sea lion and ends up in another part of ""town"" where there are smart and sassy penguins. And once he's there and he befriends the penguins he finds some objects that belong to the ""aliens"" that are responsible for the scarcity of the fish that the penguins eat. And so Mumble sets out on a journey to find the aliens. And when he does find the aliens he's captured and put into an aquarium for the ""aliens"", who are really humans, to visit and look at. Then, once he's released from the aquarium, he goes back to his hometown to see his parents and his friends and he's still treated like an outcast and blamed for the food shortage. And they still don't believe him when he's telling them that it was the aliens that are taking the food. He's almost forced out of the group again until the aliens appear. And he starts dancing for the aliens and they cheer and the group of penguins realize that Mumble's dancing is a good thing and they allow him to stay in the group.<br/><br/>The scenery is breathtaking and all the penguins were cute. I loved Hugh Jackman's Elvis Presley-inspired voice for the role of Memphis and Nicole Kidman was great as Norma Jean. The singing in this film were some of the most delightful scenes. It certainly put a smile on my face to hear the penguins singing songs by Prince! And the penguins, especially the baby ones, have great one-liners and their tiny voices alone are a sure bet to make you smile. And Robin Williams is always great as a voice for a cartoon character. You gotta love his character Lovelace in this film and his narration was great too. Happy Feet is a wonderful film and any child, or any fan of penguins for that matter, should see it! I'm glad I did. My 15 year old sister and I were smiling the whole time. Definitely a must see! Thanks for reading my review!"
"MeloDee","8","0","1","17 April 2007"," ""Cute"" just ain't the word.
","To call Happy Feet ""cute"" would be an understatement. To fully describe it, you'd need a litany of adjectives, such as ""extroidinarily"", ""exceedingly"", ""intensely"", and ""tremendously"" set in front of the word ""cute"" in order for your description to be complete.<br/><br/>If you have read the synopsis, you probably already know the story. It follows the life of ""Mumble"" (Elijah Wood), the penguin youngling of parents ""Norma Jean"" (Nicole Kidman) and ""Memphis"" (Hugh Jackman), who, because of certain circumstances, was born with the ability to dance instead of the ability to sing. When he attempts to sing, he creates a sound similar to that of a shrill, rusty horn- only about 10 times worst. It will make you laugh and wince all at once.<br/><br/>The voice acting in the movie was colorful and diverse, with a variety of different accents to help express each character. Robin Williams was amazing as the narrator. Most of the songs sung in the movie are probably very familiar to most people, and they were done in the most fun, ""cute"" way possible.<br/><br/>After an hour of giggling, though, I fell silent as the movie took a turn for the serious. It started to deal with such political issues as man's misuse of the environment, religious tolerance, and social acceptance. To be honest, I was a little taken back. I didn't expect such a heavy hit from what I thought was nothing but a cute little kid's film.<br/><br/>I felt that at some points, the movie lost a little of it's flow and started trying too hard to make it's moral points. I felt that the ending was a bit rushed.<br/><br/>All in all though, it was an incredible, original movie and I don't think that I will forget it soon.<br/><br/>Oh, and it doesn't hurt that the animation is absolutely magnificent either."
"Mightyzebra","7","0","1","15 April 2007"," 7 and a 1/2 out of ten, beautiful, but weirdly sad.
","When I first saw the advert of this, I thought it was going to be a happy film, with a few baddies and the plot it had. Unfortunately, I didn't know it was going to be this sad. I felt extremely sorry for Mumble, who was unloved and teased by thousands of penguins just because he couldn't sing! The Adelie penguins are MUCH more sensible about the whole mating thing (not just in this film). They just give their girlfriend a pebble and - voila! They can now mate! Mumble seems a little aspie (asperger's syndrome is a form of autism and autism is a difference in people), which made things interesting, but it also made things sadder and meaner because Mumble was teased. <br/><br/>The animated film is about a little penguin chick called Mumble, who loves to dance. His parents hope he'll grow out of it. Unfortunately, he can't, but what makes things worse for him and for his parents, is that he can't sing - and that means he isn't a proper emperor penguin...<br/><br/>I like this film for its animation, ROBIN WILLAMS (!! :) ), most of its characters and some of its excitement. Enjoy!<br/><br/>P.S If you thought this was going to be a happy film, then I suggest you think a while before watching this. This isn't all the title says."

","A wonderful, and wonderfully animated musical. A singing, dancing antarctic epic. A strong cast, excellent voice work. Visually stunning. <br/><br/>The plot is fairly predictable. Can the main character goes from zero to hero? Well, nothing new there. But his path is entertaining, and far more interesting and substantial than say, a number of Fred Astaire/Ginger Rogers vehicles, and those are enjoyable classics. The only other mild annoyance is the director's continually forcing the little tuxedo'ed critters to the top of some nameless frozen promontory in order to do the obligatory motion sequence. In other words - there's a lot of falling in this movie.<br/><br/>As a dad, there are two things I want to make special note of. A lot of movies that are considered children's classics involve families that have suffered at least one tragic loss. This is a long standing cliché, and our kids are quick to point it out: ""Bambi"", dead mom story. ""Cinderella"", dead dad story. ""Snow White"", dead mom AND dad, etc. It is a relief that ""Happy Feet"" is none of these. <br/><br/>Secondly, I like the fact that Mumble, the main character, deals with his ""different"" qualities with the same attitude that Popeye is famous for, namely, ""I yam what I yam!"" He's comfortable with who he is. He just has to convince about a zillion other penguins, too. And to see if, or how, he manages to do this, well, go see the picture."

All good kids stories/movies have their roots in reality at some level, but this one goes overboard. Kids wont understand and adults will be left feeling uneasy at the oversimplification of global issues. The overall message is that song and dance will overcome everything. I know its cynical to say that expression of joy isn't enough to overcome socio-political, environmental, and cross cultural and religious differences, but this movie puts us in the position of staring straight down the barrel of grim reality.<br/><br/>The comments were upsetting to me because people come off as myopic and ignorant.

","Whilst his film certainly didn't deserve the Oscar it won, it would be somehow wrong to give the film black looks. This is mainly because the film has a lovely color palette and the musical numbers certainly succeeded in melting my heart. Had this film concentrated on its music, I am sure it would have fared better. However, the film goes on to give a lecture on global warming and kindness towards penguins. And that is where Happy Feet looses track. The theme of an outcast becoming a hero has already been used in the much inferior ""The Ant Bully"", but it somehow steers slightly away from it only to find itself where ""Finding Nemo"" had already treaded. The voice cast is decent, and the mildly perilous sequences aren't shameful either. However, the film still lacks novelty value.<br/><br/>Verdict<br/><br/>This is a keen attempt to cash in on the buzz created by ""March of the Penguins""  not my kind of fun."
"mstewart35","5","0","2","29 March 2007"," Sooo Not Thought Out
","Okay, I cannot deny the technical skill, the caliber of music and the amazing cast. However, if you are, like many people, easily annoyed by musicals, this will definitely make your knee jerk. They never needed even a hint of an excuse to morph into a song and dance number. The silliness of this was altogether bizarre, and they completely sacrificed character and story development to music and tap. This movie is ""cute as a button"", BUT, like a button, has no human (or animal) guts.<br/><br/>Even Robin Williams' usual brilliant performance fails to salvage the substance of this fiasco. How I wish that the wonderful, much deserved tribute to the great Steve Irwin (also, R.I.P. ""as cute as a button"") had not been attached to a movie sooo not thought out."
"ccianciola","5","0","2","29 March 2007"," Enjoyable with some nagging concerns about racial representation
","Happy Feet was a visual pleasure. I cried and laughed and wanted to dance. At a number of points throughout however, I felt myself cringing about the way the film racialized the animal populations. I still haven't put my finger on what it is that bugs me. I haven't decided if the film is as self aware as I'd like to think it is with its environmentalist critique of globalization, oil and fishing industries. I suspect it is using ethnicity to fill out the animated penguin story but risks making the Latino and African histories and people that it references seem ""closer to nature"" and unfortunately, primitive. Icky implication.There is a chance the film is actually delivering a complaint about the effects of imperialism on humans through the impact globalization has on penguins. Maybe viewers will care more about fuzzy animals than humans but I'm not sure this was the point.I'm more curious about how a popular film that is making a moral statement CAN anamorphize animals across racial and ethnic lines and be as in command of those representations as any other component of the film."
"MattsMovieWatchingWorld","5","0","2","26 February 2007"," Did Not Make My Feet Happy.
","I rarely see a movie that is expected to be very good, but ends up not NEARLY as good as I hoped. The movie is about a young penguin who can't sing, when every penguin in Antarctica is expected to have a talent for singing. On the better hand, he can tap dance pretty well. Hearing about this movie at first, it looked good because of the animation, and some talented actors voicing. But I can't completely believe why the story idea was attractive at first. It's not a very good idea for a story. When the penguin is tap dancing, it disastrously looked that the audio and visual weren't synchronized. Maybe it's because of the complex combination and timing of the foot hitting the ground that doesn't adequately match with the number of film frames that can fit in a second. The animation was good, but they didn't do much to clearly distinguish the characters' faces. For example, much of the time, I couldn't tell whether a certain character was Mumble's girlfriend or Mumble's mother. Robin Williams, who is one of my very favorite actors, is a voice actor in this movie. He does the voice for two or three different characters. He was good, I guess, but his performances in the last two or so years have been a lot less classic as some other things he's done. He was a good voice actor for that one Hispanic penguin, but then again, why are the penguins Hispanic? I don't think there are any native Spanish or Mexican penguins out there.<br/><br/>I was watching the movie, and after a while I was wondering, 'what kind of resolution can you get for a movie plot problem about penguin singing vs. penguin dancing?', when in just a few moments, the whole storyline changed into a more dramatic, haunting, global-awareness type of story, with the original plot problem never satisfactorily resolved. I did not think that political issue was what the movie needed. It should have just stayed with the original story idea first mentioned, and somehow come up with a resolution for that.<br/><br/>This movie won the Oscar for Best Animated Feature. No. NO. This award was clearly going to be awarded to Cars. If it were my choice, Cars would have won Best Animated Feature, let alone Best Picture. Cars is Pixar, no more explanation needed. If Cars was, for some reason, not here this year, then the award nominations would have gone to Monster House, Flushed Away, Curious George, Everyone's Hero, Over the Hedge, and/or Ice Age: The Meltdown. I would even award this Oscar to Doogal before Happy Feet. Happy Feet must have won the award only because of the global-awareness/political issue. But let me say it again: I do not think that this issue is what the movie needed. This is, in my opinion, the worst animated movie of the year, that I saw (I didn't see some animated movies this year; some of them looked worse than Happy Feet). Movie awards often seem to be awarded to the more dramatic than entertaining types of movies. I think Oscars and other movie awards should be awarded to more entertaining movies than dramatic movies. If that had been the case, this movie would have been a lot different, and, in my opinion, better.<br/><br/>5/10"

","(The below is a commentary by World Magazine's John Dawson, I have included it to give a different perspective on this movie than what the typical newspaper would write.) <br/><br/>Bait and switch, Happy Feet jumps into some surprisingly angry territory | John Dawson <br/><br/>Previews for Happy Feet give moviegoers no idea what they are in for. For half of the one-hour, 40-minute flick, Happy Feet (rated PG for mild peril and rude humor) behaves like a traditional children's animated film. It's beautiful. It's filled with talking animals. It's cute, although somewhat nonsensical. But with about 40 minutes remaining, Happy Feet takes a most displeasing turnone so harsh and unnecessary, parents should avoid taking children to the film.<br/><br/>At first Australian filmmaker George Miller's Happy Feet seems like a digitized musical version of the hit documentary March of the Penguins. Miller uses March's basic survival plot to set up his tale of one Emperor Penguin that can't sing (a mating prerequisite in Miller's imagined land). Though the muted bird, appropriately named Mumble, can tap dance, he's ostracized from the group. Apart from his kind in Antarctica, Mumble survives a few scares but eventually meets a group of smaller, somehow more Latino, penguins. After a few wacky adventures with the group of smaller penguins, Mumble and his musical gang encounter the dreaded and feared humans.<br/><br/>And that's really when Happy Feet takes a sharp turn from an ebullient musical to a heavy-handed message movie that feels distracted and especially angry. There is nothing happy about the dark final 40 minutes as George Miller unleashes a political screed aimed at overfishing and human littering, among other things. Mumble goes after the humans, now ""aliens,"" lands himselfpredictablyin a zoo and summons a montage of fast-paced talking points on environmentalism. Miller also unleashes on religion, lampooning the Emperor Penguin establishment as blinded to reality by religious dogma.<br/><br/>It's dark and sad in ways that children especially young childrenwon't understand. And parents won't see it comingit's all bait for an environmentalist and anti-religion presentation that could make some moviegoers wonder if they accidentally stepped into Al Gore's An Inconvenient Truth.

'Oh so cute' adorable Mumbles and other penguin babies. Humorous characters in the movie yet with a profound message. The actors supplying the voices were great for their parts. How could you not like the talents of Robin Williams, Elijah Wood and the like? Movie aptly named. The fun and spirit of this movie is infectious. One of my grandchildren was moved to tap dance in place as the entire credits rolled by. After seeing is more than a few times, I am looking forward to buying it the day the DVD is released. Deserves an Academy Award."
"Gordon-11","Null","0","1","22 January 2007"," Poor story development and weak plot
","This film is about a penguin who cannot sing like the other penguins. He instead knows how to dance, and spreads the fun of dancing to the other penguins.<br/><br/>I had high hopes when I watched this, as I have heard so many positive word of mouth. I was disappointed by this film. The plot is rather non existent. Am I really supposed to believe that the non dancing penguins suddenly know how to dance in choreographed ways in groups when they haven't even seen the entire dance? The plot was to make excuses for them to play songs, so that the studio can release a soundtrack. I felt I was watching an extended music video. The plot was so weak that the film could have been at least an hour shorter. Another problem was the lack of change of scenery. The entire story happened on ice, and watching penguin sing and dance for 2 hours became highly repetitive and boring.<br/><br/>As of all recent animations, some moral enlightenment was thrown in to appeal to the adults. In this film, the moral was about ""fishing destroyed the natural habitat for penguins"". However, the message did not appear until the final 10 minutes of the film, meaning it was poorly developed. It felt more like an in your face propaganda that was not connected from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>However, there were good things about this film, such as the excellent animation. Making hundreds of penguins dance must have been a painstaking task.<br/><br/>I am disappointed by this film. It simply does not measure up to the other recent animations."

","This movie could have been so much nicer to take kids to if there wasn't an overuse of 'peril' (as described for the PG rating). The seal that chases Mumble and the Latino penguins just looked DEMONIC and larger than the killer whales they later encounter. The scale of the seal to the penguins was just ridiculous and overdone for the 'scary' effect.<br/><br/>I just don't think it needed to be like that. A lot of the voices (elephant seals) and imagery were embellished-scary, and I don't think that's what the trailers would have us believe was going to be portrayed.<br/><br/>My son didn't like it and because of being distracted by being scared he missed the storyline.

","...But, I found the storyline of this movie confusing. The introductions to the characters took way too long, and when the plot actually became ""the plot"" it went way too fast and was hard to follow. My other issue with the movie was that the humor and ""slapstick"" jokes are geared towards small children while the main context of the movie (mating) is rather grown up. If you want to make a movie that appeals to both audiences, put some subtle adult humor in it (pixar has mastered this and then some - take notes). I understand it is difficult to gear a movie about mating for a young audience, and it is evident in this movie."

","This environmental, non-conformist, message-heavy kids film follows a group of Emperor penguins as they mate (done by singing one's heartsong) and hunt. They are ruled by a grizzled, controlling penguin who enforces a conformist code of conduct. Mumble however, cannot sing, but he can tap like Gregory Hines. This causes shame in his father and ridicule from the others. He gets fed up, leaves the tribe and runs into a happy go lucky group of Hispanic penguins led by Ramon (Robin Williams). He then learns of aliens who have tagged birds, left equipment and taken all the fish. He sets out to find them after being rejected again by his tribe. Yes, he saves the day, makes things better and the whole tribe embraces tap as the saviour of their world.<br/><br/>This movie is like Honey-Nut Cheerios. They are tasty, crunchy, sweet and nutritious. However, in the late 80s/early 90s, when oats were the newest cure-all for heart disease, Cheerios went a little overboard declaring the redemption that Cheerios could bring to your heart. It almost overwhelmed the enjoyment of the cereal, the message was so pervasive.

","First of all, the soundtrack is wonderful. Animated musicals can be fun, but sometimes the soundtrack is so-so without the animation. Not the case with this movie. Second, sure it's got an agenda.

Adults may feel it's too filled with agenda, but kids are going to enjoy the film regardless. My take? If you can't handle films with an obvious agenda, this might not be for you, but your kids are probably still going to like it so send them with friends.

","I saw this yesterday at 8.15pm showing. What can I say? Mumble is so cute(awwww!), and not being blessed with a good singing voice but the ability to tap dance makes this a very enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Penguins are maybe some of the most endearing of God's creatures ever, so putting them in their own animated film, with a good plot was sure to e a box-office success, considering how March Of The Penguins did so well the previous years.<br/><br/>I just love animated films where they just break out into song and dance, and the routines are a joy to watch. My feet was tapping along and I swaying from side to side. The 'Boogie Wonderland' number is a really good one that stands out for me.<br/><br/>But this is more than just a song-a-minute film - It also has eco-friendly theme, which is quite fitting with the whole global warming issue going on at the moment, which makes us think about what our lifestyles are doing to the wildlife.<br/><br/>Did I mention that the visuals are stunning? The penguins up close look photo-realistic, and attention to detail is breath-taking.<br/><br/>This is probably the best animated film of the year, I think, with a better plot than Ice Age 2.

","I just saw the movie today... all in all, it was pretty good as an animated film. Yes, it did have a little bit of innuendo (my best friend and I both just laughed off Mumble's and Gloria's ""mating dance""), but it seriously lacked truly funny jokes. The funniest part was when Robin Williams' character told Mumble, ""I once heard an animal make that noise.. But when they turned him over, he was dead."" after he heard his singing. But the movie sent a good message-- I was with two teenagers at the time-- my siblings-- and they thought it was great. I thought it was very good, as did my friend. Maybe not worth buying a ticket, but definitely a rent-worthy option thats good with kids and adults, too."
"Aldri7","Null","0","2","4 December 2006"," penguins are cute
","Penguins are so cute and human like, it must be irresistible to want to make an animated movie about them. Ever wonder what penguins do all day long down there in the Antarctic? Just stand around like folks at a bus stop? Not anymore. Thanks to Mumble, who was practically born tapping his feet, they now dance. Why? Well, the reason is a little confusing.......<br/><br/>Mmmm....lets see. Dancing is fun and most likely keeps the feet warm. Dancing also angers the elders, which in Hollywood is always a good thing. But besides that, I guess its just cute to an eight year old - an eight year old that can whisper in daddy's ear about how horrible it would be if something were to happen to these cute little critters. Heaven forbid! They must not be allowed to starve. After all, we need the entertainment and what other critters walk around on two feet like us, wear tuxedos and have such cute little chicks? But can cute and dancing save them all from annihiliation? Thats the million dollar question.<br/><br/>Anyway, I didn't really feel the need for much of a plot here. I can dig two hours of great animation and scenery and music with no plot at all. I loved Winged Migration for example, a movie that came to mind during a couple of scenes. So in otherwords, others can argue about the political message and the stereotypes and all that. But I was preoccupied more with things like the poor choice of musical numbers and how I really couldn't tell any of the tall penguins apart except for Mumble. And the dancing? It really wasn't all that inspiring. So in essence, what we were left with was a movie that was basically about penguins singing and dancing, but with neither inspiring music nor inspiring dance. Oh well......nothing like going with your best punches and then missing both of them. <br/><br/>So what memorable moments did this movie leave me with, then? What themes touched my heart? Those chicks were so cute in the beginning, I almost started to cry. And I also think that having another race of Latino penguins was a definite plus. But the love story, on the other hand, fell flat because I never bonded with any female penguin, and because Mumble did not really seem to be as interesting in attracting a mate as he was in saving his fellow penguins from starvation. And where was our hero's redemption in the end? His crowning moment of glory? It was mostly lost in a sea of gyrating penguins, who were too busy grooving to the beat to remember who to thank. We know who saved the penguins, but did the other penguins know? <br/><br/>Overall, I'd give this effort mixed success at best. I don't think it was bad, but it missed in important areas where it should have made sure it hit the mark (music, dance). I didn't even mention the computer animation, which was very satisfying as i expected. Anyway, cute penguins are nice, but I don't know if I would have bothered to save them without more inspired song and dance."

","Spectacular animation in both macro (multitudes of penguins arrayed on frozen landscapes, zippy underwater action) and micro (the nuances of motion--even down to the flutter of tongues as the birds speak) details make it a must to see this on a large screen. If you have an IMAX theater handy, so much the better. But while the visual splendor is one of the primary attractions here, it's the story, with some unexpected twists and turns, that provides the main interest.<br/><br/>Yes, the basic premise is familiar--an ""ugly duckling"" (in this case, a penguin named Mumble who dances far better than he sings--in a community where singing is all-important) who rises above his misfit status. And yes, there are plot developments that are never fully explained, and even a moviegoer who has environmentalist leanings (as I do) may find some of the message mongering a little heavy-handed (as I did--but more on that later). Yet the movie has more on its mind than giving us yet another parade of wisecracking animals, and manages to speak its mind within the context of Mumble's journey. Younger moviegoers (and, perhaps, their parents) who have been conditioned by ""Ice Age,"" ""Over the Hedge,"" et al. may find the going a little slow here, but it's possible that like ""Shrek,"" this is a kids' movie that adults can better appreciate. There's plenty of comedy, but with serious underpinnings.<br/><br/>It's interesting that the commentators on this site who seem to be most uncomfortable with the environmental subtext of ""Happy Feet"" are more likely to pan the movie as a whole. As I said, I found the integration of the ecological theme a little clunky and obvious, but at the same time I thought the movie was a perfectly appropriate vehicle for sending this message, so the disparaging comments may be a matter of shooting the messenger. Those who don't want a little environmentalism mixed in with their singing and dancing penguins may not want to see it anywhere else, either."

","My dear girlfriend and I saw this today, and were very pleasantly entertained. The movie has a good message, but it really wasn't fleshed out enough. Still, it merits much good discussion with youngsters and anyone else who's environmentally unaware of the perils facing our oceans. I'm a second grade teacher and would love to show this movie to my young students. For one thing, and as one can learn from the trailers, it deals with a ""differently-abled"" penguin who can't do what his elders require of him. Rather than give up and conform (when he knows he can't), he insists on being himself. This leads to some interesting film-making with incredible animation. I agree that there may be too many tunes crammed into this movie, but what the heck, my feet kept tapping the theater floor."

","CGI has come such a long way. I actually spent most of the moving thinking of how much memory it must have taken to create the images on the screen. I could have done without the preaching about overfishing, but that's the cost of doing business these days. Sociopolitical messages are everywhere from cereal boxes to music to movies. I thought the characters were engaging. I liked the use of old standards in the soundtrack. The story is nothing new,""Misfit is cast out of the group, but comes back at the end to save the day"". The only twist is that he doesn't get the girl. I'd recommend this movie for its amazing images, incredible animation and great soundtrack."

","Happy Feet, was all in all a good movie, especially for kids of all ages. There's a lot of singing and dancing involved in this movie, at certain points you want to sing along, and you can't help it. It's not your average kid movie either. It's a little educational though you learn many things about penguins that you may not have known before. It's worth watching, but maybe not going to the theater to see.

","Great movie that the whole family can go see. Not only does it captivate the minds of children but it also amuses adults with the humor. The only detail parents may want to know for small children is that there are a couple parts with action that may scare them. Robin Williams is hilarious in this movie, especially since he plays three different characters throughout the whole thing. Even without the humor the movie has a great underlying message concerning the debris thrown into the oceans that endangers animals along with the depleting food supply of some animals due to human society.

","From the beginning this movie was a typical children's musical cartoon. The ""ugly duckling"" (in this case penguin) tries to find his place and get the attention of his love without compromising who he is. <br/><br/>There is a specific point within the movie, however, where everything changes and the film becomes a dark telling of man's injustices to nature. <br/><br/>After the film, very audibly, switches its gears the rest of the movie focuses on the little penguin trying to reach out to the humans and make them see the error of their ways to save his species. <br/><br/>While I do believe that man is enacting many injustices upon the earth and the creatures that inhabit it, and I also believe that children need to be taught the message that this movie is trying to teach, the abrupt transition from a fairly care-free children's movie to a ""save the environment"" speech made the rest of the movie awkward. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the adult humor though."

","I have to admit I didn't know what to expect before I saw this film. This year, the only other CGI-animated film I enjoyed was Flushed Away (which is partly because I grew up watching the Wallace and Gromit series and I love Chicken Run, but also because it was genuinely entertaining). As the older sister of a seven-year-old girl and a fan of CGI-animated films since Toy Story came out, I have seen my fair share of CGI-animated films... and this was not the year for CGI-animated movies until Happy Feet came out.<br/><br/>Sure, Flushed Away was enjoyable and fun to watch, but what Happy Feet has that no other CGI-animated film released this year has is the classic formula for an enjoyable family film. The makers of Happy Feet even added the formula for an enjoyable animated musical, something long missing in animated films.<br/><br/>Hugh Jackman, Nicole Kidman, Brittany Murphy, Robin Williams, and Elijah Wood star in this animated gem, and Jackman, Kidman, Murphy, and Williams provide their own beautiful singing voices. The casting couldn't be more perfect, and the characters couldn't be more lovable. Who doesn't find an adelie penguin (voiced by Williams), belting at the top of his lungs, ""Lo hice myyyyyyyyyy wayyyyyyy!"" adorable and entertaining? Nine out of ten- go out and see it today.

"sullibrandon","8","0","2","28 November 2006"," True Toe-Tapping Fun!
","Singing and dancing penguin cultures collide in this snowy antarctic adventure that delivers about as much toe-tapping fun as any dancing or music fiend could hope for, with catchy tunes that'll have your feet uncontrollably tip-tapping along on the floor with the happy dancing penguins. Featuring an all-star voice cast, the most realistic computer animation this side of Shrek, and an intelligent and thoughtful storyline that soars above the mediocre heads of all the recently released CGI movies, Happy Feet is a fun and thought-provoking film that not only can little kids enjoy, but adults will find plenty to munch on as well.<br/><br/>We are introduced to a couple of penguins in love, in the middle of a mating ritual, which involves the woman penguin waltzing around singing until she finds the perfect man penguin to sing for her. Soon the two have an egg, which, due to a brief uncontrollable toe-tapping from Dad (dancing is forbidden in this penguin society), slides away into the blizzard. He quickly retrieves it, but later on their baby, Mumble, voiced by Elijah Wood, is born, and not only can he not sing worth a darn, his toe-tapping skills are amazing. Rejected by his peers and by most of the colony, Mumble, eventually finds his way to a neighboring penguin colony where he is accepted. From there, he must continue on, using his dancing skills to figure out why the fish are disappearing from the ocean. (Hint: They're aliens with large scary machines.) Happy Feet is a movie that starts off innocently enough. You have a few fun dance numbers, some cool duets and solos, including a rendition of Queen's ""Somebody to Love."" The music is exquisite, the dance numbers are creative and extremely fun. There is one part, involving a chase with a sea lion, that some young ones may find scary, but it's nothing too bad, and it's exquisitely and breath-takingly done. The movie is rated PG, people, and with ""mild peril"" for a reason. It's not a movie for very little kids.<br/><br/>Then the movie takes a turn that many have argued is for the worse, but which I believe puts it head and shoulders above the competition. After awhile, I wondered what the heck was going to happen with Mumble's dancing talents. It seemed the movie was going nowhere with them, but he eventually uses them, in a very creative way.<br/><br/>This movie gets kind of dark, and, many would argue, environmentally preachy, but I'm glad it took this route. I was afraid I'd get a sappy, gag on my puke, clichÃ© storyline, but instead of going with the tried-and-true formula, Happy Feet took a risk, a risk that has well payed off, it seems, as it received 79% on rottentomatoes, and has topped the box-office two weeks in a row, despite tough competition from Casino Royale. Happy Feet is not a movie content to stay inside its prescribed boundaries. It takes chances with the storyline, it does something new, different, fresh, and daring, and it has a lot of people upset. Many people take their little kids to this and are horrified that they were not given the everything is happy and free kiddie flick the previews promised them. The Lion King had a very dramatic death, though, one that caused controversy back in the day, and yet it was a very good movie.<br/><br/>Happy Feet may have toyed with its audiences a little too much. It could have been more honest with the previews, and I found the conclusion to the film a little odd and it did seem kind of incongruous with what had come before. I applaud their risk-taking, though. The controversial plot aside, though, character development is stellar, the storyline is endearing and fun, the CGI is so real in places you may swear that you're watching actual penguins waddle along the ice. Each of the characters is fun, too - Robin Williams in the dual role as Ramon/Lovelace, especially. I was afraid he would just be annoying and try to steal the show with his shtick, but it fit perfectly into the storyline. And, of course, with a movie about dancing, if the music sucked, the movie would not be much to speak of. And fortunately, the music is awesome, dancing, happy feet music. It's just a movie that makes me want to get up and dance right along with Mumble and the whole penguin colony. It really makes me happy when a movie raises the bar, especially an animated one, because of how crappy animated movies are these days. Happy Feet does have a few flaws, but they are negligible. And besides, who are we kidding? It's all about the dancing penguins."

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>Happy Feet is a cute little film. I always wanted to see a film with penguins. I saw March of the Penguins, then I saw this. March of the Penguins was a fantastic documentary of a penguin's life. Well, this is a film about dancing penguins. Pretty big difference. Now I don't really remember this film clearly.<br/><br/>Happy Feet is about a penguin named Mumble. He is kicked out of his penguin group because he can't sing like the other penguins. He can only dance. Then he meets a penguin named Gloria, who can sing really well. When he gets older he and Gloria break up because he can't sing. Then he meets a group of short penguins. Mumble teaches them to dance. They have a leader named Lovelace. He has a pop holder around his penguin neck. Then the pop holder gets really stuck around his neck and he starts choking. Mumble and the other short penguins meets a killer whale. He tries to eat Mumble and Lovelace. The killer whale throws Lovelace. Lovelace's pop holder flies off. But then Mumble gets stuck in a zoo and thinks that people are aliens. A little girl comes and everyone takes pictures of Mumble dancing. Mumble gets back to Antarctica. I forgot how. Anyway, Mumble doesn't want to get teased by the other penguins. Then a penguin sings behind Mumble's back. Everyone thinks Mumble is singing! I think that happened before he got trapped in a zoo. Then they find out that Mumble wasn't really singing. Then Gloria gets a new penguin. Mumble think Gloria's singing choir is their babies. In the end humans come to see Mumble dance. He does, and the humans stop the shortage of fish in Antarctica.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a beautiful looking computer animated film. A bit long and a bit complicated for kids, but it's a great little penguin movie that you could see with the whole entire family. Everyone could enjoy this little flick. The only problem that I have is, like I said, a bit too complicated and long. I mean, there's the food shortage in Antarctica, which younger kids wouldn't understand. There is also a thing I'd like to point out, actually two things. When Mumble dances, his feet don't match the beat at all. Also, the humans in this film are not computer animated, they're real.

I'm a sucker for films with messages and when the film finally arrived at its own, I felt it did a fine job with it.<br/><br/>All that being said, it's a fun film...the music and dancing is not at all esoterically Fantasia-like.

There seems to be two story lines going on at the same time (love for the main character and life for all the penguins) with one being well resolved and the other was left very much lacking any real conviction.

The message is sort of good but any real environmentalist is going to have a fit about it.<br/><br/>I wouldn't bother seeing it in the theater. The story is kind of a let down despite the cute fuzzy penguins and the comedy of Robin Williams."
