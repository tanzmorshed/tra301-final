","A really good movie and not a bad action movie I really like it, the whole gang is here. Fast Five (2011) is still to me the best one and my favorite in the franchise and then it would be Furious 6 than The Fast and the Furious I think this would be my fourth favorite film in the franchise. It is an entertaining fun fast paced action film and that really a good one. But it is not perfect I have issues with the film which I will get to it but first I want to write goods about this film.I can't wait till I watch The Fate of the Furious I am getting on Blu-ray next week so yesterday I re-watch this film and I have enjoy it. <br/><br/>Furious 7 is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise. The film grossed $397.6 million worldwide during its opening weekend, which is the sixth highest-grossing opening of all time. The film has grossed over $1.5 billion worldwide – more than the franchise's first five installments combined – making it the highest-grossing film of the franchise after just twelve days, the third highest-grossing film of 2015 and the sixth highest-grossing film of all time. A sequel, The Fate of the Furious, was released on April 14, 2017.<br/><br/>The film's about Dominic Toretto (Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their team, who have returned to the United States to live normal lives after securing amnesty for their past crimes in Fast & Furious 6 (2013), until Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his comatose younger brother, puts the team in danger once again. <br/><br/>The cast includes: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell, and Jason Statham. <br/><br/>I like this flick they action is crazier than ever, there's some unnecessary camera moves and this one needs an even bigger suspension of disbelief, it barely pauses in between set pieces. Kurt Russell is in this and like I have said in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 my review I hated his performance in that movie but in here I loved him he was awesome and a really good guy and likable. He has more to do in this film than he did in Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2. Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto is always terrific and a bad-ass I absolutely love him. Jason Statham is a crazy motherf***** in this I have enjoyed him I always wanted Statham as a bad guy. Michelle Rodriguez as Letty Ortiz Dom's girlfriend was hot as always I have simply enjoyed her. The rest of the cast was alright.<br/><br/>The issues with the film I have is: Why is shaky cam in the beginning of the fights between Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham and on the end of the fights between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that really hurts this film. I got a migraine because of the shaking cam.<br/><br/>Dwayne Johnson was only in the beginning of the film and for the rest of the film he was departure he appeared only on the end of the film in the final showdown I only wish he would be more in this film and he would have more to do but I still have enjoyed his performance awesome. <br/><br/>Jordana Brewster as Mia Toretto is useless in this movie she doesn't do nothing her character is just wasted and useless. I don't know why they put her character in this movie. Lucky Michelle Rodriguez fulfill the emptiness in Dom's crew. <br/><br/>Car's with flying parachutes also doesn't fit in the film because of the metal weight parachutes can't hold that kind of metal and some unnecessary CGI was used in this film that also hurt the movie. <br/><br/>Those are all the issues I have, I can't wait for The Fate of the Furious to see it I heard it is a good film.<br/><br/>The rating this film get's is a A 9/10 I would have give it 10 but those issues in my opinion hurt the film. <br/><br/>Paul Walker died in November 30 2013 so his two brothers Caleb and Cody Walker replaced him and they help to make this film right so I have enjoy from all three brothers performance. R.I.P. Paul Walker my favorite actor and my all time favorite character of the franchise Brian O'Conner. This film is dedicated to his memory which I love. <br/><br/>Furious 7 (alternatively known as Fast & Furious 7 and Fast 7) is a 2015 American action film directed by James Wan and written by Chris Morgan. It is the seventh installment in The Fast and the Furious franchise.<br/><br/>9/10 Grade: A Studio: Universal Pictures Starring: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Jordana Brewster, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell , Jason Statham Director: James Wan Producers: Neal H.

"eduardoskelly-252-683387","Null","70","79","30 April 2015"," It was a good movie
","The movie was a very action packed film it had a lot going on almost at all times which really grabs your attention and other people attention. I would rate it a 8 out of 10 because it was a very good movie, also the director of the movie is a good one. He uses short cuts so then he can get all of the action in. You can't have long cuts with action packed movies because it's very hard to do. My favorite part of the movie would have to be when they were driving through all the buildings because it is something that is highly unlikely but still looks very cool. It's shows how much balls the guys driving the cars have and how bad ass they are. They chose very good actors for the characters because you can't have someone that looks wimpy driving through buildings and racing cars. They chose Dom because he is big and muscular which Is good. But overall the move fast and the furious 7 was a very good movie and very action packed."

","As a F&F fan, I've enjoyed every movie in the franchise excluding F3. But, that movie has an important part and effect to the franchise. And now to the film, It was a full action flick alongside with a tear crying tribute to Paul Walker. From the first race of Leticia to the last scene between O'Connor and Toretto, It was one of the best movie in the franchise. The Core part of the story tells us about good ol' fashioned revenge combined with Speed of NOS and muscle. Deckard Shaw seeks out his kind of style revenge which pulls Toretto and his family into Shaw's world.And so, he combine forces Mr. Nobody to complete a mission for him and in return gets Deckerd Shaw. What happens afterwards, is your's to see. The performance of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker is fantastic. From the Screenplay to their actions, their brother 2 brother relationship was amazing. Michelle Rodriguez played her principal cast perfectly. She had done homework in her fighting and she looks gorgeous as always. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson played their respective roles well and their chemistry for humor doesn't cease to amaze at most of the times. Rock and Tony Jaa and other's also played their part to their maximum. But Elsa Pataky wasn't given that much to her role. She was a like a cameo appearance but it wasn't that much necessary to include in the whole movie. The graphics and stunts was nearly mind blowing except that the CGI work done for Paul is notable at some times. But, it wasn't that much drawback for the movie as he played his part well and his brother's completed the work he is done. The franchise might have losen a big cast, but it manages to keep the film to the edge of the seat climax. The tribute given by Vin Diesel for him is absolutely superb. It was very touching when he said,""It's never Goodbye"" and when they separate in cross roads, it was really amazing to give such an tribute to Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Overall, as the franchise keeps promising its Action and Adrenaline, it manages to keep it together even though they lost Paul Walker. A must see for everyone. Try it in a cinema and your money's value will be nicely spent for a good entertainment."
"patrickbennett66","10","83","96","2 April 2015"," A fitting tribute to Paul Walker
","I wasn't quite sure what to expect from the seventh installment of this successful franchise but I was totally blown away by the seamless and well choreographed fight scenes and car chases. What makes this movie stand out from its predecessors is how it goes beyond the modding of Japanese street cars to engaging the viewer with a very decent storyline that pulls together all of the previous movies. I particularly liked the use of the cut-scenes from previous films that reminded viewers of the continuity of one helluva story.<br/><br/>Of course, the other side of going to see this movie was knowing the loss of its prime star - Paul Walker - to a shocking car accident last year, and wondering how much of a role he would play in the film and how well they would work their CGI magic into his role. Needless to say, it was very well done (even though you could tell when they did use CGI of his face in a few scenes).<br/><br/>Not trying to give anything away, but the final 5 minutes was a fitting send off for Paul. I'm sure there was a few takes for the final scene on the beach.<br/><br/>Great film. 10/10 from me."
"AmyJenson1995","9","79","92","17 October 2015"," For Paul and the family
","Perhaps Furious 7 wouldn't have that Box Office success and Popularity if the sudden death of one the main protagonists, Paul Walker AKA Brian O'Conner wouldn't have gotten in the way.<br/><br/>But this is how it is. The heartbreaking death of Paul in that terrible car crash has made this movie so special to the heart of the long standing fans. The script can be so cliché and full of inconsistencies, this movie is the last film of Paul Walker and will always be.<br/><br/>But what makes me to give that high note is the ending scene and the awesome tribute the rest of the fast and furious 'familia' made to Paul. They could have gotten his character to die like we have seen so many times in the past. Instead the scriptwriters rewrote the script to make a celebration of life and family.<br/><br/>In fact, This entire saga is more about family than cars. Cars and race are just the theme and the objects attracting our attention. But the most important part of that story is the strong relationship between the characters and their interprets who are as linked in real life as they are in the movie. Each time one of their own dies they face it together as the actors are actually doing it with the loss of Paul the only REAL loss of this community. And this is what is making this beautiful."
"funkmaker","10","70","81","2 April 2015"," a nostalgic movie for the fans not for the critics .
","fast and furious series is not made to get Oscars or golden globes these movies are made for the young people to have a thrill and bang for their money.This movie has all the youth asks for Action, very little drama,hot babes in bikinis, car chases and of course the stuff getting blown up to pieces. if you are a young person between 18 to 28 you'll love it and if you young by heart you'll adore it.but if you are looking for award winning performances this wont be the movie for you so critics might not like it for having the same old chase and kill concept of action movies but youth will love it because they once more saw their favorite actors do what they do best.drive cars and then do whats unthinkable. also to add as this movie is like a tribute to the passing of Paul walker(R.I.P.)they have managed to put on the best farewell moments for him using CGI and body doubles of course and i think think movie justifies it very much.so go on watch this movie i bet you'll feel nostalgic all over again and also in the end you might end up in tears so do bring the tissues with you"
"sahilyad26","10","64","74","2 April 2015"," Best movie by far
","The Fast Furious franchise has come a far way, and this particular movie is far the best one. It is packed full of action, comedy and amazing cars. I would definitely recommend this for anyone who loves fast furious. The movie follows Tokyo Drift so it would be a good idea to watch all the movies again before watching this one. The ending is great and overall i think the director and the actors have done a great job!! Tyrese Gibson is one heck of a funny actor, Vin Diesel has done a great job in his role, So has Jordana Brester, Dwayne Johnson, Ludicrous and Jason Statham in his great role as the antagonist in the film. Tje plot of the story is great. I was hoping for another movie of ff8 but however i think it was appropriate for the team to stop here as it would be quite disrespectful to make another one without Paul Walker."
"boyznick","8","77","90","20 August 2015"," For Paul
","When Justin Lin announced he would be stepping down as the director for Furious 7 following Universal's decision to fast track the sequel before the release of Furious 6, a lot of fans like myself were wondering who could possibly replace him!? The franchise wouldn't be what we've come to know without Justin, he has been around since the Tokyo Drift (which is way too under-rated) and saved the dying franchise from being released direct to video. <br/><br/>Fast & Furious is never just about street racing but family & heist. Before you hate me, watch the first movie and Fast Five again then compare it yourself. You see the evolution of the characters and from robbing trucks with DVD players to heisting 100million. <br/><br/>Now back to Furious 7.. When they announced James Wan will be taking over the franchise, a lot of us were worried as he was most well-known for his work in horror genre, particularly SAW & Insidious. Nevertheless James has proved he is perfectly capable of big budget action movies, just look at the air drop or the Abu Dhabi sequence!<br/><br/>Spoilers ahead..<br/><br/>The film started off with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) talking to the coma-tonic Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), promising to avenge him. Just pause and think how he could have survived the fall from the plane!? If that's the case I think Gisele & Han can too.. I mean they did bring Letty back right?<br/><br/>With all the hyped built up from the post credit scene of Furious 6, I was genuinely interested to see how Deckard Shaw hunt down the team and continue where Tokyo Drift left off. Instead we were introduced another villain, Mose Jakande, played by Djimon Hounsou (which is unnecessary and dull), Shaw was pretty much cast aside as a secondary character. We never get to see the team from the hunted to the hunter as Shaw kept showing up from time to time. Other than the impressive action sequence, it didn't really add much to the overall story. Sean Boswell played by Lucas Black showed up for 1 minute or 2 talking to Dom and you would at least think he might want to avenge Han right? But no we don't see him for the rest of the film.. I guess we just have to wait for the sequel. Shaw brothers might be teaming up, you never know!<br/><br/>Furious 7 was originally intended to be the first of a new trilogy but plans were scrapped due to Paul Walker's untimely death and instead the filmmaker decided it was all about making this movie for Paul. A lot of moviegoers like myself were very emotional by the credit rolled. It felt like the end of the journey with these characters you come to love and it was the perfect send off to Walker's character, more importantly farewell to Paul himself. The crossroad scene is definitely the highlight of the film and the reason I am giving this an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Part of me wishes they end the franchise here but with the highly impressive box office number, a sequel is nothing but guarantee. . I am very curious to see where the franchise is heading without the essence of Paul Walker. It just does not seem right without one of the core family member.. What do you think?"
"Finfrosk86","8","81","95","21 September 2015"," Has its flaws, but the action is superb. Over the top, like I like it.
","For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie. <br/><br/>This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be ""realistic"" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: ""yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic""! Dumb people.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.<br/><br/>Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this ""computer chip"" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.<br/><br/>OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.<br/><br/>There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!<br/><br/>Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.<br/><br/>And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!<br/><br/>And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad."
"bob-rutzel-239-525430","9","80","94","21 September 2015"," Terrific
","Dominic Toretta (Vin Diesel) gets his Team together to take out Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is on a revenge kick blaming Dominic for his brother lying in a coma. But first, the Team must find and protect Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) a master Hacker/Programmer, who created God's Eye, a program that can locate anyone anywhere on the planet. Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), the head of Black Ops, says Ramsey must be found if Dominic wants his help with Shaw.<br/><br/>This should be watched for the stunts and CGI as both are terrific. We will see cars race down a mountain side with many trees in the way; and also see a car jump from one hi-rise building in Dubai into another hi-rise building. These stunts or CGI (who can tell anymore) will take your breath away.<br/><br/>The pacing is very good for these stunts and CGI, but when Dominic and Shaw did hand-to-hand combat it went on forever. The scene would cut away often to the Team in cars trying to avoid the helicopter intent on taking them out with missiles, then revert back to these two who were still at it. Did I mention ""still"" at it. Yes, way too long. <br/><br/>The real winners in here are, of course, the stunts and CGI because they were terrific. And mention must be made for the photography, editing and cinematography as they were spot on.<br/><br/>Notables: Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs, Michelle Rodrigues as Letty, Lucacris as Tej, Jordana Brewster as Mia, Tyrese Gibson as Roman, Lucas Black as Sean, and Ronda Rousey the Champion MMA fighter. You will see Rhonda as Kara in a white dress fighting Letty. (a cat fight?) And certainly Paul Walker (Brian) who died in a car crash (he was not driving) during the filming of Furious 7. The song ""See you Again"" that played in the movie was a tribute to Paul Walker.<br/><br/>All in all this was terrific and the action never dragged or went on for too long as scene changes helped that out a lot. This will be hard to top and there is talk of Furious 8. Ready for it? (9/10)<br/><br/>Violence: Yes. Sex: No. Nudity: Bikini and thong backsides. Language: Small stuff and not much of it."
"tomas-112-556557","10","70","82","2 April 2015"," Despite the tragic circumstances this movie is a huge fun ride.
","So last night we finally watched the latest installment of the Fast Saga:Fast and Furious 7. In September 2013 Paul Walker died during the filming of ""Fast & Furious 7″ in a car accident. To honor him the film was completed with a modified script. The result is not only a furious action blockbusters, but also a worthy memorial to this deceased star. While Walker had already shot most of his scenes to complete the film, for the remaining parts Walkers brothers Caleb and Cody had been used in some scenes with CGI and body doubles. In the end the additional work and time spend on this was very well worth it. The fact that one of the main characters was killed during the shooting of this movie won't be noticed in the film until the very appropriate sentimental end.<br/><br/>With its great charm, wit and attention to detail ""Fast & Furious 7″ is a perfected action blockbuster. The greatest strength of the film is in my opinion that it never takes itself too serious despite its sad history. If you are a moviegoers that values a sophisticated and logical plot development and a realistic representations you are wrong here. This movie got hyperbole wherever you look, but that is not a negative thing in my opinion.<br/><br/>Compared to the previous installments ""Fast & Furious 7″ tops the predecessors in all respects and goes the extra mile. You see tuned cars drop out of a plane, drivers changing cars during full speed (several times) or crashing though the window of one Abu Dhabi Skyscraper only to end up in a neighboring skyscraper again. Epic.<br/><br/>Especially the scene where the wounded agent Hobbs dismisses himself from Hospital with the words ""Daddy has to work"" by blowing up his plaster arm by flexing his biceps may soon gain cult status. In addition to the well-known stars of the previous movies, including the spin offs ""Tokyo Drift"", the cast was even expanded by by two high-calibers starring Jason Statham and Kurt Russell who present themselves in top form and as a valuable addition to the movie.<br/><br/>You can tell that for everyone involved in the movie it was a matter of the heart to put Paul Walker the worthy monument that is Fast and Furious 7. For me this latest installment is till date by far the strongest film in the series and despite the tragic circumstances a huge fun ride."
"Njkinny","8","73","86","13 August 2015"," Fast & Furious 7 ~A memorable One Last Ride!
","Fast & Furious 7 was special for me because of two reasons. First, it is the last movie of the Fast & Furious series and second, it is Paul Walker's last movie. Paul died tragically in a car accident in 2013 during the movie break, leaving a huge void in the cast and in the hearts of his fans. This movie which was still in its production stage when he died, is a tribute to this great actor as seen throughout the film with its multiple references to ""One Last Ride"" and scenes in the graveyard where actors talk of loss, goodbyes and one last adventure together. There is a sadness and a sense of loss present all through the movie which speaks volumes about the place that Paul held in the hearts of his fellow actors who not only became his friends but also brothers. The end is a heartrending adieu to the actor and had me misty eyed and wishing Paul was still alive and well.<br/><br/>Director James Wan of Insidious movie fame has taken up the director's chair in this movie and does an exceptional job of piecing it together while also managing to raise the entertainment bar. Nowhere was it evident that the movie had been cleverly edited for the scenes that were done after Paul's death. The movie entertains and excites with its superbly done stunts with flying cars and dangerous larger-than-life scenes. The acting is as usual memorable and it was great watching all our beloved characters coming to a final point in their lives.<br/><br/>This movie is beautifully stitched with The Fast & the Furious: Tokyo Drift and takes up from its ending. Jason Statham makes his presence felt in the role of a vengeful brother and his fights with Dom are memorable. Dwayne Johnson has a comparatively smaller role in this film but still is no less commanding and heroic. His catchy dialogues bring humour and the thrill of the breathtaking action to come. Ali Fazal of Fukrey fame also makes an appearance in the movie and manages to make us laugh in his very small role. All the actors complement each other and the acting flows fluidly with nowhere to show that all this is acting and not real!<br/><br/>All in all, I loved watching Fast & Furious 7 and while it was hinted several times in the movie that this may very well be the last movie of the franchise but still I hope that we will get to see another Fast & Furious movie in the future. Go watch this entertaining film which is a fitting tribute to Paul Walker.<br/><br/>This review is also available on Njkinny's World of Books & Stuff"
"bryank-04844","8","73","86","6 May 2015"," Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer.
","It's difficult to talk about 'Fast and Furious 7' or how it's billed 'Furious 7', without mentioning the tragic accident that cost actor Paul Walker his life back in November. This accident was not part of filming, but did drastically change the story line and halted production for quite a while. Walker had not finished filming his scenes, but you wouldn't know it, as the filmmakers used a combination of amazing CGI and stunt doubles to add him through the entire film. It's seamless and flawless in that aspect, and yes, there is a very moving tribute to him at the end of the film, which might cause you to choke back a few tears. I know I had too.<br/><br/>It has been 14 years since the first 'The Fast and Furious' film graced our screens, and who would have thought that it would be the powerhouse franchise it is today. The first film back in 2001 cost $38 million dollars, which is pretty cheap for a big action film. Cut to today with 'Furious 7', the budget has gone up to $250 million and has added a string of A-List actors to this high octane world, including Kurt Russell, Jason Statham, and The Rock. Whether or not you've seen any of the 'Fast and Furious' films, you're going to have a great time with 'Furious 7′. Do these films have smart dialogue or lengthy story plots? No, but that's not the reason for seeing these movies. Instead, you get a treasure trove of fast cars, big explosions, fantastic actions sequences, and fun performances by each actor. 'Furious 7′ picks up right where part 6 left off, where an over-the-top villain who seems to be able to take on armies of people with his barehands by the name of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), is after the 'Fast and Furious' team for putting his brother in a vegetable state in a previous film.<br/><br/>He has promised to kill each and every member of the team. Meanwhile, there is a security surveillance program called the 'God's Eye', which can tap into any satellite or camera and find anyone with in a matter of seconds that an underground branch of the FBI wants. This branch is run by Kurt Russell, who tells Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) to rescue the hacker who created the program (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a group of terrorists, which in turn they can find Shaw before he can kill them.<br/><br/>I know, I'm exhausted after explaining that too. 'Furious 7′ spans a few different countries and an avalanche of multi-million dollar cars that would make James Bond excited in more than one way. Director James Wan ('Saw') has perfectly concocted one of the ultimate action films that uses fast cars, big guns, excellent fight choreography, and giant explosions to keep the 132 minute film keep its super fast pace. There are a few melodramatic moments from time to time, but it's done in a good way, so that we can grow closer to the characters. If you can get through the stinky cheese one-liners throughout, which make you laugh more than anything, you're going to have an excellent time here.<br/><br/>On a side note, I'm so glad they added Thai film star Tony Jaa to this film. I've been waiting for him to show up in the US for so long, and I hope he is here to stay, because his fight choreography and talent is some of the best out there. Don't believe me? Check this clip out. 'Furious 7' keeps its laughs, charms and cameos flowing, and even though Paul Walker is gone, there is no sign of stopping this franchise, which is a good thing. Let it be said now, 'Furious 7' is the first big action film of the early summer. Go see it."
"hassancooldude","8","80","95","20 August 2015"," ""One last ride""
","One of the best action film that exists out there and definitely the best in the Furious series. With death defying stunts and terrific visuals, it is a match made in heaven for petrol-heads. From jumping cars off an aircraft to jumping between buildings in Abu Dhabi, it puts shivers down your spine! Rock pulling off his signature move to street fight between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham and yet one cannot get enough of the action. This is pure entertainment at its best. As if this wasn't enough, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end was emotional and the best thing about this film. He got a send-off that he deserved! Those last scenes cannot be emphasized enough upon. Overall it is the best action flick so far this year. <br/><br/>""Whether I'm a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, the most important people in the room are mi familia."""

"autisticreviewers","8","46","53","10 November 2015"," Autistic Reviewers opinion on this movie.
","Fast & Furious has become a huge recognizable name in action, today it stands as a huge box-office hit for distributor Universal Studios. With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized.<br/><br/>The film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.<br/><br/>James Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year.<br/><br/>Casting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'. Walker would have been deeply proud of how the film turned out in the end.<br/><br/>4/5 – Nick & Jay"

","***WARNING! This review contains spoilers, if you haven't seen this film, you might want to before reading this review!*** Now, that I have watched the highly-anticipated feature film in the Fast & Furious film saga, this seventh installment was released on April 3rd, 2015 to extremely positive reviews and eventually broke the $1 billion dollar mark in three weeks after it's April 3rd release against a over extended budget of $250 million dollars over the unexpected tragic death of Paul Walker, who died on November 30, 2013.<br/><br/>With the previous installments being set between 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this seventh Fast and Furious film, now titled just ""Furious 7"" is the first film of the series to mostly take place after the third film.<br/><br/>I'm gonna try and explain the plot in the best way that I can without making anyone sad.<br/><br/>After defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and clearing their records, Dominic Toretto, Letty Ortiz, Brian O'Conner and the rest of the crew are able to return to the United States and live normal lives again. Brian begins to deal with fatherhood, while Dominic helps Letty regain her memory. Owen's other brother, Deckard Shaw breaks into the secure hospital the comatose Owen being held in and swears vengeance against Dom. The crew goes to Han's funeral and both Shaw and Toretto prepares to fight but they don't. Hobbs and Shaw enters a fight, but Hobbs is injured and rushed to the hospital by Elena Neves.<br/><br/>This leads into the Toretto house being blown up and a man named Frank Petty informs Dom that he will help him in stopping Shaw's plan if he gets something called the God's Eye, a computer device that can track a specific person and the creator, Megan Ramsey. They go to Abu Dhabi, where they get the flash drive with the God's Eye.<br/><br/>This leads into a very, very long car chase and a final fight ensues between Dominic and Deckard in a Street Fighter-like type. Hobbs then come and shoots and kills Jakande. When Dom remains unconscious, the team fears that he is dead. As Letty cradles his body, she reveals that they are married and she has regained her memories and Dom soon regains consciousness. Later, Deckard is locked away in a CIA person and Dominic and his crew realizes that Brian is better off with his family. In the final scene, Dom and Brian drives up at a stop sign. As Dom remembers the times that he has had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drives off in separate directions.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spend all my time on this film, but this film is the best of the Fast & Furious series, along with the first film, the second film, the third, fifth and sixth film.<br/><br/>The comedy and drama is really well-thought out and director James Wan and Chris Morgan deserves a lot of credit for picking up where this film left off in the previous film. The film does not feel like it is long at all, it feels like it's an hour and a half long and at 134 minutes, some people say it is the longest, but it really isn't.<br/><br/>The action is just incredible and this movie has a lot of action. The fight between Kara and Letty is well choreographed and done carefully. The car chases are just as intense and action-packed as they are in the other films in the series. The fight between Dominic and Deckard Shaw rips off Street Fighter: The Video Game, but I like how it turns out and the way the two jumps to each other to fight with car tools is beautifully shot and pretty.<br/><br/>The music by Brian Tyler is just emotionally powerful, intense and super-cool. The acting is just incredible and powerful. Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster as Dominic Toretto, Letty Ortiz and Mia Toretto are all really great in their performances in the film. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson as Tej and Roman are just as funny and serious as they were in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast Five and the previous film, Furious 6. Jason Statham is okay as Deckard Shaw. Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs is incredible in this film. The other actor I will definitely mention is the late Paul Walker, in his final film appearance ever as Brian O'Conner, for the seventh and final time is just sad, emotional and really great and I'm really glad that his young brothers Caleb and Cody, finished his remaining scenes. The send-off they give for his character is just sad, even with the Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth original song, ""See You Again"" song playing at the end and the montage of scenes from the previous movies in the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, I love FURIOUS 7. It can get sad at the end, but I still love the heck out of this movie and I have no problem seeing the next film, but I am sad that this is Paul Walker's last film appearance and really great performances and it is a well done film.<br/><br/>I'm giving it an 10 out of 10."
"jovillgruspe","9","49","57","8 October 2015"," Furious 7 - to tie it all
","Furious Seven (aka The Fast and Furious 7), directed by James Wan, was a roller coaster of emotions for many viewers. Continuing from the storyline after the events of The Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and Fast & Furious 6, Dominic Toretto investigates the murder of his long-time friend Han. Han was a previous member of the Fast & Furious crew in the past few installments. Following the investigation, Toretto discovers that Deckard Shaw is targeting Dom and his crew. Deckard, played by Jason Statham, is seeking revenge for the condition of his brother Owen Shaw. Once again, Dom gathers the remaining members of his team (Brian, Tej, Roman and Letty) to take down Deckard. Throughout the movie, Deckard seems to always be a few steps ahead of Dom, interrupting the crew's plans to capture Deckard. Toretto encounters Mr. Nobody, a government official, and discusses with him the possibility of catching Deckard. Mr. Nobody is in a struggle with Somalian terrorist Jakonde to obtain the powerful computer program ""God's Eye"". Mr. Nobody asks for the help of Toretto and his team to steal the computer program, and in return, he will allow Toretto to use the program to locate Deckard. With action packed car chases and thrilling flight moments, it's a race of time for Dom and Deckard to have their final face-off and prove which of the two would come out of their fight alive. <br/><br/>The Fast & Furious franchise was originally known for its modified cars, street racing, and crime induced thrills from its first movie. Justin Lin, director for the Fast & Furious installments 2-6, focused on modern cars that take ""fast"" to the next level. James Wan, the new director for the 7th installment of the franchise, proceeded to take the series into a more action driven direction. A few notable death-defying moments in Furious 7 were creatively written to add more thrill to the film. In the beginning of the movie, Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson, jumped out of a police building seconds before Deckard threw a grenade at him. When Toretto and his team needed to ambush Jakande undetected, they decided to skydive in their cars to Jakande's location. The most memorable scene for me was when Toretto and Brian drove off Abu Dhabi's Etihad Towers in a Lykan Hypersport car. The cinematography of the beautiful sunset and glossy towers while the car was in slow motion midair was breathtaking. It really showed the extravagance and majesty of Abu Dhabi. With the movie's thrilling car flying scenes and intense fight or flight moments, James Wan successfully keeps us at the edge of our seats. <br/><br/>The movie ties up all the previous installments to lead the plot into one intertwined direction. When looking at the time line of the story in each installment, the movies follow the plot starting from the 1st movie, to the 2nd, 4th, and then the 5th. Afterwards, the storyline moves on to the 3rd & 6th simultaneously. From the storyline of its 3rd and 6th installments, Furious 7 connects the time line and adds elements found from the previous movies. A scene in Furious 7 involved Toretto's team in a high speed chase that allowed one of the cars to slip right under a moving truck, which is an element found in the first movie. In Furious 7, another scene depicts one of the Toretto members driving backwards to rescue the programmer of the God's Eye. A similar circumstance is found in the 2nd installment when Brian drove his car backwards to rescue Roman. It was very clever of Wan to embed elements like these from prior movies. The decision to include these creative elements conveys the connection that bridges the franchise under Justin Lin to this ""new"" and developing franchise under James Wan. <br/><br/>In every Fast & Furious movie, Toretto emphasizes his focus on family. Family is the number one thing he protects and risks his entire life for. However, in Furious 7, it is presented in a different but more elaborate way. In the 7th installment, the theme of family transforms into closure for Han, Letty, and Brian. Han's death was a terrible loss for the Toretto family, and Toretto's answer for his death was revenge. After discovering that Han's death wasn't an accident, Toretto set out to settle the score with Deckard Shaw who murdered him. Letty's closure dealt with getting her memory back, as she was diagnosed with amnesia from her incident in the previous movie. Toretto needed his number one support system during the movie and was greatly concerned over Letty's stability. He struggled with Letty's condition because he couldn't let go of their history. When Letty got her memory back, Toretto and Letty got married, which solidified Toretto's family values. Brian was the biggest loss to not only the Toretto family, but to the Fast & Furious franchise as well. The writers and director were able to adapt to the sudden and unfortunate loss of a main cast member of the movie. Paul Walker, who played Brian O' Conner, was unfortunately involved in a fatal car accident shortly before the completion of the film. The director did a wonderful job of casting Walker's brothers Caleb and Cody to complete Brian's plot line. As a tribute to Walker, the movie ended with Toretto parting ways with Brian. The ending suggests that Brian settles down with his family. Many people may not agree with the transition on the focus of the movie. Moving from high-speed car races loaded with modifications and cleverly planned heists to high action packed scenes and impossible death-defying dangerous escapes, the Fast & Furious series is evolving into a typical genre we can find in many action movies today."
"Kodymovietalk","8","68","81","3 April 2015"," A great fun action adventure!
","Furious 7 is a great addition to the Fast and the Furious series! It has all the great action and humor from the previous movies, but also has more character development and heart. The movie of course has its over the top scenes and cheesy dialog, but that is easily forgotten with the amount of fun you have with this movie. The cinematography is also much better in this movie, thanks to the new director James Wan. James wan gives you all the great moments from the last movies, but steps it up. The movie also handles Paul Walkers death in great way. He also has a tribute at the end of the movie. Furious 7 is an amazing time at the cinemas!"
"thaole-69235","9","52","61","8 October 2015"," Awesome movie
","Fast and Furious is a series of action films by James Wan; it is one of the best American franchises which centers on heists, crimes and illegal street racing. The film was established in 2001 with the title The Fast and The Furious, and the last film of the series called Furious Seven just came out at the beginning of this year. This movie is definitely one my favorites so far this year because of it's fascinating scenes, interesting story and great characters.<br/><br/>The movie Furious Seven took place after Dominic Toretto and Brian O'Connor and the rest of their team defeated and hospitalized Owen Shaw. Dominic and his team decided to come back to the United States to live a normal life with their family. Shortly after the death of Owen Shaw, his older brother, Deckard Shaw was seeking revenge against Toretto and his team. After Deckard Shaw killed Dominic's close friend Han, one of the main characters in the previous series, Toretto and O'Connor gathered the team and were on the hunt for Deckard Shaw. The team also got helped from a secretive government agency after they had freed a kidnapped computer hacker, who had created a device that can help them capture Shaw. Deckard Shaw was the antagonist in the movie, and Dominic Toretto was the leader of their group. All the orders were given from Toretto. He and his team now put it all in the line for one last ride. They decided to return to their hometown, Los Angeles, to fight Deckard Shaw. After all, justice always win. Shaw was taken into custody and locked away in a high-security prison, and Toretto, Brian and the team could finally be off retired with their family.<br/><br/>James Wan, director of the movie did a really good job on connecting all the circumstances which made the film more interesting. All the actors in the movie had different roles that they portrayed. For example Dominic Toretto was the leader of the team, so he always has a stern deep voice and a tough exterior that a leader would. The film took place in many locations like Los Angeles, Tokyo, and India. The outfits that they characters had worn were not flashy. It was standard clothing that an average person would wear. The effects in the movie were very precise. Nothing seemed to have many computerized effects to it. The angels were shot in all directions where the audience was able to see all of the action that was taking place. Also the angles were all being shot to where the cars are being shown in all directions. The sound effects in the movie were accurate, the sound of the cars were exactly how you would hear it if it passed by on the street. Using real authentic sounds for their vehicles and weapons made the movie come to life.<br/><br/>The movie ended with a wonderful tribute to Paul Walker, played as Brian who died in a car accident in the middle of filming the movie. This is one of the emotional moments that got so many tears from the fans of both the series and the actor."
"spankmeamadeus","10","63","75","2 April 2015"," Suitable farewell
","I went expecting big things from this movie, and unsurprisingly I was not surprised. This movie was everything that I was expecting. From cars, to guns, to strong female characters (I.E the beautiful and talented Michele Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey, amongst many others.) The guys were also great, with. Vin diesel, djimon Honsou and Jason statham (all actors I have liked watching in other films they have done.) Dwayne Johnson pulling out the big guns. I really would recommend this movie and I did appreciate the farewell they gave 'the late' Paul walker at the end of the film. I do think that he will be missed by so many who have watched his films. R.I.P Mr walker. Hoping their might be something else this great group of actors can do together in the future."
"alonzo_starz","10","62","74","2 April 2015"," A must watch for Jason fans
","Well... well.. well..... Let's see Everyone knows how traumatic it was to lose an actor and a person like Paul Walker. Specially for the Fast & Furious team. It cannot be described in words or any other means. However the way this film has paid a tribute to him is something which every actor wants living or dead. Movie is simply awesome and there is no question about it. The reason simply being it was not complete when Paul was taken away from us and the story writer and director must have been in terrible agony then. But the way everything has been put together not a single soul can believe what they just saw after watching this movie. However I was reading comments and reviews from other users and I find it sad to see that people don't give importance to little but important things in a movie. For instance I was shocked to see Tony Jaa in this movie. There is a full on action sequence where he is literally making an Ong Bak 4 out of this movie but people didn't find time to write about him. I think he was simply awesome. The best thing about this movie is Jason who is simply a Pit Bull from UK, a live time bomb, the transporter who can transport you to hell in no time and a very dangerous Killer elite in one... So my recommendation to people would be, pay a tribute to Paul, go and watch this movie.... For Paul"

It's totally unbelievable how a car chasing movie like Fast & Furious could lead to a mind blowing actions movie, & it gets better from scene to scene. <br/><br/>What a good way to end & remember Paul.

","When you watch a movie you must know the type of the movie like the Fast and Furious franshine that its all about cars and stunts and action , I am a huge fan of the franshine since Fast Five and its keep growing bigger and bigger for example they destroy 200 cars for a bank vault in Fast Five then in Furious 6 they got a Tank then what they want to do something bigger !they drop a real cars with parachutes !!! This is why i love this franshine because the amazing stunts ... Furious 7 like the previous two the story is stupid and over the top but the stunts are amazing and they destroy 230 cars for the movie like Maserate 2014 and Aston Martin Db9 2008 and Nissan Gtr 2012 and Lykan Hypersport 2014 and many many cars ... and the beginning of the movie is solid when Jason Statham (Deckard shaw) is talking to his brother Owen shaw after he kills the black ops guys and destroy the hospital and the soundtrack (Payback) was amazing And the first chase sequences between Dom and Deckard it was amazing and end with a huge collision then Mr.nobody come and save Dom and he wanted him for a mission to a bring Ramsay The Hacker because she created a device that find anybody in the world and to find shaw .at this point the story become a rescue mission than a revenge plot ... and the mountain scenes is the best in the movie because great stunts and cameras work and they destroy 50 cars for that scenes ... and in Abu Dahbi we saw The Lykan Hypersport jumping between two towers and it was fantastic... and we saw another chase sequences Between Dom and Deckard this time Dom with his iconic muscle car the Beast Dodge Charger 1970 and Shaw with the British car Aston Martin Db9 2008 and end with a collision but this time the Charger win ... at the end Deckard Shaw goes to secured prison and of curse he will back in Furious 8. and despite his short time in the movie. Jason Statham was a Badass Villain and i hope he gets more time in Furious 8... And of curse we don't forget Tony jaa he was amazing in his tow fight scence with Paul walker but unfortunately he die. and Ronda Rousy also her fight scence with Letty was greet ... and the final tribute for Paul walker was amazing and emotional and the Wiz khalifa song see you again make you cry and forgot the movie , and we saw a final ride between Dom charger and Paul walker real car Toyota Supra ... So for me Furious 7 is the best one in series i know it over the top but the Cars and Stunts and Action is the best in while....."

","If you are expecting this movie to be realistic and logic, then you are making a huge mistake. Put it in your mind set that these peoples are video game characters/anime/superheroes and everything will start to make sense.<br/><br/>I was somehow thought that this movie is going to concentrates more about Han's death and there's some interesting plot that leads to the event. But nope, thats not how it went as it pretty straight forward action movie with no surprising plot and twist.<br/><br/>For the action, I could not imagine what would they brought after those tanks in the 6th movie. And I was not disappointed, free fall cars, tower to tower car jumping and the regeneration power of Dominic Toretto! Talking about the crazy stuff in the movie, how the heck Dom is not dead after he drives his car off the cliff? In every movie I see people is sure to die unless the get out of the car somehow. How the heck a Somalian terrorist get a military grade helicopter and a jet powered Predator drone? And how the hell a 23 years old hacker girl can just develops the God's Eye thats are so powerful that CIA become absolute? <br/><br/>Seriously guys, you need to abandon the world's logic and watch this movie as if you are watching The Avengers: Age Of Ultron. Expecting this movie to be realistic and logic is a great mistake.<br/><br/>As for the send off scene for Paul Walker, its truly an emotional moments in the movie. For the people who is not a fan to this movie or doesn't even know who Paul Walker is then they probably doesn't get it whats going on here. But for me, I barely holding my tears as I watch it. What a long journey it is~ <br/><br/>For Paul"
"bennystepho","8","72","87","12 April 2015"," A great send off for Paul
","I saw this movie a couple of days after it had been released. I have noticed over the years the Fast and Furious franchise has become more about the action scenes (especially Fast and Furious 6) than the actual cars and street races of the original Fast and Furious films which many of us love. Furious 7 creates a great balance of stunts and action whilst also focusing on the cars and the driving skills of the characters. I feel James Wan and the writers made the correct decision in not killing off Paul's character even though the plot had to be changed because of his unfortunate passing. The acting was up to it's usual good standard as in all of the movies. Great film 9/10. RIP Paul Walker"
"p-jonsson","9","71","86","23 August 2015"," Explosions, fast cars, fighting, more explosions...I liked it!
","This is one of those movies where the French decided on an English name but for some inexplicable reason the original English name was not good enough for them. So in France it is called Fast & Furious 7 but I believe it is called Furious Seven in the US. Typical French way of doing things I am afraid.<br/><br/>This movie is probably not for everyone. It is very typical for the latest Fast & Furious movies though. The movie can be summed up by explosions, fast cars, fighting, did I mention explosions, repeat until credits roll. For me it was just what I expected and just what I wanted from this particular movie as well. If you are into fast cars, lots of action and explosive special effects and a bit of male macho talk then this movie will please you just fine.<br/><br/>The gang is back. I have to confess that I like both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson even though they are rather far from Shakespeare material as far as acting goes. For this kind of movie they are perfect though. Unfortunately Dwayne Johnson was absent for a good chunk of the movie. When he came back from his brief presence in the beginning of the movie he did so with a vengeance though. I was actually expecting to dislike ""Mr Nobody"" but I have to say that I quite liked him.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that this is a macho action movie there is at least a small kernel of story in there. It is a classical revenge story but it is embellished with enough material to make it fairly decent. Well, decent within the confines of this kind of movie of course. Seen from a reasonable point of view the entire movie is of course totally ludicrous. The stunts are really cool but if you sober up from the adrenaline feast you rather quickly find a lot of the stunts pretty far out. Like jumping between buildings in fancy cars and such like. Even if we skip the most ridiculous scenes there are plenty more to nit-pick about. Like the fact that those old, but cool, American cars that Torretto drives would not have a chance in hell against his more modern adversaries unless possibly if the road was entirely straight. But then, these ridiculous things are what the fast and furious series is all about is it not? Well, after about two hours of ludicrous, but very entertaining, actions stunts there is a happy ending and when the credits roll this viewer is definitely a happy customer."
"Bmiceter","10","71","86","6 April 2015"," One Last Ride!!
","This was sold as One Last Ride. And it felt just like that. Throughout the film, you get the feeling that this is the finale for this incredible franchise.<br/><br/>It paid incredible homage to the previous installments. From characters, to story lines, everything seemed to come full circle. Even some of the sequences made you flash back to when you first saw something identical or similar years ago.<br/><br/>It reminded us of why we love every character tied to this franchise, present and past.<br/><br/>As someone who quite literally grew up with these movies, I feel like I have closure. I don't need another one. I've watched every Fast and Furious movie dozens of times each, hundreds total. I used to looks forward and impatiently wait for the next movie. With this one, that urge is gone. The journey feels complete. It was our last ride.<br/><br/>Faced with the huge challenge of finishing this movie without Paul, I think everyone involved with this movie made all of the right moves, all the way up to the very end. It did Paul Walker justice."

","I had to admit that this was the best movie in the Fast & Furious franchise. James Wan had done a terrific direction and the cast were just a perfect team. The movie was the final movie of late Paul Walker and I am happy to see his last movie which is fantastic. After the success of The Conjuring, Director James Wan has not let me down with the movie. The stunts were fantastic, the views were amazing and acting was above all. The movie is a great tribute to Paul Walker. Apart from regular characters, Jason Statham who played the villanious role of Deckard Shaw did justice with his role. The movie was overall a brilliant one under great direction. This is a must watch for every action movie lovers. This is the best movie I have seen so far in 2015. I go with 10/10 for this fantastic and stunning action movie."

","I thought that it was actually a really good movie. I don't mean that I don't like the other movies, I just think that it's hard to get this movies as good as the first 6. I thought the editing crew did a really good job at taking scenes from the other movies to make it seem like Paul was there the whole time. The part of Ramsey was really good, she worked well with the other actors especially Vin. The song choices were really good and they went along with the movie really well. The plot twits were really good for me because I love movies that you can't tell what's going to happen. Such as Dom being married to Letty the whole time. I don't know if anybody was expecting that but I wasn't at all. In conclusion I like the movie and it would have to be one of my favorites out of the seven."

","Fast & Furious has become a huge recognizable name in action, today it stands as a huge box-office hit for distributor Universal Studios. With this anticipated seventh installment, they have pulled out the big guns on action, fun and surprisingly emotion as the series reaches new heights and its trademarks that make it recognized. <br/><br/>The film lifts off where the previous 6th outing left, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) and crew are home in America having securing their amnesties and living their lives in peace with loved ones: with Toretto still helping his love Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) regain her memories and O'Connor adjusting to fatherhood to his growing son. But this peace will be shattered when one of their own is killed by the target cross-eye of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is avenging his brother's demise.<br/><br/>James Wan may be known for his contributions to horror-thriller genre (Insidious, The Conjuring, Saw and Death Sentence) but his direction and view of an action genre film is indeed an strong impression that left me and audiences in excitement. Wan proves that action is driven on speed, choreography and style and this makes F&F7 a worthy example of this. The action sequences are all big, loud and pack plenty of eye candy for action fans; from a rescue mission on a moving bus, building jumping, shootouts, fistfights and an explosive climax that takes place in an urban city. Practical stunts, assisting CGI and well-choreographed eye on detail make F&F7 worthy contender for visual effects and stunt awards in the coming year.<br/><br/>Casting as always is close and fun in the F&F series, with Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Gibson, Bridges, Brewster and Johnson sharing the leading formula that makes their characters seem so likable, with Johnson, Russell, Hounsou, Emmanuel and Statham proving great supporting roles. But sadly here it is final acting appearance of the late Paul Walker (who had died in an unexpected event) which left the film in a stand-still and its cast and fans worldwide in deep sadness. The film was delayed for a year and a half but the result was something that would touch not only the audience but its crew and cast. The final scene indeed left people crying in the theater but it was a touching and emotionally connected moment that hasn't been seen in film in some years, it made me feel both sad and touched and feeling that the F&F series had ended perfectly as it won't be the same without Walker.<br/><br/>Pros: + Exciting action sequences that overthrow the over-the-top action seen in the previous installment. Fast cars, mega destruction, brutal fistfights and big guns make it seem an action lover's wet dream<br/><br/>+ Improvement on plot, using the trademark franchise style that has overtaken since the 4th installment) and this story line is need more exciting and entertaining than any of the previous films<br/><br/>+ The final tribute to Paul Walker was touching, moving and something that makes the series end on a beautiful note<br/><br/>OVERALL: Fast & Furious 7 is not only a fast driven action ride but in terms of quality, production value and emotion it proves to be the best of the series and one of this year's best films to have seen. It's only a thought now to see how Mad Max: Fury Road (releasing on May 14th 2015) will overthrow the action and car stunts that F&F7 has established a strong impression among audiences, but regardless this film will indeed be on your to 'see list'.

","The summer blockbuster season is just beginning and (for me) there could be no better film to kick it off with. From a franchise that seems perfectly suited for the 'popcorn movie' months ""Furious 7"" delivers all the fun, massively scoped action and excessive chaos that you could expect from two movies. The cast returns in what will be the last film for the late Paul Walker and as posthumous film appearances go, this was by far the most over-the-top and outrageously memorable send offs an actor could close with.<br/><br/>The story-line is absurd and for the most part makes no logical sense throughout, but if you haven't learned by now to expect the monumental amounts of ridiculousness from this film franchise then you must have been in a coma for the last ten-years. Entering its seventh entry in the series, the 'Fast and Furious' franchise have done just about all you could think of as far as what a car can do in a stunt-sequence, yet as another film hits cinemas you can only sit back and enjoy the catastrophe and high-adrenaline action that only surpasses its predecessor.<br/><br/>Yes the dialogue is what you could expect but regardless of its cheese-factor there are is enough bulk of a story-line to serve as a buffet for repeated eye-popping sequences with cars taking out helicopters, dropping from planes, launching out of massive skyscrapers and oh yeah, they still manage to add some great chase- sequences as well. This was something that was nice to see re- implemented in a franchise that seemed to forget where it started in the more recent films. <br/><br/>Usually by this time in a franchise, entering its seventh installment, you could expect to feel the monotonous repetition of a possible stalling out. The ""Fast and Furious"" series only seems to be growing from each film and not only continuing to try and find creative ways to enthrall crowds with edge of your seat adventure, but manages to outdo itself with each new title. I am sure this film was much more hyped by the passing of Paul Walker last year and rightfully so, but even if he were still around this would have been a hugely popular movie among a massive target demographic and still held its solid blockbuster factor.<br/><br/>The family moniker this film carries is enhanced with all the cast returning, as well as cameos from some of the fallen characters from the last film. The Dom/Lety triangle continues to evolve and even delivers a nice little Easter-egg during the perfect weekend for it as we learn more about what actually happened in the events of the past couple films between them. Paul Walkers role of family man is expanded and helps create a very respectful and fitting way to send his character off into the sunset with class and a homage to what he has done for this franchise. <br/><br/>Jason Statham was a solid villain for this film but other than his fight scenes and routinely popping up conveniently all over the world, he still felt forgotten in the extremely busy script that pulls you from Los Angeles, to Tokyo to the Dominican Republic and Abu Dhabi. With Luke Evans from the last film getting more layers to his characters, despite the lack of physical prowess, was still the more entertaining villain simple from the conception of his character in the script. <br/><br/>Djimon Hounsou was literally useless to the story-line and his addition only cluttered the already busy casting line-up. Kurt Russell was great and with his few moments in the film he was able to fit in with the younger characters with ease and effortlessly delivered his suave and intimidating 'Russellness' to the point I would have liked to have seen more of him.<br/><br/>Statham's scenes with Diesel & Johnson were as visceral and rage filled as you could hope and Statham continues to show why he is the best in Hollywood regardless of being smaller then the men he is sized up against. Walker also had some very good scenes with Tony Jaa and the two showed great chemistry and worked to make some very impactful fight scenes that were good enough to say they slightly bettered those of Statham/Johnson/Diesel.<br/><br/>While there were some good moments of hand-to-hand combat with some nice shots, the overall cinematography had its issues. The camera- work tried to pull the most out of the choreography putting you the viewer in the right spots at the right time without over- editing. But the tumble technique was highly over used. The camera spinning with the actors and even rolling to pull you into the action was over done. It was clearly noticeable in the Tony Jaa scenes where at times it was as if the camera couldn't keep up with the speed of Jaa while still trying to stick to the predetermined techniques. <br/><br/>This film definitely didn't let just the guys have fun either. Michelle Rodriguez and Rhonda Rousey delivered a great fight scene as well. Both dressed in fine attire tearing room up they showed everyone that females can make up an excellent fight scene as well much like the Rodriguez/Carano subway fight from the prior film. <br/><br/>Overall this one had a little bit of everything. From start to finish this film never stops or even (pardon the pun) tries to pull its foot off the gas. People will always laugh at movies like these but just as a Holiday biopic tailored for an Oscar nod, films like this have their place in cinema as well and the massive amounts of money they generate help fund many of those future projects."

","The movie Fast and Furious 7 is an amazing action filled movie! This movie illustrates how much family is valued and what family actually means. Fast and Furious 7 demonstrates that family isn't just blood; family is who sticks by your side. The way the director James Wan and the editing crew Leigh Folsom Boyd, Dylan Highsmith, Kirk Morri, Christian Wagner, they made it so Paul Walker's brother Cody played his part,and they digitally put Paul's face over Cody's, to make it seem like Paul Walker was still in the movie. If you have seen the first six Fast and Furious movies, I would highly suggest you see this one, but be ready, you will need some tissues at the end! <br/><br/>The cast of Fast and Furious 7 said that it was from Walker and Fast and Furious 8 is for (Paul). This movie portrayed how much their lives have changed over the years. <br/><br/>I went with my family to see this movie and I would recommend it to any family who loves action, or has seen the previous six movies. This movie will not disappoint you! It will make you want to watch the next one and see what happens next! It will leave you filled with suspense and will make you value family more. <br/><br/>The end of the movie will bring you to tears, as Vin Diesel says to Paul ""I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers - because you did too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or halfway across the world, you'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother.""<br/><br/>If action-filled movies are what you enjoy, I highly suggest this movie! This movie will have you on the edge of your seat with excitement, fear, sadness all packed into two hours. You will be left in suspense and will be valuing family a whole lot more. This movie earns five stars in my books."

","I rate this movie 9 on a scale of 1 to 10. I think the word would be 'The Awesomest' part of the Fast & Furious series. Great work by all the stars. No doubt, this movie is a tribute to my favorite Paul Walker. Toretto asked him for one last ride and see it became his last. The action part in the movie, specially the stunts were just out of the world. I don't have words to explain how fast my heart was beating when i saw Paul jumping over the cliff to grab the car. I was just damned to see it.. and I was like 'how the hell did he do this'. Hats off to you Brian. One thing which made us Indians proud too was the casting of Ali Fazal in such a big movie. He was also very good in his role. All the stars did their parts very well. And I just love this dialog... I don't have friends, I got family. What an attitude u have Dom... just be like it always. At last, we do know that we will not be seeing Paul in the next sequel... it's kind of disappointing but he will always be in our hearts. Hell Yeah..!!!!"

"thomas-w15","9","76","94","21 April 2015"," Paul Walker would be proud!
","Furious 7: Without a doubt, this is the biggest fast and furious movie to date. Everything is bigger. The action scenes are bigger, the car scenes are even faster, and of course, ""The Rock"" is bigger. Furious 7 was already highly anticipated, and then tragedy struck, Paul Walker was killed in a car crash when filming. He will always be sorely missed and no one can ever take his place. Even though some of the dialogue and action might be a little cheesy, with great action and car sequences, Paul Walker got the send off he deserved in the series he dedicated his life to.<br/><br/>What I mean by cheesy dialogue is primarily applied to ""The Rock's"" lines in the movie. He still has a supporting role but it is not nearly as big as his role in the previous two films. To put it simply, his entire dialogue is a series of one-liners to show how big of a badass he is if for some reason you can't already tell. It is amusing still, but it gets slightly irritating after a while. Once he takes out a few helicopters single handedly, you forget those lines and just laugh and love the enormous action taking place. The trailer also clearly shows Jason Stathom who plays Deckard Shaw in this installment as the main villain, but he really is only sprinkled throughout the plot. He never really gets the same screen time Luke Evans, who played Owen Shaw, in the previous installment got. Nevertheless, in the screen time he gets, he acts like the ultimate badass that he is and we can't ask for anything more.<br/><br/>The action and car scenes speak for themselves. In some of the tallest buildings in the world, we see Vin Diesel and Paul Walker practically fly a car straight through three of them and you can't ask for more than that. Sure, it might be outlandishly crazy but everyone should know walking into this movie that it is a hardcore action-car film, not an art film. The fight scenes are also pretty well done. Seeing Vin Diesel and Jason Statham going in a slow-mo glorifying fight to the end shot is incredibly funny and widely entertaining at the same time. <br/><br/>The acting is what we have come to expect from each cast member. They all own their roles. They are their characters at this point. Sure, some may not consider it ""real"" acting but the actors did their part for the movie and you can't ask for anything more. Also, as I said earlier, Paul Walker's send off really was tremendous and many of the audience members might actually find themselves tearing up towards the end as we all listen to the song ""See You Again,"" which I think might be nominated for an Oscar for best original song. <br/><br/>If you just want pure-thrilling entertainment with some laughs thrown in here and there, you should definitely see Furious 7. Since this is a movie where it is a hundred times better on the big screen, I recommend you see Furious 7 in theaters. <br/><br/>For more of my reviews, go to my website at reviewsbywest.com"

","Wonderful. I got to see one of the advanced screenings and it was everything you have come to expect from the franchise. I don't know if this is exactly a spoiler per se, but just in case I'm marking it as one! <br/><br/>(spoiler spoiler! Describing the tone at the end!)<br/><br/>What I didn't expect was what a touching and sentimental tribute to Paul Walker it would be. Everyone, including the very burly macho dudes sitting near me, were in tears at the end. Half the audience was sobbing. The only reason I gave it a 9/10 is because it was emotionally exhausting! I think the ending to the previous movie was a lot more exciting and got your blood pumping, whereas this ending required the entire credits sequence for the theater to put themselves back together again. We were all a bunch of superfans, so we were probably more attached to Paul than the average movie-goer, so your experience may be less overwrought with emotions."
"jamesgair","7","70","87","9 August 2015"," Fast and Furious 7 is the latest fast and furious movie
","The Fast and the Furious series consist of 7 movies soon to be 8, starring The Rock-Dwayne Johnson in the last 3 movies, Vin Diesel- The voice of Groot in Guardians of the Galaxy, and the late Paul Walker who has been in many action movies, along with Gal Gadot who is set to play Wonder Woman in the line of DC comics movies unfortunately Gal Gadot's character Chazelle died in Fast and Furious 6 , Michelle Rodriguez, Tyreese Gibson from Transformers, Ludicrous is a musician as well as an actor, Jordana Brewster and the antagonist is Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham who has been in one million and one action movies. For those who have seen Fast and Furious 6 the perpetrator of those events is Owen Shaw played by Luke Evans who is in Immortals, The Hobbit the Desolation of Smaug, The Battle of the Armies, Deckard is Owen's older brother out for revenge, because Dominic Torreto's (Vin Diesel) team put Owen in the hospital. Fast and Furious 7 is packed full of action stunts that are bigger than the last movie, that take you to multiple countries all around the world, America, Abu Dhabi, Canada and multiple locations in USA. After Deckard Shaw is placed in solitary confinement in one of the most secure facilities, the team are on a beach with all their new cars lined up behind them, because of Paul Walker's death, the makers of the movie changed the ending. Dominic knows Brian O Conner (Paul Walker) doesn't belong with him anymore because he has a wife, one child and another on the way. Dominic drives off and leaves Brian behind, you see him in his car driving off into the distance when Brian now played by Paul's brother Cody Walker and some added effects, Brian says ""You thought you could leave without saying goodbye"". Dom smiles then they go their separate ways when the road forks. This ending wasn't just about Dom saying goodbye to Brian, it was about Vin saying goodbye to Paul, then the credits open with ' See you again' by Charlie Puth and Wiz Kalihifa, this song is a tribute to Paul Walker."
"tarrynaubrey","8","70","87","25 April 2015"," An Incredible Achievement, Intensely emotional and Action-Packed.
","Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time, home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess that because these films taught the significance of family and substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker."
"nadeyn","9","73","91","11 July 2015"," A suitable farewell to Paul from his LA familia
","I don't review many titles on IMDb. They need to touch me somehow before I bother.<br/><br/>Paul Walker. I remember his interview when the first F and F one was released and he wasn't much of a Hollywood namesake before then. I loved him instantaneously in that interview. There was something that reminded me of my brother in the eyes. Oddly both he and my brother were twisted in fate somehow, for they both were loving individuals who died doing something they loved, at similar ages, leaving loved ones behind. Paul succeeded my brother by 6 years so the blow was difficult when he passed, and was more raw when he died in a similar circumstance. <br/><br/>I followed Vin from his early days on FB, long before pages were creates and friends with stars were made. He always touched me with his love of life, and his respect for his colleagues, starring roles or not, and believed his deep love for Paul.<br/><br/>I avoided this movie like the plague. I knew it would burn deep, and it dd, with a rawness I didn't want to feel. It was a fitting farewell, reuniting many of the original cast. The final scene was a moving one, for although it was ambiguous to the storyline, we all knew that Paul was not to return for another, and the words spoken by Vin Diesel were so deeply moving you knew they were not only for the Brian, they were for Paul too. <br/><br/>Tears, accolades, and a touching farewell to Paul Walker. May you linger over a long lunch with my brother up there, and share your love of all things fast and furious, for you were both too fast and furious for this world."
"kunalkhandwala","9","73","91","21 April 2015"," A thrilling ride, definitely not the last one
","The speedy band of outlaws have surfaced unscathed from impossible missions around the world with varying motives behind each outing. While financial security and independence drove them through streets of Brazil in 'Fast Five', the desperate need to secure amnesty sent them flying across the highways of Spain in '6'. But this time, things get more personal. For the villain, it's all about retribution and for Dominic Torreto, it's about keeping the familia safe together. For a franchise that set a disclaimer long ago to leave brains behind in lieu of horsepowers, it does pretty well to align the stories through 7 movies and yet keep the team intact for the most part. Dom's position as the alpha hasn't been more at the forefront than it is now. ""This time it ain't just about being fast"". 'Furious 7' promises bigger, better action as muscles of both cars and humans collide to cause destruction. James Wan ('Saw', 'Insidious', 'Conjuring') is serious about taking crazy to a whole new level when it comes to the action. <br/><br/>After looking at the plight of his incarcerated brother Owen, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) swears to avenge him by taking down Dominic and his team. During an information extracting break-in at Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) office, Shaw confronts the DSS agent and sends him flying out of the window straight to a hospital bed. Then, Shaw calls Dom from Japan, just as he has killed Han and threatens to take him down next. An explosion rips apart the Torreto house, with Mia (Jordana Brewster), Brian (Paul Walker) and Dom narrowly escaping. After learning from Hobbs about how deadly Shaw can be, Dom retrieves Han's body from Japan to perform his funeral back home. A suspicious looking car draws Dom's attention who chases it, leading to a head on collision between the two. At this point, Frank Petty and his covert ops team arrive and assure Dom that it would be easy for them to hand over Shaw to him anytime. However, Dom would have to perform a mission impossible for the US Government. It involved extracting a hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from the convoy of Mercenary Jackande by air-dropping onto a restricted highway in the Caucasus mountains. This bit of action is the highlight of the film. <br/><br/>Ramsey created a computer program called God's eye that can use every digital device to track people anywhere. The flash drive containing the program has been sold to a Jordanian Prince in Abu Dhabi who has it hidden in his Lykan hypersport supercar. What follows is something you should only watch on the big screen with popcorn. With God's eye then falling into Jackande's hands again, the finale takes us back to home turf with some exemplary stunts, some raw action between Shaw and Dom and God's eye chasing Ramsey in cars that zip through LA's streets. All this mayhem however, ends with the film's most important subject that must've been the hardest for the film-makers to deal with. The manner in which they brought closure to Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner is heart- warming, elegant and fitting as it says a passive yet emphatic goodbye to one of the familia. Wiz Khalifa's tribute is already a chartbuster and the sequence with montages from previous films honors the legacy of Walker.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel may not have the acting skills that would enable him to be anyone but Dominic Torreto effectively. But with so many successful films in one franchise, he may not need the alternatives. He is truly the alpha of this series and here, he proves it yet again in the fight sequences with Statham. As bad-ass as he can be, he's still very affable when he stands by his values for his family. In the last ride sequence, it shows that he genuinely lost a brother. Dwayne Johnson has a brief role but when he's on, he is on! Michelle Rodriguez really takes the alpha role seriously too especially with her fight sequences in the Etihad towers. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous are hilarious together while Jason Statham is well, Jason Statham. <br/><br/>But the finest performance has been delivered by WETA digital (yet again), in the motion capture and re-imaging of Paul Walker's prior appearances onto his brothers who acted as body-doubles. The transition is so remarkable that it's virtually impossible to point out the digitalized scenes containing WETA's Walker. Technology has advanced way beyond the CGI in the car chases and action sequences that make up the rest of the film and 'Furious 7' has one of its finest accomplishments. <br/><br/>The entire sequence in Azerbaijan is thrilling and gutsy. From Dom's escape down the hill to the on-the-edge bus scene that has us gazing at the screen in disbelief. Abu Dhabi's flying car scene is ridiculous but nevertheless, exciting because they push those limits too. Finally, the stunts and explosions in LA are no doubt, innovative. The film-makers claim to have used real stunts in most of the action sequences and minimized the role of CGI which is commendable, given the grand scale of destruction and mayhem. <br/><br/>In spite of all its obvious flaws in story-telling and character development, 'Furious 7' is an awesome entertainer. By now, one should expect the limits of practicality to be tested in this series and simply embrace the thrilling ride. As Dom's beloved '69 Dodge Charger roars against Shaw's refined yet ferocious Aston Martin DB9, the sounds of engine revs and tyre burns block out all the shortfalls as adrenaline starts pumping again for mayhem. Not surprisingly, this series has us invested in the familia. The freedom they value, the honor they stand for and the thrill they seek on the streets. The lump in the throat effect that the last ride has, is a testament to that very notion. <br/><br/><ul><li>8.59 on a scale of 1-10.</li></ul>"

"leonblackwood","8","75","94","13 September 2015"," Amazing action and decent storyline! 8/10
","Review: WOW! What an epic action extravaganza! This movie was shockingly brilliant because of the unique stunts and decent storyline. Don't get me wrong, it is extremely corny in parts and the one-liners are pretty awful but the action scenes were out of this world. Anyway, the movie is about an assassin (Jason Statham) who is looking to take out the Fast & Furious team because they put his brother in a critically ill state in the previous movie in this franchise. After losing one of there team members to the assassin near the end of the sixth movie, they soon realise that there life's are in danger after a bomb explodes outside Paul Walkers family home. Dwayne Johnson also crosses the assassin in his office were he was looking for the names of the people who put his brother in hospital but the assassin came prepared and ended up hospitalizing the Rock, which put him out of action for most of this movie. This is when Kurt Russell enters the movie and offers Diesel a deal to take out the assassin who is ruining everyone's life's. The deal is to retrieve a unique tracking piece of technology from some terrorists, so they can track Statham down and take him out. The only problem is that the device is under high security so the team put a plan together which sends them around the world. The storyline was very well put together and the directors attention to detail was great. The amazing cars and stunts made this movie the 5th biggest movie of all time and I must admit, it is well deserved. You can definitely tell were the budget went whilst watching the film, especially when there in Abu Dhabi, crashing through buildings and blowing up expensive cars and the fighting scenes were truly a joy to watch. The ending nearly brought a tear to my eye because of the tribute to Paul Walker who died whilst making the movie but the director cleverly used all of the footage that he had of Walker so it seems like he's in the film from the beginning to the end. Anyway, this has to be one of the best films that I have seen this year because of the amazing action scenes and the great cast. Brilliant!<br/><br/>Round-Up: I'm very surprised that this movie didn't cost more money to make because of the long action scenes which are put together brilliantly by the young director, James Wan. He was a weird choice to direct this movie because he has mostly worked on horror movies like the Insidious franchise, Saw, the Conjuring, which did scare me, Dead Silence and Death Sentence with Kevin Bacon. He really did bring something fresh to the Fast & Furious franchise which has made it one of biggest films of all time but the sad death of Paul Walker might bring a end to this profitable franchise. Paul Walker, 40, really became a household name after starring in the Fast and Furious movies but he had a couple of big screen successes like Into the Blue, Eight Below, Running Scared, Noel, Takers and Hours but none of these movies really pushed him to stardom. His great chemistry with Vin Diesel made the franchise what it is today, even though he was the quiet one of the bunch but he brought some emotion and the ""Family"" concept to the team which will be truly missed. Vin Diesel, 48, has really cut down his workload recently after starring in the successful Riddick in 2003 and voicing Groot in the Guardians of the Galaxy in 2014 but he hasn't released anything since. He does have another xXx and another Guardians of the Galaxy movie coming out next year some time and he'll be kicking of the Last Witch Hunter franchise this year so he's been keeping himself busy. Anyway, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham were excellent additions to the cast and I much prefer Statham as a baddie. I didn't quite understand what happened to Kurt Russell's character or why the special force team didn't help them towards the end but thats just me being picky. It is rumoured that there is going to be an 8th movie in this franchise, coming out in 2017 but anything can happen between now and then.<br/><br/>Budget: $190million Worldwide Gross: $1.5Billion<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into their action/crime/thrillers about the Fast & Furious team being hunted by a assassin after taking out his brother in the previous movie. 8/10"
"apstylianou","9","33","39","1 December 2015"," Cheesy at times, but ultimately one of the best action movies I have ever seen in a while
","I will admit that I'm not a massive fan of the Fast & Furious franchise, but Fast & Furious 7 was a real treat in the early days of 2015. It was an intensely thrilling action packed joy ride and I had a really great time watching Furious 7.<br/><br/>Firstly, I will admit that there were some moments in the film that I felt were a little out of place sort of. Although those moments didn't exactly drop the film in a way, they were just a little unrealistic. I also thought that they could've used Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson a lot more in this movie since he only had about 10 minutes of screen time, if not less.<br/><br/>That all aside, this was classic explosive Fast & Furious car action. Vin Diesel was amazing in this movie; this time around he plays a more dramatic role since this movie pays a tribute to recently deceased star of the franchise, Paul Walker, making this movie more of a drama than a thriller action film, which I think does it's job really really well at that. I'll admit, I was tearing up at that point.<br/><br/>Jason Statham also kills it in this movie. I've admired his acting skills, but I think this is the movie that I am going to remember him from the most out of every movie he's done. He is a good actor, but as the main villain in this movie, Deckard Shaw, I thought he delivered the most.<br/><br/>Overall, I had a blast with Fast & Furious 7, it was exciting and emotional, it made us all laugh and cry. I have listened to that song by Charlie Puth and Wiz Khalifa ""See You Again"" so many times, I love that song, it's a perfect way to carry the film's emotional tribute to Paul Walker and to give him the perfect send-off.<br/><br/>For Paul 9.9/10"

","The opening scene in the movie showed Jason Statham who should be the main villain but his character was not shown much power after the terrorist showed up. Like always Vin diesel's entry was good. The digital face making of Paul was an excellent job. The action sequence from the Ehthiad towers was mind blowing. For me it was the best scene. The ending part was too long nd at some point it was like when is this gonna end. But the way they ended the movie with a Paul Walker tribute was epic. Many of them cried at his short video...Me too.

","I've didn't see the first series of Fast & Furious, but I said I should give a try to see this movie. The movie is great for an usual action movie. There are lots of visual effects, great actors (Jason Statham, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodrigues, Vin Diesel and others), great cars, great ammunition. But what bothered me was that there are lots of destruction. Everywhere you see only destruction... Cars, houses, parking lots, asphalt etc. Maybe for other viewers this is not bothering, for me it was too much.<br/><br/>I recommend viewing this movie especially for the series fans, actor fans and usual action movie fans."
"sander123-548-869941","9","73","92","11 April 2015"," A good amount of testosterone triggering action, and (hopefully) a perfect and tearful ending to the franchise
","For two years ago, I walked happy out of the cinema full of energy to get in a car and just road rage through the city - even though I didn't have the license. This time, I drove home, with the license, full of emotional memories. Paul Walker (and not forgetting his driver who deserve some love too) died two years ago, during the filming of the seventh film. This caused some delay on the movie, and the some scenes, including the ending had too rewritten again. This ending is one of the best endings in a movie I have ever seen, and for me it marked a perfect conclusion to the franchise. I hope. It will make me furious (no pun intended) if they decide to make an eight movie. There was simply nothing that I noticed during the film that can possibly trigger a new movie in the franchise.<br/><br/>But enough nagging, what about the actual movie? The plot this time around is as following. The brother of Owen Shaw, Deckard Shaw, wants revenge for what Dom and his team/family did to Deckard's brother. Dominic and his family are thereby hunted and they have to find a way to stop him. They end up teaming up with what I recall was the government, leaded by Mr. Nobody. He and his team are willing to help Dominic find his hunter, and make a stop to him, if they can retrieve a girl named Ramsey and her program, ""The God Eye"", which can connect to every technical advice in the world to find wanted persons. When they get this program, they can use it to track down Shaw. This is the main storyline of the movie, however there are some side story, such as Letty struggling to regain her memory, and Brain who tries to begin a normal life as a father and a family man.<br/><br/>As many already know, Paul Walkers brothers were hired to finish the last few scenes as body-doubles for Paul, with the help of CGI. The use of CGI to make Paul look like himself is remarkably good. I looked up online and found out that scenes where I thought he was acting on stage, was entirely done by his brothers and CGI. While I'm talking about CGI, the special effects are also a blast to watch. The movie does also a good job by giving a lot of SFX when the highlights are being shown, and stops when enough is enough. There are a lot of fast cuts in this movie, which pushes the speed of the scenes and makes the movie a lot more intense.<br/><br/>The acting is as always great. Tyrese Gibson, hilarious as always, do always has his moments to shine when he is on the screen. Vin Diesel is a great leading roll with Paul Walker on his side. Scenes with these two together are great, and we can truly see how close these two friends were in real life when they have scenes for themselves. The rest of the cast are great as well. Jason Statham is a cold, poker- faced villain who fits perfectly to the roll. Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is not so much shown this time around. But when he is on the screen, he is the most bad ass character of them all. The only actress that I find a little bit weird is Nathalie Emmanuel. She is OK, but does sometimes feels like she is bored or something. She is also the most annoying character in the movie.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this is a great film. I had a blast watching it. Personally I hope they will end franchise with this movie. They couldn't make a better ending to the franchise then this. It has been a fun ride, but it is time to park the car.<br/><br/>9/10"
"mchughesy","8","75","95","20 April 2015"," possibly the best movie in the franchise
","so with fast 7 came the biggest budget yet but also the biggest anticipation yet and the acting did not disappoint. The chemistry between the actors was near perfect and the film flowed well thanks to this. The use of Jason statham could have been better and Dwayne Johnson was also widely underused. The fighting scenes did become a little too fast at times to understand what they were doing and this scores against the film.<br/><br/>Getting into the story and we know its going to be about furious toretto and fast cars but the story seemed a little lost sometimes in the need for more action and you find yourself thinking what is the need for this, a simple story got made complicated for no reason.<br/><br/>Let me be honest, this film looked astonishing in what they pulled off, some of the scenes were edge of your seat fingernail biting worthy, this film is not about realism, its about coolness and the way some sciences played out were breathtaking.<br/><br/>So overall this film has amazing acting, breathtaking scenes and offers you with amazing entertainment, definitely worth your money"

I've been such a big fan of the fast and furious series since the beginning and I'm glad that this is not the final one.<br/><br/>I absolutely love every part of this film and that it contains such an amazing actors, incredible action scene and cool effects that capture my attention.

The fights are absolutely amazing..But the character beats especially the last 10mins (Dom & Letty and the goodbye on the beach)..Tej as (Ludacris) and Roman as (Tyrese Gibson) were amazing and they had their moments..Everyone did a wonderful job! the stories in this series might be questionable but the character work and the relationships..

Even though I have to admit that quite a lot of action sequences seem unreal and crazy, you have to remember that this is fiction and a movie after all.<br/><br/>There are also a few funny scenes and most of all a very nice send-off and tribute to Paul.

","Even i have never see the other Fast & Furious films series to know the story line. Even it has the many Clichés of Action Films. But for what it is,is a Pretty Awesome Film (Especially for the Series)<br/><br/>If you not are fan of this series,that OK (but don't you dare to say something bad about Paul Walker) If you are not familiar of the series i cant help you with that ,all i can do is tell you to see the films series<br/><br/>This film is still on Theaters so i am not going to spoiler most of the middle & the ending because is really worth it to see it with out knowing much.<br/><br/>So what is so good about this film? Let's have a look<br/><br/>Story:This film taking place after Fast & Furious 6 Ending. In this one is about Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother and that is the hull story ,is the hull revenge story cliché and well it really works for this film because the main villain of this film is really good ,you know why is angry and why he want to kill Dominic Toretto and his family the story it has is really sad and you fell so sorry about this guy. speaking of which<br/><br/>Characters:Most are the original actors you like of this series are still here and we also have some new actors in this film and all of them are awesome. But let's talk about the big once (in my opinion) and that is Jason statham & paul walker Jason play as the main new villain of this series it was really cool in this roll,i was a little afraid it was going to sting in the roll of a villain because i have never see him play the roll of a villain but after i watch this film it was awesome in this roll it was a really good choice i enjoy every min of him. Paul play as Brian it was also really good and it was a good thing to see him one last time,i was really worried what are they going to do here because Paul died before will make the news there going to do other Fast & Furious ,to make a film without one one of main actor it was impassable but what they did,they have done amazing job. As for the rest of the others they all great and they did amazing job too. (and as for Nathalie Emmanuel is really hot)<br/><br/>CGI:The CGI is Unbelievably Awesome if i watch this film on 3D it will way more awesome & look really real. This one has the most awesome car chases,the best fight scenes & the most awesome action scenes of this series.(in my opinion) My favorite of them all is when the fall of a plane and they were after a truck with mini-guns.<br/><br/>Overall this new one of this series is in my opinion the best of this series and it is really enjoyable to watch it with friends and 3D when he come on 3D. Even it has a lot of the clichés we see in other action films,it makes something new and fresh to be enjoyable & watchable AND MOST IMPORTANT IT USE PAUL WALKER PERFORMANCE RESPECTFULLY THAT FOR THE FANS IT GOING TO BE WONDERFUL.<br/><br/>5/5 10/10 98/100 and 5 stars and will give it 5 Oscars to use the death Actor Performance respectfully"

","Dom's family comes under threat from Deckard Shaw, the brother of the fellow they were up against in episode 6. Also, a mysterious government fellow pressures them to rescue a hacker who has invented a whizzo bit of kit which can spy on anyone on the planet.<br/><br/>This series started out as rough, tough, cargasm movies, but it has gradually morphed via James Bond/Mission Impossible car-based action movies into, at this point, super-hero movies – Vin Diesel and Jason Statham both display levels of invulnerability which Superman would be proud of. If you thought the 25 mile airport runway in episode 6 was stretching things a bit, wait until you see what happens with the red car in this one. The action is absolutely preposterous, and highly entertaining, even if none of it makes any sense at all (the government seriously has no operatives that can do this kind of thing, so they have to recruit a bunch of freelance drivers to bale out of a cargo plane in their cars? Really?).<br/><br/>Underwriting the whole thing is the knowledge of Paul Walker's death during production, necessitating rewriting and a variety of tricks to bring his character into scenes not filmed at that point. On the whole, this has been fairly well done, and there is little in the way of clunky moments when Walker's absence is obvious, which just leaves the awareness of his death and how that might impact on the story. Credit to the cast and crew for allowing the character to exit the series in a dignified and pleasing way, and for adding a moving coda by way of tribute which is dramatically fitting, thematically appropriate to the character and the saga, and full of obvious love for their lost friend and brother."

I for one seriously cannot wait until the release of the ones to come in future. Although I didn't watch it in cinema, I felt the full affect of the clarity of the characters, it was an amazing film, I cannot express it enough.

"estebangonzalez10","8","86","113","2 April 2015"," An over-blown action film that continues to build on the franchise's success.
","""This time it ain't just about being fast.""<br/><br/>James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that ""cars don't fly"" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes. <br/><br/>By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles. <br/><br/>Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining. <br/><br/>The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favorite after Fast Five. <br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","With still having strong memories of being left absolutely terrified by Insidious,I was thrilled to discover that director James Wan's first full-on non-Horror title would be the latest Fast & Furious film.After waiting an extra year to see the movie, (due to the tragic death of lead actor Paul Walker)me and a friend decided to buckle up for a fast & furious midnight screening.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>Finding his brother (who tried to bomb London) Owen Shaw to be left near dead in a hospital,former special operatives agent Deckard Shaw decides to get revenge on the gang who have attacked his family. Going to Tokyo,Deckard tracks gang member Han down in a street race and kills him.Wanting to make an entrance,Deckard sends a bomb to Brian O'Conner and his family,which they barely escape from being killed.<br/><br/>Horrified about the attack on his friends, Dominic Toretto receives a call from Deckard,who reveals that he is going to kill them all.Furious over the brutal killing of Han,Toretto decides that he must stop Deckard before he strikes again.As Toretto and his friends set their sights on getting revenge,they are shocked to find out that Deckard has decided to wipe them out by teaming up with a ruthless war lord.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Facing the challenge of ending the movie on a tribute to Paul Walker,the screenplay by returning writer Chris Morgan ends the movie on a poetic note,with the films theme of ""family"" avoiding the risk of being cheesy,by Morgan making the films final moments be filled with a real sense of warmth & sincerity.Along with the graceful tribute,Morgan makes the epic 2 and a half hour (!) running time speed pass,by giving each member on the heroes & villain's sides their unique moment to shine,from Toretto's wife Letty helping the team members successfully escape,to Deckard henchmen Kiet being set on killing O'Conner.Keeping the titles pulse running,Morgan lights the screen with an extraordinary cartoon atmosphere,which jumps from parachuting cars to drone hacking around LA with an infectious passion.<br/><br/>Making his first,full-on non-Horror movie,director James Wan displays an impressive confidence,with Wan using tightly held close shots,which allow the viewer to clearly see ever punch & street turn taking place.Despite a change in genre,Wan skilfully adapts his Horror film style,thanks to Wan using long,winding tracking shots which strike the action scenes with a full force,and also using minimal lighting in confrontation scenes,which give the title a tense,brittle atmosphere.<br/><br/>Entering the series as its first returning villain, Jason Statham gives a strong performance which gives the baddies their strongest presence in the entire series,thanks to Stratham giving the movie a shot of vengeful anger,as Deckard aims to take all of Toretto's pals down,whilst Tony Jaa marks his English-language debut as quick- witted baddie Kiet.For his last ever performance,Paul Walker gives a charming performance as Brian O'Conner,with Walker giving Conner a real sense of a close friendship with Toretto.Delivering the final lines in the title, Vin Diesel gives a wonderful performance as Dominic Toretto,thanks to Diesel perfectly balancing a frantic energy to the action scenes,with a quiet melancholy mood to the loss of a loyal ""family"" member."
"totalovrdose","8","83","110","2 April 2015"," Entertainingly Impressive, Brilliantly Witty and Emotionally Established. However...
","The opening of Fast and Furious 7 unleashes Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw upon the screen, the older brother of Owen (Luke Evans), the lead antagonist from the previous feature. The power exhibited during this opening however is seldom felt again, and despite Mr Statham's astounding capabilities, the script inhibits his quality to the extent that he is generally about as threatening as a pebble in one's shoe.<br/><br/>Upon Deckard igniting his quest for vengeance against Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), and the other individuals involved in hospitalizing his brother, by killing Han (Sung Kang), Toretto, who, as always, is marvelously portrayed, finds himself outmatched. A man with the alias Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a high ranking CIA operative, who is as suave as he is cool, approaches him. Tasked in removing Deckard, Mr. Nobody provides Toretto with an opportunity to get out in front of his opponent with a device called God's Eye, capable of hacking into all video surveillance devices and utilizing them to find anyone in the world. Unfortunately, the creator of this software, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) has been abducted by terrorists, and as any action by America would constitute an international incident, alternate means are necessary for a safe extraction - enter Toretto and his crew. With the device, they will be able to track Deckard - however, like any film, it is never that simple.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, this particular plot seems awfully redundant. Returning to the 'pebble in one's shoe' reference, Deckard continuously shows up at every confrontation to acquire his pound of flesh - basically, Toretto needn't fly halfway across the world for some gadgetry - he could just plant himself on a park bench and wait half an hour for Deckard to come to him. True, the storyline makes for some outstanding car sequences: ploughing through trees while crashing down a cliff; cruising through a luxurious suite on one of the topmost floors of a tower; racing down the streets of Los Angeles with a Predator drone in tow, among others, are all fantastically executed, though none of it feels to have been a legitimate requirement. Moreover, almost all of the action scenes require suspension of disbelief, the fact the characters are capable of surviving some of the incidents being highly suspicious.<br/><br/>The banter exhibited between Tyrese Gibson as Roman, and Ludicrous as Tej, is as humorous and witty as it was in the previous installment, if not even more entertaining, the few stunts Tej becomes involved in really accentuating his character's persona. Even Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) has more than a few memorable one-liners, despite his small role, and the inclusion of Eden Estrella as his charmingly enjoyable daughter Samantha, adds further depth. However, it is Michelle Rodriguez as Letty, whose performance is the most outstanding. A conversation between her and Toretto at the beginning, where she reveals the heart-wrenching pain of being crippled by amnesia, sets the scene for her character's journey, and lines she admits towards the end of the feature are beautifully impacting.<br/><br/>The tribute at the feature's end to Paul Walker is very touching, and the words Mr Diesel says are as brotherly as they are passionate. During the film, Mr Walker seems to have less screen time as Brian O'Connor than he had in previous movies. Any digital superimposing that was promulgated to complete his role in the movie was amazingly established, Brian's story focusing on whether he would dedicate himself to living with Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their son, as a father who drives a mini-van (one of the film's most comically painful scenes), or continue to involve himself in fierce confrontations.<br/><br/>Despite Deckard been largely alone in his plot for vengeance, other antagonists are portrayed by the unmistakable Tony Jaa, who participates in a number of amazingly choreographed fights, and the always impressive Djimon Hounsou, as terrorist leader Jakande. Respectively, both actors received limited roles, and deserved more screen time, especially considering Mr. Hounsou's presence can equally rival Mr. Diesel's. Towards the end of the feature, it is annoying that Jakande is only capable of saying 'what?' almost a dozen times as his plans are individually and irreparably torn asunder, while the vendetta he has against Toretto is as immature as it is unnecessary.<br/><br/>The musical score strongly resembles the former films, which assisted in immersing this feature in the franchise, and though, for the most part, the movie flowed gloriously, it was towards the end that the film began to feel unnaturally forced, the conclusion to the final battle being as anti-climatic as it is predictable. Too many coincidental moments flooded this movie, in which a protagonist arrived at the right moment to save another hero, while at the same time, unanswered questions, like, how a group of terrorists, armed with sophisticated technology, managed to make it onto American soil undetected - leave notable holes in the plot.<br/><br/>For the most part, entertainingly, characteristically and emotionally, Fast and Furious 7 delivers on all fronts, with impressive visuals, action-packed scenarios, well executed humor, tension and drama. It is unfortunate the villains, who were equally superb, did not receive the same attention, and it is further unsatisfying that the concluding battle seems to crash and burn, much like some of the damaged vehicles."

","I'm not gonna lie! I love this franchise. Aside from the third movie, I enjoy each one of them. You can't ask for much more when it comes to action movies. This series has always been a box office attraction, but the real story is Paul Walker's tragic death. I remember being really saddened when I read about his untimely death. He had come such a long way as an actor. He was getting better and better, and the sky was the limit for him. I was so pumped to go see this movie! My expectations were pretty high. I'm happy to say that it not only met my expectations, but transcended them as well. If you're looking for a great story, look elsewhere! This movie isn't about that. It has plenty of emotion and a decent enough story for this type of thing, but this puppy is all about action. I thought after the 6th one, they had nowhere to go after it. What else could they possibly do, how could they top themselves? Well, they did it! In convincing fashion. This is like 5 action movies in one. If you think you've seen it all, you haven't! There are action scenes in this movie that I didn't think were possible. They are incredibly unbelievable and WAY OTT, but undeniably exhilarating. I thought some of the situations they got out of in the 5th and 6th movies were ridiculous, this one takes the cake. It rarely gives you a chance to breathe! Just when you settle down, along comes another action scene to amaze you. As an adrenaline junkie, I loved every second of it. I'm not gonna list all of them, but I'll mention a couple. One involves Brian and a huge truck at the edge of a cliff. It's completely implausible, but I was on the edge of my seat! Another involves Dom and his destruction of vehicles. I won't spoil them, but they are memorable. The acting is solid! Vin won't ever be known as a great actor, but he has a lot of presence and charisma. He is always reliable in these movies. Paul Walker is really good as Brian. I was really happy with the tribute they did for him at the end. It was very moving and touching. The Rock (Dwayne Johnson) Is a hoot as Hobbs. It sucks that he didn't have as much screen time, but his crazy antics were a blast to watch! Great lines as well. Michelle Rodriguez isn't the Letty we know. She's damaged and vulnerable. I'm so used to seeing Michelle playing bad-ass roles, so it was cool. Jason Statham is a fun villain. You know what to expect when it comes from him. Kicking ass and taking names. Jordana Brewster doesn't have much to do, but she was good. As a huge Kurt Russell fan, it was a treat to see him again. He was hilarious and a lot of fun to watch. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson do well in their roles. Special mention to Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey! Tony Jaa actually gets a chance to showcase his phenomenal skill set. His fight scenes with Paul Walker will get your adrenaline going. <br/><br/>I hate sitting in a theater for over two hours, but it was completely worth it. You don't have time to get fidgety in your seat. There is so much going on that you'll be glued to the screen. I'm not sure if they should do an 8th movie or not. If they make one, I'll be more than happy to see it! But I think this was the perfect ending to this franchise. Whether it's the end or not, thank you for some great entertainment. <br/><br/>9/10"

""Saw"" director James Wan and ""Wanted"" scenarist Chris Morgan had about half of this mammoth $250 million movie made when tragedy struck and claimed Walker's life. Altogether, ""Furious 7"" emerges not only as a cinematic eulogy to Walker's ephemeral career but also as a white-knuckled, super-charged, adrenaline-laced actioneer. Initially, ""The Fast and the Furious"" (2001) crossed the finish line as an above-average, illegal road-racing epic about an undercover cop that bolstered actor Vin Diesel's box office clout while it forged Paul Walker's career. Walker carried on with Tyrese Gibson after a disaffected Diesel bowed out of 2003's sequel ""2 Fast 2 Furious,"" but the chrome-domed Diesel gave his blessing to the chronologically out-of-sequence ""Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift"" (2006) with a post end credits cameo. Some consider ""Tokyo Drift"" the nadir of the franchise, but I contend that ""Tokyo Drift"" surpassed its skid mark of a predecessor. The three sequels that ensued fueled the franchise with even more vitality. Not even Walker's demise could put the brakes on ""Furious 7."" Mind you, ""Furious 7"" doesn't qualify as an artistic magnum opus. Nevertheless, aside from either the James Bond blockbusters or the Harry Potter series, can you name a contemporary franchise with as many sequels as ""The Fast and the Furious?"" Whether we see an eighth entry, ""Furious 7"" has knocked the bottom out of the franchise. Wan and Morgan have concocted some preposterous high-octane stunts that defy gravity as well as logic but look extraordinary. Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, and Asian ""Ong Bak"" martial arts sensation Tony Jarr augment the original cast and invigorate these improbable shenanigans. If ""Furious 7"" marks your initiation to the franchise, you're going to have a blast catching up with the rest of us. ""Furious 7"" ranks as the top of the heap in a franchise that has never throttled back. <br/><br/>In ""Fast & Furious 6,"" Diplomatic Security Service (DSS) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson of ""Hercules"") persuaded Dominic Torretto (Vin Diesel of ""xXx"") to assemble his crew, including former LAPD cop Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker of ""Running Scared""), Roman (Tyrese Gibson of ""Transformers""), Teg (Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges), and Han (Sung Kang of ""Ninja Assassin"") to help him nab a band of global mercenaries. The criminal mastermind of the group, ex-British Special Forces commander Owen Shaw (Luke Evans of ""Dracula Untold""), likes to think big. As just compensation, Hobbs promised pardons to Dom and his gang. Meantime, Hobbs showed Dom a photo of our protagonist's long lost squeeze, Letty (Michelle Rodriguez of ""Girlfight""), and this strengthened Dom's resolve to seize Shaw. When ""Furious 7"" unfolds, we meet Shaw's indestructible brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham of ""The Transporter""), who has just murdered Han in Hong Kong. Later, he wipes out an entire team of guards at the British hospital where his crippled brother clings to life. The indefatigable Deckard vows to make anybody who had anything to do with his brother's calamity pay with their lives. After he ices Han, Deckard heads to Los Angeles and hacks into Hobbs' computer. Hobbs catches him in the act, and they tangle, swap sledgehammer blows, and virtually demolish DSS headquarters. Hobbs narrowly escapes death when Deckard detonates a grenade. <br/><br/>Not long after his larger-than-life brawl with Hobbs, Deckard has a package delivered to Dom's house. The explosion doesn't kill anybody, but little is left of the iconic house where Brian and Dom's younger sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) met and washed dishes together. At this point, Brian's wife Mia has given birth to a toddler, Jack, but she hasn't told her husband that she is pregnant with another child. Brian is struggling to get the hang of taking Jack to day care in a mini-van, and Brian's first scene at day care is hilarious. Although he is confined to the hospital, Hobbs summons Dom to his bedside and tells him ""like a brother"" to take Deckard down. Deckard stalks our heroes at Han's funeral, and Dom and he crash cars head-on into each other. Before they can do additional damage, an army of soldiers supervised by the natty Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell of ""Escape from New York"") intervenes and saves Dom from certain death. Mr. Nobody and Dom share a mutual friend, Hobbs, and Nobody is prepared to help Dom locate the elusive Deckard. Nobody shows Dom a sophisticated gadget that can track anybody anywhere. Basically, it's reminiscent of CBS-TV's ""Person of Interest"" computer. Mr. Nobody refers to it as ""God's Eye,"" and he assures Dom that the government would have caught Osama bin Laden overnight had they had such a doodad. The problem is that the individual with the key component to ""God's Eye"" is a mysterious somebody named Ramsey. Ramsey, it turns out, is being held captive by notorious terrorist Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou of ""Amistad"") who wants the same gizmo. Several outlandish action set-pieces later, our heroes get what they want, but neither Deckard nor Jakande make it a picnic.<br/><br/>Director James Wan rarely lets the episodic action loiter, and he integrates the late Paul Walker seamlessly into several exciting escapades. One incredible cliffhanger scene occurs on a switchback highway atop a craggy mountain where our daredevil heroes struggle to extract Ramsey from a fortified bus armed with six Vulcan mini-cannons. At one point, Walker's Brian O'Connor finds himself dangling from the wrecked bus as it teeters precariously over the edge of a precipice. Brian must scramble across the top of the bus before it plunges into the canyon below. Wan orchestrates several suspenseful, careening car chases. Another staggering stunt has our heroes propelling a priceless sports car through two luxury, skyscrapers in exotic Abu Dhabi to recover Ramsey's device. ""Furious 7"" rivals a James Bond extravaganza with its breathtaking, melodramatic mayhem!"

","This film tells the story of a team of daredevil drivers who ate recruited by the secret service to rescue a kidnapped hacker who has invented a powerful surveillance software.<br/><br/>With the series being the who's who of conventional action superstars, ""Fast And Furious 7"" finally corrected the conspicuous absence of Jason Statham. He certainly doesn't disappoint, as every star deliver awesome action scenes. This film is different from the others because it's really good. It's not ridiculous and brainless like ""The Expendables"" series; and it's not attention deficit like the Bourne series. This combines action, brains and emotions, which is a perfect blend for blockbuster success. <br/><br/>The action scenes are simply awesome. The scene of a car flying between buildings is superb, but by no means the best. There are so many other astounding scenes that got me holding my breath, literally. For example, Paul Walker trying to escape from a bus is a scene that made me stop breathing because it's so intense. The film is so packed with action, but it doesn't feel fragmented or attention deficit. That is what makes it stand above other action films.<br/><br/>""Fast And Furious 7"" constantly surprises me with jaw dropping action. Just when I thought I have seen everything, and nothing can surprise me anymore, the surprises keep on coming. I'm truly amazed by the film. I guess no one thought James Wan could make such an awe inspiring film, after establishing himself as a great horror director."
"CalRhys","Null","233","355","3 April 2015"," Intense, Entertaining and Emotional
","By about 2009 when 'Fast & Furious' was released, the franchise had slowly began to veer away from its initial focus of street racing and instead began to turn its attention to the action genre and over-the-top big budget sequences. However along with this change of style, the franchise was actually getting better and better with each film. Today I saw the most recent instalment in the cinema... talk about action-packed. 'Fast & Furious 7' is a no-holds, over- the-top and mindless action film, but this aside, it is an extremely entertaining and fun film to watch. With an all-star cast and some brilliant action sequences, 'Fast & Furious 7' is proof that certain franchises can continually make great movies. The most notable moment however in the entire film is the emotional and respectful ending during the send-off of Paul Walker, the film finishing with a montage of Walker in the previous six films, finishing with just two words, 'For Paul', this is the first time a Fast and Furious film has affected me emotionally, and it is arguably the best in the franchise."
"teampw7","7","142","226","20 March 2015"," A badass movie with an emotional tribute to Paul Walker.
","Furious 7 is badass. This movie is way different than the previous installments, due to James Wan, who was a fantastic director and had great camera shots in this. The fight scenes were awesome,the Statham and Rock fight is one of the best in the whole series. The audience was cheering and clapping through the whole film. The movie was also hilarious due to the comedic sides of Tyrese and Ludicrous. It was interesting to see how they dealt with Paul Walker,the CGI could've been better but I loved the way they used archive footage of him.Along with the action, there is a very emotional side to this movie. There are certain scenes that are very sad and one of them,Paul actually filmed. Overall,this movie was packed with tons of action,badass one-liners,and a farewell to an amazing actor and person. Rest in Peace Paul Walker."
"prospectus_capricornium","9","148","241","3 April 2015"," Explosive Action Sequences and A Heart Rupturing Send-Off
","FURIOUS 7 starts its engine quietly, depicting cast members now back to their normal lives in the United States. But the wheel doesn't stop there (Statham), and with the arrival of a new enemy, the engine immediately roars anew and gears the movie toward an unprecedented high-velocity escapade, giving way to the most explosive, and probably, the most heart-wrenching chapter of the series, yet. YET, yes, because the saga doesn't show any sign of retirement, and with the new heights reached in Furious 7, the signage is quiet clear: the franchise is nowhere near its final destination.<br/><br/>There's a haunting poignancy in how the movie reiterates ""family"" and sticking together, while keeping the blazing momentum of the speed and action unperturbed, if not ever progressing. Centripetal to this theme, is Paul Walker's character's retirement, fueling the film's emotional core with piercing capacity . The level of action are thrust into all new-heights, and visual drama are brought into breathtaking levels. Whether action and emotions are immiscible or not, that theory is totally dismissed here, as both blends well to bring the attempt into a glorious result.<br/><br/>While the narrative is far from perfect, there are lots of reasons to shrug off such shortcoming. The movie vaunts a solid assemblage of action stars led by Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham. Jason Statham, plays as the main antagonist here, and he makes a decent job, so does Vin Diesel as the leader of the crew. There is no shortage of visual extravagance, as every high-octane action stunt is delivered with breathtaking CGI-trickery, magnifying the thrill into several seismic folds. At such instances, the visual artistry overshadows the real intention of the moment, and when it does, the narrative falls with no more than rudimentary appeal. But then again, with the level of adrenaline employed to fuel up the death-defying action sequences that looms up every now and then, it will be totally forgivable to lose thought of the said flaw, and just enjoy the ride.<br/><br/>Regardless of its faults , FURIOUS 7 is a ride worth taking over and over again, not only because of the level of action it presents, but more strikingly, of how its core is imbued with resonating message of family and brotherhood. Evident to this, is how it pays tribute to Brian (Walker), dotting the movie with flashbacks of him, to further build up his character. And towards the end, as the momentum further spikes, the film places Brian on spotlight, bringing the movie into a highly sentimental send off and a heart-rupturing finish. This film deserves 9/10."
"sukhmanjitcheema","9","289","510","18 March 2015"," A farewell with a bang.
","I saw Furious 7 at a SXSW screening. The sudden death of Paul Walker shocked his fans and the people who were setting hopes for another F&F movie. Well, James Wan and his crew managed to pull it together using CGI and stunt doubles. I have to say, it was a bigger stake here than Furious 6, which felt more bang- bang than a GOOD movie. If you are looking for little story, more car chases, stupendous action and violence and hot babes, Furious 7 is your ticket. The scenes shot in Dubai are particularly spectacular, with lush resorts, exotic cars being driven off hotel rooftops and crashing into an art gallery, ah! What wonders F7 takes you to! You may know, James Wan from Insidious and Saw, and his crazy camera tricks are highlight here. But it comes with a little compromise, the acting, Diesel feels raw, while Rodriguez feels stale and bland. Walker is great, as usual (R.I.P) Tyrese Gibson is the worst, with his ""cool guy"" attitude and ""bad boy"" cliché character. Overall, this one last trip as Torretto calls it, is refreshing, bang on and full out spectacular. Furious 7 deserves to be watched."

","With stellar reviews already, Furious 7 is set to be the largest hit for the Furious franchise yet; and rightfully so. <br/><br/>This movie masterfully displays just how deep the values of family and honour are embedded within the Furious characters. <br/><br/>Paul Walker is fantastic in his last ever movie, alongside Vin Diesel and new addition Jason Stratham as the movies antagonist; this movie really deserves to be seen. <br/><br/>Fan or not, there is no denying that Furious 7 will take you on a roller-coaster of a ride; emotionally and visually, culminating in the best, most enthralling Furious movie to date which will live on in fans' hearts forever."

May your soul rest in Peace."
"pway82","6","393","796","1 April 2015"," Still fun but as cliché as it can get
","I rarely write reviews but i feel this one deserves one that isn't one of the overwhelmingly clouded reviews, that mix real world tragedy into the rating of a fictional piece of work.<br/><br/>The movie is entertaining for everyone that knows what to expect and the ridiculousness of the action scenes is fun in itself. Other than that, this movie is far away from the masterpiece a lot of people make it out to be. Especially the serious parts of the dialogue are a 101 on clichéd movie lines and the story is as surprising as the content of a bag of chips. Paul Walker was a decent actor and his death is mourned by many but an emotional 5 minute tribute at the end of the movie, that also seems tacked on in terms of the storyline, is swaying many into thinking they witnessed a new Shawshank Redemption or The Godfather movie.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the series you're in for a great ride and if you're into action movies in general you won't waste your time with this one. Just keep an honest perspective about this movies place in history."

","If you don't like to think at all while you watch a movie, this movie is for you. Their stuns and most of the action makes no sense, unless this movie is SF, and they have super powers.<br/><br/>It also makes no sense how they shoot with so many bullets that don't get to the target even if if so close! <br/><br/>It's also pretty lame how they make the bad guys so stupid (they shoot with 'canons' using bullets, but they don't have a grenade or something to blow the cars that follow them?! really now.<br/><br/>And many stupid things, like simply 'holding' on to the windscreen while the car was in move, staying on your feet in a fast moving car with rough terrain? jumping from a car to another while moving? Cars jumping directly on a drone? <br/><br/>Falling with the car so many times, getting hit badly, but never getting hurt?<br/><br/>Their lines are also so low, with no sense of humor or intelligence.<br/><br/>And you rate this movie for it's final scene, you give this movie a high rating because of Paul Walker? you should rate the movie, not the tragedy..."
"lafemmeecarlate","6","253","515","3 April 2015"," 10/10 for the Paul Walker tribute, but that can't undo the movie
","I think a lot of the reviewers are giving this movie high scores because of the whole 'it was Paul Walker's last' thing. <br/><br/>The tribute to him was, in my view, perfect and I think it was executed really well. Full marks on that. <br/><br/>But let's be real about the actual movie. You have to suspend belief from 5 minutes and keep it suspended until the tribute starts. <br/><br/>These movies have always had a level of bang and stunts that was unrealistic, and there is A LOT of that in this movie, but even the plot itself is ridiculous. How many innocent third parties are allowed to be killed and or have their property damage so a bunch of street racers can try to settle a score with a guy so highly trained, a TEAM of special forces guys couldn't take him down after the government decided he was more of a liability than an asset (so we are told). Seems like a legit premise...<br/><br/>If you are after a bit of fun and action then this movie is just fine. I didn't not enjoy it. But the plot is so ridiculously unrealistic that for me, it made for a disappointing end to the franchise. <br/><br/>As I said in the title, the beautiful Paul Walker tribute can't undo the silly of this movie. I think I will just cut Tokyo Drift out of my collection so I can pretend Han never died and movie 7 never needed to happen."
"obloco","3","3","3","5 March 2018"," are you kidding me?
","Watched this the other night, and I can't believe all the good reviews it is getting. I just oon't get it. I wasn't expecting a cinematic masterpiece, I knew full well going in this was going to be a car chases and explosions thrill ride sort of movie. Well, we got the car chases and explosions, but for me there was no thrill ride. I found most of the stunts visually uninspired and boring, and in spite of usually being able to turn off my brain and go with it, in this case I spent most of my time shaking my head in disbelief. This was so over the top it made old episodes of The A-Team look like a documentary. It wasn't so bad I stopped watching, but the thought did cross my mind. To all the ""it is so bad, its good"" folks, I usually like that sort of movie, but I don't think this one fits the bill, and since I enjoyed Crank 2 I think that says plenty enough. If you dig it, more power to you; if you haven't been following the franchise, go re-watch the Transporter or anything else for your car chases and explosions fix and give this one a pass. A certain amount of hoak and cheese can be fun, this was just too much for me, and I'm not the only one."
"t-sai771","4","171","349","3 April 2015"," Great tribute, but movie was just another movie.
","While the ending to Furious 7 was executed extremely well, the same cannot be said for the rest of the movie. The acting fell flat and it was nothing more than a two and a half hour long soap opera that has started since the franchise stopped racing cars. The loves scenes became ridiculous and the car action increased in more B.S. than Congress. The movie recycled every cliché in the book. <br/><br/>The fighting actions that involved Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) was welcoming. Jason was Deckard during those moments and he played the part well. All the random moments where he would show meant you knew it was about to go down. When he appears, action is none stop between Domini Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Deckard Shaw, with the fighting between the two intensify with every encounter.<br/><br/>Furious 7 has an incredible tribute to a man that was loved by many and he deserved nothing less. But that alone cannot make this movie be worthy of anything higher than a 7."

","Movie is so boring and very unrealistic, people only gives good reviews because they think it's insulting or disrespectful to Paul Walker which it isn't. Movie is so unrealistic and boring, actors are so boring throughout the series and people think they are good actors only because of their looks. Like really? Driving one building to another? So unrealistic nobody wouldn't do that on real life unless they can land on the ground safely. I feel like I'm the only person in the universe who's smart enough to know how fake this movie is, people acts like they did all this in real life when they didn't. Also it's lame how their character won't die as if they are immortal which isn't possible in real life. It so easy to not die in movies it's like Call Of Duty where you can't die in campaign or else you're stuck in one mission and can't proceed."

","With his brother in a comatose condition in the hospital, ""Deckard Shaw"" (Jason Statham) swears vengeance on ""Dominic Toretto"" (Vin Diesel) and his team who put him there. Now, while this should certainly be a possible cause for concern to any normal person, the fact of the matter is that Deckard is a highly trained and extremely skilled professional assassin who has a terrorist organization at his disposal to help him out. Fortunately, Dominic also has some resources of his own with ""Luke Hobbs"" (Dwayne Johnson) and a shadowy government official who calls himself ""Mr. Nobody"" (Kurt Russell) who have separate agendas which coincide with Dominic's plans to kill Deckard before he can kill them. Now rather than reveal any more I will just say that this picture definitely had the talent to be a very fine film. Unfortunately, the director (James Wan) resorted to one preposterous stunt after another which made this film look rather ridiculous in my opinion. Having said that, those who are fans of this particular franchise will probably love this movie for the simple fact that it has plenty of action and some of their favorite actors. Unfortunately, the complete lack of realism severely damaged its credibility in my eyes and I have rated it accordingly. Below average."

","Sure, a lot of people are going to like cars falling out of the sky. Sure they going to like things blowing up over and over again. Some will find ""Awesome"" the special effects. Most will.<br/><br/>Not me. The fast and furious franchise has gone trough some changes since it first installment. Since the return of the original cast in the fourth movie, the tone has changed, and ""popcorn"" action privileged over a strong story. But it was well done. Still keeping the ""buddy-touch"" the charismatic characters, raising one from the death in the 6 th movie, and also keeping some sentiment.<br/><br/>But every movie, kept going in a stronger direction of ""you not believe what you will see"", but also in more and more nonsense. As the balance was still fine in the fourth, the fifth had just some ""over the top"" situations, The 6 th, was for me limit of ""believable moments"", but OK, it was still fun.<br/><br/>Now, the movie in unbelievable from start to end. The situations are so overdone, and have no gram of realism. On the contrary what happen to Paul Walker in real life, the can fall from heights, crashed in cars many time, they will all be running around as nothing ever happen. Action is fine with me, but please give us a story we can believe in!<br/><br/>Then I not know how Paul Walker death affected the final result. First, on many occasions, I had the impression it was not him, which of course is true. The theft of the car in the building, the fight with the Thai movie-star, Walker's face was either not really visible, or then not realistic, like a video game character. Sure, because of the circumstances, still well done, but visible.<br/><br/>Where it affects probably the most is the ""buddy feeling"" of the movie and the dialogs between him and ""Vin Diesel"", were almost non existent. Vin is deciding everything, Walker, is just there to execute, probably because, their conversations were not all shot yet. And that is more difficult to artificially create, when people are not running or driving around. <br/><br/>Loud Fireworks, crashing cars, a lot of action, not always make an exiting movie, like mentioned before, especially when what is happening is so much over the top. You not fear for your heroes any more, because, and I not say this ironically, they are not people of flesh and blood any more, but super heroes like Superman, that seem stronger then a normal human being. And that was for me the strength of F&F before, just ordinary guys, getting in a difficult situation."

The secret lies in the breakdown of our society. When this franchise began in 2001, our society was morally not decadent as it is today, nor so violent. In the last 16 years our society has grown worse and the values ​​of the old days began to disappear and our society and the moviegoers in general began to identify more and more ,each time, with the ""characters"" of this type of film.

Add in some wooden acting, unrealistic plot lines and some pretty terrible CGI and you get the Fast & Furious 7.<br/><br/>Take it at face value - a noisy action film with fast cars, elaborate fight scenes (often so clear the actors are no where near making contact with each other), unnecessary bikini shots, and it's a film that is capable of wasting a couple of hours of your life.

","The seventh installment in the Fast & Furious film series, 'Furious 7' is pure bad-ass, no-holds-barred entertainment! It redefines popcorn entertainment & offers pure thrill. Its presentation & execution, both, are mind-bogglingly done!<br/><br/>'Furious 7' Synopsis: Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother.<br/><br/>'Furious 7' has style & substance. The Script is perfectly done, while the Action-Sequences leave you stunned. You will cheer each time a car collides with another, or when a car flies from one building to another. When was the last time an Escapist flick left you awe-struck, been a while right? Finally, 'Furious 7' does that!<br/><br/>Chris Morgan's Screenplay is swift & fact-paced. James Wan's Direction is high-octane. Cinematography captures all the maddening action, with zeal. Editing is razor-sharp, despite a running-time over 133-minutes. Action-Sequences, simply, are spell-binding.<br/><br/>Performance-Wise: The Late/Great Paul Walker is the emotional strength of 'Furious 7'. The talented actor who passed away back in 2013, gives the film immense power through his presence. And a beautifully fitting tribute is given to him in the film's final moments. Vin Diesel is tough, as ever. Dwayne Johnson, surprisingly, is reduced into a cameo here. He's brilliant nevertheless. Michelle Rodriguez is efficient. Ludicrous & Tyrese Gibson bring the house down, with hilarious turns. Jason Statham, as the antagonist, plays it straight. Ditto for Djimon Hounsou. Ali Fazal leaves a mark. And its so nice to see Kurt Russell back after a hiatus. The veteran is superb.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Furious 7' takes summer blockbusters to another level. Its entertainment at its finest! Two Thumbs Up!"
"ferguson-6","5","70","159","5 April 2015"," For Paul
","Greetings again from the darkness. ""For Paul"". A touching tribute to the late Paul Walker provides an emotional end to the most high-octane (sorry about that) F&F episode yet  and the perfect victory lap (sorry again) for the franchise. Of course, we know that it won't be the last, if for no other reason than easy box office money.<br/><br/>The franchise began in 2001, and the familiar faces are back: Vin Diesel as Dom, Paul Walker as Brian, Jordana Brewster as Brian's wife Mia, Michelle Rodriguez as amnesiac Letty, Tyrese Gibson and Chris ""Ludicrous"" Bridges as comic relief Roman and Tej, respectively, and Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson as Agent Hobbs. New to the scene are Djimon Honsou as a terrorist, Ronda Rousey and Tony Jaa as elite henchmen (henchpersons?), Nathalie Emmanuel as super-hacker Ramsey, and Kurt Russell as the shadowy government-type cutting shady deals for fuzzy reasons. The biggest add is of course, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw, the Black Ops big brother to Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) – silenced villain from the previous film (in which Statham made a brief appearance foreshadowing this story line).<br/><br/>Achieving remarkable success for what started as a fun little street racing cult film, this series thrives on its familiar characters, simple plot lines, staggering lineup of dream cars, and ever-louder and larger stunts, fights and set pieces. One of the earliest scenes features a fight scene that would be the climax of most action movies: The Rock vs Jason Statham. Rather than end or solve anything, this fight merely serves as a set-up for one of the film's punchlines – involving The Rock and a plaster arm cast (pay no attention to that leg cast). In the middle, we get a too brief clash between Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Rousey, but the real finale is a rooftop battle between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham that has such an extended cut-away, we almost forget they are going at each other.<br/><br/>In between those colossal fights, we get Paul Walker sprinting up the side of a bus that is sliding off a cliff, a wicked and armed drone, car chases galore – including one with a stealth chopper, synchronized10,000 foot car drops from an airplane, and most impressively, car jumps between the Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. That last one is not just any car, but a stunning red Lykan Hypersport  one with little resale value after its final trip.<br/><br/>Michelle Rodriguez' character is fighting her amnesia, Ludicrous and Tyrese play off each other like Laurel and Hardy, while Dom does his best Yoda impression, and Statham comes off like a revenge-seeking missile from a Terminator movie. Every character gets their fair share of posing, preening, strutting and smirking. It would be an insult to call this over-the-top because that would imply we have previously seen the top. This is high-speed, high-altitude mayhem that plays directly to a large fan base.<br/><br/>Personally, I'm not a devout F&F follower, and have seen only the first entry prior to this latest. My attendance for Furious 7 was driven (get it?) by my interest in seeing the tribute to Walker, and my personal code of seeing every Kurt Russell movie (don't ask). However, I do understand the mass appeal, and I believe the followers will appreciate the approach of director James Wan (Saw, The Conjuring), who replaces 3 time series director Justin Lin."

","The family of street racers are back, again; there are personal matters at stake, again; circumstances have forced them to team up for one last ride, again. Having successfully defeated criminal mastermind Owen Shaw, members of the crew have gone their separate ways. Little did they know about Shaw's big, bad-and ingeniously resourceful-brother Deckard, who comes lurking out of the shadows for revenge (heretofore unseen big brother comes to avenge little brother, truly a novel cinematic idea!). Add to the mix a few other ruthless bad guys, some shady and seemingly indestructible federal agents, a beautiful woman with brains, some rough-and-tumble fight scenes, one ridiculously over-the-top action sequence after another, and the stage is set for pretty much everything you've come to expect from this long-running franchise. Logic, character development, and story continuity/credibility take a backseat to needless exposition, crowd-pleasing one-liners, and superfluous action set pieces, like you'd expect, but the presence of series veterans, effective casting in key roles, and knowledge that this is the late Paul Walker's final film give it much more weight than it should. **"
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","6","2","2","26 April 2017"," ""Furious 7"" begs us to further embrace the insane joyride and ignore the rest
","After ""Fast & Furious 6"" shifted the action of this mega-series into a gear not known to man — one resembling a superhero movie far more than an action franchise — those following the ""Fast & Furious"" had to either get on board or jump out. So the mantra for enjoying ""Furious 7"" is ""embrace the insanity."" You either get a kick out of it or you don't.<br/><br/>For all the crazy stuff they pulled in 6, there's an equal or one-up in 7. In the last movie you had the crew trying to take down a massive cargo plane; in this movie you have cars skydiving out of a massive cargo plane. Even when you can guess something insane is coming, you still can't believe what the filmmakers decided to do. For example, a sequence in Abu Dhabi involves the crew needing to steal something locked inside of a rare and exotic car locked in a safe room at the top of one of the city's biggest buildings. Need I say more?<br/><br/>The plot holds a little less water than 6, and to say that any ""F&F"" plot holds any more or less water than another is a big difference. The film is put in motion by the events of 6, as that film's baddie, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), is in a coma, and his special ops older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) wants revenge on Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and company. Plausible, except that Deckard has an uncanny ability to track people down, show up in the right place at the right time, sneak into government facilities, perfectly time explosives and stay one step ahead of everyone — all by himself.<br/><br/>OK, easy enough to embrace that insanity. But after Dominic decides to go after Shaw, a mysterious suit and tie named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) shows up with a small army to save the day and offer Dominic all his resources to track Shaw down if he and his crew can rescue a hacker (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a band of mercenaries led by Mose Jakande (Djimon Honsou) and find a device she invented called the God's Eye that turns all devices into the world into a personal surveillance system that can track anyone  All this to justify sending Dom, O'Conner (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Chris Bridges) to the Caucasus Mountains, Abu Dhabi and beyond. It's not longtime series writer Chris Morgan's finest work.<br/><br/>With the ""we don't care about physics"" cat out of the bag, the sky is literally the limit for what these characters can do or endure. The highs of the movie come from this potential for unbelievably imaginative sequences, but so many scenes lose suspense because we know that our heroes can fall, roll over and get crushed countless times and emerge virtually unscathed. In fact, it's kind of ridiculous that Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) actually ends up in the hospital after a ""nearly fatal"" fall early in the movie. The film's most suspenseful moment involves O'Conner, but perhaps because Walker's untimely death during production had audiences in suspense over how his character would bow out.<br/><br/>Walker's unfinished work is hard to detect. A few scenes seem out of place in an effort to use actual footage of Walker whenever possible, but if you had no idea he died during production, you'd be taken by surprise by the film's tribute ending. It really only provides us emotional catharsis for losing Paul Walker, not for the departure of Brian O'Conner from these stories. His character arc just doesn't feel complete, but undoubtedly there was only so much the filmmakers could do.<br/><br/>Horror aficionado James Wan, taking over for four-time ""F&F"" director Justin Lin, brings a lot of Lin's style and adds a signature in various 90-degree camera rotations that usually follow characters in action sequences when they are not standing upright and usually in the air or falling. In a way, these shots acknowledge the unrealistic nature of the action scenes.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" probably takes itself the least seriously of all the movies thus far, and in that sense, it makes all the ridiculousness easier to stomach. Gibson's Pierce is really forced into the jokester role, and he manages a few laughs that he wasn't getting (from this critic) in previous films when he was prematurely being shoehorned into that stereotype. And Hobbs' return after being out of the middle act of the movie is perhaps the biggest signal that we're all supposed to just be having fun together.<br/><br/>These movies haven't quite done enough to reach a higher echelon of quality given the relaxed attitude toward good storytelling, but it's clear to anyone that they are not trying to meet any needs beyond a fun time. Hence, each movie grades out pretty similarly, with a little variation here and there. If we weren't familiar with and invested in the characters and if the budget for these movies weren't so astronomical that we could have fun watching them just because they have the money to show off, the litany of flaws would be more apparent. The high entertainment value and lack of substance pretty much offset each other, resulting in movies that are immensely watchable yet only so satisfying.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

"thesar-2","4","46","108","5 April 2015"," Serious Seven
","I never got vested into the series until #5, still my favorite installment because they were finally honest and embraced the fact these are live-action cartoons and with each of the many ""Yeah, right!"" near misses and stunts, it makes it actually fun. #6, though not as good, but still entertaining, carried that tradition.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, someone decided to go back to being serious. Sure, there were some ""Yeah, right!"" scenes I enjoyed in Furious Seven, but they were few and far between. In fact, maybe just 2-3 in an almost 2½ hour movie. Sad.<br/><br/>Not to say this was a bad movie. The action scenes, though cut down tremendously from previous chapters, were really good. Mostly involving Paul Walker. And speaking of Paul<br/><br/>Yes, RIP Paul. I really did like him and his presence in movies. But, his part here seemed almost irrelevant. Yup, I liked his fighting the same dude twice, and he did have the most exciting ""Yeah, right!"" escape in the best chase/action scene in the film. But, his part in the team just seemed blah. I understand his arc, destination, etc, but his character was actually the lamest of all of themincluding the bad jokester.<br/><br/>What I did like most about Furious Seven were the characters played by Michelle Rodriguez and Kurt Russell. They absolutely kept things interesting. Unfortunately, the two I wanted to like more, but was sadly let down by, were: one of my favorite action stars, Jason Statham who was not as exciting to watch as is the case in any of his other films and The Rock, whose measly 10 minutes of screen time was a joke.<br/><br/>Unbelievably, for this series, that is, they worked on the story and, while still simple, it was enjoyable. Basically it was twofold – revenge from the brother of someone they previously killed (Die Hard with a Vengeance, anyone?) and yet another big brother device they need to obtain from the bad guys sothe US government can use it. Um, seriously? I am proud to be an American, but would absolutely think that device would be best in the bad guy's hands than in our Government's. (Thoughthey probably already have something similar, if not exactly the same, to the one in the movie, anyways.)<br/><br/>While the movie was decent and the few action scenes were good, I'm not 100% leaning on a recommendation since it was just sodamnlong. And what we came for just took too much time to get to. Maybe for fans, but even then, they were probably expecting what I was: another silly live- action cartoon, albeit fun, ride. They just took it way too seriously, especially for a part 7 in a franchise. <br/><br/>That all said, at least director James Wan gave the dudes in the audience the two things they wanted most. And when those two things showed up, for my own amusement, I had to shout out at the screen: ""GIRLS! GIRLS!"" and ""RACE SCENE!"" (Taken from a hilarious YouTube video that summarized the previous six installments. And don't worry – the movie was so flipping loud, especially during those scenes, no one could hear me.)<br/><br/>* * *<br/><br/>Final thoughts: Yes, this is a movie. Yes, fiction. But, dang it, one of the most pointless and clichéd scenes that simply drove me nuts was one where a gun could've ended a dispute, but was discarded in lieu of a street fight. Again, I recognize this as a fictional movie, and definitively a Fast & Furious sequel, and Indiana Jones already did what I wantedbut still, it was frustrating. At least make the person run out of bullets and then do the butch, male fighting. Sheesh!"
"lasttimeisaw","6","36","85","5 April 2015"," R.I.P. for Paul Walker
","An Easter weekend cinema-going of this topical car-chasing no brainer, a franchise has already exceedingly overstayed its shelf-life, reaches an unforeseen acme catalysed by the tragic loss of its co-leading man Paul Walker last year (ironically in a car crash, again a bloody testimony of ""movies are deceitful"", considering in this latest offering, no lack of crashes, but not even a minor concussion incurred or whatsoever.). After the series best FAST FIVE (2011, 7/10) and a degenerative FAST AND FURIOUS 6 (2013, 6/10), this time, the director chair has been delegated to James Wan, the master-hand behind SAW & INSIDIOUS horror trademarks, it is a sure-thing its box office will explode and achieve another series-high, but reckoning a story and cast overhaul is inevitable for its next move, let us take it as a sincere eulogy not only to Paul but the franchise itself. <br/><br/>The cast continues ballooning with Jason Statham as the indomitable villain, and Tony Jaa makes his Hollywood debut in a thankless role as a heavy, with a has-been action star Kurt Russell back in the game with the hope to hog the position as a regular for the upcoming adventures. Universal surely is hatching a bigger plan for their top-ranking monkey-maker mammoth. <br/><br/>The movie never veers from binging on its WTF spectacles, this time, the highlights include a car-parachuting stunt, an action-packed hostage-rescuing set piece ending with a science-defying cliff-hanger, and a car-swooping among three adjacent high-rises in Abu Dhabi. No doubt they are all thrilling to watch, and the admiration for the teamwork behind swells up spontaneously, which inadvertently overkills in the final showdown with a bombarding drone running amok in the city, personally it descends to a headache-inducing and eardrum-hurting nuisance because it drags too long and the hand-to-hand combat between Statham and Diesel fails to match its promise. <br/><br/>Now, to the mushy part, as a half-finished swan-song of Walker, Wan and the screenwriter Chris Morgan choose the safest route for his exit strategy, with the aide of body doubles, CGI effects and montages of previous scenes, to say the least, fanboys will feel satisfactory and the due respect has been properly paid to the gone-too-soon. After all, the over- sensational phenomenon is not because the picture per se is the best of the series, purely, it is another victory of the ever-correct marketing tactic exploits on people's sentimentality on tragedies, which in some way, actually could give this enervated franchise a glance of hope to regain its vigour and keeps its life span. But for now, I can only wish R.I.P. for Paul, never a versatile actor, but a down-to-earth presence our generation hopefully will not forget in no time."
"jefflouvre-435-77367","2","58","146","2 April 2015"," Stuck in 1st gear; Walker would have been disappointed
","THE Fast and Furious franchise is back for the seventh time, but without Paul Walker, who died in a car crash (ironic, isn't it?). It was nice of Vin Diesel to name his newborn daughter Pauline in honour of his former friend.<br/><br/>The film carries on with the theme of family. It's not every man for himself, but it's every man for this multiracial family.<br/><br/>Furious 7, however, is stuck in first gear and never gets going. I felt bored and restless in the first few minutes and hoped that the action scenes would rev me up. However, despite all the hullabaloo happening on screen, I never felt excited or bothered by it.<br/><br/>One reason could be that viewers would have seen all the action before. The prerequisite implausible car scene, involving freeing a beautiful hacker, is more than viewers can hope for, but a voice inside them will tell them that science fiction films are more believable than this.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the film let the cat out of the bag by showing this scene in its trailer, thereby removing any iota of excitement.<br/><br/>Diesel, who's also a producer of the film, is still the glue that holds this motley crew together. His tough-guy persona is wearing thin, as is his ability to take hits from bad guy Deckard (Jason Statham) and the number of times he survives car crashes.<br/><br/>His Dominic Toretto is gruff as ever but I didn't empathise with him as much as I did in the sixth film of the franchise.<br/><br/>Walker, who died two years ago in speeding-car accident, is gently pushed aside as Brian. Dominic tells Brian that the bravest thing the latter ever did was to be a father to his family. Such a sombre scene requires time for it to sink into viewers, but in the next scene, we see bikini-clad women strutting their stuff in Abu Dhabi.<br/><br/>Has anyone noticed that this franchise's preferred way of filming sexy babes is something that I call below-the-butt eyeline?<br/><br/>Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) looks hot wearing a red gown and duking it out with another babe.<br/><br/>Roman (Tyrese Gibson) cracks jokes and Tej (Ludacris) provides the necessary IT support. They briefly fight over sultry hacker Ramsey (British actress Nathalie Emmanuel) and just when you thought that they'd argue over her brains, Malaysian-born director James Wan lets viewers ogle her in her black bikini at the beach.<br/><br/>The film's preposterousness reaches a new level with a sports car flying through three high-rise towers. Even if you had wanted to gawk at its silliness, the film took that away by showing it in its trailer, too.<br/><br/>The ending, which takes place in downtown Los Angeles, is the final nail in the coffin for the film. An armed helicopter can wreak havoc with nary a sight of US jet fighters intercepting it. The police, meanwhile, are inept because they can't stop the accidents caused by car chases.<br/><br/>By this time, however, I just wanted the film to finish so I could get out of the theatre.<br/><br/>1 out of 5 stars<br/><br/>abigspark.blogspot.com"

Half way through you forget why they're even doing what they're doing.

"Theo Robertson","6","47","117","4 April 2015"," Won't Win New Converts But Fans Will Love It
","This isn't a franchise to appeal to me . I think I gave up after the third film and the series does seem like a teen version of TOP GEAR with added silicone and steroids all shot in an MTV style that makes Michael Bay seem almost like Bela Tarr in comparison . So to be blunt I watched FURIOUS 7 just to see what the fuss was about and perhaps morbidly to see a film whose lead character is played by an actor who sadly died mid way through production <br/><br/>To be fair it plays out very much as I expected for the first third . Car chases . explosions , pumping music playing the action , speed ramping , fisty-cuffs and karate kicks , constant slow motion every time the camera lingers on a semi-clad beauty and of course Jason Staham playing Jason Statham who looks like Daniel Day Lewis compared to Vin Diesel . What I have noticed in the gap between this and the last one I watched is how different this latest one feels from the early entries . From what I remember the original had a simple plot of a cop going undercover to break a gang of racers who've turned the streets of Los Angeles in to their own personal race track . It's not a brilliant premise for a film but it is a fairly sensible one . In spirit this one feels more like it belongs in an alternative universe similar to THE EXPENDABLES franchise or even James Bond . The action scenes are over blown and totally , totally ridiculous but to be fair I wasn't exactly bored by any of this and the cinema audience who were no doubt hard core fans of the films seemed to greatly enjoy it laughing out loud at the one liners so it's not a total dead loss and there is a meta-fictional feel that addresses towards the end that takes note that if the series continues it'll be without one of its mainstay characters played by Paul Walker <br/><br/>In summary I was slightly surprised with FURIOUS 7 but much of my surprise is probably down to the fact I haven't watched most of the other movies and failed to see how the franchise evolved in to something different from its genesis . It probably won't win any new converts to its cause and I'm in no hurray to visit the films I missed but for those of you who enjoyed THE FAST AND THE FURIOUS and stuck with the series you'll love this one"

Part 6 had some really crazy things happening with flying cars and 100 km runways... I have no idea what the writers and the director were smoking when they created this.... Don't get me wrong, the action scenes were intense and extremely captivating; it is just they were even more ludicrous than Fast 6. <br/><br/>In this movie every character had some type of superpower; it felt like watching X men racing in fast explosive cars.<br/><br/>The only reason why this movie is not a 1 is because Jason Statham is an ultimate bad-ass who played his part very well.<br/><br/>Get ready to burst from laughing, because no matter what I type here, it will not prepare you for what you are about to witness."

If the last few outings were really dumb, this one is just plain stupid--raucous fun in fits and bursts, but too long, too over-the-top, too overstuffed, with flashy but pointless camera movements masking a firm sense of space, geography and logic. Less mayhem would have been a good thing, none of Gibson would have been a great thing. A few familiar faces make brief appearances, but the real stars will always be the cars and stunts; it's just a shame that so many of those stunts are too obviously staged/digitized and too physically impossible to legitimately thrill.

"takashi_kupo","2","27","67","4 April 2015"," Worst Movie of the Year (So Far)
","I love blockbusters but I don't love this one.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is a sexist, racist, trite film that does not even amount to the levels of The Avengers - a film it tries very hard to be. But even as a blockbuster with hundreds of millions in funding where we might forgive the rampant presence of -isms (seems backwards, doesn't it?) to please a general audience (falsley presumed to be White, Straight, and Cis-Gendered), we find ourselves in nothing but muck.<br/><br/>In the first 15 minutes, we're subjected to women as props being sprayed with water with as little clothing as possible. Equal opportunity to delight straight female viewers or gay men is forgotten entirely as the objectification of the female props decorates the set. Did Vin Diesel and manage to negotiate as a producer that he could gain 20 lbs and not take off his shirt at all? Were the producers simply frat boys that don't know how to make women into 3 dimensional characters and scream ""eww!"" at the sign of male cleavage? Probably.<br/><br/>If that isn't enough, Iggy Azalea, the very symbol of White people pretending to be from the streets, makes a pointless cameo with a terrible American accent and the entire movie is a setup for a letdown right then and there.<br/><br/>Furious 7 delves deeper into its own chasm of stupidity by tokening its characters - good guys and bad guys. Roman is used is as the sassy black woman and Letti is turned into a practical girl from a novella (""I have to find myself, Dom!"" *tears in her eyes falling to her booty shorts.) When it comes to the bad guys, you have the token Asian that knows martial arts and the token black guy that's a terrorist. Djimon Hounsou is wasted in this film.<br/><br/>The only characters worth their salt are Dom, who doesn't exactly evolve but does have a character arc, and Tej (played by Ludicrous) who's character is not simply a witty black man but a competent hacker with good insights.<br/><br/>The globe trotting film however makes a very disastrous mistake by portraying Abu Dabi infactually with women walking around in bikinis. Any individual with vague knowledge of the world knows that this is a country where women wearing a bikini is basically illegal and will get you thrown in jail or fined. A simple fact checking might have saved the film this humiliation.<br/><br/>But that's the essence of the film. Silly and sometimes terrible writing. Even as the film attempts to assemble a bountiful team of amazing drivers and skilled fighters, all of the one-liners fall completely flat. Take for instance Hobbe's one line to Letti during a confrontation. ""Woman. I am the calvary."" Maybe it was Dwayne Johnson's delivery, or maybe it was the 15th failed one liner in a row, but it was awful.<br/><br/>The only reason this film gets two stars out of me is the amazing tribute to Paul Walker and all the fake outs of his character's death through the film. Without it, the movie would be complete trash. Actually, it is trash, it just has a great tribute at the end which is surprisingly affective."

","This is my first review on IMDb, and I'm writing it because I really have to lay down my thoughts.<br/><br/>I have watched the movie today, after a long period of waiting. I have to say that very few movies have managed to keep me so tense for almost the entire period. I remember, when it was rated 9+, people thought it was overrated. Maybe. A movie can't have it all. Others are sad because some hotshot actor didn't get an Oscar yet. How about these people? Do they deserve an Oscar? But you know what? Who cares about the IMDb rating, or the Oscars? A movie or an actor doesn't need any award to get to our hearts or in our lives. I know I was amazed by this series since I was a kid and I can say I grew up along with it. Fast and Furious 7 gets you through a series of emotions, from happiness to amazement to sadness, like very few movies are able to. It shows the viewers how important is the value of family and how strong the bonds between the characters have become. Throughout the movie we enjoy action, drama and even few comedy scenes, harmoniously put together. Extraordinary camera shots and James Wan's best directing work along with amazing performances delivered by most of the actors make Fast and Furious 7 as glorious as a series finale can get. <br/><br/>""One last ride""... or is it? This movie is a success, no doubt, and it would make for a great ending. But not only that the large number of fans would like the story to go on, but I believe even Paul Walker himself would have wanted so. <br/><br/>Until next time, ""Salute la familia""!"

","This movie was over-hyped with the pre-release death of Paul Walker and that's it. It is long and that should be warning enough if you plan to watch this in a theater and not end up enjoying it. Jason Statham just drops in as big brother out for revenge and in my opinion a big let down for big fans of his like me. He just pops up in every single plan devised by Vin Diesel's crew which is actually a bit too much. There could have been a bit of character building for him but unfortunately it ain't there. No story here but then that would be expected of such a movie. If they plan to kill the franchise with this one, I think they have succeeded. The ""family sticks together"" and "" all I have got is family"" dialogs are re-used and someone in the dialog dept needs to come up with some fresh ones. Action scenes do not look realistic and they are over blown to the limits.If you are going to watch it for the cars, even that is a big let down. Save your money and watch it on DVD or cable cos that's all this movie is worth. And I believe Universal should stop with this sequel completely. 4 stars just for the action scenes which you could watch in the trailer itself ..!!!"

","The whole movie franchise of Fast and Furious is probably one of the most memorable ones. However, as it is nearing the end, the franchise is becoming nothing more than a Science Fiction cliché.<br/><br/>In this specific movie the whole plot is based on both lack of common sense and bad physics. Nearly every stunt and every piece of action was not supported by the right laws of physics. The illogical plot made me feel a bit stupid. At one point I felt like I was watching a Marvel movie, something like The Avengers. This wouldn't be so bad if it were for cars racing on the streets, you know, the thing that we all fell in love with.<br/><br/>On the other hand, this particular movie contains a witty atmosphere, something I've not really felt while watching the previous parts. The acting is great, as you would expect, the portrayed characters felt like having real-life emotions which is pretty rare in a purely action movie.<br/><br/>All in all I give this movie a 5/10. This might be harsh due to my love for physics. The only downside is the lack of logic. If you're a fan of the previous parts go ahead and watch this movie that ended with a heart melting scene. It is worth a watch."

Every thing just works. The comedy, the love story, the actions etc just work so well.

","An action movie can indeed have a great story and balance. The best action movie ever, in my opinion, is Terminator 2. The action is there, but there are also moments of low-key scenes to build up the story. When the action scenes arrives, they are set in context with the characters and the story.<br/><br/>Fast 7 have very poor story boarding and a even worse story. The characters are very shallow with few exceptions. Some scenes are very embarrassing to watch, and the dialog in ""romanic"" moments are stolen from an essay from ground school. There are almost no breaks between the action scenes, and the overall music does not match the scenes very well.<br/><br/>Fast 5 was in contrast a far better movie with more self-irony and a more ""trustworthy"" story. <br/><br/>I suspect they have tried to amplify Fast 7 to make it even more spectacular.

He is brutal but has style which makes him more than just another Hollywood bad guy. Actually there are many more elements of this movie worthy of praise.

"ryanskywalker-87402","8","2","3","22 April 2017"," A fitting farewell for Paul walker
","James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third installment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that ""cars don't fly"" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes.<br/><br/>By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth installments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacris), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining.<br/><br/>The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favourite after Fast Five."

The mix of fast paced action, and heartbreaking emotion keeps you on the edge of your seat, whilst Dom and his crew drive cars out the back of a plane thousands of meters above the earth and Letty starts to remember her past.<br/><br/>The lead cast of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Kurt Russell and Jason Statham deliver a stellar performance with Dwayne Johnson charging in to save the day.<br/><br/>In the Epilogue we see the main cast on the beach, watching Paul Walker's character play with his son and partner in the sand as the talk about how he suits a family man better. In the last few moments of the Epilogue we are faced with the same situation as the end of F&F1, Paul and Dom lining up at the lights one final time. As the clip ends we hear Vin Diesel with a voice over, talking about Paul Walker ""I used to say I live my life a quarter mile at a time and I think that's why we were brothers - because you did too. No matter where you are, whether it's a quarter mile away or half way across the world. The most important thing in life will always be the people in this room, right here, right now. Salute mi familia. You'll always be with me. And you'll always be my brother."" FOR PAUL<br/><br/>This was one of the most emotional experiences I have had at a movie theater to date, and i'm sure that i'm not the only one because half the theater was crying with me. This was the perfect send off for the late Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Rest In Peace Paul Walker.<br/><br/>""When I did the first one, it was a cool movie where I got to run around in race cars, shoot a gun and kiss a hot chick. That's where I was at in my life then. Now that I'm older, there's a reason we're still here. The themes we hit on early on, whether the audience even realized what it was that was drawing them in, is irrelevant. The second you lose the family, how significant are we? It's funny to see the people connect with it the way they do. I had no clue, I didn't get it. And now, more I get it and I see it."" - Paul Walker"

","Before reviewing a movie, everyone should think about what they expect to see on the screen. That's the main point of Furious 7 and it's why there's so much people yelling about its high rating. The movie itself is not different from any other of the franchise: cars flying, impossible stunts, etc. I would give it a 6/10, 6,5 tops, but that's not the reason why I went to the theater. I wanted to see how Paul Walker's farewell would be, and the result was far beyond I expected. Usually when an actor dies during the shooting of a movie, they simply write a tribute on the credits. That wasn't the case. The whole movie had a ""b side"" story that lead to the ending scene being completely dedicated to Paul/Brian. It was peaceful, respectful and beautiful. I believe a movie is awesome when you leave the theater and want to talk about it for hours and that's exactly what happened, because of this last scene. The real experience of Furious 7, at least for me, wasn't the 2+ hours, but those 2 minutes that will be remembered for a long time as the best tribute ever made for a friend, and for that, this movie can't be anything but a 10/10."

Starting with the head on car collisions and the numerous one liners about family to the good five minute tribute that goes out to Paul in the end.<br/><br/>You will be reminded of the pain of never being able to see him on screen again. He was spectacular as ever and I have only the best of adjectives to describe how well suited he was for the role and no doubt, more sequels are on the way for the Dominic, Letty and crew but no one can ever reprise the role of Brian O Connor which is why it is justly shown that he retires from all the high octane action to taking care of his family with Mia.<br/><br/>There are, of course some of those jaw dropping scenes sprinkled generously in the trailers which will not leave you feeling completely disappointed. James Wan signature rolling the camera along the motion is worthy of mention, what better way to watch Statham and the Rock throwing those punches.<br/><br/>But really, your disappointment will quickly be replaced by an emotional melancholy feeling, and it is only fitting.<br/><br/>His words to Toretto ""Did you really think I would leave without saying goodbye"" will get to you more than you think it will.<br/><br/>Do not miss this one."

I teared up after that wonderful farewell which did justice to the tragic demise of Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one not to be missed."

","Furious 7 is latest movie in the fast and furious series. Furious 7 takes place after fast 3(Tokyo drift), Deckard Shaw is going after the team for revenge of his brother. There is another subplot that's important but overall it's about Deckard Shaw going out for revenge. First off, you can't believe anything that happens in this. Everything they do makes them seem like superheroes. The action is so over the top but it is still so fun to watch. There's also lots of one liners, that Are funny.The cast is great, there are so many people this time like Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Ronda Rousey and lots more. They all have small parts but it's great seeing them in this series. Now the ""team"" is also great. Tyrese Gibson is funny as always. The Rock is in the movie for a little but I wish he had a bigger role in it. Now Paul Walker, it is very sad what happen to him and I feel like the cast and crew of furious 7 did an Amazing job of saying goodbye to Him. He was a great person in and out of movies. Overall furious 7 had lots of crazy and fun moments but had an amazing tribute to Paul. Go and support this movie."
"agblum","8","4","9","2 April 2015"," Good Fun, and A Wonderful Legacy for Paul Walker!
","""Furious 7"" is the latest in ""The Fast and The Furious"" Franchise, whose production was halted due to the tragic death of Paul Walker, who played the co-lead, character of ""Brian O'Conner"" in the series, along with Vin Diesel's ""Dominic Toretto"". Reportedly less than half of Walker's scenes had been completed at the time of his passing. Through digital magic, Walker's two brothers, who closely resemble him, stepping in for him at points in the film, and re-writes, production then resumed, and now the film, Walker's last – is out. I hadn't seen one of movies at the time of I heard of Walker's passing. I watched all the previous shortly thereafter. While there are flaws, some cheesy Dialogue at times, etc., the movie to me are just guilty pleasures, simply meant for fun – And I really like or love each one. ""Furious 7"" is no different. Car chases,fight scenes, laugh out loud moments from Tyrese Gibson as ""Roman"" in particular, the theme of family, and Kurt Russell's ""Mr. Nobody"" is a great addition. Yes, there are some unbelievable moments, but it's fun, and you don't care. Without spoiling it - The exit for Walker's character is handled with class as reported. Will there be more? There is one aspect that is left open-ended, and the plan was for 10. I predict there will an 8th, or they will spin-off Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson's character of ""Hobbs"", as has been a past rumored, and pick up that story line that was left open in that film. For this movie, a wonderful legacy for Paul Walker, May he rest in Peace – 3 ¼ out of 4 Stars – 8 1/4 out of 10 Stars."

Ronda rousey & Tony jha even though in special appearances, do pack a punch!<br/><br/>Paul walker who is missed badly, shows up one last time as brian o conner and lives up to the role once again.

","I love the first two parts of the movie series.<br/><br/>Today I went to the cinema to watch the film and it was great! Some scenes were a little bit to boring because of this excessively action sequences. But at the end it was really touching.<br/><br/>I cry and tears running over my face when they see off to Paul Walker (Brian O'Connor) at this epic end scene. It was fantastic and I want to say thank you for this great row of movies and this long time of accompaniment of my childhood and my life. I hope that this was the last part of this movie series. Because it was a perfect ending and now they only could mess up this thing.<br/><br/>So when you liked Fast & Furious from the beginning or like cars and action or if you only want a film which touches you when you can something connect with Paul Walker... then go into this film and enjoy it!"

","Fights, races, lots of humor and explosions. Fast 7 has everything you could wish for. There were some scenes which where a little bit too much, but Fast 6 and 5 had those too. All actors did a good job and of course Jason Statham stands out most of the time.<br/><br/>We all knew there would be parts where Paul Walker would be replaced with body doubles and some CGI content, but that was very hard to find. They made this movie an amazing tribute to Paul and I had goosebumps during the last scene. Skylar Grey produced a wonderful song which suited the scene perfectly and the end couldn't be done better than the way they did it.<br/><br/>Paul deserved a tribute like this.<br/><br/>Go see this movie. It won't disappoint you!"
"CinemaCocoa","4","3","6","13 April 2017"," When did this series forget it is about cars?
","I want to make it clear, first and foremost, anyone dying is a tragic thing, Paul Walker was far too young and his career was only just beginning. I don't want my opinion of this film to be considered disrespectful.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is so, so far from what the franchise used to be that I found myself ceasing to care. When did this series forget it is about cars?<br/><br/>Set after the events of Fast and Furious 6, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his friends, excuse me ""family"", become targets for Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is out for revenge after they killed his brother. Toretto's team is recruited by a shadowy covert operation to hunt Shaw down, but to do so they need a device called The God Eye, a computer hacking tool that can simultaneously access all of the cameras in the world.<br/><br/>This film has excessive action sequences, often running for twenty minutes or more at a time, explosions, attack helicopters, predator drones, hundreds of half naked women everywhere, flashy cars for no reason at all, bad jokes, product placement, over-long running time and most of all lazy writing. Sounds familiar right? Yet unlike many Michael Bay films this gets a free pass from critics?? This is appalling.<br/><br/>At first I had high hopes; the opening features Dom attempting to remind his Amnesia-saddled girlfriend Letty of her past by taking her to Race Wars (a key moment in the first film) as well as his visit to Tokyo and speaking to the forgotten lead actor Lucas Black from the third film Tokyo Drift. An early bout between Statham and Dwayne Johnson's returning Agent Hobbs was also excellent.<br/><br/>But it lost me after the sky-diving cars (yes, sky-diving cars, if you haven't seen the trailer) when our heroes, for the most redundant reason ever, must go to Abu Dhabi. After a manic mountainside battle they somehow go to Dubai in the flashiest super cars which even Toretto wouldn't drive. A Bugatti Veyron, seriously? Where did they get one of those? From the local Dubai Veyron rental service?? Going to Dubai is because a chip required for the God Eye device had been installed in a super car literally no reason why. This makes the sixth movies' idea of putting a valuable microchip inside a tank inside an armoured motorcade seem believable!<br/><br/>But why all of this nonsense? Why do we need a God Eye device? Because Jason Statham's character is so skilled that he can virtually teleport around the world completely untraceable. Or as I like to call it: lazy writing.<br/><br/>The film is a constant, constant battlefield after the first twenty minutes. Not only do we have Statham appearing randomly throughout, but we also have Djimon Hounsou as a a bad man? The character development is astounding. We have his stock Asian martial artist, as well as a random burly woman in a dress for Michelle Rodriguez to fight once.<br/><br/>This film is just immature nonsense; a weird mash of Mission Impossible, Michael Bay films and The Expendables.<br/><br/>The action sequences when appreciated in isolation are impressive, that scene in Abu Dhabi is awesome and certainly something I've never seen before But I need story substance and narrative cohesion to care; the Fast films used to have some semblance of structure to them, now its just a barrage of noise."

Thank you for listening to the fans who wanted to see more of the Dom and Letty relationship! The DOTTY flashback was awesome! Letty was beautiful and that scene between she and Dom was my icing on the cake of this installment. Michelle Rodriguez just killed it; her performance in this movie was excellent! Hope going forward we will get to see more of her. She has proved her ability to not only exceed expectations as a loyal, hard-working member of the team but also showcase another skill set - the woman has ""Hands"" - the fight seen was amazing! <br/><br/>I also enjoyed watching them move in multiple social circles and fit in perfectly. It was about time we get to see them in evening wear! They became multi-millionaires in F&F6 and still we are expected to believe they can't, or won't, dress in anything but jeans & t-shirts? I am simply thrilled they are finally expanding the teams reach so they can class up the crew!!!

","When Paul Walker died on November 30, 2013, and the filming of Furious 7 was not complete, I'm sure many were wondering how they were going to finish it. Well with being delayed a year for rewrites and for filming to be finished, director James Wan delivers in this epic conclusion with crazy action sequences and heartfelt moments that are notorious in Fast & Furious movies.<br/><br/>After taking down Owen Shaw in Furious 6, Dom and his crew are free; living in Los Angeles and elsewhere enjoying the lives they've worked hard to achieve. Little do they know that Shaw's older brother Deckard is hot on their trail and after killing Han, crippling Hobbs, and blowing up the. Toretto house, the crew realizes they need to stop Him.<br/><br/>Dom and his crew, with the help of Frank Petty, embark on a mission to rescue hacker Ramsey and her device The God's Eye from mercenary Dakande, which will help them find Shaw. What follows are two of the most brilliantly choreographed and edited action sequences in the franchise: the first being jumping out the plane in cars and parachuting to the ground and the second being the race through the Caucasus Mountains. After rescuing Ramsey, they travel to Abu- Dhabi to get The Gods Eye, where they manage to destroy a penthouse and jump three buildings in a car. However, they lose God's Eye to Dakande while trying to find Shaw.<br/><br/>Returning to Los Angeles for their final battle, the final 30 minutes of the movie are non- stop action sequences: either Dom and Shaw' fight on the parking garage or Dakande chasing Brian, Ramsey, Tej, Letty, and. Roman throughout the streets of LA causing havoc and destroying anything in his way. With the help of a ""less-injured"" Hobbs, Dakande and his men are killed and Shaw is apprehended and brought to a maximum detention facility.<br/><br/>Dom and his crew return to a normal life, and after Letty regains her memory everything is alright. The movie ends with Dom and Brian going their separate ways; a fitting end to a terrific franchise. The death of Paul Walker was beyond tragic, but that did not stop his friends and family from giving him a just farewell in a franchise he helped built.<br/><br/>Very good movie for the circumstances in which it was made. Rest in Peace Paul Walker"
"YJLcool","8","3","6","3 April 2015"," A film that has high entertainment value, delivers on all fronts and a brilliant last ride for Paul Walker.
","The Fast & Furious series is back again with its seventh latest ""furiouser"" installment, Furious 7. The series has changed a lot over the years...first about illegal street racing in Los Angeles, then a serious heist thriller and now a global spy thriller. (Yes, you heard me! The gang are now turned into international secret military operatives!) Over the years, the franchise has always been delivering on what they promised: bombastic action, hot babes in bikinis and lots of sports cars... with recent installments more focused on the main characters, making each of them individually defined enough to be easily recognized on screen.<br/><br/>http://yjcool.blogspot.com/2015/04/movie-review-furious-7.html<br/><br/>This film is also director James Wan's (mostly directed horror films like Saw, The Conjuring, Insidious) first go at the franchise, and there are subtle changes compared to the last four films, which were previously helmed by Justin Lin (who's moved on to direct the next Star Trek film). Needless to say, this has got to be the most epic, extravagant, ridiculous yet jaw-dropping, action-packed, emotional film in the franchise. In this film, the team tries to take down the dangerous ex-black ops British terrorist Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the brother of Owen Shaw (the villain in the previous installment, played by Luke Evans) who comes for revenge. In order to find and track him down, they need to assist in securing a kidnapped hacker from a terrorist group.<br/><br/>The film is constantly filled with tension and excitement despite its slightly long running time (2 hours and 20 minutes). The impressive, absurd yet glorious stunt-filled action sequences featured in this film will definitely keep the audience glued to the screen. They able to both match and even top the efforts of its previous installments. Aside from the usual sport cars that many viewers of the franchise used to be seeing in the past, there are more luxurious supercars being used this time around: Bugatti Veyron, Ferrari, Aston Martin, Maserati, Lamborghini, and the exclusive $3.4 million Lykan HyperSport. There are also a few comic relief scenes with Roman (Tyrese Gibson) as well to relief some of tension between the action sequences.<br/><br/>The team have good chemistry with each other and the film does have a plot, albeit a simple one. As usual, Vin Diesel still bring his 'alpha' leadership to the team, Paul Walker as his right-hand man with life experiences as an FBI agent, Michelle Rodriguez as his racing support/lover-'miss alpha', Dwayne Johnson as the team's 'muscle man support'/connection to the police, Chris Bridges as the tech guy, Tyrese Gibson as the comic relief. There's also a new female addition to the team, Ramsey, a highy attractive hacker who's also the key to the film's MacGuffin. The inclusion of Thai martial artist Tony Jaa (Ong Bak) and mixed martial artist Ronda Rousey (The Expendables 3) also add flavour to the close-combat fight action scenes in the film as well.<br/><br/>However, the film is not without its problems. The franchise's biggest problem has always been the lack of compelling, memorable villains. The same can be said for this one as well. There are two villains this time around and they were constantly sidelined most of the time by each other and the big action sequences. The characters are not well developed enough, which is a waste. There are some plot contrivances here and there and some dialogues in certain scenes are particularly cheesy and corny, which I think viewers of the franchise would get used to them by now.<br/><br/>The film also provides the audience a nice sendoff and tribute to Paul Walker at the end. Another major problem for the film is the tragic untimely death of Paul Walker during the film production (everyone should know by now that Paul died in a car accident last year halfway through filming), which forced the studio to hire Walker's brothers to step in and that CGI would be used for his face and voice. All in all, the film has high entertainment value, delivers on all fronts and a brilliant last ride for Paul Walker."
"captainmike-michael","9","3","6","2 April 2015"," Best Entry since Fast 5 and a Great Tribute for Paul Walker
","As ridiculous as it's always, James Wan steps in with a lot of surprise without revealing much in the trailers for the Furious fans base, proofing that the risk of franchise fatigue can be excluded as long as the the story keeps moving into new directions. The story succeeds by maintaining perfectly the racing cultures, hilarious fun and unstoppable action sequences from its predecessors, expanding into an explosive scale that audiences might feel that it owns some shades of Mission Impossible and The Dark Knight trilogy. Engagement achieved in this 15-year-old franchise plays an essential factor in delivering unexpected plot, good performance, characters development, cinematography, stunning visual effects, thrilling races and blasting fight; even Brian Tyler puts in an extreme heartfelt effort to bring more stylish, adrenaline-driven, impulsive yet emotional soundtracks. This seventh attempt of speeding appears to be the best entry since Fast 5, with an exception that the beautifully crafted ending may seems perfect as the final film, not only triggering the tears of audiences, but also intentionally a metaphor farewell to beloved Brian O'Conner and an impressive tribute for Paul Walker."

","GOD this movie was terrible!!<br/><br/>First of all, it was ALL action with the most generic and cheesy plot line ever. Like really, some guy wants to find some chip which gives you ultimate hacking abilities and it's oh so powerful? PLEASE. That is incredibly dumb and cookie cutter and like, there's literally nothing original or interesting about that plot a LOT. Way to fail in originality. <br/><br/>Secondly, the action scenes themselves were dumb and defied all physics. Like actually though. The scene where Paul Walker is trapped in a bus that's very obviously gonna fall off a cliff, and he manages to climb it and survive because the chick just HAPPENED to get there in time? So stupid. Also, CARS FALLING FROM A PLANE AT A VERY HIGH ALTITUDE AND THEY ALL SURVIVE AND HAVE NO IN JURIES? What??? Like with that speed..and having their windows open like that, it makes literally no sense. Like, they would've DIED!! It was really stupid. There were several more action scenes and fight scenes that made no sense (such as the car going through three buildings in Dubai), but I'm not gonna name all of them. They were just all dumb and shot for people with no brains and who like movies that are all about ""the spectacle"" and not about substance whatsoever. This was a movie made for stupid people or people that hate thinking when watching movies, and don't critically analyze life. Literally, the kinds of people that are basic as hell.<br/><br/>Also, oh my god, every character had the WORST one-liners and on top of that, there was this cringe-worthy ""family"" theme that had no actual substance. It was like the directors were trying really hard to get feels out of the audience, but with terrible one liners and a cheesy plot line, it was just so bad that it was actually impossible to feel anything other than sourness and cringe when watching the movie.<br/><br/>ALSO, what the heck, the amount of testosterone in this movie is actually ridiculous. Like, objectifying women from the opening scenes. Way to market to your male crowd by reproducing a patriarchal bias. Ugh and it was so disgusting when the hacker girl was being treated as a sexual object by two of the main characters. Furthermore, i love how the two main female characters are SO dependent on their male counterparts. Like, one girl is pregnant and doesn't want to tell her husband because apparently being pregnant is too much for him too handle? And she deals with it alone because she's a woman right? And then of COURSE the other chick who's actually involved in action-packed scenes has amnesia and relies on Vin Diesel's character to find her self-worth and reason for doing things. <br/><br/>Honestly i could go on and on, but everything about the movie was so dumb. Like it was the most mindless piece of crap seller-movie that I've ever seen *cringe*. Literally making use of ""The Spectacle"" and the fact that people actually want this to win an Oscar for Best Picture MAKES ME LAUGH. That's actually the dumbest thing and most laughable thing I've ever heard!"
"iliepalex","2","10","31","4 April 2015"," Wow, what a piece of s....t
","I think this movie is taking advantage of Paul walker's death, the storyline is non-existent (they save Ramsey from the black guy, and she tells them that the drive with the program is in abu dhabi, there is not connection from azerbaijan to abu dhabi, they meet directly with the other hacker, they enter directly in the party)the characters are stupid (vin diesel doesn't talk he only is speaking in quotes, kind like David caruso in csi Miami, Paul walker is in CGI all over the place, because Paul walker is in CGI, all the actors in the movie are a little cgi like in 300. To much action, very little logic in the action. <br/><br/>So at the end i give 2 as a grade because the movies was very very bad, they were sure that they will make money when Paul walker died. they were sure that everyone will go see the movie."
"KineticSeoul","6","12","39","10 April 2015"," It has it's entertainment value
","Well this was a entertaining flick, but it does get really tiresome. I just really wanted to like this movie, since it's the sendoff movie for Paul Walker. But just got out of the theater feeling like it's just another average high budget action movie. That does have it's entertainment value, but is still easily forgettable. Now this series took a turn for something else starting with ""Fast Five"" with it focusing more on the action, missions and carnage over racing. So if I had to rate this movie from ""Fast Five"" which is my personal favorite in the franchise so far. I would have to say this is a tie with ""Fast 6"" since 6 had better elements when it comes to the directing, the story which is slightly better and more elements actually involving manuerability of the cars. This one has a slight edge when it comes to the entertainment value, so in a way this movie is slightly a guilty pleasure for me. I know they were trying to keep this movie light and fun despite all the carnage, but the humor in this really does flop. Like they were trying to be funny by going overboard but just comes off weak. I personally think Justin Lin is a better director than James Wan. Or maybe that has to do with the fact that Justin Lin stayed on longer with this franchise, anyways I liked the directing style of Lin better. But props to Wan for tackling his first super high budget Hollywood movie. When it comes to this installment, it's like Wan thought up different ways of how many times a car can drive off a high place and how many times people can jump out of a moving vehicle. Since the chase scenes has been done quite a lot in the previous two installments. I personally lost count when it comes to that. However I think Wan also though up fights that the fans would want. Like Jason Statham vs. The Rock, Jason Statham vs. Vin Diesel and Ronda Rousey fighting some other protagonist. The constant pushing in the romance between Dom and Letty just made the movie drag and is probably the most boring part about this movie. Sure it can have a bit o romance, but let's focus on the main plot. Cause the romance in this is stale and far from being immersive. The scene stealer in this is Jason Statham, cause he is by far the most badass villain this franchise has had so far. Which is a shame since it felt like he had less screen time and interactions than Luke Evans. Overall this is a entertaining action movie that is worth a watch, despite it getting really tiresome near the end.<br/><br/>6.8/10"
"white_water","4","12","39","2 April 2015"," Huge disappointment after the last two movies
","Fast & Furious 7 feels like an episode of a soap opera that has been on air way too long. Almost all of the fun and excitement that Justin Lin somehow managed to bring to the series with 5 and 6 is gone and instead we get a messy series of very confusing and nauseating action scenes that are so over the top that they wouldn't feel out of place in a comic book movie. Some will like that, I get it. But I miss the times when every movie did not end in a bloated CGI-set piece that goes on for 30 minutes and everything is destroyed. Also the word ""nauseating"" is very important. During most of the action scenes I had no idea what was happening on screen thanks to the shaking and the editing. James Wan also likes to do this thing where he tilts the camera which I'll admit sometimes looks good (I liked this in The Conjuring) but it DOES NOT work here. I sat pretty front in the theater and whenever the camera tilted like that I felt nauseous. That is not a problem everybody will have but I'd say don't sit very front in the theater. The storyline is extremely confusing and FF7 feels like two movies edited into one. I'm sorta willing to forgive them for it for two reasons. 1) It's clearly because Paul Walker died. 2) It's a Fast & Furious movie. What I won't give a pass on is bad action and Furious 7 is filled with that. Isn't that the big thing about action movies? They should have good action scenes. I also think that the change from Lin to James Wan was a bad call. FF7 looks and sounds like a Fast & Furious movie but Wan just doesn't nail the tone. There are couple exciting parts. Whenever The Rock shows up the movie is suddenly good. It's too bad he's in it for like 10 minutes. Tony Jaa also makes a brief appearance. He sure can fight, too bad whoever was filming and editing those fights did a terrible job. Now I saved the best for last. KURT RUSSELL is in Furious 7. Kurt Russell. Perhaps my favorite actors of all time. He has a very brief role but he looks like he's having lots of fun. He could have totally phoned in that performance, it's a really small role but like The Rock whenever Kurt Russell gets to be Kurt Russell he just lights up the screen. He has one scene that is actually so badass that I actually got chills. Too bad it's like 5 seconds long. So how to fix Fast & Furious 8? Strip it down a lot. No need for all that excessive action. If it were up to me, I would just do a buddy cop movie with Kurt Russell and The Rock."
"markus-s-englund","7","10","33","1 April 2015"," Fans of the series will be pleased
","I went to a midnight screening yesterday and everyone in the theater seemed to have a great time. The highlight was undoubtedly the parachuting-scene that is extensively featured in the trailers. It is the most ridiculous and arguably the best action set piece in the entire series, narrowly beating out the bank vault chase from Fast five.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film fails to achieve that same level of excitement again. The big action scene at the end is quite unimaginative for a fast&furious-movie and goes on for way too long. Over-reliance on CGI also hurts the movie, since it's not always completely convincing.<br/><br/>Most of you will know that some of Paul Walkers scenes were made using his brothers as stand-ins combined with CGI. I'm glad to say they completely pulled it off. I personally never noticed anything off about Brian in the movie. I'm not going to spoil how Brian's journey ends, but I can say that it's a fitting and respectful goodbye to both Walker and his character of Brian. It gets really emotional."

Pretty much all manner of random stuff involving cars, plus, to a much smaller extent, other stuff, with no real link between one scene and the next.<br/><br/>As you can tell, there is really nothing plausible or even good about this movie. Just random action scenes, generally involving cars, strung together. Absolutely nothing makes sense, or even tries to make sense - the plot is that non-existent.<br/><br/>Hammy acting to go with the lack of plot and torrent of ridiculous action scenes. Not that surprising, considering the cast. Kurt Russell is capable of a lot better though.<br/><br/>Clearly made for people who just need explosions and fast cars to be entertained.

","I am typing this out as I am watching this ""film"" and it is so completely seizure inducing and devoid of any plot or logic it's an embarrassment to legitimate films everywhere.

Impossible scenarios, indestructible human beings, zero humor, I felt like I was watching a 2-hour Snoop Dogg video. How about this gem for dialogue...Ludicrous: you said dibs what are you in the 4th grade? 5 seconds later...let's Rock, Paper, Scissors for it.

"jaygarcia367","8","4","10","5 April 2015"," Honestly, I was a little disappointed.
","I'm not saying it was a terrible movie. There was just too much hype about this movie I expected this one to be ground breaking. Speaking as a fan of the franchise. I've enjoyed the direction the series has taken. The last few Furious films have been amazing. Especially the previous one. It had something the others didn't. The script had a lot of heart and soul, like the original Fast and Furious. I was expecting Furious 7 to be more like the original. Instead we get some hyped of version of Mission Impossible. It almost seemed like another generic summer blockbuster. This was a good hardcore action film but it was missing something. I feel the script was altered after Paul Walkers death. He was great in this film by the way. It just seemed like too much was cramped together to blind us from forgetting he was gone. With so much special effects the series has almost taken on a Transformers feel to it. I feel they should have toned that down a bit. But in the end this film will really only be remembered because of the untimely death of Paul Walker not because it was amazing or ground breaking. The only thing about the film that has stuck with me are the visuals not so much the story."

","In this action packed movie about a family of speed racers and the criminals they face there is literally not one scene in the second half of the movie that you can take your eyes off of. they incorporate comedy into a movie about shooting and racing and it works perfectly.<br/><br/>Now for the plot.<br/><br/>Dominic Toretto is part of the fast and furious family. He seeks out a man named Deckard Shaw who is trying to kill him and the rest of the squad. The reason Shaw wants to kill them is because they killed Shaw's brother and he wants revenge. but Shaw is hard to find so the gang will need tools and the one gadget that can find anyone..."" Gods Eye "". the team uses gods eye to track down Shaw but they don't kill him. Then Shaw gets the gadget and uses it to hunt the squad including a hacker called Ramsey. in the end they are in an explosive battle and Toretto and Shaw and in a big fist fight. I wont tell you who wins as you can probably guess, but during that fight Shaw's ""Sidekick"" Jakarde is in a helicopter shooting and firing missiles at Ramsey to stop her from hacking his system and getting Gods Eye. The team pulls off stunts to keep her safe and end up finishing the hack.

","Hello everyone,<br/><br/>Here I go again... but this time about something that was more furious than fast. Yeah, first of all, let me just tell y'all that I am no fan of this series, I'm quite the opposite of a fan-boy, but I have to say I really enjoyed the 7th one. Yes, this review will be more about how I saw the movie and not that much about the movie itself, but I think even the movie was like that, as I hope it changed immensely after the lose... I'm just saying this as I can already see how the 1000-word limit of IMDb reviews will restrict me again. The first restriction was on a joke I did, that worked out great, so it is like by design to be restricted again, but this time on an eulogy, of some sorts. So, let's start... it, by saying some of the most important things about this movie, and probably about the series, from my point of view:<br/><br/>1. He owns the fastest car in the world... but he keeps it in a vault!<br/><br/>2. Do you still miss the bullets?.. this time we don't need to be that fast!<br/><br/>3. I don't have friends... I have family!<br/><br/>4. I will not leave you... No, I'm leaving you!<br/><br/>5. Do you promise?... I promise!<br/><br/>6. If I don't call... you should go on!<br/><br/>7. You will live forever... through everything and everyone that have you!<br/><br/>I should stop now, as it seems 7 is a number to be held, and behold... but everything will go on, so why shouldn't we?! There are so many things I could say about this movie, but maybe everyone should go and see for themselves, or not... like we all do... eventually or never.<br/><br/>8. I remember everything now... It's about time!<br/><br/>Thank you all for being more Furious than Fast,<br/><br/>Seven Tytwo Junior<br/><br/>P.S. As a general... thing, even before anything happens, please keep in mind everything in this world still has all the cars, women, buffoons, computers, weapons, experts, shows, even explosions&special effects, but sometimes there's no need for any sex scenes... maybe just because, sometimes, all those things might mislead one's attention and could be harder to see through all of those what.... movies, and especially films, are all about."

","I saw this movie tonight, at 19:00 at Event Cinemas. I was looking forward to this movie before Paul Walker passed. Prolonging the release was horrible, but I'm glad they took the time to finish the franchise instead of throwing everything together and calling it quits.<br/><br/>The thing that stands out about the Fast and Furious (FnF) is how much the characters value themselves as family, NOT friends. The family aspect felt stronger than ever in FnF7, which brung Sean Boswell into play with Dom.<br/><br/>With a different director, the action shots & camera affects were better than every before seen in FnF. Fight scenes were amazing, though they could never top Dwayne Johnson & Vin Diesel! ;) Tyrese Gibson kept the comedy going while Vin Diesel dominated the drama side of things, and of course the action. The action was amazing, as always, and the cars were just as fast. No let downs there!<br/><br/>The most amazing thing about this movie, to me, was the archive footage of Paul Walker, which in fact was filmed by himself. (Some of it.) The last 5 - 10 minutes were the actors, relaxing on a beach, remembering Paul Walker, were they in character? That's up to you to decide.<br/><br/>This franchise couldn't of been as successful as it was without Paul Walker. He was an amazing person, and he couldn't have received a more touching goodbye. Rest In Peace, Paul."

","I was looking forward seeing this movie. Simply because I enjoy action flicks sometimes -- because of the simplicity. But the dialogues are so astoundingly bad that I had to throw up after 9 minutes. Literally. Well, 10 minutes rest and I gave it another try. I have seen a short, very unrealistic action sequence (if Force still is the factor of mass and acceleration, the two guys must have been killed each other 3 times in 1 minute) in which 2 people finally survived an explosion plus the resulting fall of about 5 meters. Through glass of course. Followed by a cliché scene in which we learn about the pregnancy of another character. This. Is. So. Wow. Nooooo!!! What the hell??? Do it as I did: don't see it at all. These were the worst first 15 minutest of an action movie that I will ever see."

And The ROCK gets a car (sort of) too! Plot is par for the course, slightly dumbed down for the audience of today. (E.g.

"bobscheer","3","9","31","6 April 2015"," A Spurious mash up of film and TV shows loses its own plot.
","Fast and Furious 7 or' Spurious Heaven' in my mind is, for millions of viewers, obviously, a whole lotta car smashin' fun, but for me it was just a pile of silly. Give me 'Need for Speed' and 'The Beverly Hillbillies' for more accessible car 'grunt'. Furious 7 is an overdose of film, TV and genre mash ups. It is Jackass meets James Bond or The Avengers/Guardians of the Galaxy/ Superfriends/ Agents of Shield meet Blofeld/ Jaws/Zoltar ... So what? Well, the series started off creating its own genre. Cool hipster car hoons pushing hotted up cars to their limits with a few human rights issues covered along the way for some heart. This hopefully final installment forgets all that and tries too hard with a silly McGuffin; 'God's eye' that gives total power to whoever can access it with a nice girl/ hot chick hacker nerd. At least this 'Bond Girl' didn't have to be bedded by the hero to stay in the film. I usually love Jason Statham's stock character, but his supervillian was low level pantomime Terminator and was just irritating. Kurt Russell appears as an Optimist Primo type and kits our heroes out in wannabe transformer cars and we go from one really silly set piece to another. The Rock puts his best Hulk on for some biffo. And there's even a Shrek Donkey appearance. I took a nap in the middle from all the gun muzzle flashes and explosions, just after the Mission Impossible Ghost Protocol bit.<br/><br/>The cast is all likable and it's great the gang is here for truly the last time but I wish the series had gone back to its roots rather than being a jacked up James Bond. <br/><br/>The best sequence was the final one as a moving tribute to Paul Walker used the perfect metaphor for this series. It is a tragedy that he had to take a different road and we will miss him from our screens. <br/><br/>Too much of a good thing? You bet your parachuting GI Joe cars it is."
"kunal_gupta","4","9","31","3 April 2015"," Fast - Because it has to be to cover the loopholes!
","Furious 7 is everything that you expect from this franchise - Cars, explosions, babes & logic-defying action sequences. Fast & Furious 6 set the bar for stupidity quite high with its infinite runway sequence, and thankfully, Furious 7 does NOT top that. The story is simple and linear. The crew members are happy and settled in their lives, when they are (obviously) pulled back into the world of cars and crime. It takes them 7 movies to travel to the world hub of luxury cars. Here any person who has, at any point of time in his life, had even the tiniest crush on an automobile, is bound to have an orgasm. A couple of bootys here, a couple of cars flying there and our minds are satiated with this part of the movie. After that we don't mind the dandiya sequence between Diesel and Statham. The performances are good, although Dwayne could have been given a little more screen time, and Jason could have been given a little more dialogue so that he wouldn't have looked like a glorified hit-man. The music is like the display of Nathalie Emmanuel's assets - it had potential, but it wasn't used. All in all, an expected addition to the franchise. The tribute to Paul Walker in the end, is what makes it special."
"blakiepeterson","8","3","7","2 May 2015"," An Action Movie That Gives The People What They Want
","Like fine wine and stinky French cheese, The Fast and the Furious franchise has gotten better with age. Upon its debut 14 years ago, it started as a bird-brained (but entertaining) action caper with one eye on a fast car and the other on a fast woman. Don't be mistaken — those attributes are still riding high as of 2015 — but beginning with 2011's Fast Five, the franchise had an epiphany. It realized that story lines, dialogue, acting, really anything artistic, was not its strong suit; action was. Ever since, the movies have transformed into well-oiled beasts in on the fun, light on plot and heavy on all things that involve an adrenaline hit. Furious 7, said to be the last of the franchise due to Paul Walker's tragic death in 2013, is the best of the bunch, providing for a fitting tribute to its leading man while giving the people what they want and then some.<br/><br/>Picking up right where Fast & Furious 6 left off, the crew returns to deal with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the vindictive brother of the last villain they defeated. Old friends return to join the fight as well as new faces, including Frank Petty (Kurt Russell), the head of a covert ops team, and Megan Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), a British hacker. Shaw has not come alone, though; on his side is dangerous mercenary Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou), and his massive team of agile henchman.<br/><br/>Whereas The Avengers work together because the government forces them to, the diverse, familial characters in Furious 7 align out of loyalty, respect. Now that we've gotten to know them for more than a decade, the chemistry between them is almost effortless, and in a movie as skimpy on plot as this one, a crackling compatibility is a good thing. The constant grunting about all things family by the hulking Vin Diesel still harbor enough cheesy sentimentality to cause an unintentional laugh here and there, but his feelings are warranted — with only a single main character out of the picture, something feels off. It's a movie that thrives on affinity.<br/><br/>Regardless of its newfound dramatic heave, though, Furious 7 is, first and foremost, about action. Containing sequences choreographed so impressively that suspense is basically inevitable, it would be impolite not to carry a suddenly quickened heartbeat on our sleeve. This is the kind of film where expensive cars are driven off private jets, pass through three (three!) skyscraper windows at high speed, and dive from cliffs with little to no injury to the driver. Keep in mind that these scenes sometimes last for ten minutes, thus torturing our serenity and collected calm. Fact is, Furious 7 isn't interested in appetizers; it skips straight to rich, hearty dessert.<br/><br/>Years ago, I would have never expected to find myself a fan of this dopey franchise. Lately, however, it's been hopeless to try and resist its electrifying zest. Furious 7 is a movie of polished, professional action. Fans won't be disappointed, and those seeking an adventure will find themselves more than pleased. Walker would be proud of the finished product — it would be hard not to be. <br/><br/>Read more reviews at petersonreviews.com"

"gavindwalsh","9","3","7","24 April 2015"," Top Action Movie. Touching Paul Walker Tribute.
","I have read some reviews banging on about how 'unrealistic' the whole plot of this movie is. Let's 'get real' here. Movies are about entertainment, about keeping us viewers on the edge of our seats, as well as making us want to see more. This move does exactly that for me.<br/><br/>The movie is jammed packed with action, from start to finish. The stunts, as always, are just out of this world. No, granted, you wouldn't be able to run up the side of a falling bus as it slides down the side of a cliff. But I bet you as well as I wish you could right? And no we couldn't dodge that amount of high spec weaponry and drive cars like the way they do in this film. But again, I bet you as well as I wish you could right?<br/><br/>What is with all the negativity? You want to be entertained, not sit there yawning while scratching your backside drifting off, dribbling into your own lap. 'Get real' How boring would it be to sit and watch things that happen is every day life? We have the soaps for all that! I dread to think what your review would be on the Terminator franchise LOL <br/><br/>For me, the acting was again superb by all of the main cast. And Kurt Russell is just as good as ever in my opinion. All the stunts were very well executed, the fight scene choreography was also very thrilling to watch. All in all I think it's a very entertaining, and in parts touching film. <br/><br/>The tribute at the end was a very fitting, and moving scene for Paul, who was a fine actor. Not only in this franchise but also in any other film I have seen him in. He was a very big talent and will be greatly missed in the industry. I don't mind admitting the bit of leakage I had from my eyelids viewing the end. RIP Paul Walker.<br/><br/>I'm looking forward to the next 'unrealistic' instalment of this highly entertaining franchise. Chris Morgan is a very talented writer. The kind I aspire to be just like one day. For me, this was $190m well spent!!"

","Spoiler! You will be entertained! Though I thought it should be Fast 7, furious 7 worked out well enough. Paul Walker is not the star of franchise, he is just an original cast member. Having said that he did a good job. They all did a good job. The camera time was shared nicely and it's an expendable of driving cars. The action scenes are nicely done and entertaining. The story is easy to follow. The plans are a little out there and the execution of said plans is even more way out there (typical for this franchise). You will laugh, you will get excited, you may even have anxiety at some points and if you are sentimental you'll sigh at some points. But overall it's an entertaining movie that is worth your money and your time and for pop culture references."

","The movie enthralled all viewers by including as many unrealistic stunts as possible through out the movie - whilst completely unrealistic it did give that extra wow factor to the movie.<br/><br/>No expense seemed spared when it came to the cars and helicopters used - truly stunning vehicles aimed to make you lust after the cars.<br/><br/>There were many cliff hangers due to the unfortunate death of Paul Walker, throughout the movie you were sat at the forefront of your seat every time something dangerous happened, wondering how or if they would kill off Brian's Character.<br/><br/>I think they may have rewrote some aspects of the dialog as some scenes seemed aimed at Pauls death and saying goodbye to family, I'm glad that they chose to have him as an underlining theme to the sequel - this definitely pulled at your heart strings though! Overall the film is a standard Fast and the Furious; unbelievable stunts, some poor dialog, underlining themes of family & similar story line as previous movies.<br/><br/>What puts this as a good movie is the way the directors and characters have created an ending to the character Brian without tarnishing the name Paul Walker. The ending tribute credits make for an emotional ending but overall they have respected him as a character and a person.<br/><br/>A must see if you love cars, action and unbelievable fight scenes."

","I can't get the ending out of my head, I cried at the ending of this film. It is a perfect tribute to the late star Paul Walker. With an excellent soundtrack, a montage of his work in this franchise and the power of family and friendship echoed in the most touching ending ever, even the hardest of hearts will crumble.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is incredible, with outrageously entertaining death defying stunts and emotion help to bring it down to earth. James Wan was the perfect choice to take over Justin Lin, his camera-work and style is so sleek and jaw dropping with every single part of the action captured with intensity, most noticeably the plane drop and following car chase alongside a steep mountain.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is a total bad-ass as Deckard Shaw, an unforgettable movie antagonist. Newcomers Nathalie Emmanuel, Tony Jaa, Djimon Hounsou, Kurt Russell couldn't be anymore perfectly fitted to their roles, each bringing wit, style and new challenges for the Furious crew. I absolutely loved Ronda Rousey's appearance as a bodyguard, her presence boasts authority and immediate cool, she looks great and kicks some serious ass, plus Iggy Azalea's cameo was short lived but I'm a fan, nice little touch.<br/><br/>I have no faults with this film, Vin Diesel, The Rock and crew give performances that in my opinion are a perfect balance of emotion, wit and passion, Jordana Brewster and Michelle Rodriguez especially. I'm hoping this film crosses the billion dollar mark, it deserves too."
"Nicknielsen99","10","3","7","4 April 2015"," Royal Ending to Paul's Legacy
","In 2001, on screen emerged the young talents of Paul Walker. At the time, Paul Walker's career wasn't truly glimmering in the spotlight. Yet, when he stepped into character as Brian O'Conner, thus it began. Through 5 other thrilling installments in the ""Fast and Furious"" franchise, he grew up, and grew into the role as Brian. However, Furious 7 was a spectacular conclusion. For those unaware, Paul passed away in November of 2013, and all Furious fans, and Paul Walker fans; like myself, were devastated. Yet, the ""family"" of Paul, being Vin Diesel, Tyrese, Ludicrous, and many others, kept his legacy going, and wanted to end it respectfully. The movie itself was my personal favorite, other than 2 Fast, 2 Furious. It had a mix of comedy provided by Roman(Tyrese), but it kept the message that ""Family is everything."" Brian O'Conner throughout the movie seemed like the same man we saw back in 2001.(Except without the baggy shirts, and jeans). Yet, this finale(hopefully) was the best yet. It had a better balance of action, racing, and of course the ladies. Now, the whole plot is that Deckard Shaw, brother of paralyzed Owen Shaw, seeks revenge on the people who did this to his brother. His goal is to get rid of all of Dominic Toretto's(Vin Diesel) family. The entire movie is layered with action sequences, fast scenes, and even faster cars, and the same sex appeal that has been there throughout the series. Overall, I would say it is an 8/10. Some scenes lacked realism, yet that is what to expect, but the overall plot, and ""bond"" carried the film. The best part in this review is the honoring of Paul Walker at the end. All I will say is that it had myself, and the majority of the theater crying. Tears streamed down my face as I realized it was the end of a legacy. Sure these movies may not be the ""Oscar quality"" type, but to me they are as important. RATING: 8/10. RECOMMENDATION: This film is rated PG-13 for loads of violence, swearing, and some partial nudity. OVERALL: I would definitely recommend this film to everyone, whether you grew up with the ""Family"", or you want to enjoy a memorable ride. It is FANTASTIC! PS- May Paul Walker rest in peace, and may his legacy continue racing forever."

They just make every stunt performed look way too easy and going in and out of a foreign country is just a breeze. Authorities are absolutely clueless most of the time and just let the good and bad guys shoot each other and drive off. Gravity is a thing for people with normal jobs and why drive on streets while you can simply hit it and fly over.<br/><br/>I am definitely not recommending this title to anyone.

","The seventh installment in the Fast & Furious franchise sees the return of Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) as two mercenaries specializing in fast cars. This time the film begins with them resting on their laurels, but their past exploits are about to catch up with them.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is probably the most interconnected of the Fast & Furious films. It really requires you to have seen the previous films, or at least it heavily rewards you having done that. Everything from the individual character arcs to the villain himself are building upon the events of the past films and I bet the film would be rather difficult to follow if you haven't seen them. But that's definitely a point in the film's favour, not a weakness.<br/><br/>The film's strengths are those of the franchise. It has style in abundance, most of all. It has fast cars, cool soundtrack, suave characters, great actors, hot chicas, high octane action scenes, spy stuff and the kitchen sink as well. And the addition of Jason Statham to the ensemble cast only strengthened the formula.<br/><br/>Regrettably, Paul Walker, one of the two main leads of the franchise, passed away in a car accident during the filming of the film. The film was completed using his two brothers as stand-ins, and if you didn't know that, you absolutely wouldn't notice. The film's script was also reworked a little bit in order to retire Brian as a character, and it's a fitting, touching send-off to a great character. Full marks.<br/><br/>I still maintain that Fast Five is my favourite movie in the franchise so far, and after that I'd probably go with the first one, but this one would be a close third."

","For the absolutely most part I really enjoyed this action movie.<br/><br/>This is exactly the kind of action that I really like. Extreme action. Action that does not try to be ""realistic"" at all. Over the top action. (and I really hate people that can't accept extreme action, they be all like: ""yeah, right, that's SO unrealistic""! Dumb people.<br/><br/>Here's what I don't like. I have to say I have a slight problem with Vin Diesel. I mean, he's alright, it's just, compared to Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham, he's just, well he kind of pales in comparison. His character is also slightly annoying. With his family-talk all the god damn time. We get it, you're into family, the only thing that matters is family, your little gang is family. Family. Family. And hose gravelly grunts he speaks in, ain't cool bruh. Sometimes you can barely make out what he is saying.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to portray him as super strong, which I don't totally buy. He's a big guy, but not that big. He looks like he thinks he's bigger than he is. Compared to the monster that is The Rock, he looks like a skinny twig for Petes sake. And he, Vin Diesel, is lifting cars and tossing people several yards, I just don't buy it.<br/><br/>Also there's some other stuff that I didn't like. There's this ""computer chip"" with some insane technology, and it seemed a little out of place. That stuff was straight up sci/fi. I hate when they mix sci/fi-stuff into action movies that are set today. The plot has some issues, but I choose not to care too much.<br/><br/>OK, got that out of the way. This movies has perfectly shot, exciting, over the top-action. Several big, long action scenes, and I pretty much loved all of them. And since this is an action movie first and foremost, I won't let the negative stuff count all that much. I was very entertained.<br/><br/>There are a couple of 'jump-out-of-a-car-in-slow-motion, at-the-last-millisecond, with-a-one-in-a-billion-chance-of-making-it'- scenes that for some reason gives me goosebumps a little. Probably because they are so over the top. I love that stuff. I think of who ever came up with something so over-the-top, and get a little impressed. Good job!<br/><br/>Good thinking getting Jason Statham into this, I so rooted for him. He is way cooler than the whole furious-team.<br/><br/>And that Nathalie Emmanuel, holy gasoline fumes is she gorgeous. And she speaks nineteen languages, including Dothraki, what a catch!<br/><br/>And of course, we all know Paul Walker is no longer with us, and you're reminded of that each time he is on screen. He gets a little montage at the end, it is very well done - really sad, man. Real damn sad."

Also in the final scene we see Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) Letty (Michele Rodriguez) Roman (Tyrese Gibson) Tej (Ludacris) Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) sitting on the beach and looking at Brian O'conner with sad looks and it is understood that they are not acting, but their sadness is real and they think back to Paul Walker who died in that terrible car accident.
Finally a song in memory of Paul starts with some scenes of all the episodes where he was present and finally Vin Diesel in the car reached by car by Paul Walker will see one of his brothers, who run together the last race and then their paths divide<br/><br/>During the filming of this film, Paul Walker died in that car accident and was replaced by Paul's 2 brothers with Paul's face processed on the computer, during the film I noticed from the face when unfortunately Paul was replaced.<br/><br/>WE WILL NEVER SEE IT AGAIN<br/><br/>Too bad that these words recited by Vin Diesel want to make it clear that Paul Walker is unfortunately no longer there and we will never see him again in the next films of this saga.<br/><br/>GOODBYE PAUL, WHO FOLLOWED THE FAST & FURIOUS SERIES, WILL NEVER FORGET YOU."

","This movie officially bombards the audience with an explosion of adrenaline with breathtaking scenes in the audience. Especially in the red car, Vin and Paul did a legendary job, let alone the old series even in other movies.
Cars are already great as usual. The action scenes with cars are much more unique than the old series. Paul Walker, on the other hand, plays in the movie as if he is not dead. They did a very good job at making metaphors. They brought integrity to the script. It was good for integrity to put cross sections from Tokyo drift. But what I don't like is that they gave very little role to a guy like Dwayne Johnson in this movie. Unfortunately, Dwayne made little appearance in front of our eyes, as she was hospitalized by kicking a man, slapping, and being hospitalized for a long time."

I'd say my biggest gripe is with Tyrese Gibson's character, Roman. Why is he even in these films? I know he's supposed to be the comic relief, but honestly, do you think a professional team would keep a guy that does nothing but whine and complain, and can't even offer any benefit to the team besides being an annoying, loud-mouthed braggart? It's silly to think that above everything, high flying stunts included, that's the part that's hardest to believe for me.<br/><br/>RIP Paul Walker.

The introduction of Jason Statham confirms officially this evolution as before did the entrance of Dwayne Johnson. And in fact the movie is full of long, predictable fights with or without arms where those that in the firsts film were pilots now are kind of ninja or 007: I really don't understand how Dominic Toretto can raise a car just with his hands or destroy the street with the foot.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the movie is a sufficient action, that forgets the most part of its supercar movie and concentrate all its efforts producing a commercial ""sparatutto"", with all the negative points of a entertaining movie (bad dialogues, annoying irony, superficial characters etc)."

"mitchell5954","7","0","0","17 August 2019"," A Good Sendoff To Paul Walker
","Furious 7 is a solid entry in the Fast and Furious franchise but it's, by no means, spectacular. I know you shouldn't expect too much from one of these movies, but, while, I liked and had fun with the film, I still think it's not on the same tear as the previous two movies. This is now the highest-rated movie of the franchise on Rotten Tomatoes and I don't think it warrants that. While I can definitely say I enjoyed this more than the first four installments I think it not as good as Fast Five or Six. The story has two main faults that put it bellow those films for me.<br/><br/>The film does many things right. It is a lot of fun despite by grips with it. Vin Diesel and the rest (for the most part) reprise their roles here and they do a pretty good job. The effects, like in the last two films are very well-done as well.<br/><br/>I also love what they did in the end. I loved the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end. It was sweet and served as a nice send-off too him. I'm glad he went out on a fairly high note. I didn't even notice it was his brother doing many of Paul's scenes. Whether it was the effects or the way it was shot, they did a good job in that regard.<br/><br/>The action is a lot of fun as insane as it is. I warn you will have to suspend your disbelief immensely to enjoy the action here. This took the over-the-top nature that the previous films had and intensified it to the tenth power. The action seems to get crazier with each film. However, despite it was still highly entertaining. This film might have the most and greatest action scenes of all the movies; even Fast Six.<br/><br/>However, as I stated before I have two major problems. One is that the film seems very unfocused. The previous films all had a simple structure and a basic singular goal. In this movie it starts out with Jason Statham's character hunting Toretto and the group. However, then it shifts to this completely out-of-nowhere plotline regarding the God's Eye and Djimon's character for the entire middle portion and Statham gets put on the backburner. Statham occasionally shows-up to remind us he's in the movie but not much focus is given to him.<br/><br/>Statham should have been the main villain and focus. He's the more interesting villain and one presenting the most personal conflict for the heroes. It's like they needed this other plot just to give the rest of the cast something to do and to show more over-the-top fights. Instead he's played as more of an afterthought for most of it which is my second big problem. Also the way he gets beaten is extremely underwhelming as well. Kurt Russell is there but he doesn't get to do much either. That is more of a minor grip but it irked me.<br/><br/>Overall, Furious 7 is an entertaining film with some great action. If you like Vin Diesel and the rest of the Fast crew (except Han) you won't be disappointed. I don't think it's as good as the previous few installments but still found it serviceable and a good send-off for Walker. If you like this series then check this out."
"dineshaishu","10","0","0","29 July 2019"," Furious 7
","Amongst the hype of the death of the incredible Paul Walker, James Wan and his crew managed to pull off the brilliance that was the seventh installment of the Fast and Furious Franchise (Styled as Furious Seven.) On a whole, the franchise started out as a small-time, home-bound film regarding street racing and yet as it progressed, the franchise developed into an international action genre, that worked in favor for the films. For this one in particular, (Furious Seven) it was an excellent action-packed film peaked with fury and yet well-rounded off with a touching tribute in honor of a fallen comrade. And I guess that because these films taught the significance of family and substance in loyalty it was absolutely shattering as the movie came to end, signifying that so did the life and career of Paul Walker, and the legacy he left behind in the character of Brian O' Conner. On the other hand, in terms of screenplay and layout of the film, the special effects and action sequences were very much over the top bringing vast entertainment and a unique feel to the highly grossing and thrilling ride viewers take along with the cast. Rest In Peace Paul Walker."

","When I say this is the best F&F movie so far, and yes even better than Fast Five. I mean it. Furious 7 rarely fails to entertain me at any point in the movie despite numerous viewings. That's how good it is. Everything from the action to the complete absurdity of it all is cranked up a notch. As only Fast & Furious knows how to do. Although, Dom slamming his foot onto the ground and having it collapse beneath him is a little ridiculous even for Fast & Furious.<br/><br/>With Furious 7 you also have arguably the second best villain in the franchise in Deckard Shaw. Right behind Hobbs if you go with the notion that he was a villain in Fast Five. Who's sorely missing for most of this movie by the way. As for Jason Statham's performance here it's very reminiscent of a lot of his past roles. So if your a fan of him like I am you'll love him here.<br/><br/>Finally, we all know this is Paul Walkers last outing as Brian O'Conner and I think that's why I cherish this movie so much more. Knowing that Brian is never going to gear up with the gang again is a hard pill to swallow, but seeing how nice a sendoff they give Paul makes it all the easier to bare. That's why I give this movie a 9 out of 10 if only for some of the stuff being a little too ridiculous even for Fast & Furious standards."

Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde and a shady government official called ""Mr. Nobody"" are both competing to steal a computer terrorism program called ""God's Eye,"" that can turn any technological device into a weapon.

However he does not receive enough screen time, as, understandably, more screen time is given to Paul Walker, leading up to the final farewell. Vin Diesel does his thing, being a badass with no emotions. Every action sequence just had to be filled with at least one moment of something happening and the actor tried to be funny and every person in the audience chuckling to themselves about it.

","Directed by James Wan<br/><br/>Starring Vin Disel, Paul Walker and Jason Statham<br/><br/>Plot Overview: ​Soon after his brother was crippled by Dominic Torretto(Vin Disel)'s crew, Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) seeks revenge and tries to seek out those who harmed his brother.<br/><br/>This movie is not only a powerful tribute to the guy who started this entire franchise, but is also an immensely enjoyable popcorn flick that succeeds without the burden of handling Paul Walker's death. I applaud James Wan and the rest of the crew for managing to make a movie incredibly enjoyable yet also incredibly upsetting. Wan had the burden of making a standard F&F popcorn flick but on top of that saying farewell to Paul and he did it in such a beautiful way that he must be applauded for that. Even without the heartbreaking tribute at the end, this movie stands on its own two feet as an immensely enjoyable popcorn flick and could have ended the franchise in the best way possible.<br/><br/>Half of this story was a by the numbers revenge story about Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) hunting down those who crippled his brother. While this arc was done pretty well, it pales in comparison to the other half of the movie which was attempting to bid farewell to Brian O'Connor/Paul Walker. I think that this half of the movie was flawless and really pulled at your heartstrings. The ending was also incredible and genuinely heartbreaking which is the first time a movie like that has drawn genuine emotion from me. It was(and should have been) the perfect way to end this franchise. Alas they didn't end it here but that is another matter entirely.<br/><br/>It's very hard to comment on what was Paul Walker and what wasn't but regardless the character of Brian O'Connor was played very well and you could really feel emotion conveyed through it. Vin Disel was alright as Dominic Torretto but I think that the emotion he emitted was genuine which is actually heartbreaking, and I don't want to even think about going through that, but it doesn't necessarily prove his worth as an actor. Jason Statham is the the God of War incarnated. He is a living metaphor for badass and he really shines in this movie. That said, I think they could have done so much more with his character. Granted, Deckard Shaw was easily the best villain this franchise has ever had but I think they built him up to be this unstoppable force but then he only had one or two scenes that were genuinely noteworthy. Another great thing is that every character's actions is in someway justified. Vin Disel has Han's death to motivate him and Jason Statham has Owen Shaw's disability to do so. Aside from the main actors, everyone else does fine from Michelle Rodriguez to Kurt Russell but none of them really stood out. I would also have liked to see a LOT more Hobbs because he was the reason this franchise became what it is today.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, this movie is pretty good. The cinematography is pretty nice and it looks very good. Some of the effects(such as the Dubai sequence) looked awesome whereas others(such as the house sequence) looked unbelievably fake and awful.<br/><br/>As far as I'm concerned, this movie needed to provide fun action sequences and bid farewell to Paul Walker in a powerful way. This movie achieved both. They handled each aspect of it so magnificently and beautifully that it was just a treat to watch. <br/><br/>'When I see you again' is an amazing, heart wrenching song that I wholeheartedly believe should have won the Oscar. As a side note(and if you haven't watch the movie you should stop reading now), I would have made one alteration to the end of this movie. In the scene where Brian and Dom and driving down the road as a tribute to Paul Walker, I would have liked them to have both the characters be driving the cars they drove at the end of 'The Fast and the Furious'. If you can't remember them cars, then here is a link http://img1.rnkr-static.com/list_img_v2/192/280192/870/the-fast-and- the-furious-cars-u4.jpg . While it may not have need to happen, I think that doing that would have been a beautiful send off to Paul Walker and would have ended the franchise in a flawless manner.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is a very enjoyable popcorn flick that also has a powerful tribute and message so I do recommend that you see it.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>Would Recommend"

","A furious ride, is what this film is. I love the franchise very much but it has made me question my liking to it not once but twice. Not this time. The series has gained a new life from furious 6 and then they came with a bang with this one. It's an amazing movie and a tribute to Paul Walker. The director, James Wan has become one of my favorite since insidious and conjuring but now he has done well in an entirely different genre. The action scenes look smooth and the cast, well it is the best ensemble the series had till this movie. I was on the edge of my seat every time Jason Statham pops on the screen. He displayed a style and finesse in his act which is difficult when their is Vin Diesel sharing screen with you. I loved this movie very much and i hope if the series continues that i will see something i new again."

The animation made me wanna puke especially the scene where Brian is running on top of the bus you could f**king tell that it was poorly made. Another thing why doe nobody bleed in any fight scene... COME ON!! REALLY? Dom drives down a cliff, the whole car is destroyed but he comes out without a scratch... REALLY NIGG*? The final fight scene Dom vs Deckard was like watching WWE! The most depressing fight scene... it was like watching Bambi's mum got shot in the head and Simba's dad getting kill by a herd of wild ox's.<br/><br/>""Deckard Shaw is an ex-Special Forces assassin and a mercenary."" Yet a bold guy who drives for a living beat the crap out of him without any training at all. ""ex-Special Forces assassin"" yet he can't even kill a group of drivers.<br/><br/>Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) bring a drone into the city and starts to blow shits up and destroys a signal tower, with all the sh*t going off in the city I didn't see one military troops in there. The drone destroyed every car it shot missiles at fut fails to blow up Letty car. WTF!!<br/><br/>another thing the animation when Dom drives through the building really sickened me. Why?

","When i saw the trailer for the upcoming Fast&Furious 7 i was really disappointed.Especially after fast 6 the franchise was getting away for its primary target: ""Street Racing"" and not forget the second point: ""illegal"". If you compare the first movie and the last one you will barely noticed that is the same movie.The only same are the actors and the brand name, nothing else.<br/><br/>We have in 2001 a small mid-level garage with import Japanese cars and cost's up to 60k $ which to keep them running they are involved to TV and DVD theft to high level ""agents"",racing with Ferrari's,Tesla's and car's above to 3 million dollars.Are you kidding me?<br/><br/>As a car enthusiast i was expecting to see car chase,illegal modifications and more street racing.If you see fast 7 you can barely notice street racing.<br/><br/>In conclusion Fast 7 was to me more like a mix from old scenes of fast&furious franchise,action and more fighting like Taken or Expendables (should we expect and liam neeson in the next movie?),a little drama and a small taste from bollywood (especially the scenes with Ramsey and Hobbs).If you like movies with action and fight,then Fast 7 is perfect but if you are a car fan you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>I saw the movie because of Paul.If Fast&furious 8 would confirmed i would be waiting for the DVD release.<br/><br/>A really disappointed fan Universal."
"hosboshoff","5","6","20","25 October 2016"," Big on gruff & buff, not much else
","Perhaps it was naive to expect much in this genre, but given rather complimentary reviews I took the chance. What a disappointment. Throwing money at a movie gets you lots of gruff & buff; big explosions, amazing stunts, scores of hotties and all the predictable stuff in this type of movie. Is it too much to ask for a decent plot, clever dialogue and some acting with a pinch of believability? Not short on eye candy & raising the pulse from time to time, but the obvious weaknesses in the plot & events, coupled with corny & insipid dialogue and some b-grade acting made this a rather tedious two hours. Never been so disappointed in a Metacritic rating before."
"UmarMuzammil","2","7","25","13 May 2015"," Poor Story with action that makes no sense
","I never wrote a review before after watching movies all these years,this one completely disappointed me after seeing the reviews and ratings and how famous the movie was. The movie starts off well and the first 15 minutes good, but after that unrealistic things started happening, Rock falls off from building holding a girl,cars falling from helicopter, driving on cliffs, jumping from cliffs and all that within the first half of movie, wont talk about the second half. Just to mention there's a huge difference in realistic stunts and stunts they showed in furious 7. <br/><br/>Talking about the action and plot of movie, it got worse. A assassin with a lot of skill and special agent from government messing with street drivers while government agencies cant catch him. All of them destroying people property and buildings like 911's happened,with the drone behind their cars and public feels normal and nobody asks nothing except for two police cars that tried to chase them once and wait doing all of that none of the person dies in all this action. Besides the Unrealistic stunts in the movie, there are various technical flaws which made it worse like Rock recovering so soon with broken leg and arm, when leg takes more time to recover specially if its broken in 3, he was running with heavy machine gun in streets by the end of movie and Vin diesel was flying his car to touch the helicopter. I mean Com'on is it a movie or joke as humans cant do this and this wasn't a animated feature film also.<br/><br/>To Make it short, if you have been watching good movies for sometime and know what are stunts and what they did in furious 7, you definitely wont like it as none of it made any sense."
"toby-aldridge-147-110469","1","7","26","17 April 2015"," damn rubbish
","this movie was damn trash, I had to sit there for 2 and a half hours just to cringe and sigh at everything. Yeah the movie had a nice tribute to it at the end, the CGI/animations and the special effects were great. But the whole movie was just so predictable, and the action scenes were highly unrealistic, for example around the end when Toretto and Shaw were fighting they were punching each other really hard, a normal man would not be able to fight after that, one of those hits to the jaw and its done for you. Another thing that made me sigh was all the cheesy one liners in the movies, when Hobbs was about to go kick ass he spoke to his daughter and he said 'daddy's gotta go to work', now I've heard that damn line around 7 thousand times in movies. Not to mention that the action scenes in the movie looked like they were written by a 8 year old. Jumping out of planes in cars? I mean really, it's basically impossible to do that with a parachute AND land on the road successfully. One of the dumbest parts in the movie is when Shaw and Toretto basically drove into each other, like what? that is the stupidest thing I've ever seen in a movie, and the fact that they both just hopped out of the car, stretched some muscles and started fighting again was even more stupid, you wouldn't be able to do that in real life. And when Jakande was in the helicopter flying around in the city for about half an hour, you'd think the swat team would be on to that in no time, not just a few police cars. And there is no way that Hobbs could just pick up a giant machine gun and know how to use it, let alone stand in the middle of the road and start firing at a damn helicopter, like c'mon seriously people? I seen almost every review saying oh this movie was amazing and a touching tribute, but the whole movie was genetically manifested to just make money, and that's exactly what it did. <br/><br/>For this movie I give the acting a 5.5/10 the effects a 9/10 and the story a 2/10<br/><br/>overall a disappointing movie."
"danielbelcher97","10","3","8","14 May 2015"," Best Fast & Furious. The movie doesn't try to be something its not.
","Critics want to put this movie in a time capsule to review it as if Walker's tragic death never happened but the reality is that it did and the way the film dealt with it was perfect and thus boosted my score. It must have taken a lot to carry on with stunt doubles and archive footage and although noticeable it didn't take me out of the action.<br/><br/>The film has a classic overused plot but the film doesn't hide that it is not about the plot it is about fast cars, guns and explosions. The lack of story is replaced with amazing stunts and interesting characters. Again people take of stars for the ""unrealistic stunts"" but the film is silly and cliché and the amazing stunts just add to the action.<br/><br/>As a whole this film really enbraces the genre and the audience it is targeted at.

"joshuadrake-39480","10","3","8","23 April 2015"," The best ""Fast and Furious"" movie yet...
","***WARNING! This review contains spoilers, if you haven't seen this film, you might want to before reading this review!*** Now, that I have watched the highly-anticipated feature film in the Fast & Furious film saga, this seventh installment was released on April 3rd, 2015 to extremely positive reviews and eventually broke the $1 billion dollar mark in three weeks after it's April 3rd release against a over extended budget of $250 million dollars over the unexpected tragic death of Paul Walker, who died on November 30, 2013.<br/><br/>With the previous installments being set between 2 Fast 2 Furious and The Fast and the Furious: Tokyo Drift, this seventh Fast and Furious film, now titled just ""Furious 7"" is the first film of the series to mostly take place after the third film.<br/><br/>I'm gonna try and explain the plot in the best way that I can without making anyone sad.<br/><br/>After defeating Owen Shaw and his crew and clearing their records, Dominic Toretto, Letty Ortiz, Brian O'Conner and the rest of the crew are able to return to the United States and live normal lives again. Brian begins to deal with fatherhood, while Dominic helps Letty regain her memory. Owen's other brother, Deckard Shaw breaks into the secure hospital the comatose Owen being held in and swears vengeance against Dom. The crew goes to Han's funeral and both Shaw and Toretto prepares to fight but they don't. Hobbs and Shaw enters a fight, but Hobbs is injured and rushed to the hospital by Elena Neves.<br/><br/>This leads into the Toretto house being blown up and a man named Frank Petty informs Dom that he will help him in stopping Shaw's plan if he gets something called the God's Eye, a computer device that can track a specific person and the creator, Megan Ramsey. They go to Abu Dhabi, where they get the flash drive with the God's Eye.<br/><br/>This leads into a very, very long car chase and a final fight ensues between Dominic and Deckard in a Street Fighter-like type. Hobbs then come and shoots and kills Jakande. When Dom remains unconscious, the team fears that he is dead. As Letty cradles his body, she reveals that they are married and she has regained her memories and Dom soon regains consciousness. Later, Deckard is locked away in a CIA person and Dominic and his crew realizes that Brian is better off with his family. In the final scene, Dom and Brian drives up at a stop sign. As Dom remembers the times that he has had with Brian, they bid each other farewell and drives off in separate directions.<br/><br/>I'm not gonna spend all my time on this film, but this film is the best of the Fast & Furious series, along with the first film, the second film, the third, fifth and sixth film.<br/><br/>The comedy and drama is really well-thought out and director James Wan and Chris Morgan deserves a lot of credit for picking up where this film left off in the previous film. The film does not feel like it is long at all, it feels like it's an hour and a half long and at 134 minutes, some people say it is the longest, but it really isn't.<br/><br/>The action is just incredible and this movie has a lot of action. The fight between Kara and Letty is well choreographed and done carefully. The car chases are just as intense and action-packed as they are in the other films in the series. The fight between Dominic and Deckard Shaw rips off Street Fighter: The Video Game, but I like how it turns out and the way the two jumps to each other to fight with car tools is beautifully shot and pretty.<br/><br/>The music by Brian Tyler is just emotionally powerful, intense and super-cool. The acting is just incredible and powerful. Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jordana Brewster as Dominic Toretto, Letty Ortiz and Mia Toretto are all really great in their performances in the film. Ludicrous and Tyrese Gibson as Tej and Roman are just as funny and serious as they were in 2 Fast 2 Furious, Fast Five and the previous film, Furious 6. Jason Statham is okay as Deckard Shaw. Dwayne Johnson as Luke Hobbs is incredible in this film. The other actor I will definitely mention is the late Paul Walker, in his final film appearance ever as Brian O'Conner, for the seventh and final time is just sad, emotional and really great and I'm really glad that his young brothers Caleb and Cody, finished his remaining scenes. The send-off they give for his character is just sad, even with the Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth original song, ""See You Again"" song playing at the end and the montage of scenes from the previous movies in the franchise.<br/><br/>Overall, I love FURIOUS 7. It can get sad at the end, but I still love the heck out of this movie and I have no problem seeing the next film, but I am sad that this is Paul Walker's last film appearance and really great performances and it is a well done film.<br/><br/>I'm giving it an 10 out of 10."

Add to that Keselowski's ""Bum of the Month Club"" bouts climaxing many of his 2014 Sunday afternoon jaunts, and the plot for FURIOUS 7 practically writes itself. If Kevin Harvick shot out a 100th Floor window of some Abu Dhabi high-rise, you can bet Keselowski would shoot out right on his tail from the 101st Floor. Since nearly every Nascar event is conducted in an Open Carry state, it's only a matter of time before the Daytona 500 and most of the lesser-known contests inject a literal element of ""road rage"" into their proceedings by encouraging drivers to become Armed & Dangerous. Other than adding some bullet-proof glass atop the walls for young spectator protection, America's fastest sport seems ready-made for FURIOIUS 8 pay-per-view-style mayhem.

I left the theater feeling like the entertainment level was met and then some but most importantly the family values that are personified in Brian O'Conner are honestly presented and come off genuine. I would have never expected Hollywood to support family values to the extent Universal did in this film. This film didn't end with a feeling of it's own self importance.

","I have been a fan of this franchise over the years and have loved the characters for what they are with all their numerous shortcomings as this makes it so real along with all those crazy stunts.In my personal opinion the last 3 films number 4,5 and 6 have really taken this franchise to another level.The character of Domanic Torretto and Brian O Conner had been the heart and soul of this franchise and as a fan I was really heartbroken with Paul Walker's death in 2013 as I believed Paul brought a certain level of vulnerability as well as honesty to his character who started as an outsider to Dominic Torretto and his team but over the years became family.His character was always intimidated by Dominic Torretto and that was brought out beautifully in all the previous films.Coming to this movie I believe the level has gone up in terms of stunts and entertainment quotient but i felt the movie dragged at the some portions in the second halve,but apart from that James Wan and his team did an excellent job specially incorporating the scenes shot with Paul's Brothers after his demise.Specially the tribute they payed to Paul in the end was something Actors live for.This franchise will never be the same again without Paul....RIP PAUL THANK YOU FOR THE MEMORIES....."

","Seeing this movie means that I will now have to go back and change the only film that I ever rated 1 star previously and give it a 10, because literally this film is so absolutely god-awful that it makes the worst movie I have ever seen previously look like pure gold.<br/><br/>Let me be frank, this is not a movie. It's a cartoon with real actors. I understand this is not supposed to be realistic of course, but on no level at all can this be considered good. I mean it looks like it's been written by a sexually frustrated 13 year old boy who only eats sugar. <br/><br/>The plot is so illogically ridiculous, so full of holes and nonsensical developments that it makes my three old niece sound like an astrophysicist. The action sequences are all totally pointless because in the end none of the good guys are ever in any danger whatsoever and I would not have been surprised even if Vin Diesel had taken a direct hit to the face with a nuclear missile and still walked away with a Hollywood smile. What's the point?<br/><br/>Asides from the absolutely appalling plot, narrative, acting, the cringingly immature script, the awkwardly grotesque directing and the inane and utterly boring repetition, the 'film' manages to fill the moments in between explosions with shots of scantily clothed females lounging around super cars. Which just proves my theory that James Wan and Chris Morgan got the inspiration for this flick while they where snorting cocaine off a prostitute's butt, in a bed made of thousand dollar bills, while playing GTAV.<br/><br/>But in the end I can't blame the creators of this junk-food film, because judging by the hundreds upon hundreds of millions of dollars it made they are actually making the kind of movie people love. Which, in the words of Alejandro G. Iñárritu, goes to show that, ""Popularity is the slutty little cousin of prestige."" <br/><br/>But if you do love this film then thats fine of course. As long you're 15 and under and you really don't know the difference between a film and a cheeseburger. <br/><br/>Awful."

","After Paul Walker tragically died, I had wondered how this film would get made. I worried about it being canceled completely, but it didn't and it was gracefully executed. I had one simple problem with the film: Very little Dwayne Johnson. I felt like it'd be even more fantastic with more of Hobbs, Johnson is full of life with his jokes, physicality and personality. The action is amazing, yet it being insanely over the top, which makes it even better because it knows what it is. James Wan, usually known for his chilling and suspenseful horror films did an excellent job with taking over the franchise. Seeing the crew together always makes me smile because the chemistry between them all is wonderful to watch. They are like a real family and you can see it in the last scene. The final scene was truly touching, seeing Brian(Walker) pull up next to Dom(Vin Diesel) and saying ""Are you gonna leave without saying goodbye?"". Seeing them smile at each other and then drive down the road together, honestly brought me to tears. ""He will always be with me. He will always be my brother..""."
"Screen_Blitz","8","3","9","4 April 2015"," This seventh installment to the Fast and Furious franchise is a pure action thriller ride
","The Fast and Furious franchise had shown its ups and downs throughout since its debut in 2001. This high-octane film series has exhibited a leverage of exhilarating car racing sequences and death- defying stunts that made each of its entries fluctuate in quality of popcorn flicks -- for better or worse. This seventh installment, directed by James Waan, continues its signature sleek action grandeur with some eye-popping car stunts and frenetic action sequences to fuel the adrenaline testatrone, while pushing the plot and character development near the back of the line. This installment, however, faced some major difficulties after franchise veteran star Paul Walker was tragically killed in a car accident during production, delaying the film's release for a whole year. What the cast and crew were not fixing to do however, is not let his death put a halt to the franchise and instead hire Walker's younger brothers substitute the role of Brian O'Connor while being replaced with CGI of Paul's face. The result is a film that not only succeeds with a sleek, action-fueled fare but a surprisingly emotional tribute to the late star. Set after the events of 'Fast Five', Dom (played by Vin Diesel), Brian (played by Paul Walker), and the crew consisting of Letty (played by Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (played by Tyrese Gibson), and Tej (played by Ludicrous) face a new threat, a special forces assassins named Deckward Shaw (played by Jason Statham) who is now seeking vengeance against the crew who took down his brother Owen Shaw in the last film, and sent Agent Luke Hobbs (played by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) to the hospital. Under the assisting eye of Covert Ops agent jokingly named Mr. Nobody (played by Kurt Russell), the crew must pick their slick car racing skills back up and take the down Shaw once for all. <br/><br/>When it comes to bathing the action with outrageous car stunts and frenetic firefights, this film certainly delivers. Those who have sat through the previous entries should expect the action to push the boundaries of plausability. In this entry however, the action set pieces soar further into the realm of where the boundaries of logic are pushed to the point where it gets a little absurd. That is definitely not to say that they are a not a whole lot of fun. That is if you are willing to leave your intellect at the door. Ranging from explosive car crashes, to characters driving a car out from a skyscraper into another, to taking a barrel down a cliff, this film exhibits almost no obedience to plausability. Instead, it continues its usual trend of characters zipping through the streets in fancy sports cars and mowing down the baddies in an excess of machine guns. While the plot and character development are unsurprisingly left mostly neglected here, director James Waan thankfully makes up for it with feeding the adrenaline-fueled testosterone with exhilarating action set pieces and infectiously likable characters who never miss the opportunity to spit out some hilarious one-liners from time to time. Jason Statham's antagonist makes for a cheeky villain, but certainly not one that blows the previous ones out of the water. The cast remains funny and charismatic as ever, while Kurt Russell is given little to do other than to deliver some lines of dialogue dealing with techno-business. Easily the biggest gem that the film has to offer is an unexpected emotional heft, uprooted by the death of Paul Walker, that pays off at the end as we are treated with a bittersweet sendoff to both the character and actor.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is a wild, fast-paced action thrill ride to embraces the spirit of the franchise with solid versatility, while paying a respectful tribute to the late Paul Walker, a new star shining in the heavens. It is a fun ride for those craving for two-hours of muscle men racing in sports car and dodge bullets. If you are for the ride, fasten your seatbelts."

This film was a TRIP!<br/><br/>Yes, it is an illogical leave-your-brains-at-the-door movie with every law of physics thrown out, but if you can accept this, it is like a fantastic roller coaster ride.<br/><br/>I said leave your brains, but not your heart. There is a lot of emotion to this movie - and not just because of Walker's death.<br/><br/>The stunts will go down in history as THE definition of ""over the top.""<br/><br/>One of the thing that surprised me is that this franchise if probably one of the (if not THE) most consistent with its story line and character development. With the sole exception of Harry Potter, I am not aware of any long standing franchise that has the exact same people playing the exact same roles with a story line that actually depends on the prior movies. Just remember that #3 is really the back story before the very end of #6. So the order is 1, 2, 4, 5,6,3, 7. If you have seen these films, the you understand.<br/><br/>There is no recap here. If you have not seen at least 3-6, then some of this would be ""what are they talking about?"" Han's story was throughout 3-6, Lettie's story started in 1 but really took off in 4 and 6, Sean only appeared in 3, etc.<br/><br/>Regarding how they handled Paul Walker: just incredible. I was LOOKING for Cgi, body doubles, twin brothers, and - maybe because I was so caught up in the movie - I never noticed it. The way they ended the film was really nice. It could have been exploitative, but instead it was sweet.<br/><br/>My only complaint (which is why I am giving it a 9 instead of a 10) is that - like #6 - it just goes on 20 minutes too long. Just one more insane over the top action scene than was needed. Minor quibble.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to James Wan, who really surprised me. I have seen practically everything that man has done, and it has all been in moody horror films (after the 1st Saw film, he dropped the gore and torture - thankfully - from his subsequent films). Never would have expected him to direct an action film so well.<br/><br/>Definitely on my wish list for the blu-ray version.<br/><br/>If you like 1-6 (or even 4-6), then you will love this.<br/><br/>If you have never seen any of these films, I would recommend seeing 4-6, then 3.<br/><br/>If you don't like any of the others, then you won't like this.<br/><br/>This franchise -for fans like me - actually seems to be getting better and better.<br/><br/>How many #7's are rated one of the best of the series?<br/><br/>I am ready for #8!!!"

But this one has a lot of action, comedy, drama. It's very funny it follows the story line perfect even everybody I know loves this movie I could watch this movie over and over again and never be tired the action in the movie seemed so real when they was fighting and the cars crashing into each other seem real and they got that great and on point this movie makes more than a billion dollars every one they had a lot of the great actors to make this movie have its pop it's like you just see the actors that are in it an you just know it's going to be a good movie that's why I wouldn't hesitate to be the first one in that movie theater for the next one on the day it comes out the same day I would be there."

","I was never a furious fan lately then one day by chance went to cinema to watch another movie but didn't get ticket and fast five show was almost empty got into theatre with average expectations and a time pass movie but came out dazzled.Since then i fell in love with this series.Furious 6 was even better but the fast and furious 7 its a bombshell, a cherry at the top of cake.Eagerly waited for it for a long time and tried every bit to go into the first show and even with sky high expectations i was mesmerized. Being said that let me be clear its far far better than the other car racing movies be it f n f series or others. Jason Statham as deckerd Shaw just adds to the worth of the movie. Be it CGI or anything else but still the action sequences keep you to the edge of your seats. The problem with sequels is with time they get boring and 7th in the series dats too much....But it defies the tradition it gets better and better and better... One thing which bothers every viewer is that are the characters superheroes coz till end nothing seems to put even a scratch on them...it should officially be named a superhero movie. Tribute to Paul walker in a way is amazing....RIP Paul Walker.."
"prashamsapokhrel","9","2","5","7 May 2015"," Package of entertainment
","Furious 7 is the best chapter of the Fast and Furious franchise till now. It really stood up to its name and fame. The actions, the cars, crazy friends (oh family) and so on made this movie worth watching. No doubt that it is a must-watch movie. Though there were some unrealistic and scattered moments of action and cold emotions, they could easily be overlooked because of the unfortunate death of Mr. Walker. Personally I felt it to be a one-time watch movie. <br/><br/>If you have watched all the previous chapters of Fast and Furious franchise, you need to watch it. In fact, you would not even think of not watching it. Isn't it? <br/><br/>Overall, it was two hours of entertainment."
"tbsmith14","9","2","5","23 April 2015"," Great action/thriller movie!
","This was first movie in the Fast and Furious franchise that I have ever seen. I am not a Vin Diesel or Paul Walker fan or a fan of action movies. Having said all that, I LOVED, LOVED, LOVED this movie! It was exciting from beginning to end and it held my attention throughout the entire movie. I laughed, jumped, cringed, and even shed a tear, at the end. I left the movie smiling, feeling good, and wanting to see it again. I was pleasantly surprised and immediately searched the internet to find all the information I could about Diesel and Walker. Any movie that captivates you and sparks your interest to the point that you feel compelled to research the characters/actors, I feel, has done a pretty good job of selling you on the storyline."

","This is by far one of the best ones yet. Its action packed and full of suspense. There are so many parts where you just want to jump out of your seat because of the pure awesomeness and excitement. And there is also the tear jerking parts a couple times in the movie but all is still awesome. The movie is a fair lengthy movie so you will be getting what you paid for. Make sure you a friend with you too, either to cry on or to scream with when the excitement comes. What ever you saw in the previews was nothing compared to actually watching the movie . I highly recommend this as its not only my favorite movie series but also another job well done."
"PoisonKeyblade","9","2","5","10 April 2015"," Solid Installment with a Touching Conclusion
","Ridiculous, over the top, and somehow fantastic, Furious 7 is another very very fun installment in the franchise. It's crazy how Five, Six, and now 7 are all considered the best installments. How often can you get quality films 5, 6, and 7 movies deep? The dialogue is a bit stilted at times, and there are moments when the CGI Paul Walker is pretty noticeable, but for the most part, this is a very well-done film. James Wan brings incredible vision and skillful direction to the franchise. I can only imagine the woes this production underwent as a result of one of its main stars, and while the ending clearly was added later on, it is basically perfect. I can't think of a more tasteful way they could have handled things. Without spoilers, this is a very loving tribute to Paul Walker. His presence is felt throughout the whole movie, but the ending especially really hits close to home and weighs heavy in the spirit of Paul. I think he would have been proud. It will be interesting to see where they are going to take things from here, and especially whether or not this will be as successful minus one of the leads. After the excellence of Furious 7, I'm definitely ready for whatever they are going to churn up next, even though the way this ended felt like a very fitting conclusion for the franchise as a whole."

"rjsf96","7","2","5","6 April 2015"," Paul Walker Would Be Proud
","The Fast and Furious franchise is one that you cannot review objectively and in a serious manner. The films defy logic, reason and realism. It's a great job that they are damn entertaining then. The franchise never found its steering until 2011's 'Fast Five'. Strange that it has taken them five attempts to get it right. But with this, the seventh instalment they perfect it. The series has not changed so much, if anything it has gotten louder, dumber and more in your face than ever before. The creators realised that the plot is unimportant, what the audience values is inspired set pieces that go against the laws of physics, fast cars, and hot women and now it seems, characters that we very much care about. 'Fast and Furious 7' is a success that I am sure will qualify as the most outrageously entertaining film of the year.<br/><br/>As soon as 'Fast and Furious 7' revs up its engine, it never stalls. This instalment begins right after the events of 'Fast and Furious 6' and 'Tokyo Drift', where Hans was killed by Deckard Shaw. He introduces himself through the immortal lines ""Dominic Toretto. You don't know me, but you're about to"". Deckard is after the crew who hospitalised his brother Owen and left him comatose in the previous film. Toretto played by the grizzly Vin Diesel, assembles his crew made up of Brian O'Connor (the likable Paul Walker in sadly his last film role), Letty (the feisty Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (a funny Tyrese Gibson), Tej (a bubbly Ludicrous) and Hobbs (the exhilarating Dwayne Johnson.) They are asked by a character that only refers to himself as Mr Nobody (an engaging Kurt Russell) to retrieve a device known as the God's Eye. It has the ability to track down anyone on the planet anywhere, within hours. The team need this device to find Deckard Shaw before he causes further devastating, destruction in his wake. But this hardly seems necessary as wherever the crew goes Shaw follows swiftly behind. Of course, it is a plot device with little importance to the overall arch of the story; it's only purpose to loosely connect a plot and allow for the madness and mayhem to unfold before our unbelieving eyes.<br/><br/>In the first of many (Fast and Furious) set pieces we see Hobbs up against Deckard Shaw. Jason Statham does so well as the villain that it makes you wonder why he has been cast as a hero of a story so many times before. The action is very different and James Wan's technique is more frenetic, less polished and very gritty as opposed to Justin Lin's stylish approach. Even fans of 'The Bourne Trilogy' and the work of Paul Greengrass will have to hold onto their seat for dear life. Thankfully, it is always cohesive, just don't blink. The camera follows the movements of characters with ease and makes these fights far more entertaining than they have any right to be.<br/><br/>Some may be disappointed by Dwayne Johnson's absence from the film for the most part. As he only appears at the start and the very end of the film. This however did not detract from the overall experience, as the scenes he does get are undoubtedly some of the craziest, insane and best for his character. So for me it did not matter in the slightest. If anything, it was a good thing as it allowed for more comradery between Vin Diesel and Paul Walker, reminding the audience that best friends are for life and your loved ones never truly leave you. Later in the film, Brian O'Connor tells Dominic Toretto that ""cars don't fly"". Toretto stares at him in a disapproving manner and proceeds to crash a Billionaire's Sports Car through two or more skyscrapers. Don't ask why. It does not even matter. You are so caught up in the moment that you forget plausibility.<br/><br/>The dialogue in the film always allows for the characters to connect in many different ways be it; serious, funny and even (whisper it) deeply moving. Roman and Tej have no shortage of playful banter. Brian O'Connor and his wife Mia (a spectacular Jordana Brewster) convey emotion, depth and meaningful moments. They don't feel cheesy, even when they discuss the importance of friendship and family. Thank goodness, the director and the screenwriter got this right. Paul Walker's scenes with Vin Diesel boast the best connection between two characters in a very long time indeed. You are never left in any doubt that they were best friends in front of the camera and behind it as well.<br/><br/>I have never heard of a film having two Directors of Photography, but 'Fast and Furious 7' does. The film is so staggeringly beautiful that I do not think one cinematographer would be able to convey such a high level of beauty in the exotic locales. The score by Brian Tyler gets the adrenaline pumping and the tear ducts flowing. Especially in the meaningful and moving 'See You Again' by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth, what a beautiful tribute to Paul Walker, even listening to it now, I cannot stop crying. Who knew a film about cars and heists could be so powerful and tear jerking.<br/><br/>'Fast and Furious 7' is by far the best instalment in the series. No small feat, when up against the fifth and sixth entries. The action is awesome, the stunts gravity defying and the cast pitch perfect. The script is great, the characters well developed and Paul Walker's send-off makes 'Fast and Furious 7' the most beautiful, poetic and emotional film I have seen in my life. I have no hesitation in stating that 'Fast and Furious 7' is perfect summer blockbuster entertainment and a masterpiece. So strap yourself in for the best ride yet. Rest in Peace Paul Walker. You would be Proud."
"rockandhockey","9","2","5","6 April 2015"," The Perfect Ending
","What is great about this movie is that it is the perfect finish to this series. For any movie fan that likes cars, for any person who can appreciate the meaning of family and for any person who just purely likes very action packed films, this is the perfect ending to a pretty great series. <br/><br/>I admit I was fairly skeptical when the first few movies came out. The plots seemed very dry and more about the cars than anything else. When they made Tokyo Drift, I was almost ready to give up on the series. But beginning with the fourth movie and concluding with this one, it has become one of my favorite series ever. <br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Paul Walker are the perfect compliments to each other, the classic muscle head and the tech savvy friend, both striving together to find common ground. Then when you begin to build in their supporting cast, you can't doubt the prowess of the writers. The dysfunctional nature of the first few movies turned into an incredibly complex story line, filled with plot holes that continued to be filled as the movies continued. <br/><br/>This movie finished the series perfectly. It completed the story like between Toretto and Leddy, it showed the family side of this group that all fans love, it showed the finale of Brian O'Connors changes. All of it worked perfectly in sync and then concluded with the perfect tribute to Paul Walker. <br/><br/>I won't spoil the plot ending for those who haven't seen the movie, but for me this movie was everything it needed to be. It isn't a movie that movie snobs will look at and be able to critically debate the nuisances but it will be one that they will appreciate. It won't win awards, but to those who have followed this series closely it will be a satisfying ending to the story. I will personally never be able to watch any movie with any of the the main cast of this final movie without thinking of the Fast and the Furious series. <br/><br/>If you are at all debating seeing this movie, don't. Just go and watch it. You will not be disappointed. It truly is the perfect ending to this underrated series."
"alexisgabriel123","10","2","5","6 April 2015"," Fun, Smart, Action-Packed, and Sexy
","The last installment in the Fast and Furious series, Furious 7, is a movie worth watching. With unbelievable stunts and crazy action sequences, the film is one movie that should be seen, if you can, on an Imax theater so that you can really immerse yourself in the movie. The action is done splendidly and the comedy is hilarious. Although Fast Five, Fast and Furious 6, and Furious 7 aren't focused on the subject of street racing, they are some of the best movies. They were more about car chases and working with cops and agents. But in Furious 7, the story about avenging their dead friend gave it a brand new twist that I think we haven't seen in a Fast and Furious movie before."
"bravesfanc","9","2","5","6 April 2015"," A perfect send off
","If you watched Furious 6 & 7 back to back it would feel like one very long movie. 7 picks up right where 6 left off. However 3 or 4 years have passed since the events of the last movie. No need to go into detail about this film. You get what you expect, ridiculous car chases, death defying stunts that no human could possibly do, and yet it's so much fun to watch.<br/><br/>The ending does give Paul Walker's character a perfect send off. Considering he had filmed about 85% of the movie, there were only a few times I could tell it wasn't him. Plain and simple, if you're a fan of the previous films then you will have no trouble sitting back and enjoying the ride. 9/10"
"RyaanGriffiths","9","2","5","6 April 2015"," All about family!
","Well, what can I say? The new Fast and Furious 7 really focuses on family. As with every Fast movie you learn a key message into why family is so important, but with the recent tragedy of Paul Walker's death Vin Diesel and his crew worked extremely hard to make this movie a tribute to his contribution to both his personal life and Fast franchise. Vin Diesel promised this movie would win awards and my god it will! CGI is outstanding. The last scene for Vin Diesel is the focal point to add his small tribute for his 'brother' Paul Walker felt deeply by everyone in the theater and at home. The scene contains a heart felt inspirational monologue from Vin Diesel to Paul, backed by the song 'See you again'. See you again is performed by Wiz Khalifa Ft. Charlie Puth and adds sentimental passion. Overall a fantastic movie rounded off tremendously by the tribute to Paul Walker - Had me in goosebumps and teary eyed."

This movie still has some great moments to offer to car people, however this movie isn't like the predecessors. For anyone, who saw Fast & Furious 6, this movie will seem like it's right in track with the older one. <br/><br/>However, don't think that you wont see any crazy cars and stunts, cause then you're terribly wrong. There are some absolutely gorgeous cars, although there is not a lot of focus directed towards them. <br/><br/>The unfortunate death of Paul Walker is covered up, by stunt doubles and CGI. It is very hard to notices that Paul isn't acting in the movie anymore. <br/><br/>The ending of the movie will crush hearts of steel. The ending dedicated to Paul Walker was very emotional and powerful. I couldn't help it, but my eyes were tearing up. Rest In Peace Paul."
"hypestyle","8","2","5","5 April 2015"," Furious 7 Blasts Trhough One Last Ride
","""Furious 7"" is the seventh entry in Universal Studios' enduring ""The Fast & The Furious"" movie franchise. The action film stars Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson and the late Paul Walker in what is his final on-screen performance. This latest and possibly final sequel in the series finds the Diesel-led team of drag-racing avengers facing off against two terrorists in a contest of firepower and horsepower.<br/><br/>The globe-trotting adventure introduces Jason Statham as the film's primary antagonist, Deckard Shaw. Shaw, an ex-military assassin, vows revenge against Diesel's Dominic Toretto for putting Shaw's brother Owen in traction by the end of ""Fast Six"". (Or rather, at the beginning of this film; it was assumed Owen was vaporized by the end of the last movie. Luke Evans plays a near-corpse quite well, it must be said.) To telegraph Shaw's tough-guy bona fides to the audience, his introductory scene leaves the entire wing of a hospital in shambles. After the brutal sidelining of federal cop Hobbs (Johnson), Shaw's got his cross-hairs aimed at Toretto and his team, including Brian O'Connor (Walker), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Chris Bridges) and amnesiac Letti (Michelle Rodriguez), all gathered by mysterious CIA rep Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell, seemingly in a nod to his own history as an action icon). Mr. Nobody wants Toretto's team to rescue a pretty computer hacker (Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel) from the clutches of yet another terrorist, Mose Jakande (played by Djimon Honsou); in exchange, a special computer-satellite chip she has access to will allow them to track down Shaw for a final showdown.<br/><br/>The particular MacGuffin of this film is somewhat of a moot point; Shaw manages to somehow abruptly show up like Jaws the shark at inopportune times to assert his revenge as the heroes are trying to rescue someone or steal something. Director James Wan-- heretofore known for lensing horror films like Insidious and Saw-- is a newcomer to the franchise and capably abets the over-the-top sensibilities of the film series. In comparison to the first film's Southern California setting, the latest entry casually adds Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi to its list of exotic locales visited. Before the credits roll, viewers will be also exposed to not one but two games of chicken, a fleet of cars parachuting to a mountain road, a marauding helicopter, a remote-controlled drone, and a sports car soaring between three skyscrapers. Subtlety isn't a virtue in the ""Furious"" universe.<br/><br/>The acting performances are all on-point for the characters featured. Diesel's Toretto is all stoicism and bottled fury, punctuated by the occasional smart-aleck quip; Statham's Shaw is a cocky bastard who isn't above bringing an automatic rifle to a street fight; Johnson's Hobbs is a macho cowboy prone to spout testosterone-laced punchlines that would only be credible coming from The Rock. Sadly, he isn't in the film as much as he could be. Most of the film's comic relief comes from Gibson's motormouth Roman with Bridges' Tej as his tech-savvy foil. Rodriguez arguably has the most demanding character arc with her lingering amnesia, but its resolution is rather abrupt. Lastly, Walker's Brian is the level-headed heart of the team, but torn in adjusting to being a new dad and husband to Toretto's sister Mia (Jordana Brewster).<br/><br/>Walker and a friend were tragically killed in a car accident before the film's primary photography was completed. Subsequently, his remaining segments were filmed using body doubles and computer-driven special effects. To the extent that the film series has already made heavy usage of stunt doubles and CGI enhancement, this is both par for the course and a curious commentary on the potential for posthumous acting performances in cinema. None but the most wizened (or cynical) of filmgoers can likely tell where the real Walker begins and ends. Still, occasional in-story comments about characters being ""tired of funerals"" and Brian's lingering angst about being retired from the craziness of dodging bullets and leaping from moving vehicles casts a bittersweet pall over the proceedings. Screenwriter Chris Morgan's script regularly brings up family ties as the film and franchise's prominent theme. It works, albeit nominally, though these films are more about muscle cars (and musclemen) than philosophy. Bring popcorn, fasten your seat belts and enjoy this (alleged) last joyride from Diesel and company."
"wutianyue1218","8","2","5","4 April 2015"," It is a good action movie! Yes, it is!
","No doubt, Furious 7 is a good action movie. In my opinion, it is the best one in the Furious series. Furious 7 not just simply puts actions and racing together. At this time, Furious 7 tries to tell a story to connect all people and things of whole Furious series, and, more importantly, it also tries to give a good ending to audiences and fans. The Furious series has been compared us for 14 years. Different from the others in this series, Furious 7 has more meanings for each fans. It is Paul.The real brothers don't need too much talk, they just look each other and nod, then drive separate way. Dominic Toretto(Vin) drives to way of real and peaceful life. The way waiting for Paul must be a free and happy place. He can smile and drive without worry in that place. Thanks Paul!Thanks Fast and Furious series!"
"kevinchengxin","8","2","5","4 April 2015"," Not the Fastest, But the Most Furious
","I doubt anybody who was in any way involved with The Fast and The Furious (2001) had ever been bold enough to predict that this series could ever be steered this far, and towards so different a direction. But here we are, at the 7th entry in this franchise that was established upon the simplest possible idea of racing with hot guys and chicks. If one has never peeked at any of these films, and merely know the series from its sensational commercial success and its seemingly endless string of sequels that occupy cinemas every two years with rocket-science punctuality, he might cringe at the very notion of yet another succession of mindless money-grabbing hormone-oriented flicks for young generations, who seem to have nothing better to do than ruining the market of motion picture as we know it. Well, he wouldn't be entirely wrong, that is, until this point.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 7 is---there's no better way to describe it---the ultimate Fast & Furious movie. For more than a decade, this series has been somewhat a bunch of random ideas, cast at the wall by producers, directors and other involved parties. Now it's time to finally gather everything that sticks, and aggregate them into a 137 min of one breath- taking action sequence segueing into another that's even more mind- blowing. <br/><br/>The subject matter this movie deals with is ""the death of a friend""--- actually, scratch that, it's ""a death in the family"". Inside the world of the movie, it's about Han; outside, it's about Paul Walker. This is a major reason why Furious 7 not only aspires to be the best of its kind, it also NEEDS to be the special one.<br/><br/>The two deaths, both in reality and in fiction, propels this movie up to an unprecedented level of expectation even before it begins. This is everything that's been built up to. And amazingly, it lives up to it. Since the character of Han was introduced and killed in Tokyo Drift, Fast 4 to 6 became, to a certain extent, The Final Odyssey of Han. I don't know if they ever deliberated every move like the Marvel Cinematic Universe, but in hindsight, it's brilliant. The tragic death of Paul Walker only adds to the movie's heavy sense of fatalism, even further making it the culmination of everything. The filmmakers are fully aware of this. The last minutes became a sentimental farewell to Walker's character, the most perfect send-off they could have visualized. Are they perhaps consciously capitalizing on Walker's tragedy? Absolutely! But we wouldn't have it any other way!<br/><br/>The more I like this movie, the more I can't help but lament why Fast & Furious 6 didn't seem to work just as fine. Furious 7 brought out the best part of Fast Five, the fascinating chemistry among the team members, including the Rock. They spill out wittily-designed dialogue, every syllable a manifestation of their own personality. Whereas last time, it all seemed rushed and contrived. Probably something to do with Justin Lin, the director behind Fast 3 to 6, who, by that time, had to be feeling a bit exhausted. I'm glad to see James Wen, who is more celebrated with his filmography in the horror genre (Saw, Dead Silence, Insidious, The Conjuring, etc), rejuvenates the series without losing its sight or style.<br/><br/>I could compliment this movie from a thousand more different angles, but the truth is, it's not without its faults. I still don't completely agree with the decision of bringing back Letty, which renders some of the previous adventures totally pointless. She has her share of struggle in this film, still suffering from amnesia and wishing she could be whole again. I can't honestly blame her for not remembering her past in a flash, considering that I, who saw all previous movies, couldn't quite recall what she did before her ""death"". This subplot conveniently became useful in the end, in a scene where conflicts are so obviously created just so this subplot can be useful. To be honest, between the death of our beloved character and people, between Vin Diesel's talk about family and everything else, we really have little emotional room left for this. Also, because actions are so tightly arranged, one is liable to feel some slight visual fatigue at a later point. I also don't recommend watching it in 3D. The effects are okay, but the last third of the film largely took place at nighttime, or in dim-lighted places, which means not ideal for 3D viewing (if you remember Pirates of the Caribbean 4).<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 7 is exactly what fans have been hoping for, and is most probably what non-fans wish this series could become. It's not perfect, but then again, it's not supposed to be. What it should be is special, and in that it indubitably succeeded."
"kieranbattams","8","2","5","4 April 2015"," Freaking Insane! and a beautiful tribute..
","I can never recall a time in my life i could have said i was looking forward to a 7th installment of a movie.. i was young when The Fast and The Furious was released and if i went back to when i first saw it I never would have felt a 7th film would have been good.. but Fast & Furious 7 proved me wrong and it turned out to be one of the most action packed, over the top, ridiculous and downright entertaining movies for a long time. The film and its crew had to overcome a tragic and hard problem which was the sad passing of series veteran Paul Walker. I knew him only from this series but i have heard he was one of the nicest guys working in Hollywood. The ending of this film, without spoilers, was the most perfect and beautiful tribute that could have been done and I think that if he had seen this movie himself then he would be proud. It brought me to tears and i'm not afraid to admit that. <br/><br/>Furious 7 picks up directly after the events of the 6th movie (sounds ridiculous saying that) and we are introduced to Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham who is on the path to revenge after Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew took out his brother. What i like about this film is that it actually makes Tokyo Drift relevant. In my opinion 2 Fast 2 Furious and Tokyo Drift are not good movies and they had no reason to exist but the 5th movie brought back characters from the 2nd who are some of the best and this one takes place after the events of Tokyo Drift starting with the death of Hans who originally died in the third film.. its a confusing timeline but the beauty of Fast & Furious is that it knows this and we as an audience have a lot of fun untangling the timeline which could not work with any other series. Anyway, this leads us onto 2 revenge paths with Statham after the crew and the crew after him. In order to defeat him they must get the ""God's eye"" which is a device that can find anyone in the world in seconds, hired by Kurt Russell on top form we are given a thrill ride which is quite possibly the most entertaining film of the franchise yet.<br/><br/>The film is the most ridiculous and insane too.. we have seen the crew take down a huge plane on the biggest runway in the world and destroy half of Brazil with a huge safe. Here we are treated to Skydiving Cars and a huge street race/fight involving drones but the most insane part for me was Vin Diesel and Paul Walker jumping across 3 skyscrapers in Abu Dubai in a supercar that seemed like it was built for this madness. Seriously, it was intense and i was on the edge of my seat. The only thing i missed in this film was more of Dwayne Johnson. He appeared in Fast Five as Hobbs and became my favourite part of the series but for a lot of this film he is out of action.. but this is after a brutal and downright awesome fight between himself and Statham. I knew that from the moment Statham receives an uppercut to the face and gets up to continue fighting that this would be incredibly unrealistic.. who could ever survive that. Plus the climax was incredibly well done considering the circumstances. It would have been no easy job to continue without Walker and you could tell where things had to be changed but i will not criticise for this because I respect that they managed to get the film finished.. plus seeing Dwayne Johnson handle a minigun like it was a leafblower was absolutely incredible. <br/><br/>I feel lot less focus was given to the driving sequences as cars were either flying or we had extended fight sequences.. these were well shot but felt a bit repetitive because the same camera trick where the camera flips upside down was used which looked cool but in my opinion happened too much. Other than that I liked this installment a hell of a lot.. Michelle Rodriguez and Ronda Housey going bare knuckles was a treat to see in particular. If the series ended now i would be incredibly pleased as I'm sure a lot of fans would too. A beautiful monologue from Vin Diesel.brought me and many others to tears and it will be an ending to remember for years to come. A beautiful tribute to Paul and an amazing ending to a freaking insane movie! RIP Paul Walker"

","They keep getting bigger and better<br/><br/>Far from the street car race movie it began as, Dominic Torretto and his crew seek revenge for the death of their friend by teaming with a black bag government agency as their wild card task force.<br/><br/>This action movie has everything. Vin! The Rock! Statham! Rousey! And Jaa! It's like the Expendables, but instead of showing what was, Furious 7 show us what's now in action. <br/><br/>They've escalated the movie to a new level, absolutely impressive considering how ridiculously huge the last film was. I would have never thought this would be the next action super franchise, in fact no action franchise has ever been this big. It's like the Avengers with cars.<br/><br/>The car chases are bigger. The fight scenes are badder. I thought it was too much when these cats out raced a tank and took down a 747 in the last movie, but yeah they topped that.<br/><br/>Plus it a great story about a cast of misfits put together who ride or die together like blood. It's all too touching, especially after the death of Paul Walker, which they give a tribute to. I know they had to scramble to figure out a way to finish this movie after Paul's demise and they pulled it off. <br/><br/>The Rock and Vin have successfully made the movies Stallone and Schwarzenegger should have gotten around to in the 90s during their hey day. <br/><br/>I should not need to convince you to see it, but see it, twice! It was everything I hoped for and lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Rest in Piece Paul Walker, I don't think anyone has ever had the luck to have their final movie be so amazing."

"suryanarayanan-srikanth","9","2","5","3 April 2015"," One Last Ride
","Just when you thought it couldn't get any better Furious7 takes it to a whole new level. To know the fact that the first stunt in the movie was shot with actual cars and cameramen, it makes you awestruck. Decent story line for an action packed movie. Few of the stunts are questionable but again I feel that's acceptable given the fact that they have performed real (and dangerous) stunts for other scenes too. Awesome IMAX experience - gives you the perfect feel for such a larger than life movie. Tribute to Paul at the end very touching. Credit goes to the crew (and Diesel) for managing to complete Paul's scenes with the help of his brothers and some graphics, rather than just removing his character from the plot. Must watch for Furious fans (or any other action movie lover for that matter). This is one movie franchise you can never be tired off."
"anandgokul18","10","2","5","3 April 2015"," Nice storyline and amazing FX
","This being the ""one last ride"" of the Fast and Furious series, I am quite impresses with the movie. Also, this is a good watch for the weekend and they team performs quite amazingly especially the effects in Abu Dhabi. Also, I am impressed with Paul's brother's scenes which filled out the spaces left by Paul Walker after his death. Also, the team's motto of ""Family"" is seen quite evidently from the movie and Letty recalls her past in the end of the movie when she finds Dom dying. The drone fight scenes are quite good visually. Thus, I recommend this for both F&F fans as well as causal movie goers and guarantee that this will make a good weekend watch."
"misschrome33","9","2","5","3 April 2015"," Fantastic addition to the franchise
","Action packed, heart breaking, and worth every penny. <br/><br/>I left the IMAX theater last night satisfied that if they never made another F&F movie I would be content with how this one ""wrapped up"" the franchise. It brings all of the movies together. Everyone always wonders why Tokyo Drift felt ""out of place"" (we have to remember the franchise storyline is out of ""sequence""), well you don't have to worry anymore. This one will wrap it all up in a tiny little bow for you as you cry your eyes out over changes to the ""family"". <br/><br/>Statham was a wonderful addition as the villain. The fight sequences and stunts seemed a little far fetched at times, but well worth it in the end. I didn't find as much comedic content in this one as the last, but what few bits were thrown in to make us laugh were good. <br/><br/>I did, however, feel anxious throughout the entire movie because I was not sure how they would deal with what was left of Paul's character/story after his untimely death. I can say, that I was pleasantly surprised that nothing was taken out after this happened, fortunately, he was nearly finished filming his scenes when it happened. His brothers stepped in like champions. It was very subtle, but you could tell the scenes when one of Paul's brothers were standing in. Even though they both look a lot like him, it felt off. The scene chemistry felt different and the camera angles/shots were definitely different. Little things covering their faces or being on the edge of the shot instead of the middle near Dominic. <br/><br/>Overall, I was satisfied walking out of the theater. If they decide to not make another, and end the franchise with this fantastic tribute to Paul, I am content with that. It felt like closure when leaving the theater. It felt like we weren't left hanging for something else to happen. It felt right."

","So I saw this film yesterday, and it has to be one of the best Fast films in the franchise. The combination of super-cars and stunts make this film put you on the edge of your seat. The added fight scenes (as expected in the Fast franchise) add essence to the story.<br/><br/>Also what made this film especially great was the dedication to the late Paul Walker. He would have been proud of this film.<br/><br/>As with every Fast film in the franchise, the sequel predominantly is out done from its predecessor, and the brilliance of Fast 7 has shown that. <br/><br/>The soundtrack is just as great, the greatest track being Get Low by DJ Snake and Dillon Francis. Just like Fast and Furious 5 and the memorable Danza Kuduro, Get Low will be a memorable dance track for the Fast fans.<br/><br/>All in all, a succinct story-line with gripping action scenes and awesome cars, as always!!!"

","This is one of the better movies in the Franchise. To me, it was more emotional than any of the other Fast and Furious movies because this is the last time we will ever see Paul Walker on the big screen. But to me, it was also a really cool and slick movie. The action was awesome, the explosions were timed well. It had a surprising amount of heart, and the characters were built up just enough to make a ridiculous ending seem not so ridiculous. It wasn't a prestigious film with incredible performances, but Vin Diesel and Jason Statham do a good job with their roles. If your looking for something to entertain and thrill, this is the movie for you. It's got cool cars, lots of muscle, and just enough sentiment to keep it human. I say give it a shot."

"anupapu8","8","2","5","2 April 2015"," A perfect Farewell for Paul Walker
","Furious 7- This series has never been famous for its intelligent plot ever. Just made for entertainment with cars , action and girls in bikini. But after 4th installment there was a seriousness in the series. They tried to make it better and unique in its own manner and yes they succeeded. Now about Furious 7 , it can be a different movie for each and every person on the fact that what you expect . I am not gonna be emotional to give this one high rating just because it has been made around the tragic event of Paul Walker's death. So lets have a fair judgment , at least whats i think as fair. There can be 3 parameters for judging this movie as what you expect 1.Intellent Plot. 2.High level on action & 3. emotional end to Paul Walker's journey. If you expect number 2 & 3 then this is a movie for you , and you are gonna get overwhelmed by watching this , but for me the 1st point was still the priority where the movie if not failed is just above average . That doesn't mean that i didn't liked the action sequences , i enjoyed them and they are brilliantly choreographed , and so many in numbers that i can't mention them all. But i have some complaints with one on one fights because they were not executed well and to cover that fault our cameraman has shacked it all. As with shacking camera you can hide the faults. For me the best sequence was when one of the female member from team Domnic is transfered from one car to another car both coming from alternative direction. It was really innovative. And yes we also get some high tech hacking kind of stuff too in the movie. Then comes the emotional content. And i am shocked to see such great emotional moments (specially the post climax Farewell message from Diesel to Paul Walker was heart breaking)in the movie which has never been so deep on emotions in its earlier 6 installments . And the biggest credit goes to James Wan the director who is new to this franchise but is a really good director , only one present in Hollywood industry who make more then descent horror movies back to back(for example - Insidious 1&2 and The Conjuring ) . When it comes to acting its all good . The chemistry between all the characters is great as this is the 7th time they are working together. Statham is one of my favourite and watching him as villain is great . Although Dwayne Johnson along with two new entries - Ali Faizal and Tony Jaa are wasted. Nevertheless , its been a really entertaining film . Fast 5 is still my favourite from this series because of the intelligence in the plot and this one comes on the very second spot. 7.7/10. A perfect Farewell for Paul Walker.. by ANuP APu KuMaR"

","I've seen the first movie, so i got this free premiere tickets so why not? I thought i was going to watch a cars movie...guess i was wrong.<br/><br/>Looked like a movie scripted by 5 male teenagers on a hot summer afternoon, full of nonsense. I can't even describe, that would take hours to explain everything. I could talk about every dumb scene, but it would be too much of an effort, here's one:<br/><br/>The Rock is on hospital because by miracle he managed to get harmed, after something, he breaks its arm's plaster by flexing it, gets an FBI bullet proof vest out of nowhere (because hospitals...) then drives an ambulance and proceeds to fall on the top of a drone armed with missiles, and naturally he gets drone's mini-gun. The amount of nonsense is so unreal i almost felt like leaving the cinema room.<br/><br/>This was honestly the worst movie I've seen on cinema. Nonsense physics, nonsense ideas (How to get on the most private party in the world? You just need to get some invitations out of nothing), dumb fights, almost no races, hot girls to give credibility, i can't even explain everything in 1000 words honestly.<br/><br/>The only decent thing i found was the final 3 minutes or so, the Paul Walker tribute, and that is worth of the 2 starts out of the 3 i give to the movie, that scene was really awesome and worth, that and probably one or 2 comedy moments.<br/><br/>As for the rest, you can't even enjoy the movie, you can't fit it on the ""so bad it's good"". You can get more entertained watching transformers."

"hokavs","4","6","25","7 April 2015"," A movie full of one-liners, seriousness and symbolics
","I liked part 5 and 6 from the series. Sure I liked part 1 and 2 because I was young at that time and I liked the car tuning and racing. But then I grew up and it kinda lost my interest. Then they did Tokyo drift: different scene, different actors, and later on I started to appreciate the series when we arrived at part 5 and 6. They were funny, full of action and not dead-serious, and they were good guys doing not-so-good things (stealing the forbidden fruits so to speak). In other words a nice escape from realism and just be a block of testosterone for 1.5 to 2 hours. The characters in these movies did what they loved and did it for who they loved.<br/><br/>Part 7 really annoyed me. I'm not gonna give the movie 1 stars, because people still did put in a lot of hard work and the ending of the movie was beautiful. But I also mean that literally: the ending was the best part of the movie, because that meant the movie was finally over. But also because Vin Diesel actually came on screen as being a human being instead of being a one-liner robot trying to look tough and wise non-stop. If your character on-screen isn't impressed by anything anymore, or touched by anything, it's pretty hard to be touched as a viewer as well by that same character.<br/><br/>The movie was full of hard action (no soft, sweet explosions but rough and raw ones, like the sound of metal clinging), and things like sympathy and humor seem to be missing totally. It felt as if the characters had to do this mission, without really wanting it or put their heart into it. I experienced it as a superficial one-liner movie in which no real character development took place. They wanted to portrait Paul as a family man, but how I experienced this was as if they put in the script: ""Paul playing with family, make 3 turns swinging kid in the air, smile for 5 seconds, move on to the next one-liner from Vin Diesel, move on to the next action-scene"".<br/><br/>Of course I know these movies aren't known for their realism or in- depth characters, but at least their characters were somewhat real/authentic/understandable previously. But even the joke-man in this movie looks so serious all the time as if he needs to take a dump during the entire movie. I'm not even gonna discuss his awkward party-scene in Abu Dhabi. <br/><br/>The role of Kurt Russell is also fitting for the name his character gives himself in the movie: Mr. Nobody. He acts super-superficial, as if this movie was a nice little extra (financially) for Russell, but there's no character growth or identification when compared to Hobbs in the previous parts for example. The only character growth you'll see is that when Mr. Nobody is shot and seriously injured, he promises Vin Diesel he will switch from Belgian beer to Corona's. Seriously. I feel they had a script and just had to include things like Mr. Nobody and ""God's Eye"" just to fill up some gaps.<br/><br/>And let's not forget Hobbs who in this movie is completely unbelievable (in a bad way). He rips his plaster by flexing his muscles, he sees a building explode nearby and doesn't even wink, he just goes full Clint Eastwood-mode and says: ""Toretto"". His little girl is in the hospital-chamber when all of this happens and he just walks up and says: daddy's gotta go to work. Again it feels very forced, as if he said: You are not really my kid, but the script said we needed Hobbs to have a kid (for making him human or something?) for 10 seconds, so we put you in this room. Now beat it, because I'm gonna steal an ambulance and with it bring down a drone, then take a mini-gun, then shoot at a helicopter, and finish the job like a wild wild west revolver gunslinger. I mean when someone would actually say stuff like that it would be funny, but somehow it didn't connect with me when i was watching it.<br/><br/>So, in my opinion: this movie is trying to be funny when it shouldn't be, overacting-tough when it should be human, and way too serious when it could be funny. Feels like it's trying too hard and therefore misses its mark. Great ending though."

","I've been involved into Fast and Furious family for the last 14 years or so, and I hoped that they will end series of one of the biggest movies with a BANG, but man I was wrong.<br/><br/>I started watching F&F movies because of cars, the action, and the thrill they bring with themselves. Along the way I felt in love with the actors, and I (as weird as it sounds) was looking at the actors in the movie as ""mi Familia"". <br/><br/>I went onto premiere last night thrilled and excited because I finally had the chance for the closure with F&F. I hoped that they will have in the final movie more cars, races, tuning etc. At last, that was the reason this movie was success after all. MAAAN, I WAS WRONG. <br/><br/>I left the cinema with bitter taste in my mouth. Disappointment, anger, sadness. Mixture of emotions, all negative ones. The only part of the movie I enjoyed besides 'beginning' and huge The Rock vs. Statham fight was the part where they retrospectively showed inserts from the first few sequels. The rest of the movie was mixture of Star Trek and some Van Damme movie. I can't say I just didn't like it. I kind of hated it. They went totally the opposite way than they primarily wanted to go in the beginning of the franchise. <br/><br/>I can say that my brother who is a huge fan as well felt asleep multiple times in the mid-point of the movie. At least they had some reality and probable scenes in the previous sequels. It is absolutely impossible to do 99% of things they've done in this one. It was utterly gross, too much sci-fi, and too little of cars to be considered as F&F family member. Not even The Rock, Paul Walker or Vin Diesel could pull this one out of misery. <br/><br/>To sum up, save your money and time. <br/><br/>IF YOU'RE BIG FAN LIKE MYSELF OF FAST AND FURIOUS, I DO NOT RECOMMEND YOU TO WATCH IT. YOU WILL LEAVE THE CINEMA DISAPPOINTED.<br/><br/>4/10 in best. And that is because of special effects, otherwise it would be 3/10."

"James_De_Bello","7","6","27","1 April 2015"," 7.5/10
","I consider myself to be a true fan of the ""Fast and Furious"" series. I acknowledge that Tokyo Drift is the worst of them, I myself don't like it, and I also am not the biggest fan of the fourth movie, but for the rest I have always liked if not loved the series. Being 19 years old I kind of grew up with it and have seen it evolved, it has been one of my childhood action franchises just as an 80s kid, looking back now, would consider his Die Hards and Lethal Weapons. I have always had an affection towards the movies, I understand they are not Citizen Kane, but I am truly in love with their riveting and exhilarating sense of fun, that probably no other saga can match, and the characters which I always look forward to hang out another time. Five and Six took both of these elements to the next level and still to this day, I consider some of the staple modern action movies, add this to the fact that I always have been a big Paul Walker fan, ever since I was a kid I thought that he should have been an A-list star, and you can understand the excitement I had for this movie. So after that long introduction, the big question, does the film actually match my excitement? I'll tell you what it exceeds it and takes action film limits to an even further level, even though I may still think Six is still my favourite.<br/><br/>Before starting the actual review I want to praise this franchise for how much it has evolved and with the evolution has made every film count more. Now the first Fast and Furious isn't just a street racing movie, but it is seen as the start of this big adventure that takes us to places we would have never imagined with such a sense of fun and self conscious no other action franchise has ever matched. <br/><br/>I just want to get the negatives about of the way, because yes I have to acknowledge them, but I would just like to geek out and write a love letter to the Fast and Furious franchise. The cringe-worthy scenes still remain, the storytelling is logically fragile and it does go totally bonkers in the last five minutes of the third act. But you know what? I did not care that much. I already hear the voices of people judging me for giving such high praise to this franchise. You know, I get it if you didn't like the first four movies, I get it, but really just open your dam mind from and have some fun! There is no place on earth where you will find better crafted entertainment, action is an art and boy do these filmmakers excel at it. It doesn't hold up as well as the others upon further viewings because it really does almost go too over the top, but it manages to walk that fine line almost perfectly for it to be still a blast on re-watch.<br/><br/>From second one, I was jumping in my seat with joy, I was gasping trying to catch my breath, I felt like I was floating with laughter, this is how much fun is this movie. It is a two hour rush of adrenaline. Scene after scene you're thinking how the hell are they going to top that? And they do! There are sequences in this film that impacted me physically. I can't give the director, the stunts, the DPs, everybody enough credit. It really felt like the best action a human could ask for. As I said before, the movie stumbles here and there with some too over the top stuff or some rare times the scenes feel like filler, but you don't even have time to realize it that we already are at the next breath taking set piece. Credit also goes to the cast as always, who makes it even the more fun. There chemistry is stunning and they even bring the right amount of heart for someone like me who actually cares about them.<br/><br/>Now, to the big elephant in the room, how did they handle the death of Paul Walker? I personally think even the greatest minds on earth would have a hard time topping this. From a technical point of view I was always searching for the moment were it would pop on screen and it never came, it's flawless. Moreover, they gave the character such an emotionally correct farewell I had to shed a tear. It was really, really touching. Props to everybody involved, they handled this in the best way and in this occasion I too would like to say goodbye to the actor Paul Walker in his final film. Thanks for your contribution to this amazing action franchise, I can't believe how touching it was for me realizing how many time I had actually passed with you in your films. That ending was such an emotional punch! <br/><br/>Go see this movie and have a blast, if you're being sniffy about it either continue living in your ignorance or open your mind and go have the best fun ever!"
"jackainslie1","2","5","22","19 April 2015"," It just wouldn't end...
","This film has got to be one of the worst that I have ever seen. Apart from the tribute to Paul Walker the whole movie is absolute garbage. The action is completely unrealistic and I found myself laughing at its stupidity. James Wans' favorite way of showing us women appears to be showing us what is going on below the waistline. Everything about the film is cringe worthy, especially the dreadfully written script. There are so many clichés and cheesy one liners in this film that you end up annoyed. Vin Diesel's acting is unrealistic and laughable. The movie is far too long and appears to heavily rely on unrealistic action. Plus - Tribute to Paul Walker Minus - Everything else"
"lois-lane33","6","5","22","5 April 2015"," Its a hard film to review.
","In some ways its a great action film and in other ways its a total joke. Its a lot of fun to watch crazy car chases but the man to man fight scenes were 'over the top.' You don't get hit in the head with a 25 pound monkey wrench and just shake your head and keep fighting. Its a lot of stuff like that-death blows just pissing off characters- repeatedly-that gave me a bit of irritation. This type of film making is all about bigger faster and more action-so I suppose it all makes sense in the context of the movie but at the same time time I thought they might have toned down the Godzilla versus Hercules fight sequences into something that would apply to human beings. Its still watchable as good action film. I think this franchise never had a future beyond this film anyway for what its worth now that they probably won't be making any more of them due to Paul Walker not being around anymore.I only give it a six because of the abundance of unrealistic fight scenes. Its not supposed to be a Rocky movie."
"rut-willems","2","7","36","12 May 2015"," You have got to be kidding me..
","This movie was simply ridiculous, i mean the PW tribute at the end was very nice and heartwarming but this movie.....<br/><br/>The main characters suddenly were given the decision-making skills of a four year old to enable for the director to put as much of demolition, racing and explosions in this movie as possible. I've always enjoyed the F&F movies but this one was just too ridiculous, stunts went from highly unlikely to straight out impossible in combination with the fact that a team of 10 soldiers suddenly can't hit one single guy standing out in the open with automatic rifles and later in the movie when it IS convenient someone shoots a f*cking hand grenade over a distance of more than 200 meter with a f*cking handgun not to mention how that f*cking thing got there in the fist place!!<br/><br/>But sure don't believe me, go see for yourself and end up in a mental hospital, like me."

","How does garbage like this get a 7+ rating? This movie has several of my favorite stars, but it is one of the dumbest movies of all time. The special effects went so far beyond reasonable, that they just make you groan.<br/><br/>Here is an example: The need to catch a truck, so they decide to get in a cargo plane. They drive their cars out of the cargo plane and parachute down to the road. While in the air, they are steering their cars to navigate them. All (but one for comical relief) land perfectly on the road.<br/><br/>If people stopped watching trash like this, Hollywood would be forced to put out better movies.

","It's been described as a Vehicular action film. No question. As Dominic Torreto(Diesel) says: ""I don't have friends, I gots family"". How true is that. They stick together as if they were family. They look out for one another. Plot being fairly simple. From the past Fast & Furious series sequels, the film starts off with Deckard Shaw(Statham) being dangerous as ever. He is comforting his brother who has been put in hospital. Now I haven't seen ANY of the Fast & Furious. However fans of this series would know and be able to connect the dots. ahhaah.Overall great film. One word is very simple REVENGE. That's all there is to it. ahahah.

I am not too much into hot girls scenes so I am not missing super hot girls here, but could add some more girls to hand the eyes on. In general good movie with sad meaning and tributing to Paul.

"jmcd2007","10","2","6","7 April 2015"," Awesome Film...and a Fitting Tribute To a Wonderful Character and Person (R.I.P. Paul Walker)
","I walked into the theater knowing that this film would be Paul Walker's last...and also knew ahead of time that there would be a tribute to the him at the end credits, while also having his two brothers act as stand-ins to complete the film. My expectations were completely blown away. The addition of Statham as the villain (otherwise known as Deckard Shaw, who is out for revenge against Toretto's crew for the death of his brother Owen in Fast 6) was excellent, and really showed off his acting ability well here...not to mention his fine martial arts skills. The early battle between Dwayne Johnson and Statham were great too, with ""The Rock"" himself delivering his famous finishing move, otherwise known as ""The Rock Bottom"" to Statham through a glass table. Not only does Statham do battle with Dwayne, but with Vin Diesel as well, with the largest fight occurring toward the end of the film. Surprisingly, however, Dwayne's role is more limited here, as he spends a majority of the time recovering in the hospital after being thrown out of a building from a mine that Deckard detonated within Hobbs' (Dwayne Johnson) police headquarters. It really wasn't that big of a deal, though, as Dwayne kicks back into action once realizing through local news reports that trouble is brewing right outside his window.<br/><br/>As mentioned however, this film marks a somber note, and final goodbye, to one of the Fast & Furious franchises' most beloved character and actor, Paul Walker. Walker, who died at only 40 yrs. old in a horrific car crash on November 30, 2013, was featured prominently in the film, with his character, Brian O'Connor now getting used to the family life. Toward the beginning of the film, he is now driving a minivan and has one child with Mia. However, once Dom's house explodes thanks to a ""package"" that Deckard Shaw had sent to his residence, they all soon find themselves back into the ""game"" for ""one last ride."" Were there a few semi-impossible stunts and a decent amount of CGI used in this film? Yes, but we must remember that this is a movie and movies generally do tend to go this route sometimes. That's why they call it entertainment. Let's also remember that some CGI also had to be devoted to Paul Walker, too, who only completed around 60% of this film before his death, while his two brothers graciously stepped in to fill the void. If it weren't for them, this film might not have happened at all. In any case, this film had everything in it that I ever expected...and more. An emotional tribute to a great character and actor that will make even the most unemotional person cry. During the beach scene at the very end, you could tell that the actors themselves were no longer acting. Like many fans, they all looked very shook up over Walker's death, and from that scene on, you could tell that it was all real life from there on out. The movie closed out with Vin and Paul driving on a two lane highway, and then splitting down separate roads. The screen then faded to white and simply said...""For Paul."" If he were alive today, I'm sure Paul Walker would be very proud of this film. Even though I had no involvement in it whatsoever, I know I was. I'm sure his family would be, too."

This movie is a tribute to Paul Walker. Hat's off to the whole team of Furious 7.So ,if you have not watched this one then you must watch it. I recommend you to watch it in 3D .There are many scenes in the movie which will cause you goosebumps. The thrilling stunts will make you scream and clap. Even if you have not watched the prequels of this franchise,then also you should watch F7 for breathtaking stunts and thrilling action scenes.<br/><br/>a perfect 10 !!"

","When it comes to the Fast and Furious movies, you are either a fan or you're not. If you're not, there's really no reason to write a review here. The fact is that one of the stars of this film died during production and they still turned out an honorable film (in more ways than one) with the help of Paul Walker's brothers as doubles and some good, but sometimes noticeable CGI.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of this franchise, you need to go see this movie. Yes, it's over the top. Yes the dialog could be better. But what are we really there for? We're there for the ride that the last few movies have promised us, and we're there to see Paul Walker's final performance. If you're part of the ""family"" as I am, you'll be very satisfied with this movie, especially how they keep you on the edge of your seat for two hours wondering how they're going to answer the biggest question you'll have on your mind while watching it: how will Brian (Paul Walker's character) go? To even touch on ANY scene is to give you a spoiler. But get ready, the fights are better, the explosions are bigger, and the stunts are unbelievable. I was worried when I saw that the director from the ""Saw"" movies was at the helm, primarily because that was a purposely low budget consumer money grab that he gloated about publicly. However, after watching the film, you won't even realize that the director has changed. Fast fans, you won't be disappointed. Furious Seven delivers on all cylinders. RIP Paul Walker."

But there were missing some little details, in the scene when they arrived in Abu Dhabi, almost all elements for a classic fast and furious scene were present, there were fast expensive cars, slow motion close ups of beautiful girls but the Latin hip hop music was missing. If the Latin hip hop music was present this movie would be a 10/10, just for that scene. when eventually there was Latin music, which was almost at the end, but this was the wrong time to use Latin music. But overall I enjoyed the movie and would definitely recommend it to anybody who likes Latin music."
"r-sab-08","10","2","6","4 April 2015"," A ride indeed.
","Just had my second viewing and wow. This movie has it ALL. As a die hard fan since the beginning I loved every bit of this movie. It actually took a while to process everything I just saw because it is really full on, and that's not a bad thing at all. <br/><br/>Action is the best it has ever been and so are the stunts. There is some great continuation of the story and it ties all the movies up together pretty nicely. Tokyo Drift finally gets complete after the cameo Vin did in 2006. There was no race between DK and Dom which was a slight bummer but it was hinted Dom won, still a great scene and a nice throwback seeing Bow Wow and Nathalie Kelly briefly (Tokyo Drift footage). <br/><br/>Now knowing the tragic passing of Paul Walker, this film handled it well by using CGI to finish the movie. Props to everyone involved who did that, I can't imagine how hard that job must have been. After everything that happened and to just finish off the movie. The CGI for the most part was good, there is only so much you can do. <br/><br/>The one thing that stuck out as the most memorable and emotional part was the tribute to Paul Walker.

"rgkarim","9","2","6","3 April 2015"," Furious Excitement! A Tale of Brotherhood
","Fast and the Furious is a series that we have all fallen in love with. Ever since 2001 when the series came out, we have been exposed to beautiful cars, hot extras, and plenty of crime and punishment amidst their colorful cast. This weekend we jump into the seventh, yes seventh, installment to see if we get the same thrills and chills that we love. For the virgins of the series, and those who've seen the trailers, here is what you might expect:  High speed thrills and action  Beautiful women seen from all angles  Jason Statham being Jason Statham  A conclusion to Paul Walker's legendary role<br/><br/>Fans of the series know that this movie is all about coordinated plans that often involve beautiful cars performing unbelievable stunts. Well that trend continues with at least three lengthy sequences dedicated to showing off expensive cars being pushed to their limits. Fans will be pumping their fists in joy as Dom and the crew take their beauties across the world, country hopping as they fight off terrorism partnered with vendetta. In glorious high definition, alongside stable camera work, adrenaline junkies like myself will be more than happy with the exciting battles this movie has. While some of the situations are ridiculous, and a bit conventional, they are incredible displays of the glorious work special effects can craft. <br/><br/>In addition to the excitement, the directing team did a good job adding some additional character to the scenes. Furious 7 has plenty of laughs, especially in the brotherly exchange between Taj (Ludicrous) and Roman (Tyrese Gibson). I myself laughed the hardest at Gibson's scenes, where his stunts and dialog, combined with the delivery, were enough to relieve the tension. The action also held suspense, mainly due to the built relationship between the cast of this series. That dynamic, along with the wonder of who will make it, keeps you engaged in the battles, both the necessary and unnecessary battles. Unlike some other action movies, Furious 7 sometimes takes a little too much liberty for making an action sequence. A few of the scenes were a bit overdramatic, some of the fights quick write-ins to allow for cameos and character involvement. <br/><br/>Speaking of cameos, you can expect a lot of filler shots centered on the feminine figure. Guys will love seeing the curves of many beautiful ladies, most getting close enough to touch the derrieres they are shaking. The tight outfits and bountiful bosoms, or missiles as Roman calls them, will make many a man or boy, drool in delight at the gorgeous women before us. This brings me to another point, that Furious 7's editing could have used a little work. While the movie was exciting, there were plenty of scenes that could have been trimmed, or left out to shorten the run time and make a more conducive movie. <br/><br/>Now I mentioned how the relationship between the stars is a big part of this series, but what about newcomer Jason Statham. No surprise, the action star has little to say, and what he does comes out the same grunting mess he always does. Primarily he talks with his fists, or cars in this case, as the stunt man goes to work on his vendetta plan. I can say Statham still has some moves up his sleeve, but this role was not my favorite of his repertoire. He still had the threatening gaze, but his character lacked the finesse and skills I normally enjoy seeing. Much of his stunts were overexaggerated antics, painting him invincible instead of deadly. Fans of him will have no problem accepting this, but there were a lot of stretches with his character that I didn't quite enjoy in the grand scheme of things. The man is still good, don't get me wrong, but I think I enjoy his Expendable work more than the brother with an attitude. <br/><br/>Finally the tribute to Paul Walker; the man who started this series concluded his performance in a great manner. Walker's tale has heart, soul, and bite in this ""final"" installment. I felt I got good closure for the character Bryan O'Connor, getting to see the true man in the calm and collected warrior. Sure it wasn't the greatest backstory, but decent when blended with his action. The ending in particular gave me goosebumps, and captures the essence of the actors' relationships and the brotherhood they shared. Although not anything what I expected, I bow my head in honor of the action star. <br/><br/>To sum everything up Furious 7 is an awesome sequel that ranks high on my F&F list. Action wise it is one of the more exciting, and helps tie up the tales of almost all our characters. Is it truly over? I don't know; there is a lot of open ground to cover for a possible sequel. However, it brings the same excitement you like in the ridiculous world we've fallen in love with. Despite the plot conventionalities, disproportionate acting, and interesting editing choices, the movie is one of the better ones I have seen in a long time. Go see it in theaters, for the special effects, the engaging chemistry, and to close out the series. <br/><br/>My scores for Furious 7 are: Action/Crime/Thriller: 8.5 Movie Overall: 7.5-8.0"
"CleveMan66","9","2","6","3 April 2015"," ""Furious 7"" is one of the best action movies - ever.
","This is Paul Walker's final film. That's the armored truck in the room when talking about ""Furious 7"" (PG-13, 2:17), so I might as well address it up front. During a break from filming this installment, franchise regular Paul Walker died in a single-car crash on November 30, 2013. While mourning his loss, the film's producers set out to alter the script and make a plan to finish the movie without one of their most important characters. Walker had completed filming most of his dialog before his death. Four men similar in physique to Walker, including his brothers, Caleb and Cody, were hired to help complete Walker's scenes. All that, with a little CGI help, has produced a film which is likely to please action film fans and Paul Walker fans the world over.<br/><br/>This film's story begins at the end of the last film, ""Fast & Furious 6"" (2013). The last scene in that film has someone killing Han (Sung Kang) on the streets of Tokyo and immediately making a phone call saying, ""You don't know me. You're about to."" Early in ""Furious 7"" we see that the recipient of that call was none other than Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), the only character to appear in all seven movies. The villain making the call is Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the older brother of the man who Dominic and company defeated and left for dead in the previous film. Immediately after the call, a package explodes, destroying the home of Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster) and their young son. All three of them (along with Dominic) narrowly escape being killed, as does Luke, whom Shaw attacked at work. As Tej (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) says to Roman (Tyrese Gibson) at Han's funeral, ""We're being hunted."" Indeed they are. They need to get to Shaw before he can get any more of them.<br/><br/>A mysterious government agent (Kurt Russell), who simply refers to himself as ""Mr. Nobody"" can help Dominic's gang, but Nobody needs something in return. A terrorist named Jakande (Djimon Hounsou) has stolen a computer chip that Nobody refers to as ""God's Eye"" and also kidnapped the program's designer, known only as ""Ramsey"" (Nathalie Emmanuel). God's Eye can use ""anything with a lens or a microphone"" (surveillance cameras, cell phones, etc.) and facial recognition software to find anyone in the world. Mr. Nobody tells Dominic that, if his gang can retrieve the computer chip, then he can use it to find Shaw. Dom agrees and Nobody assembles Dom's crew, including Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), who is still struggling to regain the memory she lost in a major accident earlier in the series. The quest for the chip and, ultimately for the chance to kill Shaw before he kills all of them, takes this ""family"", as Dom calls them, to Azerbaijan, Abu Dhabi and back home to Los Angeles. Along the way, the gang find themselves in all manner of deadly situations. Anyone who has seen the movie's theatrical trailer can tell that the action is the wildest yet, and can only guess that there's a lot more where that came from. (They'd be guessing right.) Not only is the action in ""Furious 7"" the best in the franchise to date, so is the film. Sure, some of the dialog can be a bit hokey and the beatings the characters take should either kill them or land them in the hospital right next to The Rock's character, but that's all part of the fun. The film's plot allows us to see the characters in a variety of exciting chase scenes, intense fight scenes and practically impossible scenes of ""vehicular warfare"", all while dealing with some serious real life situations. I meant real life as in the lives of their characters, but the movie also deftly handles the real life human tragedy of Walker's untimely passing. When I reviewed the previous entry of this franchise, I gave it a ""B+"" and wrote ""with the possibility of an even higher grade for the next one, based on the last scene of this one."" I got what I hoped for. ""Furious 7"" is one of the best action movies – ever. ""A"""
"tewarrior2","9","2","6","3 April 2015"," The best yet
","I do not particular write reviews on movies because generally I say them in person but this one is way to good to pass up on. People who rated this less then a 7 are completely lost when it comes to movies and should take film school or be a director if they can do better which they can't because they are to busy being self centered. This movie was one of the best movies in the whole Fast & Furious series and deserves an 8.5 but I did a 9 because it was better then an 8. If you want action, you got it! If you wanted fast muscle and exotic cars, you got it! If you wanted intense scenes and good drama, you got that too. If you wanted this to be a tribute to Paul Walker well, you got that as well at the end of the movie. I think an 8.5 is perfect for this movie because this movie has a great mix of it all and can definitely go for an Oscar nominee. This is why I have chosen to write this because my review isn't based on Paul Walker no longer being with us but based on a great movie which is what Furious 7 is. Trust me it is hard for me to give 10's out for movies or TV series because it literally has to be perfect and I only have a few 10's I have ever given out: The Shawshank Redemption, Game of Thrones, The Dark Knight, and The Godfather."

","Paul Walker's last movie, the seventh installment of the hit series of Fast and Furious. In every part, you can find mind blowing stunts and action sequences. Somehow, they are illogical, but, can give entertainment. And that's the reason this series is popular in youngsters basically who love cars, cash and girls! This is the sequel of its last part, though it is connected with Tokyo Drift, too. Jason Stathom becomes the villain in this part. Whenever he enters to the screen, the crowd shouts and give him a roaring welcome every time. Vin Diesel and Paul Walker and their team, are ready to finish Jason and one other villain who is behind the hacker girl. Team has to save the girl and take the revenge of the death of their teammate. This is the storyline, and it is full of action scenes. Director James Wan did a quiet good job. I think this is probably the best part of these series. 15 minutes before interval will blow your mind, and it will be refund of your ticket. The car scene jumping from one to another building in Abu Dhabi is also marvelous. The fight scenes between Vin-Jason and Paul- are just fantastic. It's cool for Ali Fazal to do a small role in this movie. This will help him in more Hollywood projects. Everyone knows that Paul Walker is no more. Some portions has been shoot using his body double, particularly his brother. Though, it is the last ride, in the end, Paul Walker's journey in this series has been displayed. Dialogues of that frame have been written beautifully. Some spectators started clapping in those frames. The film is dedicated to Paul, and that's why, the last line on the screen was ""For Paul"".

","The most recent production of the Fast and the Furious franchise does not bring anything new compared to its predecessors. The moments of action are equally interesting, intense, furious and fast as in other movies. And so are the characters. As for the story, it doesn't really matter in this film. Seems like it would be there just to provide a decent separation of Paul Walker. And it manages to do so. He gets exactly what he deserves. The Director uses some interesting techniques. It is obvious that he has been inspired by the many successful films of the genre action-thriller for the production of this film and he tries to emulate them in a discreet manner. There are some memorable moments in this film. For example I will never forget the skydiving cars. But there are some moments that are not plausible at all, for example, a man who has no scratches after he falls with his car in a gap of at least 500 meters. And this is not the only scene full of mistakes. There are many similar moments that make the film look as if it had a budget of $ 1 million, instead of $ 250 million. It is easily seen that the Furious 7 is directed by an amateur. Too much money from the budget have been allocated to the actors and too few for the filmmaker. In conclusion, this film successfully manages to bring quality action to the big screen, but overall it is a mediocre film that does nothing original to the film industry."
"murtaza_mma","7","5","23","2 April 2015"," A Potpourri of Vestiges Review: Every bit as fast and furious as some of the franchise's previous installments, if not more
","Fast & Furious 7 (aka Furious 7) is every bit as fast and furious as some of the franchise's previous installments, if not more. Fast & Furious 7 showcases adrenaline pumping action from start to finish with Vin Diesel once again leading the juggernaut as the macho anti-hero Dominic Toretto. From LA to Tokyo to Azerbaijan to Abu Dhabi, the movie is high octane and absolute carnage and it features some of the coolest heart-stopping fight as well as chase sequences seen in recent times.<br/><br/>If you are excited by fast cars, hot chicks, badass dudes, and exotic locations then Fast & Furious 7 would certainly impress you. Like with most action movies, the plot is secondary and what happens is of little consequence vis-a-vis how it happens. While the heroes are larger than life and the villains don't get any meaner than this. Jason Statham is a great addition to the franchise and his presence as the story's antagonist immensely adds to the thrill and excitement.<br/><br/>In Fast & Furious 7, Paul Walker is quite impressive in sadly what is his last screen appearance. He will certainly be missed. Michelle Rodriguez is kickass as ever as Toretto's love interest Letty; the chemistry between Rodriguez and Diesel is electrifying. In one of the movie's most scintillating fighting sequences, Rodriguez battles the American mixed martial artist and judoka Ronda Rousey. The raw intensity of the entire scene (given that Rodriguez herself is a trained boxer) makes it absolutely breathtaking to behold.<br/><br/>Although, he gets less screen time than usual, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson makes his presence felt in Fast & Furious 7 (all thanks to his hulky physique and great comic timing). Another actor who deserves a special mention is Kurt Russell who is easily the movie's biggest surprise package and an absolute treat to watch. It's a role that can be seen as a tribute to some of Russell's memorable performances in the Action flicks of the '80s, particularly the movies directed by John Carpenter. The supporting cast is solid as ever.<br/><br/>While the action can be nonsensical at times, it is great fun to see men fight like machines, and at the end of the day we can't really complain. Can we? Well, who can nitpick at the sight of a sports car jumping from one skyscraper to another? Who can be bored by the sight of a half-a-dozen cars getting jettisoned from an airplane? Who can be turned off by the sight of two alpha males beating the hell out of each other in a street fight of sorts? <br/><br/>The bottom line is that Fast & Furious 7 is supposed to be an Action feast and action is what it exactly delivers. It is a very strong contender to be adjudicated as the best film of the franchise, thus far. Fortunately, the action never gets to the point of being obnoxious like so often the case with the films from the Transformer series. Fast & Furious 7 is the perfect Summer Blockbuster from Hollywood; the movie has set the benchmark for the upcoming Action films this summer. The movie's greatest USP is that it is exactly what it is supposed to be, no less or no more.<br/><br/>(This review was first published in my film blog A Potpourri of Vestiges)"

","Fast cars, fist fights, and Dwanye freaking Johnson. It's no wonder this movie made over 1.5 billion dollars at the box office. Though Furious 7 may not be one of the greatest movies of all time, it is sure worth a watch. It starts a little slow but when the pace picks up, look out. This film is jam packed with as much action as one could dream of. Unlike most of the other Fast and Furious movies, this movie focuses more on the problems and drama of ""the family."" It is touching where it needs to be and badass where it should be.
Furious 7 blends action and drama in a wonderful way. It is a beautiful end to Brian O'Conner's saga. A person can't help but tear up during the end scene which acts as a tribute to Paul Walker. It is 110% worth the 2 hours and 20 minutes to watch."

","Very disappointing. inferior in every way to the previous two. There was some crazy stuff in them, but nothing like this one. Not only was it ridiculously absurd many times, the action in general wasn't even done well. lots of shaky cam. the fights were hard to follow and didn't flow well with the different battles like they did so flawlessly in the others. You can easily tell it was directed by a different person. I looked up his previous movies he directed and most of them were horror films, including the first Saw. it tried to take itself too seriously and get too emotional. the rock was barely in it. that along with the characters they previously lost made this team a lot less fun than the last two. also in previous ones, everyone had their roles, with some overlap. in this one, everyone could fight and shoot. Statham was awesome as a villain but was very underused. And the other villain was stupid (2 viewings)"

","Fast and Furious 7 is an action-packed movie that will get your on the edge of your seat, make you laugh, and drive all your attention into the movie screen. After watching Fast and Furious 7 I couldn't help but feel the need to go do something dangerous the adrenaline rush this movie gives you is unlike any other. The feeling that you cheated death just by watching the movie is absolutely remarkable. There are many scenes in this movie that give me this feeling but the two stand out the most are when Brain (Paul Walker) gets trapped in a bus sliding off a cliff and he runs up the bus as its going off the edge and grabs hold to Letty's (Michelle Rodriguez) spoiler on her car. Although some of the CGI in this particular scene looked a little unrealistic the focus was more on Brain and did no the effect the power and meaning of the scene. And the other is when the crew backs their cars out of a flying plane and parachute down to a small mountain road. This was absolutely insane to watch as they had real footage of them dropping these cars out of a plane.
The whole plot of the movie was dealing with the kidnap of Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) over a surveillance device that can use any camera or microphone to find anyone and anything within minutes called God's Eye. Finding the chip to this device leads them all over the world including Dubai where Dom drives a 3.4 million dollar supercar, the Lykan hypersport, which contained the chip through three buildings tens of stories in the air. During all of this Brian's wife is kidnapped and they are forced to hand over the God's eye chip. With the chip in the wrong hands they now have to have Ramsey hack the system but the only problem is is that the bads guys with the chirp and in a helicopter and she needs to be within one mile for the hack to work. They basically play hot potato with Ramsey in cars while being shot at from above until the hack is complete. They then blow the chopper out of the sky in a dramatic car jump grenade shot. They recover God's Eye and the security of the world is restored.
This is the director's, James Wan, first action movie as he was more formally known for his work in the horror industry. But it's safe to say he nailed this and I would hope to see him creating more action movies in the future. Wan did a great job giving the movie an intense feel the whole time except when Roman (Tyrese Gibson) who is the crew's jokester/ladies man that lightens the mood would speak up. Roman never failed to make me laugh and is an essential part of the movie to create a more well-rounded crew. Although some of the stunts were a tad far fetched, that's what I would have hoped to expect from a Fast and Furious movie, it's what keeps us coming back for more. I also cannot say enough good things about the soundtrack to this movie I personally have downloaded over half of the songs from this movie and listen to them all of the time. And finally, my favorite part about this movie was the tribute to Paul Walker at the end. Paul has been a huge part of the Fast and Furious movies and his character Brian is more important than any other character in these movies. The tribute Wan gave to him was very respectful and brought tears to my eyes as well as many others. Overall this was a great action movie with a lot of different elements that are entertaining for everyone. It is a movie I would highly recommend seeing and a fun movie for people of all ages."

","Granted that I can't claim to be a fan of the ""Fast & Furious"" series, but still have managed to gotten around to watching them all whenever the chance presented itself. Though this is definitely not movies that will lure me to the cinema. It took me about two years after its initial release to get around to watching ""Furious 7""; yeah, these movies are not high on my to-watch-list.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" was every bit as I had expected, which wasn't much. Sure, there is an abundance of cars and action here, which is essentially the only thing that the franchise is about.<br/><br/>Story-wise, then ""Furious 7"" was every bit up to par with the previous six movies. So if you enjoyed those previous movies, you will also enjoy this one. Just don't expect storytelling on a grand scale.<br/><br/>Personally I can't claim to have any interest in Vin Diesel or his inability to act and his monotone delivery of every single line. However, Jason Statham, Dwayne Johnson and Michelle Rodriguez is what I enjoy watching in this franchise. The cast is actually quite alright, and has been so throughout the entire franchise. It was quite nice to have Tony Jaa and Kurt Russell show up in ""Furious 7"".<br/><br/>There is a lot of action and cars in the movie, as I mentioned earlier. Personally I don't care much about cars in any way or fashion, so that has little appeal to me. The action, however, now that was top notch. Actually, some of the scenes were just so over the top and campy that it was hard not to laugh at how ludicrous of it all was. I mean, the scene where Dwayne Johnson breaks off his cast and goes to pick up a Gatling gun to take on a helicopter was just too much. I was actually ready to turn off the movie when they dropped out of an airplane in their cars and almost all of them practically managed to land spot on the road, that was just downright ridiculous. And finally the scene where they had a car jump through three buildings was also seriously too much.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" is definitely a movie made for the male audience, so it is filled with testosterone, cars and action.<br/><br/>While it certainly is an entertaining movie, it is also a movie that you shouldn't take too seriously, because it is just blown way out of proportions and lacks a sense of realism. ""Furious 7"" is hardly a groundbreaking movie by any means, but proved to be just as entertaining as the previous six movies in the franchise."
"eric262003","8","1","2","4 June 2017"," Great Send-Off to Paul Walker (1973-2013)
","Since its fruition in 2001, the ""Furious"" movies has been a high octane franchise that churns out exciting adrenaline-pumping action mixed with colourful characters and intense story-lines. The first of the series had a ""Point Break"" thing going for it. The second one was a letdown due to Vin Diesel's absence, but it was still exhilarating. ""Tokyo Drift"" was the worst of the bunch. The forth one was great the Vin Diesel and Paul Walker came back and came into the idea of adding fast cars action with espionage James Bond themed stories and since then it has never looked back. The series from 4-6 had shifted gears towards action films very reminiscent to popular movie franchises of the 1980's and 1990's and each film was played solely from the heart, which is a good thing, because never once does it feel forced, doesn't insult your intelligence and not played for cheap thrills. ""Furious 7"" follows that trend like the 4-6 of the series only this time instead of jumping for joy in excitement, I was in tears of joy because the movie was well made, but tears of sadness as this was Paul Walker's last film before his tragic death.<br/><br/>To be frank, I was a little hesitant of seeing ""Furious 7"". I was scared, that this film was just there to cash in another franchise just for the sake of it. I also thought that Paul Walker's death would be too much heavy-cargo for me to sit there and realize that I'm watching an underrated performer to never grace the big screen again. Another thing that made me hesitant was that Justin Lin was not coming back this time around to direct. And though James Wan was great in his directing debut in the franchise, we see that action is not the genre of his craft. Granted there was some great usage of slow-motion captures and Wan seems at ease with the ""Wan-cam"", but still many times the editing of the action can be a bit rusty and sloppy and the close cuts and the zooms make the action hard to follow at times. It's still ten times better than ""Taken 3"", but the scenery is opaque and indecipherable at times. There are some really cool moments like when Brian O'Connor's (Walker) speeding down the transport and was about to fall to his demise, but was successfully rescued in Letty Ortiz's (Michelle Rodriguez) car. Sadly, the action scenes are not in the same league as series 4-6. The showdown was a bit of a disappointment, the drone fiasco left very little impression because I was more excited about an epic showdown between Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). It truly pales in comparison to ""Fast 6"" where the entire swat has his and her time to shine. Although she was best thing to happen in ""The Expendables 3"", I thought Rhonda Rousey was badly wasted here as a Head of Security to an Abu Dhabi billionaire.<br/><br/>Even though the action was not up to par from the series 4-6, it was still very character driven. It was great to see Walker and Diesel go at one more time for one last ride. Dwayne Johnson was Luke Hobbs shows why he's valuable asset to the franchise. Michelle Rodriguez shows she one of the toughest action film stars out there and it's a pleasure watching her kick butt. Jason Statham is by far one of the best villains in the franchise in hopes he plays more villainy characters in the near future. And even though I may have been a bit down on the action, it's still fun to watch in all its over-the-top imagination. The pacing is executed briskly up to bring some action and character develop,meant. Very entertaining and a nice swan song for Paul Walker. The last five minutes of the movie were very emotional and it was handled in a very crisp, tender moment and the epilogue to O'Connor was fulfilling and very well executed. Even though there are more sequels to come, there's part of me that wished this film would end the franchise because the ending was so perfect. After the credits rolled I really left the theatre satisfied given I was entertained, engaged and filled with tears in both joy and sadness as O'Connor drives his fast-car into the heaven's above."
"bobbystryker","8","1","2","9 April 2015"," Whether you're a fan of the series or not, you need to see this! Read on to find out why!
","It's with mixed feelings that I approach this review. Fresh in my mind from last night's screening, who would have thought that a Fast and Furious movie would be making such deep waves amongst the movie-going world. I am of course referring to the fact that this is Paul Walker's last movie.<br/><br/>I never really liked the series until they left the whole boy racer attitude behind and embraced full-blown all out action as their genre of choice in Fast 5. It was a turning point for the series and made people once again stand up and take note of the franchise.<br/><br/>It was obviously never intended to have come this far but I think most people are happy it has. Weaving into the mix the seemingly off kilter events of Tokyo Drift, fans had their interests piqued, curious to know how everything would fit in.<br/><br/>Fast and Furious 6 further embraced the action genre and really hit things out of the park. The Rock was now an established and loved member of the family; bringing some much needed charisma to the franchise. The scale of the action was brought up to level 11 out of 10 and with a sneaky after credits scene, fans were ready for the next installment.<br/><br/>So here we are, Furious 7.<br/><br/>Dare I say that this movie is actually not as strong as either 5 or 6? <br/><br/>Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the big bad brother of the Fast and Furious 6 villain, is out to take down the team that took down his brother.<br/><br/>A former black ops assassin gone rogue, Deckard starts to come after the Fast & Furious team one by one. His first stop, The Rock! Something that turns out to be one of the best fight scenes in the movie (yes, even better than those involving Tony Jaa).<br/><br/>If this was the set-up plain and simple, the movie probably would have been better. But then it wouldn't have been possible for them to introduce Mission Impossible style craziness. <br/><br/>So cue the unnecessary plot twist of having Diesel and his team go on a wild goose chase for some super-computer hacker to allow Diesel's team to find and eliminate Statham, which seems even more ridiculous given that Statham is there at almost every turn trying to kill them all.<br/><br/>But as mentioned above, this convoluted plot allows the director to introduce some pretty amazing and nail biting action set pieces in exotic locations. <br/><br/>I have no idea if there are really bikini-clad women prancing around in Abu Dhabi, but Furious 7 makes us believe there are.<br/><br/>By the time we reach the last half an hour or so, it's all out action and it's pretty impressive. <br/><br/>Invariably with so many actors involved, some characters get thrown to the wayside. There should have been way more of The Rock, there should have been more Tony Jaa doing what he does best, and what on earth were they playing at with Kurt Russell's character? It's a crime to under-utilize the amazing Russell in this way, but admittedly having him in there is better than not having him in there at all.<br/><br/>Statham's character suffers the most from having so many people in the mix. He goes from being a mysterious cloak and dagger style super threat to being something of a cartoonish over the top villain by the end.<br/><br/>Overall, there are just too many unbelievable and cheesy scenes for my liking.<br/><br/>So why then do I recommend everyone to go and see this? <br/><br/>Because of Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Paul's passing is handled with dignity and respect. The special effects used to allow Paul's brothers to stand in for him could have been distasteful and distracting but director James Wan ensures that this is never the case.<br/><br/>In all honesty, I don't think I've ever seen a movie that's choked me up and brought me to tears in the way Furious 7 did. It doesn't matter whether you're some gangster tough guy or whatever, you need to bring your man-sized box of tissues with you if you're gonna watch this movie. A certain moment just really got to me and the image has stayed with me until now.<br/><br/>I was never really a fan of Paul's but by the end of the movie, it's obvious that he was loved by all the cast. <br/><br/>We've all read how Diesel cried when he visited Paul's mother after Paul died. It's this real life brotherhood between Diesel and Paul that makes certain scenes so much more powerful. It's not Dominic Toretto's last words to Brian O'Connor, it's Vin Diesel's last words to Paul Walker. <br/><br/>A touching, respectful and powerful farewell. <br/><br/>Well worth checking out.<br/><br/>FOR THIS AND OTHER REVIEWS CHECK OUT MAXIMUMEXTREME.NET"

","Reviewed by: Dare Devil Kid (DDK)<br/><br/>Rating: 4.6/5 stars<br/><br/>Serving up a fresh round of over-the-top thrills while adding unexpected dramatic heft, ""Furious 7"" keeps the franchise moving in more ways than one. Continuing the global exploits in this unstoppable franchise built on speed; Vin Diesel, Paul Walker and Dwayne Johnson lead the returning cast of this chapter directed by James Wan that also welcomes back favorites Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, and Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, along with Elsa Pataky and Lucas Black in special appearances. They are joined by international action stars new to the franchise including Jason Statham, Djimon Hounsou, Tony Jaa, Ronda Rousey, and Kurt Russell.<br/><br/>This time around Dominic Torretto and his crew finally think they've left the criminal mercenary life behind after being granted full, government-sanctioned pardons for their hand in defeating international terrorist Owen Shaw. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw is out for vengeance, and orchestrates a series of attacks on the crew, resulting in the death of a key member, and leaving another gravely wounded. Worse, a Somalian terrorist called Jakarde, and a shady government official called Mr. Nobody are both competing to steal a computer program called God's Eye, that can hack into any technological device around the world within mere seconds. Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between terrorists and the United States government.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" is, without a vestige of doubt, the best chapter in the franchise - no two ways about it. The production is all about raising the stakes to top the erstwhile entries, and boy does it succeed in doing so! Even though this installment is as zippy, playful, and amiably preposterous as the previous two models (the analogy with parts 5 and 6 are being made considering they were hitherto the best in the series), it still feels bigger, faster, funnier, and yes, more touching. The action and chase sequences are visceral and triumphant with the film boasting the craziest stunts, campiest dialogue, warmest of most warm fellowships of any entry yet. The sequels have grown progressively outrageous but they've shrewdly embraced a semi- comedic style, and this has only served to benefit the series - the way this gang cheats death in the Fast & Furious milieu is closer to the rules that govern cartoons like the ""Looney Toons"" and ""Wile E. Coyote and The Road Runner"". Kudos to Director James Wan (who now turns his sights towards action after earning his place as a horror auteur, and comes out with flying colors) and his stunt team for pulling out all the stops in their quest to deliver a complete package of no-holds- barred, gleefully outrageous action sequences that make the movie feel so transcendent and fantastically entertaining. Just when you think they've gone as far over-the-top as possible, they do a whole bunch of more unimaginable, crazy stuff.<br/><br/>Anyway, these films were never meant to be emotionally deep or boast incredible acting and nuanced plot lines - and anyone expecting such things is either just plain inane or needs to acknowledge that the franchise isn't their cup of tea. That being said, ""Furious 7"" ends up having some surprisingly touching subtexts concerning family - not necessarily people united by blood, but by loyalty and friendship. The camaraderie here is stronger than it has ever been. And though the performances aren't going to lay claim to any acting honors by any stretch of the imagination, it's the authentic chemistry of the entire cast, their wittily delivered one-liners, and the magnetic star appeal of the likes of Diesel and Johnson that lend melody to the film's relentless beat.<br/><br/>Most importantly, ""Furious 7"" could have easily come across as morbid and schmaltzy, but it's not until the very end that we're reminded of Paul Walker's fate, and the filmmakers handle it with taste and respect. An additional scene - obviously shot and juxtaposed after Walker's sad demise - before the end credits roll pays a fine tribute to Walker and his impact on the series, and more significantly his bond with the rest of the cast. If this is the final entry of the franchise, then it's a perfect ode not just to the series, but to the life of the late Paul Walker as well. By the end of it all, I challenge any regular follower of these movies to keep their tears at bay. Anyway, despite having a whale of a time, one does get the feeling that they should just stop now and leave on a high note, instead of ruining it all by overdoing a really good thing.<br/><br/>Explosive, spellbinding, and surprisingly touching, ""Furious 7"" is a fitting farewell to Paul Walker and probably to the franchise, too. Simply put, ""Furious 7"" is one of the biggest, loudest, zaniest, and ""holy crap that was incredible!!!"" action movies ever."

Viewers with me on the theater sniffed, not just on the last scene, but on one or more occasions mentioned above. The emotions slowly build up, and in the end.. Please see for yourself. <br/><br/>On other aspects of the film, they let the cars work it here, unlike any other film, no narrations about specs etc. With the action, it's pretty much blinding, they were quick and appear to be precise.

","In the seventh installment of the franchise and the first to take place after the events of Tokyo Drift, has Dominic Toretto and company now back in the states now that they have been pardoned for their past crimes. However the return is short lived when Han is killed by Owen's older brother Deckard Shaw who wants revenge on Dom for his comatose brother. Among other obstacles faced in the film is Letty trying to regain her memories and Mia being pregnant with a baby girl and Brian dealing with the adjustment of fatherhood. Dom swears revenge on their fallen comrade which reunites the crew once again to find Ramsey who is a hacker who has a program called God's Eye that is a tracking device. I will say what made the film emotional for me was the tragic passing of Paul Walker who died while the film was still in production which created a difficult situation for the cast and crew. However I will say that Paul is given a decent send-off for his character and the way the film ends concludes the series in a proper way if there was an 8th film."

","This is yet another crappy FaF film filled with unrealistic stunts and American patriotism. Corny dialog, terrible story and terrible characters. I can't see how anyone in there right mind can enjoy this utter tat. All it is, is explosions, woah, butts, yeah, 'Murica, F*** YEAH yet somehow it still receives 7.7 on IMDb. When I went to see i sat down ready to see a bad film but the level of stupidity in this film, there is a scene where Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson rips a mini-gun off an attack helicopter and then carries it around and uses it by hand, and this is after he had his arm broke. Speaking of his broken arm, he sees some action on the news in the hospital stands up out of bed and bends his arm to make the cast break of he then proceeds to use the mini-gun. I mean for god's sake that's not possible. There is also no laws of physics in the Furious universe so don't expect any realism. No one important dies in the film and at the end there is a tribute to Paul Walker which sadly did not last long enough to bring any real emotion, it's about 1 minute of Vin Diesel having flash backs."
"biliander","3","5","24","5 April 2015"," Just a terrible movie
","I have never wrote a movie review so far, but this film got me so ""furious"" after leaving the theater that I had to express my disbelief in IMDb. The plot is very, very weak, but given the franchise, this is not such a problem as we all are expecting more action, racing and effects than a good story. <br/><br/>Yet they took the good things in the franchise way too far. The stunts are defying the law of physics and common sense in such a ridiculous matter that it is laughable instead of enjoyable. <br/><br/>The characters are getting worse and worse with each movie, a bunch of racers and mechanics who fight on even terms with world deadliest secret agents or can hack everything. I don't know who decided that every character in the movie should be a super hero, but that decision and its execution were extremely poorly made. To the point where The Avengers is more realistic movie than Furious 7. <br/><br/>The only positive from the movie is the Paul Walker tribute, yet this cannot justify the high score in IMDb or the movie as a whole."
"shovv-50180","1","42","349","27 April 2015"," No disrespect to Paul (RIP) but this movie is awful, surprised that it got 7.9/10
","I am a big fan of the F&F series & thats why i wanted to this movie to be somewhat exceptional, especially for Paul but this movie was full of unrealistic events. Surely, a lot of people would love to see cars falling out of the sky. Some might even love the special effects but I didn't. The stuns and most of the actions made no sense. Lemme explain why:<br/><br/>1- The unrealistic stuff started from the parachute landing, i know that they did throw out cars from the sky for real but if you ever studied physics you'd know what would happen to a car if it falls down from sky to ground, even with a parachute! Also the way Dom went through from one building to another breaking glasses, made me think If I was watching ""Shaolin Racing"" a sequel of Shaolin Soccer. <br/><br/>2- Dom & his crew pull out that parachute stunt with the help of govt officials to rescue this hacker called Ramsey, but at the same spot Deckard Shaw appeared out of blue, without any problems. <br/><br/>3- When Dom & his crew went to that Jordanian Prince's mansion to retrieve Ramsey's chip, they faced Deckard Shaw again who appeared with a gun in his hands. The whole mansion was loaded with security officials thats why Taz had to hack their system so that Dom, Letti & Brian get to recover the chip, but Shaw was at his ease and appeared as a superhero.<br/><br/>4- When Shaw threw a grenade at Hobbs, the whole apartment got destroyed buy at the same apartment Shaw was fine & safe because he was hiding behind a wooden table. The grenade that can destroy an entire apartment, can't cause damage to a table? Well Shaw didn't even get any scratches, his face was just covered with a little dust.<br/><br/>5- When Dom followed and found Shaw, Govt officials came out of nowhere and intervened. Because of the govt officials Shaw managed to escape and right after that the govt officials asked Dom to catch Shaw with the help of God's eye. Why go through so much trouble when you could have already arrested Shaw? Couldn't you rescue Ramsey & God's Eye after arresting Shaw? <br/><br/>Overall, Furious seven is a awful movie. And please, don't rate this movie high because of Paul, we all love him but please let's be honest here. Thank You"
"Rob_Taylor","6","4","18","15 September 2015"," Furious 7: Jumping the Shark
","I wanted to like this. Really, I did! As Paul Walkers final film, I was hoping they would have done something interesting and different with the story and they did. But not in a good way.<br/><br/>In essence, they tried to turn Furious 7 into Mission Impossible. Before very long in the movie, the gang are working for ""Da Man"" - in this case Kurt Russel - and helping him recover a piece of technology for the security forces. Said technology will then be used to help them find Jason Statham's character, who is out to get them.<br/><br/>Sounds reasonable, right? Unfortunately, this premise is quickly overwhelmed with utterly ridiculous nonsense such as cars parachuting out of a plane to land perfectly on a winding mountain road; Coaches armed with mini-guns down the sides like some kind of road-going galleon; Reinforced concrete parking structures that collapse like they are sandcastles on a beach; People fighting and hitting each other in the face with plumber's wrenches and barely even feeling it.<br/><br/>You get the idea? It is ridiculous. As if they just decided to ramp up the stupid and to hell with it.<br/><br/>So is it really that bad? Well, I guess if you have no understanding of how the real world works - physics, gravity and so on - then I suppose it is a decent enough action film. The problem really lies with how this movie takes itself far too seriously. None of the aforementioned excesses would be out of place in a comedy spy film. Yet here, they just stand out. Instead of saying ""Whoah! Did they just do that?"" you end up saying ""You've gotta be effing shitting me!"" Furious 7 is a parody of its own franchise, piling on the impossible action and saying ""To hell with the consequences"". After the previous outing, I didn't think they could make it any more unbelievable, but they have.<br/><br/>The result is an unsatisfying movie where nobody dies except the bad guys and everyone has Neo-like abilities when it comes to defying gravity and physics. It's just too much. Far from being a fitting send-off to the franchise, it just ends up teeth-grittingly annoying and tiresome.<br/><br/>So was there anything good? Well, there was some interesting camera-work in the early fight sequences, with the camera following characters as they rolled around. Literally the camera rolled with them. Quite a nice effect, actually. The car driving was, as usual, enjoyable to watch, though the stunts were less so.<br/><br/>However, other than that, there is little to recommend this movie apart from the silliness. If you've seen other F&F movies, this one is just more of the same, but done in such an over-the-top manner as to make it tedious, not exciting.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: Beyond ridicule. Too much excess that no one tried to reign in. Tries to reinvent itself as a spy-action movie. Not so much Mission Impossible, as Mostly Impossible."
"EShy","2","4","19","23 May 2015"," Crazy stunts and nothing else
","The biggest problem with this movie is that any plot in there was written around the crazy car stunt ideas they had.<br/><br/>Jumping with the car between skyscrapers? Awesome. <br/><br/>Moving between cars while spinning at high speeds? Cool.<br/><br/>How about parachuting with the cars? realistic? of course not. It's not even original (there was a car ad that did the same stunt). <br/><br/>These stunts are crazy and fun (so what if none of it is realistic).<br/><br/>I just wish they could create a plot that makes sense around it.<br/><br/>They got the brother seeking revenge as the main bad guy. In Die Hard with a Vengeance that idea worked great to justify McClane's involvement (because really, how does that s#$@ keeps happening to him?).<br/><br/>The problem with that plot is that there's not enough there to justify two hours of crazy stunts. So a secondary plot is introduced. The team has to rescue a hacker and find a device that would help them track down the revenge seeking brother. <br/><br/>That would have worked, if that bad guy didn't show up at every location. He shows up every single time and instead of trying to get him they try to escape. <br/><br/>This movie makes no sense but the stunts are fun. Just ignore the dialog and any attempts at a plot and maybe you can enjoy it.<br/><br/>This movie made a lot of money so another is probably on the way. Hopefully they'll use some of that money to hire a real screenwriter"
"jamamaes","6","4","19","15 April 2015"," Mindless action with great tribute.
","To watch this film you must have a mind that does not nitpick and that can look over the impossible stunts that are performed in this film. It is amazing some of the visuals but it is just so ridiculous it takes away from the film. It gives it that impossible feel that I don't think suites this film. I am all for seeing a bus go off a cliff in an action sequence but with the stupidity that one of the characters escapes to then jump on a spoiler is something I cannot accept. <br/><br/>I did enjoy the characters to some extent and I could take on board the story of Jason Statham's character view on them attacking his family. However I would of much preferred seeing them go head to head rather than him just jumping into the plot for the story convenience. It seemed a bit forced. But I had come to expect this from the Fast and Furious franchise. <br/><br/>This is a perfect film to put on when there is nothing else to watch or when it is on television for a bit of mindless action. But I do not thing it is a great thing for action films of the future to take a leap from this film as I assume the one billion it will make worldwide will influence more films to come. I would like to see some plausibility to the action and think ""wow that could of happened"". Not ""wow this is stupid"" when i see a car go through three skyscrapers and they some how survive. <br/><br/>After all of this the tribute to Paul Walker was a very touching moment and it is one I will re-watch as I did like the chemistry with all the characters. Paul Walker was probably the best of the bunch which will be a miss to this franchise. <br/><br/>Overall I would actually recommend watching this film however know what you are getting yourself into. you will not be seeing an action film that will bend your mind but you will see one that will make you think how stupid some of the scenes are. <br/><br/>6/10"
"joeravioli","5","4","19","5 April 2015"," The wrong tribute to the wrong man
","Furious 7 is the  seventh installment in the Fast and Furious franchise. Watching it makes it obvious that it has come a very long way from its 2001 days. It is loud, violent, and emotional, something that the previous films all seemed to strive towards but never could achieve to the degree that Furious 7 did. But was it too much? Was the decision to turn a small franchise about crime and street racing into a massive, apocalyptic film with insane, death-defying stunts even a good idea? Well, sure. But not to the extent of Furious 7. It is too loud, too violent, and too serious. Jason Statham removes all the lightness of the previous films with his sneering, annoying, black-op juggernaut vibe, while the clanking and smashing brings back cold-sweat nightmares of a casual trip to the imagination of Michael Bay. It almost makes me yearn for a delicate drama, something where the words are not canned and meaningless, where the meaning is complex, and where Jason Statham is in a world far removed from it. Which isn't to say the film is awful. It is stylish, funny, and sexist as always, filled with fancy cars and gasp-inducing moments. But I just think it takes it a bit too far, especially in its fighting scenes and the apparent invincibility of all the characters. They survive rollovers with a few scratches, getting hit in the face with wrenches with little cuts, and getting hit with bottles with little as much as a small moan. And whenever they get hit the theater fills with a massive, crunching thud that eventually gets hard to take.<br/><br/>Here's the story in a nutshell. Owen Shaw's (villain from FAF6) big brother (Deckard Shaw) decides to take his revenge on Dominic Toretto and his crew for crippling his brother. Han is revealed to have been killed by Mr. Shaw, and Dominic is now Shaw's new target. Of course, Dominic is mad as heck. No one targets his family and lives to not go to jail.<br/><br/>The film ends with the words ""For Paul"" as we knew it would. The death of Paul Walker left everyone (or at least me) confused at how it would even be possible to make Furious 7 in the first place. But as I watched the sensitive, tasteful tribute at the end of the film, I began to feel a sort of emptiness. The tribute, I realized, was for the character, Brian O' Connor. Paul Walker was just who the film was dedicated to. The inescapable hypocrisy of the film began to become painfully evident.<br/><br/>How did Paul Walker die? He was in a car accident involving a car driving at an insane velocity. He was killed going too fast. And yet, we glorify him in a film that is all about driving fast, and shows it to be completely safe. Nobody even gets hurt after driving off cliffs, crashing into trees, or driving out of buildings. By supporting this mentality, we are not honouring Paul Walker. We are contributing to his folly.<br/><br/>The best way to honour him would be to not finish Furious 7, and to quietly abandon the franchise."
"billygoat1071","Null","2","7","5 April 2015"," Beyond Extreme
","The Fast and The Furious franchise has gone way out of hand in this seventh installment, as it begins with its main villain leaving an entirely wrecked hospital which is done by him, a one man army who is about to take down Toretto and his team. And their mission gets to involve even more crazier stunts than ever, and these characters often mentioning about how they fully acknowledged of what they've been through. Just like what the last two films had promised, these movies will get dumber and dumber, but at the same time a lot exciting. And it is, though the direction kind of overdoes his own style, which can cause minor distraction through the fun that is already happening. But this movie is relentless in ever way, it may not make sense on what they're doing, but again it's always been better this way.<br/><br/>Once again, the team is hooked up with a mission impossible, but this time out of revenge from its enemy. There isn't much new other than expanding the scale of the action's utter insanity, but before all that, the movie concentrates more on the personal life of its heroes, like Letty unable to feel normal in her old life and Brian who cannot let go of the action despite of the need of staying with his own family. These and the comedy are the only human element containing in this film because once they are in the field, they totally become superheroes that can push any limit and incapable of dying unless the movie demands them to. There is still suspense, of course, but the people who keeps thinking about the logic of its impossibility will have a hard time, indeed. Otherwise, it's just sick fun.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't make much of a sense either, but then, it is written to create a set of outrageous stunts, as they look for a drive that can track down their enemy who is already behind them, constantly. So they go to these random places just to setup a particular action scene and then proceed. But it isn't only about cars, there's also cameos of great on screen fighters like Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey who have sidelined action scenes with one of the crew while the main characters are driving their way, either being chased by more enemies or jumping between buildings with broken brakes. It's over-the-top, for the good reasons, of course.<br/><br/>James Wan is more known in the horror genre, but I do remember his other action movie, Death Sentence, was a pretty exciting film. Here, he does plenty of styles with prominent shots that highlights cars, hot women and locations, even more. The action also has too much quick cut editing, which can be exhausting; last helmer of the series, Justin Lin did it cleaner, but otherwise, Wan made a larger sense of scale in his action, anyway. And for the cast, Vin Diesel once again gruff and broods, but that already defines this character. Jason Statham plays the main villain at his coldest. The film is smart enough to give Dwayne Johnson's character a little break at leading their mission to bring a cooler guy like Kurt Russell to take his place.<br/><br/>Furious 7 ends with a tribute of the late Paul Walker, where you can really feel how the cast, especially Vin Diesel, love and missed the actor, a scene that indicates that their friendship will forever live on, even if he departs to another lane. You will understand if you've actually seen it, but that scene alone made it worth it, for a film that is already given itself too much action movie pleasure. But these movies haven't come to this emotional side that really felt this genuine. Of course most of it is loud and crazy, but once it settles to this part, it immediately makes it up for the whole experience."

","I will admit, the franchise of The Fast And The Furious has always been a guilty pleasure of mine. From the fast sexy cars, the scantily clad woman, ridiculous action that's real world impossible, and most of all, the brotherhood between that characters, how could it not? Granted, the scripts aren't always the strongest, but they never fail to entertain you to the point of triggering your adrenaline, and keeping you on the edge of your seat. Furious 7 was no different, and succeeded with showing tribute to many aspects of what made it a hit franchise that has earned million upon millions worldwide.<br/><br/>This installment of the franchise brings out a new enemy, Deckard Shaw, the brother of Owen from part 6. Deckard is out for revenge of his brother's demise, and won't stop until he succeeds. Now, if you think Owen was a bad ass then you haven't seen sh*t. Deckard makes Owen look like a girl scout in many ways: he's more weapon savvy, a highly trained fighter, he has whatever he needs at his disposal, and he fears no man nor death.<br/><br/>Dom and the crew are back in L.A. trying to get back to normal as possible. Brian is trying his best to get use to being a normal dad who has put his adventurous past away for the better of his life with Mia and their boy Jack. The quiet doesn't last long when Deckard sends a bomb to their home and forces the ""family"" to get back together and avenge the death of Han.<br/><br/>Along the way they meet a secret government agent named Frank Petty, played by Kurt Russell, and he makes a deal with them. The deal is to track down a kidnapped hacker, Ramsey, played by Game Of Thrones star Nathalie Emmanuelle, with a program that can change the way criminals are tracked down, and with this program, track down Deckard and end him before turning it over to the government. In a series of amazing, intense stunts, they rescue her and make a new enemy who eventually works hand in hand with Deckard. Their common goal is obvious. From the Middle East to the streets of L.A., they face down with Djimon Hounsou as Mose, and Deckard, equipped with military grade weapons and drones. <br/><br/>After many mind blowing special effects filled moments we get to the conclusion of the film. There's hand to hand fights, big bad guns, and a plan that works out in the end in the way that can only be expected from the F&F franchise.<br/><br/>I was completely pleased with the amount of action, intensity, and nail biting moments that rounded out what I felt to be another successful installment. There were some moments in the script that felt a little off, but chalk it up the re writes due to the untimely death of Paul Walker. I rarely have a problem with the work that Director James Wan puts out, and the chemistry of the cast is always on point. This film also succeeded in answering some unanswered questions about Dom and Letty that were never brought to light, but everyone will be excited to find out. The way they have us say goodbye to Brian was tasteful, touching, and very fitting for fans to relate to, involving both the character of Brian and the actor. If more films are on the way we'll definitely miss Paul Walker's involvement, but with the chemistry of this cast you'll always feel like you're visiting old friends. Go see Furious 7. It's a rush!<br/><br/>Danny Mozz, The SHOCK! Chamber"

It's really sad what happened of course but we are stuck with part 7 and for me it was all over the top.<br/><br/>it picked up were part 6 left and that was fine until the cars come out of an airplane. From there on the whole movie is an over the top action flick. If it would have been a movie on it's own it would have been great, style 007 or Mission Impossible but hey, face it, it is still Fast And Furious. We do have car chases and naturally in the beginning German Junk Car lost it from the US Muscle Car, that was good but overall, it was more about the action. The car jumping from building to building, doesn't fit for me in a F&F flick. <br/><br/>So I'm left with a bitter feeling. It do has an open ending so up to part 8 but really, let's go back a bit more towards the cars in stead of action like this.

There is not a single racing scene (unless you count the race wars drag), every action scene is extremely unrealistic, and overall the film is simply a failed amalgamation of every possible action movie scene. The first few films worked because of the street racing and the culture. The acting has always been bad, but no one really cared. Cutting the racing scenes along with trying to turn the franchise into a series of heist movies is really what soured the Fast and the Furious for me and really any one who likes good movies. Adding D. Johnson and J. Statham was simply the icing on the cake. Don't waste your time with this movie. The potentially best part of the movie was when Dom meets Sean in Tokyo, but the drifting scene through the parking garage is not shown. The only positive of the movie is the sound track."

For example the development of the main villain is basically one shot.<br/><br/>The characters and the story are full of clichés and you need serious Hollywood action movie preconditioning to accept them.

In the first movie the characters were much more down to earth - they were some street gang racers, doing their racing cary stuff. There is nothing of this anymore.

"RayKarago","5","4","21","20 April 2015"," A good send off to Paul Walker, but was it a good movie ?
","Man, I got to tell you, I was pleasantly surprised by the last two Fast and the Furious films and when I went to see this one, I was really excited, when I saw it....eh? I mean, yeah, the film is decent. I guess my biggest problem with the film is the lack of story. There is so much story that is substituted for needless chase and explosions, and I know that is kind of the point of the Fast and Furious franchise but in the last two films, what worked was the development of the characters as well as the introduction and development of new characters and villains such as Hobbs or Shaw.<br/><br/>Here, you are promised prominent Hollywood bad asses, Jason Statham, Tony Jaa and Djmion Honsou (one of my favorite actors) and they get no development and are all shoehorned into several different plot lines that add up to nothing more than a few fight scenes that you honestly don't care about. Also, the film really exploits how much it can get away with in terms of action, they did it before but here it gets somewhat distracting. I hear Denzel Washington turned down Kurt Russell's role and with the way he is written, I can see why. He was REALLY ANNOYING.<br/><br/>The film's one saving grace is its ending. I won't give it away but it is a very heart warming send off to Paul Walker, and you can feel it was coming from the hearts of his co-stars. They also dealt with the CGI of Paul Walker's face very well.<br/><br/>Overall, Fast 7 is a fun film, a popcorn film and you probably won't want to watch it again."

","1. If you are too young to have seen Kurt Russell in SOLDIER, stop reading this review and go get a copy. I would hate for you to walk away with the impression that Russell (who was a Disney kid in the 1950s) is just a older guy in a suit who plays a smart-talking Fed. Just see it. Thank me later.<br/><br/>2. This is more than a ""dream team"" cast. This is so ""high concept"" you could get the bends trying to wrap your head around the strings that were pulled to force this into blockbuster mode. I am sorta OK with that but I want to go on record with the simple observation that the earlier entries in the series did not need to rely on pedigree, or genre-bending, they simply had to rely on what they offered the viewer. There is a difference.<br/><br/>3. Quick nod to Statham for creating one of the most iconic characters in modern film. And I am not sure he knows it. If you are fan of BANSHEE (and you should be, it's the edgiest show on TV) they actually had an episode where a Statham clone (a thin killer in a suit with a Brit accent) shows up to fight the sheriff. (OK to stop the review here and go watch Banshee). It was brilliant. Actually pound for pound and word for word and scene for scene better written and directed than this film.<br/><br/>4. No car stuff till the 26 min mark? Talk about resting on your laurels? <br/><br/>5. It is one of the better films this year. Problem is, I am not sure that is high praise."

","With a pardon in hand, the Fast & Furious team tries to settle down to normalcy. A relative of an old foe, Shaw, however, starts hunting the members down. This especially disrupts the life of Brian O'Connor, who is having trouble readjusting to a non FBI, non fugitive lifestyle of being a house dad.<br/><br/>I saw this film two weeks ago, and I still can't get it out of my head. It is not that shocking of a story, but it was that eerie. Unfortunately, that eeriness wasn't achieved by film art. It all had to do with Paul Walker's death. (Nothing like realism to wreck an escapist yarn) Unlike Brian O'Connor, the character that Paul Walker had created some fifteen years ago, the actor wasn't able to walk away from a fiery car crash. Which is troubling because three of the four signature stunt scenes in this film involved O'Connor walking away from car wrecks. And the fourth...<br/><br/>First of all, some credit...Some of the stunts worked. Andy and Jack Gill, the stunt coordinators, gave most of the stunts a seamless look.<br/><br/>James Wan's direction was just okay. His jump cuts weren't needed. And while some of the stunts scored, a lot were underwhelming or silly concepts. Flying cars?!?? And it's curious as to why he avoided showing the race between Dominick Toretto and Sean Boswell. (That race has been expected for the past four films. Not showing it was bad form.) <br/><br/>Give Wan kudos for pulling the best performance out of Kurt Russell (as nameless) in several years. Also give him a gold star for getting a good performance out of Jason Statham, as the villain, Deckard Shaw. For the first time ever, Statham's acting wasn't a distraction.<br/><br/>It was also unnerving how Wan and the studio handled Paul Walker's final scenes. To complete this film the studio used digital technology to create images of Brian O'Connor in some sequences, including his last scene with Vin Diesel. It looked phony.<br/><br/>I've seen all the Fast & Furious films. I liked the first one the least; the fifth one, Fast Five, the most. Of them, I had only seen the fifth installment twice. It was always a good sell to me, for I pegged it for what it was: a popcorn film series...like flash Gordon, or Jason and the Argonauts. If you like looking at fast cars, and Evil Kneivel stunts, then these first few stories were for you. <br/><br/>None of these stories reflected what went into street racing philosophies or realities, though. Not once in any of the Fast films did I ever see a driver lose control and fly through a house or a storefront. There were no overturned light poles or traffic signals. And no one was sent to the hospital after getting rammed by an out of control racing car. The closest the filmmakers came to collateral damage in the series was when a safe took out a bank.<br/><br/>Reality was never a high point with these films. What made the Fast & Furious franchise succeed was their reliance upon stunts first...so it was especially out of character to see flying cars. <br/><br/>Rob a bank, heist a Hollywood truck, smuggle some illegals, and get some free gas were major plots of four of these first five films. They kept to blue collar interests. The sixth installment had the most unbelievable – way unbelievable – plot. And in Furious 7??? The plot line gets even more bizarre. Find ""God's Eye?"" Is this the sign of a tired series?<br/><br/>Having trouble separating the Paul Walker tragedy from the film? It's an easy reaction to spot. If you are interested in seeing Furious 7 out of curiosity on how they will resolve the Brian O'Connor dilemma, then there is CONFLICT. As I pointed out, this film series has avoided realistic situations its entire run, and the sixth installment ran as fast as they could in the other direction. Thinking that number seven recasts the mold is wishful thinking.<br/><br/>Me? I was conflicted at first. I rewatched the film hoping...maybe...these wacky stunts SAVE the film. But each time I see them now, the image of Walker's car ablaze keeps flashing back in my head. And I think: ""What a waste...""<br/><br/>Addendum: Vin Diesel just announced that there will be a Fast & Furious 8. This comes after his pronouncements before the film was released in mid April 2015 that if there was an eighth installment, he would not be involved. Of course that was more than a billion dollars ago.<br/><br/>Whichever...this is the last one for me. As these story lines become more incredulous, it's well past the point of being a popcorn movie. It is now getting into the territory of being a joke."
"dgluth","3","4","21","10 April 2015"," Overblown, manipulative, and contrived.
","I am a long time fan of The Fast and the Furious series. Watching it evolve as a franchise over the years has been a great joy and a lot of fun. From the early 2000's feel of the first two to the high octane of the last two, it has been an interesting series to follow. It's great action and fun characters are what has kept audiences coming back again and again. This is why I'm sad to say Furious 7 doesn't deliver in any way. <br/><br/>Firstly, the story was a convoluted mess that ultimately made little sense. It's an action movie, I get it, sometimes you've got to turn off your brain. Even if a plot is predictable, it should at least make sense. Furious 7 sees Jason Statham, who was teased at the end of the last film, take on the gang for nearly killing his brother. The trailers advertised the film as Statham vs. the F&F crew, but really it's about them working for the government to get a hacker, to find a program, that they need for reasons, and Djimon Hounsou is an angry warlord. The story never feels like it's sensibly going anywhere, and even if it's all just a setup for action sequences, it barely serves to do that. Nothing is connected and ultimately it's hard to care about what's happening, or for the characters involved.<br/><br/>This is where Furious 7 is weakest, it drops everything about the characters that was great. They spew one liners with little passion, Toretto hamfistedly preaches about family to pad length into scenes between set pieces, and everyone else has become a parody of themselves and a stereotype of their race. Jason Statham is completely wasted as his story is sidelined for another. His sole purpose is to show up in every action piece at the worst time to cause trouble for the gang. That's all he does, just show up and kind of make things harder. Along with Statham, Hounsou and Tony Jaa are also wasted in the role of vague villains who don't really seem to have any motives outside of being really evil. Hounsou is an underrated gem, as is Jaa and it was really good to see him in some Hollywood cinema. Too bad neither has much to say nor are they given a shot to deliver anything other than ""bad guy dialogue."" <br/><br/>The action is partly the only thing that makes the movie bearable. It keeps things going and at times it is really exciting, particularly thanks to the direction of James Wan. Wan's really only other foray into action cinema was the immensely underrated 2007 film ""Death Sentence."" Unfortunately, all of Wan's creative tricks and ideas can only do so much with what is already a stupid script. Without spoiling too much, the action scenes are a mix of high octane, on-the-edge-of-your-seat excitement and physics that push what I previously thought possible to exist within the realm of suspended disbelief. When the characters survive so many impossible feats, it all becomes a wacky show of what will they do next? There is no suspense by the end of the film, you know that despite how ridiculous it is, they'll all be fine. Let's just say the scene in the trailer with the car flying between two buildings in Abu Dabi is a lot more absurd in the actual film, and I lost my self cracking up in the theater. <br/><br/>Finally, let's talk about the manipulation of the film. We all know what happened during filming, Rest In Peace Paul Walker. The ending was a nice send off, with Vin Diesel musing about brotherhood. It feels real, all though out of place with the story, but it comes across as genuine. That is until CGI Demon Walker shows up to look into Diesel's soul with glassy eyes that hold the gaze of hell. Seriously, how did they think they could pull that off? The scene on storyboard must have looked really good. Walker pulls up next to Diesel, they share a final moment, and then drive off into the sunset in different directions. They could have achieved this with many other means, considering the real Walker was dead, but no, they had to reanimate him in cold, creepy, uncanny valley digital animation. <br/><br/>This final scene could have been a nice send off, but instead it came across as a cheap manipulation to get the audience to feel nostalgic. After an entire ridiculous movie with a ridiculous end to the action, we get treated to a sappy bit shot at what has to be the warmest beach in California. It was sad he passed away so young, he seemed like a decent guy. This ""tribute"" felt more like ""tear bait"" injected in to trick the audience into feeling like they watched a tribute to the career of a great man. Too bad it was just Furious 7. Again, R.I.P. Paul Walker."

","First of all, Paul Walker you shall be missed, may you R.I.P. Next is the review. I liked the movie to be honest and I thought it was very enjoyable. It had me laughing from start to finish, but not always in a good way. The movie was presented as epic and thought things would be more epic. There was too much of nothing happening, just explosions in every other scene and a lot of unrealistic non-sense. I don't care who you are, you can't break a cast just by flexing or break the ground by stomping. Another thing is you can't die and come back to life because of someone speaking to you and telling you they love you. And yes as nit picky as that sounds its true. All in all, this movie could have been a lot better and a lot more entertaining without all the extra take up space. I enjoyed the words of good bye to Paul Walker though it really was a tear jerker. I really enjoyed the series, thanks."

","I found myself doing just what everyone else was doing, trying to find where they kill Paul off and where doubles and CGI took-over. Quit that. Later after thinking about the movie itself, I found that this turned into a send-off for him, not really a good movie to stand on it's own. If he hadn't died and I watched this as it was I think I would probably be rating it far less than I did. Plot was at best= so-so, acting was okay but the team design and pull through that had worked in at least the last couple movies wasn't there, they tried but it was figurehead at best. It turned into a 'Vin Diesil's tribute to Paul and I walked out thinking if it wasn't for Paul death I would have felt cheated to have paid to see that."
"donbanf","7","4","21","4 April 2015"," Some ingredients missing but a fun farewell to Paul
","**Note** This review contains SPOILERS THROUGHOUT<br/><br/>Saw this last night (April 3rd). I am a fan of the Furious series and I have seen all of them. I've always loved the cast and especially Paul Walker. Someone noted that this film is not likely to connect with viewers who are not fans of the series or have not followed it and I agree. While I enjoyed the film, it was an awful lot of loudness, explosions, car chases and just beyond unbelievable stunts along with cast members' characters surviving many car stunts and crashes that would have been highly improbable, enough to put Wile E. Coyote and the Road Runner to shame. It could have used more character development and more fleshed out villains and it went ON, like a long time. I would like to have had more of Dwayne Johnson's character—he was funny and they gave him a cute daughter in the film. Director Wan does keep the action up though and it is rarely boring. <br/><br/>It's important to remember, this is not the film they set out to make. Had Walker lived, it would have been a different film, plot and otherwise. Visually, I did not notice the places where they used CGI with the exception of the fight in the tour bus. There were many quick cuts and it did not look like it was actually Walker tangling with the other man. That scene for me was the best, with the bus dangling over a cliff and Brian scrambling to get out. Even when you know it's not real, it looks so real, very convincing. Letty arrives just in time to save him. <br/><br/>Overall, I had a hard time telling when it was Walker's actual scene he was present for and not. The tip-off however to me was various scenes where Walker was present and you expected him to say something but he didn't. Those are the scenes where I believe it was not he. <br/><br/>The film begins touchingly enough and funny, where Walker's character is in close-up, grasping a steering wheel and you think it's another racecar and instead he's parking his SUV to get his toddler out. A real change from the early days. There is also a good amount of good-natured banter between the various characters and humorous zingers that made me laugh. It is touching because you know they were all friends on the set and they loved Paul. <br/><br/>Another scene with Letty all dolled up in a red dress and makeup was a lot of fun, where she does some kung fu moves in a penthouse suite with some mean bitches (can I say that?) at the Abu Dhabi tower they're at. <br/><br/>There is something missing however and you do see it. You can tell there's a certain emotional component that is missing. There are scenes that are just obvious, ""Brian"" would have been saying something or doing something, interacting more but he doesn't. There is only so much you can do with a missing cast member. <br/><br/>""Any man's death diminishes me, because I am involved in Mankind; And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; it tolls for thee"" John Donne 1572-1631<br/><br/>This is ultimately the cast and crew's farewell love letter to Paul Walker and in that they very much succeeded. Walker died on my birthday. I had been out that evening with family and friends only to come home, turn on the internet and see the news. I was moved to tears. How could I be so affected by this guy I never knew? I felt like I lost a friend. He just seemed like such a nice guy both in his films and out. I have heard that Paul's family wanted them to finish the film he had started and they did a pretty darn good job. The ending is appropriate and poignant. When you see it, you realize it doesn't make sense as the ending of this film per se, it's really the cast and producers saying goodbye to Paul. The image of Walker in that final scene is a much earlier one or an amalgam of his various faces through the years. It really is a goodbye between him and ""Dom"" and it's beautifully done. He will be missed."

This installment is a very special one because of the tragic loss of a great man who died in a car crash, halfway during the production. Paul Walker (Brian O'Conner), was the jewel of this franchise, his roles, the stunts, and every other thing he did for the franchise were priceless. On that tragic day, (30 November, 2013) I was in tears when I knew about the incident. Today, after almost two years, seeing Paul as O'Conner for ""The Last Ride"" broke my heart.<br/><br/>I had chills, from the very beginning of the movie right until the end. Each moment is priceless when you feel that connection with the franchise and its family. Like always, the franchise never disappoints. Since, they delivered something much more than expected during Fast 5, I had a higher expectation from this movie. However, I have no complaints, the movie was just awesome. Those surreal stunts seemed astonishingly undeniable. You do not get to see that everywhere, but the Fast & Furious franchise, thanks to James Wan.<br/><br/>During the final minutes of the movie, where Vin Diesel (Dominic Toretto) pays tribute to his brother Paul and when they show a flashback of all those priceless moments of Paul with the franchise, I had tears rolling down my eyes. It was just too overwhelming. The franchise is never going to be same without you. I really wished to see Brian O'Conner in the eight installment, but as they said, this is where you belong you have done enough.

"ThomasDrufke","9","2","8","3 April 2015"," For Paul
","The Fast and Furious series is one of the few franchises that has gotten better as they go along. I thought the first few were entertaining but had no real meat or depth to them. The series took off with Fast 5, and has been fantastic ever since. Furious 7 is not only the most insane of the franchise, but it's also by far the most emotional. This movie is simply the reason why I love cinema. It has everything that you would want in an action film, plus the perfect way to honor Paul Walker. I never thought a film with hundreds of punches, huge muscles, and fast cars would move me to tears. Just as Furious 7 was dedicated to Paul Walker, I'm going to dedicate this review to him as well. He was never an Oscar winner, but he was a part of one of the franchises that heightened my love for film. He was known as one of the nicest guys around Hollywood and I can only hope that he's looking down and watching this film with a big smile on his face.<br/><br/>Furious 7 plays a lot off of the events of the previous installment as Jason Statham plays Deckard Shaw, brother of the almost fallen Owen Shaw. He's very much like Winter Soldier in Captain America, he appears every now and then tearing through buildings and bodies on his way to avenge his brother. From hear it's Dom, Brian, Hobbs, and the rest of the crew to stop him from taking more lives. Much like the previous films Furious 7 goes across the globe and finds it's way to high speed races with a lot of girls in bikinis. Perhaps they took that a little too far this time but it will only bother you if you don't know what your getting into with these films. Speaking of that, it's just about twice as ridiculous as the 6th film in terms of death defying stunts and action sequences. The action is non stop and the plot can be a bit confusing and convoluted. But considering how much trouble the production went through, I cant blame the filmmakers for any of those faults. They did a tremendous job in retrospective.<br/><br/>Newcomers include Kurt Russell and Nathalie Emmanuel who both did a good job. I heard Russell plays a bigger part in the inevitable 8th installment and I would like to see Emmanuel return as well because they both seemed to have a lot of fun with this film. Everyone else is pretty much back including Mia, Elena, and Gisele all making cameos. I have come to love this group so much over the years that it's really great to see everyone together, especially if it's the last time. There's also a side story about the Letty-Dom relationship. That also turned out to be extremely satisfying as a long time fan. But the biggest laughs out of the film come from Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous' banter. It's one of the reasons why the last 3 films have worked so well is the increased chemistry between the crew.<br/><br/>The most satisfying part of the film was the ending. Every questioned how they could possibly deal with the death of Walker during the middle of filming, but I have to say they couldn't have handled it any better. The last 10 minutes or so were absolutely gut wrenching. I loved all the big action sequences with cars flying through buildings and one on one fist fights were great. But nothing in terms of filmmaking compared to the final scenes honoring Paul. Vin Diesel giving his final words to him was some of the most emotional moments I have experienced in a film, let alone an action film. The plot doesn't make perfect sense at times, but the message does. Family is and always will be the most important thing in life. Rest in peace Paul Walker.<br/><br/>+Action tops anything before <br/><br/>+All the characters and more appear <br/><br/>+Funny as ever <br/><br/>+Perfect send off for Paul <br/><br/>9.3/10"

","Since 2001, The Fast and the Furious was indeed, by far, the most interesting film that defined street racing in popular culture. Now, jumping ahead over a decade later with this new movie Furious 7, it did more than just provide the usual car chases, extremely dangerous stunts, or intricate strategies the last films had shown many times before, it also brought out something more that is seldom seen in the entire film series: emotional depth.<br/><br/>Following from where both Tokyo Drift and Fast 6 left off, Dominic Toretto and his crew head out to pursue the mysterious individual responsible for killing one of their own. Upon finding this person, they realize there's more about him than what they initially thought.<br/><br/>With the departure of director Justin Lin (who helmed the previous four films) and upon passing his director's chair to horror filmmaker James Wan (of 'Saw' and 'Insidious' fame), he did quite an impressive job doing an action film, which diverts him from his usual norm, and that's not a bad thing. Normally, I watch the movies for its plot, but story-wise, it kept me further interested that I was left mind-blown and found it made perfect sense on how the previous events from the main films and its one spin-off intertwine with this current title. The action sequences were brilliantly executed and crafted cleverly within the new location settings like Abu Dhabi, especially when it further showcased how much a car can do than just simply driving or speeding in one. As car makes and models continue to evolve overtime, you'd know how useful they can be in such scenarios when you least expect it.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, The Rock, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Tyrese, and Michelle Rodriguez have really outdone themselves in this new outing, including additional cast member Jason Statham - who's no stranger to fast cars himself - as the villain, but of course the real honor goes to Walker. After his tragic passing during production of this movie, I felt this similar notion of loss when Brandon Lee lost his own life during filming of The Crow back in 1993. It's like when you see them perform on screen, you feel like they're still very much alive as long as people continue to watch what they loved doing. Jumping back to this film and to not give too much away, some scenes actually brought out an emotional tone for a few of the main characters. Although most of the crew would still continue doing the meticulous work they're known well for, there are moments where they express (if not verbally) good reasons for doing such. Overall, it's a film Walker did proudly and it was great seeing Lucas Black reprise his role of Sean Boswell from Tokyo Drift again since it basically helped set the stage for what Toretto's crew must do next. Though some audiences may call it ""overhyped,"" ""predictable,"" ""mediocre,"" or even ""overly sympathetic"" due to the passing of a great actor, never once should it be taken for granted because I certainly enjoyed what I saw as the adrenaline in me kept pumping and the story didn't drag, only accelerated further. There wasn't a dry eye in the auditorium that night since I literally heard scattered, faint weeping and sobbing. Not to mention a touch of symbolism in one scene that made it so emotional. Thanks for the ride, Paul. My hat's off to you..."

","First of all, I normally know what I get when I watch a movie. And I watched all F&F movies, so it wasn't that surprising. I've waited long to watch F7 'cause the hype was hard and every moron on the street praise the movie like it was the Passion of Christ part 2 plus the radio stations play this f***ing ""see you again"" song up and down. Let me sum it up for you, I hated this movie before I saw it. I put it in my watch-list and thought this would make a good Sunday afternoon movie in the near future.<br/><br/>Yesterday was this special Sunday afternoon and my girlfriend suggested this movie. After 10min she was sleeping deep and I was alone with ""the family"". If she was awake we could joke together about the cheesy dialogue, the bad acting (and I looking at you Vin Diesel) and the pointless, very forced story line. I love movies with Dwayne Johnson but he couldn't save anything. I quit after 30min, cause I couldn't take it any more. The Vin Diesel scenes were so awful to watch, he act bad ass as f*** but looked like a sausage in a wife-beater with nearly no expression in his face.<br/><br/>I never saw the high praised over-the-top action everybody is talking about but I don't feel like I am missing something. I don't give one star ratings (except this one time I watched 10min of the iZombie pilot-episode), so I scrolled through my ratings and saw my 3-star ratings for A Quantum Solace, Ghost Rider 2 and Transformers 3 and I finished all of them, this must be much worse.<br/><br/>So here you got it, 2 stars, horrible movie.

Suspension of disbelief? More like expulsion of disbelief. I've never seen anything so cheesy. The lines sound like they were stolen from a video game script.

I finished it simply because I usually trust the reviews on IMDb and thought it might get better. I was wrong. The movie is nonsensical. Don't waste your time or money. The only decent part of the movie is the tribute to Paul Walker at the very end, but I'm sure you could see that on YouTube or just skip to the end of the movie to see it if you feel the need.

It's just too much to see in nearly 2:15 that the film takes to unravel.<br/><br/>As a result of all this, the characters can never be fully realized. They are basically people caught up in this very warfare enduring throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film becomes tedious because you want more character interaction other than what I have described above."

","Furious 7 (2015): Dir: James Wan / Cast: Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jason Statham, Kurt Russell: A vast improvement over a franchise that burns more rubber than ideas. This entry is better plotted and written with more detail than what is expected. Jason Statham makes for a nasty villain Deckard Shaw who is out for revenge after the bludgeoning defeat of his brother in the previous film. He first sends Hobbs, played by Dwayne Johnson to the hospital after a brutal battle following his hacking his computer for the names of the team that took his brother down. Central plot regards Shaw stalking them and making lethal attempts at their lives. There is also an interesting subplot weaved within regarding a hacker who needs to be rescued to complete the mission. Finally, we have impossibly corny yet entertaining race action sequences where cars careen through skyscraper windows towards other skyscrapers. Vin Diesel returns as team leader Dom who engages in a street fight with Shaw, but his main concern is his team as well as his wife's amnesia. Paul Walker unfortunately met with an untimely death before film completion. As Brian, his wife, who is Dom's sister is expecting a second child. Michelle Rodriguez plays the feisty Letty, Dom's wife who struggles with memory loss. Statham is a terrific addition as Shaw, as well as Kurt Russell as an agent recruiting Dom and his team for a duel mission. Don't expect anything above mindless action and stunts that are way off the grid. Do expect a film that rises above previous films plus gives Paul Walker a nice montage sendoff before the credits. Score: 6 / 10"

","Of course you don't expect much from the story of a film like this, so I will tell you about everything else: cars, planes, cars, tall buildings, cars, attack helicopters, cars, drones, cars, demolishing buildings... did I mention cars?<br/><br/>In truth, the cars scenes were not so relevant. It all felt like they struggled to find reasons to use cars in an otherwise completely unrelated scenario. Jason Statham comes off as a real badass, The Rock is as usually huge and intimidating, but in this film Vin Diesel just outmanned everybody. He is a beast!<br/><br/>So if you want spectacular scenes that have no regard to logic, this is the film for you. Unfortunately, I would have preferred the last film in the series to have been more meaningful. Instead they just babbled on about family and destroyed cars. The property damage inflicted to kill two assassins and save a hacker was probably in the tens of millions, if not more."
"KrazzyDJ","6","3","17","12 April 2015"," As a tribute, it works. As a movie, its only average
","It's an understatement that the films in this franchise are getting crazier and increasingly unrealistic with each successive installment. And Furious 7 takes that to yet unseen levels. But then, realism never really was an expectation here was there ? The earlier films though, were at least grounded in some level to the extent that you could at least believe what you saw if you stretched your imaginations far enough. This one takes believability to, as Roman would say it, a whole new level.<br/><br/>Sample this: After the events of the previous installment, Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard is out for revenge against Toretto and his crew. To get to them though, he needs to know where they are. So, he breaks into the DSS' headquarters (which looks completely desolated with only Hobbs and Elena working there) and into Hobbs' computer scanning for information on their whereabouts (which, as we were led to believe from the previous installments, were erased with the crew receiving full pardons). He then begins taking them out one by one starting with Hobbs (who Shaw manages to injure badly so as to land him in a hospital) and followed by Han (which connects the franchise to Tokyo Drift) and then Dom and Mia (who barely manage to escape). In the middle of all this, comes a terrorism plot about a certain ""Mr.<br/><br/>Nobody ""who is after a device codenamed ""God's Eye"" that can turn any camera into a tracking device of sorts allowing its owner to spy on anyone. A terrorist wants to use it for his personal gains but to do so, he requires the assistance of the device's creator - a hot female hacker named Ramsey who Mr. Nobody wants Dom and his crew to rescue since only she knows where the device is. All of this is of course, carried forward by the franchise's trademark over-the-top and highly unbelievable set of action sequences, fast race cars and even bikini-clad chicks in a scene or two.<br/><br/>The series seems to have settled on a formula of sorts with a silly plot governed by cringe-worthy lines of dialog relying on its action to do the talking not to mention the amount of times the term last / final is used in the franchise (One Last Ride, One Last Mission, etc.). While the set-pieces here are good enough, they lack the awesomeness of the ones in Fast Five and Furious 6 (which is gonna be hard to top with a tank and a plane). The final sequence drags on for so long with actors doing nothing but mouthing search and rescue dialogues amidst heavily inter-cut action I stopped caring about the outcomes of the characters themselves. The fight sequences too seem to have seemingly odd camera angles as if the director of photography ran out of angles to shoot from.<br/><br/>Why then, have I rated this movie a 6 you wonder. That's because it all does come together to create a decent entertainment package. But more importantly, this is largely due to the tribute to Paul Walker at the end that, unexpectedly, feels so heart-wrenching its surprising. After all, its a Fast & Furious movie; it isn't supposed to be this emotional. But the cast give such a fitting send-off to Walker's character in movie it resonates largely with the real life situation. As for the CGI Paul Walker that some people seem to be cringing about, except for some shots in the end, I honestly couldn't make out which shots used his digital double in the film (I did have some guesses but they turned out wrong).<br/><br/>I do believe that a lot of the high praise that the movie is getting has to do with this being Walker's final movie as also to the tribute at the end. Otherwise, its a fairly average action movie with a brainless plot that at times, reminded me of the crazy Bollywood movies that a lot of people criticize. Given the money its making and the fact that this is Universal's most reliable and only huge franchise for now, I won't be surprised if we get one of these every two years for the next decade at the least. Watch it, if nothing else, For Paul !!!"
"ironhorse_iv","7","3","17","10 April 2015"," Furious 7 was alright. Sit back and enjoy the ride, let reality leave you for a couple hours.
","Furious 7 rides into theaters, yet again. Taking place, after the events of 2003's Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift & 2013's Fast & Furious 6. The story brings all the characters from the previous films, back together for one more adventure. In this movie, Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew, are faced with a sinister foe, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), whom seeks revenge for his comatose brother. Directed by James Wan, the movie combine, most of the plot threads of the previous films into one. It moves as if it's recapping the previous films. The plot get more and more out there. With each passing film you can see it becoming more and more far- fetched. The movie starts out, with car racing like the first movie, 2001's Fast & Furious. It then goes into a heist sub-plot like 2011's Fast Five, and then the movie go into the spy genre, like Fast & Furious 6. In many ways, it's nearly a complete movie. Once again, the movie brings over the top action. Without spoiling too much, I found a few things about the film action, a bit jarring. I really didn't buy into most of the actions scene, because how unrealistic, it was. There were a lot of BS scenes where the hero walk away, nearly unscratched, when they should be, dead or in serious condition. If you're a fan of more realistic action, this movie might not be for you. If you like over the top. It's full of it. I think the highlight of the film, has to be the Abu Dhabi heist sequences. It was so testosterone full! I love the fight scenes between Luke Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) & Deckard Shaw. Jason Statham makes a great villain. It's too bad, that the movie didn't focus on him, as much, as it should had. I really thought, the movie would had work better, if he was the main villain, rather than the large number of sub-villains, they had for the crew, to fight against. Who knew, that Djimon Hounsou's character, Jakande, would be just as huge as a threat as Deckard Shaw? I didn't see, that coming from the trailers. I really didn't see Kara (Ronda Rousey) being a minor character. I thought, she was working for Shaw. Instead, she was working for some prince. Still, the fight between Letty Ortiz (Michelle Rodriguez) & Kara (Ronda Rousey) was pretty awesome. Like, I said before, honestly, how many movies are they going to make out of these characters? I know, most of the actors can't find work outside from the popular Fast and Furious film series, but seriously, it's the 7th movie in film series. It's clear, that these actors only got this franchise to keep their careers, going. The actors are indeed, 'One trick Ponies'. Don't get me wrong, they're alright in the film, but I'm really getting annoyed by the lead actor, Vin Diesel's mumbling and lazy not buff, look. Unfortunately, one of the better actors, Paul Walker, was killed in a car accident, during filming, which lead to Vin Diesel having a bigger role in the film. Director James Wan did the best, he can, to replace Paul Walker, by giving Walker's dialogue to other characters, or having Paul Walker's brothers as stand ins. For the most part, it kinda works, but there were a few shadowy back-head or far away shots that clearly made, because Paul Walker wasn't there, anymore. Once again, actors Tyrese Gibson & Ludicrous are the comic reliefs. Tyrese Gibson's Roman still gives, some good one-liners and zingers, but he's a little more annoying now, since the movie made him, look more like a coward. Ludicrous's Tej is a little more unbelievable. It's weird that he's the tech guy, now. It's also strange, that he knows karate, now too. The cameos in the film was alright for the most part. I wish, Lucas Black's Sean Boswell, had a bigger part. I wouldn't call this movie, a stand-alone film. There is a lot of things you wouldn't get if you didn't watch the previous films. The movie is a bit long. They added a lot of tiresome long scenes, like skydiving in cars to rescue an important kidnapped hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) for a mysterious secret agent (Kurt Russell). The whole God's eye subplot wasn't really needed. I know, it is paper thin, but they would had stretch out the revenge plot. I came to see this movie just for that. Due to that add, this film became the longest movie in the series so far. Another fault of the film, is how they treat women. They parade them as sex objects. Michelle Rodriguez and Nathalie Emmanuel are strong, smart female role models, even though the movie does objectify them physically. There are tons of bikini shots and car porn that can make any young man, horny as hell. Overall: I really don't understand why films like this, get a higher score, than Michael Bay films. It's nearly has the same stupid problems. Too many explosion, clumsy writing and degrading stereotypes and women. I guess, Fast & Furious just have more loyal fans. Still, the best thing about this film, is how they handled the tragic death of lead Paul Walker with admirable grace, ultimately creating an emotionally impactful farewell. Despite, the natured absurdity of this world, it still worth seeing, only for that, alone."
"moviexclusive","6","3","17","1 April 2015"," Besides a dignified farewell for Paul Walker, this seventh entry doesn't match the fun, excitement and adrenaline rush of its two immediate predecessors
","Vin Diesel may have been the most indelible trademark of the 'Fast and Furious' franchise, but its late star Paul Walker has consistently been the Yang to Diesel's Yin. It is no secret that 'Furious 7' is Walker's final performance, an inevitable consequence of his untimely death in a car wreck last year while filming on this latest instalment was underway. <br/><br/>All we will say is that its writer Chris Morgan has given him as dignified a farewell as we can expect, and as the epilogue made up of footage from each one of the movies past echoed Diesel's personal message of brotherhood and family, be prepared for perhaps the series' most poignant moment ever. This however we will say – Walker is front and centre in each and every one of the action setpieces that Morgan and its new director James Wan conceive for a solid but otherwise unspectacular entry which can't quite match the fun, excitement and adrenaline kicks of Justin Lin's two earlier chapters. Oh yes, the filmmakers have pushed the boundaries of logic and gravity to try to top the over-the-top thrills of its two predecessors, but ironically the strain of their effort is more apparent than ever.<br/><br/>Indeed, it is telling when a car chase along the streets of Los Angeles no longer gets our pulse racing in the same way that the first movie did – and there is one in particular between Dominic and his arch-nemesis here Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) that is particularly nostalgic. Rather, it will take parachuting Mustangs chasing after a rogue paramilitary unit up in the Caucasus mountains led by Djimon Hounsou's terrorist Jakande to get us to truly sit up, but let us reassure you that this sequence teased in the trailer ranks among the finest that this muscle-car franchise has offered. It takes close to an hour to get to this point, as Morgan sets up the vendetta between Deckard and Dominic (and as his crew) and set in motion the pieces for their latest adventure.<br/><br/>Frankly, the plot exists only as the narrative glue for the various stunts meant to be the highlight of any 'Fast and Furious' movie. There is no point questioning just why Kurt Russell's shadowy Government agent would entrust a supposedly time-critical mission of retrieving an all-seeing surveillance programme known as the 'God's Eye' and its creator (Nathalie Emmanuel's Ramsey) to Dominic and his men without so much as having his own team to stand by. Ditto for why Dominic would even agree to put his men in such danger despite being promised that they could use the said device to track down Deckard, in particular since the latter seems to show up on his own accord at every turn to foil their plans. We get that the franchise needs to shift gears in order to stay fresh (like how the fifth movie reinvented itself into a heist caper), but this detour into international espionage is far less convincing to say the least. <br/><br/>It also explains why we were not quite taken by the sojourn into the United Arab Emirates capital of Abu Dhabi, compared to say the favelas of Rio de Janeiro in 'Fast Five' or the streets of London in 'Furious 6'. Yes, it does provide the opportunity for Dominic to crash a Lykan HyperSport out through one of the upper floors of the Etihad Towers, float across the Abu Dhabi sky while Deckard fires grenades at him, then smash through a window of a neighbouring tower, and finally skid past a small deployment of Terracotta Warriors – but it is so ridiculous even by 'Mission Impossible' standards that one cannot help but react with bemusement than wide- eyed awe. That leaves an overblown finale in the most literal sense of the word, which sees Jakande strike up a convenient alliance with Deckard in order to unleash war on Dominic and his men in the heart of downtown Los Angeles. Between Jakande's unmanned drone and his military helicopter, the urban warfare cannot quite match the white knuckle suspense and exhilaration of a massive bank vault dragged through Rio or an assembly of race cars taking down an airplane as it prepares to take off.<br/><br/>Certainly, Wan had big shoes to fill with Lin's departure, but the helmer (better known for 'Saw', 'Insidious' and 'The Conjuring') who has never taken on a project of this scale misses the mark on several counts. Not only is the action more 'meh' than 'wow', there is too little of the camaraderie between Dominic and his crew which gave the last two films an added 'zing'. Just as sorely missed is the dynamic between Diesel and Dwayne Johnson's Federal Agent Hobbs, the latter of which pretty much sits out the whole movie after being injured by Deckard in one of the early scenes – and despite what promise it may have shown, the mano-a-mano showdown between Diesel and Statham cannot quite live up to that between Diesel and Johnson in 'Fast Five'.<br/><br/>After the dizzying heights of the immediate last two movies, it seems inevitable that 'Furious 7' will be at least slightly underwhelming – and if not for the beautiful sendoff for Paul Walker at the end, it would be even more disappointing. At this point, the franchise seems to be its own enemy, and if we weren't quite so taken by 'Furious 7', that's because we knew from 'Fast Five' and 'Furious 6' that it could have been much better."

","This film is absolutely awful. No amount of stunts, explosions, car crashes and shootouts hide the fact that the plot makes absolutely no sense. The fast and the furious started out as a semi believable film about Street racing. Seven films in and the only way you could explain the time line between those two films is if it turns out Dominic hit his head at the end of the first film and we're experiencing his wild coma induced fever dreams. It's honestly sad Paul walker died whilst production of this film was wrapping up but don't let the fans of the series inflated review scores talk you into watching this film. Do yourself a favour, watch the first one and pretend there aren't any sequels."

","Family and friends raced into local theaters hours in advance to grab seats for their latest action-packed and absurdly ridiculous, ""Furious 7."" Since its first installment ""The Fast and the Furious"" in 2001, the franchise has lovingly become a tacky, silver-screen staple for youth all over the world. Haters don't hate. If you've seen one, two or seven of the films by now, you knew exactly what you were in for, and you still showed up.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" once again took things to the next level with more impossible high-flying stunts and an entire script of quotably profound one-liners about the meaning of family – or how serious a beating one is about to receive. The film expanded on its already large cast by introducing several new actors including Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou and to my enjoyment, Tony Jaa from the martial arts cult-favorite ""Ong-bak"" films. However, this highly farcical sequel was full of bittersweet anticipation as an entire nation gathered, paying tribute to the tragic, early death of actor Paul Walker, by seeing a journey that's lasted for more than a decade now, through to the end.<br/><br/>Walker, who has been around since the beginning, playing one of ""The Fast and the Furious"" original characters, Brian O'Conner, a young undercover cop who infiltrated an East Los Angeles gang of behind-the-scenes outlaws, tragically died in a high-speed car crash on Nov. 30, 2013. After taking time to grieve, shocked ""Furious 7"" crew members delicately moved on with production.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" ended up destroying box office records during its debut weekend, picking up a massive $143.6 million in North America and $240.4 million overseas; totaling an impressive $384 million overall. Not only did ""Furious 7"" become the largest opener among its predecessors. After its release, it set a milestone by ranking number four in the top 10 highest opening films of all time – proving to be one of Hollywood's most iconic and profitable franchises.<br/><br/>Where do we go from here though? Is this the end of the ""Furious"" franchise? Not for directors and producers. It seems their grieving period ran little-more than a quarter of a mile. The eighth installment by Universal Pictures is currently set to be released April 14, 2017. Surely, many fans will be torn over another sequel, especially one excluding Walker for obvious reasons. My suggestion would be to revisit the idea of branching off on side character stories like they did in the 2006 semi-sequel ""Tokyo Drift."" But, with such a huge fan base and record-breaking turnout for the presumed final installment, Universal can't this cash cow go to pasture in good taste.<br/><br/>It's worth mentioning that producers and directors were more heartfelt in the manner which they handled Walker's passing. Usually in these situations, productions will omit a deceased actor from future scenes or films by letting their character perish as well. In the case of ""Furious 7,"" however, director James Wan decided to see Walker's character through to the end, finishing the film with the help of Walker's brothers, Caleb and Cody as stand-ins, and some subtle, well-placed computer effects; giving everyone a final, emotional montage of ""Fast and Furious"" Walker moments – reminding us of the gravity he had on our lives throughout the past 14 years.<br/><br/>Thanks for the lavishly unbelievable, yet genuinely profound journey Paul, giving us all a reason to do hoop-dee burn-outs in theater parking lots across the nation, to live a little faster and burn a little brighter.<br/><br/>""If one day the speed kills me, don't cry, because I was smiling."" – Paul Walker"

","Dominic Toretto and his fast gang of furious street racers are back again for the 7th time! The stakes are 7 times higher than ever before.<br/><br/>You saw the gang go against Owen Shaw and generally kick his ass, putting him in a coma. They thought it was all over but now here comes his big brother who you learn (in an over the top dramatic opening scene) ends up having to fight all his little brothers battles. So watch him naturally hunt Torettos team in an action packed sequel which will once again defy the laws of physics (and gravity) have a cheesy romance story and of course have cars! doing stuff that cars aren't supposed to do (or able to do really if we are being 100% scientifically accurate) Jason Statham (despite being accepted as an action hero for some reason) has a reputation for playing the same guy in every film, same accent, same mannerisms, the only difference really is if his character gets a sense of humour or not, in this case he goes without one. I'm not a Statham fan (is it obvious?) but he absolutely kills in this movie! (pun intended) From the previously mentioned dramatic opening scene to the action packed climax he stays amazing cool, oozing with charisma and general badassness.<br/><br/>The film has the usual team dynamic with Ludicrous being the hacker and Tyrese being the (cringeworthy unfunny) comic relief, Toretto and Brian teaming up once again (sadly for the last time) to stop the big bad guy, of course there is a forced romance story between Toretto and Letty, wasting precious screen time with their little angsty story was amazing to see on the big screen. Kurt Russell makes an appearance as a not so shady business man with ""an offer they can't refuse"" One of the chicks from Game of Thrones makes a brief appearance (as well as a nobody ""Bollywood actor"") Stathams character always decides to make an appearance at the most inconvenient times. The Rock is on bed rest for most of the movie, but don't worry even he has a few good scenes in the movie. So you'll be seeing all of these amazing characters (also random ass shots of girls throughout the movie just because the director wants to confirm that you know that he is a pervert and an assguy, not a titguy) Overall it's a good action flick with everything you would have come to expect from a Fast and Furious movie. Fast cars, random uninspired ass shots (literally the camera zooming into random womens asses because that's normal behaviour for a self respecting director) breathtaking action scenes, cheesy dialogue (AKA Tyrese humour) the characters randomly having to travel the world, grand theft auto, A-star celebrity cameos (with Iggy Azalea thrown in for good measure) and in the end enjoy a (pretty amazingly done) goodbye montage to a fantastic actor that will leave you teary eyed.<br/><br/>So bottom line, it's an action packed sequel that satisfies and is actually more fun than its predecessors. This movie made me a Stathan fan (well...) I highly recommend it to everyone who's into mindless action movies (Statham fans/Fast and Furious Fans)"

","This was the 7th fast and the furious film (obviously) and when most franchises never reach that many movies and it's surprising this franchise has and even more so that it is a great movie. Vin Diesel uses the word family a lot in this film and it is fitting as one of the best things in the film is the crews chemistry and relationship it did really work as they felt like a family. They act like one to they love each other but disguise it by making fun of each other and having a great laugh during the most dangerous situations. The films Villain was a great one having a great performance for Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw (Is Deckard even a real name by the way?). He was so villainous and bad ass as he not only had the courage to fight the Rock but beat him. Unfortunately he was really underused. The Gods-eye plot wasn't as interesting as the revenge plot and it did drag on a bit. The ending was perfect for want it needed to be the final fight with Deckard Shaw and his men was a really well done action scene. It also had in my opinion the best line in the movie ""Did you think this was going to be a street fight..... You're god-damn right it is"". The emotional end scene with Diesel and Walker was so sad and really felt like a fitting end to the series which I really think it should have been. I know I haven't talked about Paul Walker that much in this review but to be perfectly honest I wasn't a huge Paul Walker fan don't get me wrong he was a really good actor but I haven't seen him in much other than these movies so I didn't feel the sadness that so many other people felt when he died. But in the end other than the fact some elements dragged on a bit and the underused villain I loved this movie and in the end was the second best movie in the franchise (I thought 6 was just a little bit better) and one of the best movies of 2015"

","This film has everything you could want from a fast n furious movie and more! As always, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker do a great job along with Dwayne Johnson, who entered the franchise from fast five. This movie has killer action sequences, whether it's cars falling out of the sky, fist fights, or even cars flying into sky scrapers. If you are a die hard fast and furious fan I really don't think that you could be disappointed by furious seven. Paul Walker as everyone knows died in the past year and in the end of the film they did a small tribute to him featuring the song by Wiz Khalifa see you again. A lot of people in the theater got very emotional including me just because he was such a great guy and a great character in the fast and furious franchise, I was very glad that they recognized him! We do have some new comers to the franchise including Jason Statham and Kurt Russell, and I felt that both used their screen time wisely and portrayed their character very well. I was very impressed with Jason Statham, he always does action movies that's his typecast, but I felt in this role he really portrayed a great villain for the film! Kurt Russell did a great job as a member of the crew that is trying to take down Statham. One thing is for sure, you will never be bored with this film, it is high-octane, it is full of action, it has great dialogue, even if you're not a die-hard fast and furious fan, I still think you will be very pleased with this film! I think it's just the right found that Paul Walker needed to say goodbye, it is going to be hard to see anymore of the films in the franchise without Paul Walker, I just hope they don't kill off his character, I hope they retire his character respectively, without killing him off. 9/10 for Furious Seven! 👍🏼"

Jason Statham is a great addition to this franchise and his presence as the story's antagonist immensely adds to the thrill and excitement. In Fast & Furious seven movie you see the Paul Walker is quite impressive."
"CinematicInceptions","7","1","3","23 June 2015"," Good action packed sequel even without the PW tribute.
","Paul Walker tribute aside, I felt like this was a pretty good movie that took everything that was good in six and brought it up a notch. I wouldn't be disappointed if they stopped at seven because it would be a strong send-off. Aside from that, I don't think they would really be able to top the stunts in Furious 7 without blatantly exceeding reality. As it was, I only *just* bought that the car stunts were possible. To top that off, the separate families are now safe and happy and free of all charges, so making a FAF 8 would kind of ruin that. Of course they could bring back Han and Giselle since we didn't get full confirmation of their deaths.<br/><br/>The plot was a bit more cohesive than six's, and even though there was just as much action as six, it felt less action driven. The action sequences had a little more weight and purpose to them. That said, it still could have been better. Mr. Nobody's character could have been written better. We had no idea what he wanted to do with the God's Eye and giving him a more tangible motive would definitely have improved the plot. On a slight side note, I have a theory that the God's Eye is a actually the same thing that Owen Shaw was after in FAF 6. Hobbs says in 6 that security will be nonexistent or something like that if Owen Shaw achieved his end, and the God's Eye pretty much fits that description. One major plot engine is the terrorist group that the Shaw's both work with. The turns and such aren't exactly jaw dropping, but considering the genre, it's not a terrible plot especially since you have the emotional story lines of Brian trying to cope with his restlessness and Dom and Letty handling Letty's memory loss. Letty's flashbacks are decently presented and pretty well timed, though I didn't feel like it was entirely necessary for her to leave Dom since they're only apart for like ten minutes of screen time. The two emotional endings were pretty well done and, well, emotional for the audience. The external line ending could have been better since we don't really know what happens to the God's eye. I think it got blown up on the helicopter, but there still could have been some kind of reflection on that.<br/><br/>The characters are a pretty big element again, as in six. I'll start with the three newcomers. Mr. Nobody was pretty well scripted for his type of character, even if he wasn't written as well as he could have been. Ramsey was basically the main plot engine, but she had a pretty strong personality and depth. Deckard Shaw's introduction was awesome and establishes him as a very formidable villain and he delivers on it the rest of the movie. Dom is pretty much the central figure again, though he's not quite as deep as in 6. Brian is given a lot of depth since he has the whole thing with his family, which is really where all of Mia's character comes from since she's not exactly front and center. Letty has a lot of depth with her memory loss subplot, but her personality might be a bit of a detractor since it might not be on par with her former performances (though I haven't seen the first five apart from trailers so I can't really say). Hobbs ins't quite as prominent as in five and six, but he has some screen time and comes in as the semi- deus ex machina at the end. Tej and Roman both have smaller roles with lots of screen time and provide a lot of the comic relief. I loved seeing Tej get his two second action sequence, and I'm probably not the only one. Roman is all talk with almost nothing to back it up, again. The characters overall get about a B+, taking scripting and personality into account.<br/><br/>The action was, of course, a very prominent factor, and it definitely delivered (maybe even a little too much). All of the action sequences are very long, probably averaging out at around fifteen minutes. The entire parachute drop sequence is about twenty minutes, rather than the one minute trailer sequence. It's very explosive, even when explosions aren't involved. There are lots of cars involved, but there's also some good hand to hand like the Dom/Deckard street fight. There's a fair amount of high tech stuff involved with the God's Eye and everything. It's a sure-fire adrenaline rush, but there is the possible detracting factor of realism. There are a few things that might make you go ""there's no way that could happen"", and there is a little bit of invincibility mode. The only street racing comes in the, we'll call it obligatory, race wars scene. <br/><br/>Even if the action has some potential problems, the comic relief is almost unbeatable for a non-comedy. Roman and Tej are an awesome comedy duo. Tej pulling out the MC Hammer with his bulletproof van and Roman's happy birthday diversion were great and even got a little applause in my theater. <br/><br/>The execution was good, especially in the visual areas. The acting was alright, though nothing Oscar worthy. The script was a big step up from 6, but it's still an action movie so don't expect anything spectacular.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series, definitely see this, and maybe even consider buying straight away. If you're just seeking action, watch at least six and maybe the other ones too beforehand. It's not a bad group movie, and should be a crowd pleaser if you're not seeking an amazing story. As a final recommendation, I will agree that a 7.6 is a little high, but without the Walker tribute at the end, it would still probably be a 7.4. Overall Rating: 8.5/10"
"zshah2010","8","1","3","13 June 2015"," basically..a bollywood action movie done correctly.
","I actually watched this with my class, as a farewell for the end of the year. Honestly, i never really cared enough about the rest of the franchise, they were fun to watch, but I did remember enjoying most of them. but what about this one? how does this hold up?<br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed it. no really, I found this movie to be rather enjoyable and fun. of course, you have your obligatory scantily clad women, your car porn, and of course the ridiculously over the op physics defying car chase scenes. hell, there are even some that don't involve cars at all. any person who doesn't enjoy over the top action or partial nudity will probably not enjoy this movie, although the former isn't very prevalent. The acting is okay, for the most part, and the special effects are spot on. also, i have to say my favorite part happens near the end of the dubai party..its not a spoiler, trust me!<br/><br/>Yes, yes, I know..This is Paul walkers last movie. I really respected his acting ability long before his death, I thought he had a decent amount of charisma, and the send-off they did for his character was a real tearjerker. Honestly, I couldn't ask for a better send-off than this."
"danrst","8","1","3","20 May 2015"," Great film
","This film, to me, was a great installment. It has plenty of action, some good jokes and a brilliant ending. Reading some of the reviews saying it's totally unrealistic drove me to write this review. Yes, it has cars jumping from one building to another without serious injury or damage to the car. Yes, there are times were you think ""Why doesn't he just do this..."".<br/><br/>If you are looking for a film that is completely realistic and doesn't stretch the boundaries of what is possible, then do not go and see this film. I imagine if you make this film entirely realistic, the main characters would be in prison and we'd be without a film to actually watch.<br/><br/>The films have evolved over the years and the stunts have got more elaborate and graphically intense. This is what I think the film is about and is why I have scored it so highly.<br/><br/>Just watch the film and enjoy the action. So what if it isn't realistic..."
"CMTiago","9","1","3","15 May 2015"," For Paul. The family will miss you
","Ever since Paul Walker's untimely death in 2013, this movie has been hailed as his ultimate homage. I'm pleased to write that not only does this movie continue the trend of great F&F movies started by Fast Five, but it also honors the late actor who had been a big part of the franchise for many years.<br/><br/>So we are brought into the movie with a return to race wars, a place we haven't seen since the first one. Dom is attempting to get Letty's memory fully restored and hopes this will be the trigger she needs. This will be one of the movies plot points, But focusing on the main plot, after Owen Shaw was incapacitated in the last movie, his older brother Deckard Shaw (Statham) will look to exact revenge on those hurt his sibling. Also coming into play is a international spy plot involving a highly innovative tracking system that could be dangerous in the hands of mercenaries. The thing right now with the Fast And Furious movies is that you can mix the cars with the most crazy of plots and it works. Scenes like the crew jumping out of a plane in their cars, Toretto driving a car through 3 towers in Abu Dhabi and more are now a part of this wild series of movies. They embrace their silliness and if you're willing to shut down your brain for a moment, you will be in for another exhilarating ride (no pun intended)<br/><br/>Furious 7 also acts as Paul Walker's final film to this world and it couldn't have played out better. Brian O'Connor will now enjoy his family life until we see him again.<br/><br/>Rating: 9,5/10"
"emmalouj","9","1","3","6 May 2015"," satisfying fan movie
","If you go to see this as a fresh face to the franchise you may enjoy it well enough as a high octane action movie. There are a couple of edge of your seat stunts that however unrealistic are nonetheless great. If you are going to watch this a true fan of these movies I don't think you will be disappointed. With Paul Walkers death always in your mind as you watch there is a sense of poignancy to many scenes. As a fan I found the conclusion satisfying if that is the right way to put it. Yes there are cheesy bits and clichés but it's not Shakespere, it's silly to expect anything other than what it is. If you really love the Fast films, you will love this."

"Tyson14","9","1","3","9 April 2015"," The perfect send off for Paul
","""This time it ain't just about being fast.""<br/><br/>I saw this film the day it came out but i thought i would review the previous fast and furious films first. James Wan, who is well known for directing horror films (The Conjuring and Saw), took over the seventh film in this franchise replacing Justin Lin who had been sitting on the director's chair since the third instalment. What I found most interesting about this franchise is that it didn't seem like it was going anywhere after its solid debut in 2001 since the first couple of sequels focused on different characters and story lines. Even when they got the entire cast back together in 2009 for the fourth film I didn't feel like it was anything special. I'd always mildly enjoyed the films, but it wasn't until Fast Five that I was really engaged with the series. Justin Lin may have not impressed me before, but when that film came out he decided to have fun with the overblown action scenes and audiences embraced it completely. We had the team reuniting together being chased by tanks and planes and pulling off nearly mission impossible tasks. My greatest concern for this film was that Wan wouldn't follow that basic formula that had elevated the franchise in the first place. But in an early scene in the film those fears were soon gone when Wan practically gives the audience a wink by having Brian (Walker) telling his son that ""cars don't fly"" when he playfully throws a small toy car through the window. We were about to find out that that claim wasn't necessarily true because throughout this film we actually see several cars fly during the spectacular action scenes.<br/><br/>By the end of Furious Six the franchise was tied perfectly together by uniting the events that took place in Tokyo during the third film with the present. In the fifth and sixth instalments Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Tej (Ludacirs), and Roman (Tyrese Gibson) had finally found financial stability and cleaned their names to return home. The character of Agent Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) had helped reinvigorate the franchise and Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) was brought back from the dead (well actually she never really died, but fans of the franchise know what I mean). Mia (Jordan Brewster) and Brian were enjoying their newfound family life, but as we found out in the end of the sixth film, Owen's brother Deckard (Jason Statham) was set on avenging him. Their seemingly peaceful life is interrupted as the team begins to be hunted down by this dangerous British criminal. Loretto is offered the opportunity to flip the papers on Deckard from being hunted to becoming the hunters when a secret government official known as Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) offers him a deal. A Somalian mercenary (Djimon Hounsou) has kidnapped a hacker known as Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has developed a computer program known as God's Eye that basically allows you to find anyone across the globe in a matter of seconds. If Toretto's team can rescue Ramsey and retrieve God's Eye he will let them use it to track down Deckard and catch him off guard. And so the adventure across the globe begins with flying cars, helicopters and droids exploding across the mountains of the Middle East, the elegant buildings in Abu Dhabi, and the city of Los Angeles.<br/><br/>Gisele and Han were part of the reason why I enjoyed the previous films so much so I was worried that their absence in this film would hurt the movie, but the addition of Jason Statham as the main villain of the film elevated this to a higher level. There are great fight scenes between him and Dwayne Johnson and then with Vin Diesel that were incredibly entertaining. These are probably the best action stars of our generation and when the fighting choreography is filmed correctly you can't go wrong with these guys. There are also some fantastic action scenes involving fast car chases across a gorgeous mountain that ends in a Jurassic Park like cliffhanger. The action scenes are overblown, but that is what makes them so entertaining once you learn to accept the absurdity of it all and simply enjoy the ride. Over-the-top action scenes is what elevated this franchise in the first place and Furious 7 continues to play with that same premise taking advantage of Wan's knowledgeable work behind the camera and his use of different camera angles which makes the film look all the more entertaining.<br/><br/>The greatest success of Furious 7 is being able to blend the incredibly fun action scenes with the dramatic elements involving the chemistry between the characters. We've grown to love these characters and each new addition always seems to work. Furious 7 takes some common themes from films like Mission Impossible or Ocean's Eleven and applies them really well here. Tyrese Gibson plays a similar character to the one Matt Damon played in Ocean's where he wants to prove his leadership qualities to the rest of the crew. There are elements recycled from other action films, but thanks to the cast it works extremely well in this franchise. And then you have the emotional aspect of this film surrounding Paul Walker's untimely death. You can't help but feel emotionally engaged towards his character knowing that the actor has recently passed away. There are several scenes of his face where the CGI seems evident, but the voice work was perfectly executed. The CGI never distracted me however, and I'm glad they decided to continue with the production of the film. The last five minutes are emotionally engaging and without spoiling the film all I can say is that the crew did him justice with a beautiful tribute. Furious 7 continues to build on an already engrossing franchise and it might just be my second favourite after Fast Five."
"Anurag-Shetty","10","1","3","9 April 2015"," A fantastic end to the Fast & Furious franchise.
","Furious 7 takes place right where Fast & Furious 6 left off. After the events of Fast & Furious 6, Dominic Toretto(Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner(Paul Walker) & the rest of Dom's crew have given up the crime & racing life. However, Deckard Shaw(Jason Statham) comes after Dom's family & crew for putting his brother, Owen Shaw(Luke Evans) in a coma(these events happen in Fast & Furious 6). Now, Dom, Brian & the rest of the crew have to do everything in their power to stop Deckard Shaw before he eliminates all of them. To stop Shaw, Dom & his crew will need the help of the US government, represented by an official simply known as, Mr. Nobody(Kurt Russell). But first, Dom & his crew will have to retrieve something for Mr. Nobody. <br/><br/>Furious 7 is an outstanding movie. It's the best film of the entire Fast & Furious series. Sure, most of the car stunts in the film are impossible in real life but, they're still extremely thrilling & fun to watch. The highlight of the Fast & Furious movies is that the action set pieces improve with each new film. The things Dom, Brian, Letty(Michelle Rodriguez), Roman(Tyrese Gibson) & Tej(Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges) do with their cars are unbelievably awesome! The whole sequence in Abu Dhabi is the highlight of the film. All the car & action sequences look eye-popping in IMAX 3D. Vin Diesel is great as Dominic Toretto. Paul Walker is spectacular as Brian O'Conner. The tribute to the late Paul Walker at the end of the film is poignant. We'll miss you Paul. Rest in peace. Jason Statham is vicious as the antagonist, Deckard Shaw. Michelle Rodriguez is good as Letty. Jordana Brewster is super as Mia. Tyrese Gibson is hysterical as Roman. Chris 'Ludacris' Bridges is effective as Tej. Dwayne Johnson is amazing as Hobbs. I just wish Johnson was given more screen time. Kurt Russell is impressive as Mr. Nobody. Nathalie Emmanuel is wonderful as Ramsey. Elsa Pataky is adequate as Elena. The supporting characters are effective too. Furious 7 is a must watch for everyone! Go, have a ball!"

","I'm not a fan of action or car movies, but wow. I absolutely loved Furious 7! Firstly, I'll get the negatives out of the way. Some scenes (okay a fair few scenes) were pretty far fetched. But as are a lot of movies these days, so I was quickly able to move past that, especially with the humor they add along with it. Some major characters were seen for maybe 5 minutes of the entire film, which was unexpected as they are promoted as major roles. And... yeah. that's it for the negatives! My heart was thumping (felt like out of my chest) all the way through, and even though someone spoiled the ending for me, I was on the edge of my seat through all the explosions and fight scenes. And oh my feels. So many feels! The tribute and resemblance to Paul Walkers family life had me blubbering like a baby. It's definitely worth a watch. 10 bucks at the flicks or 30 when it comes out, I would pay to see it again and again. As someone who generally sits there during shootings and explosions itching for the repetitive banging to end, I absolutely LOVED THIS MOVIE. I didn't feel as if anything was over or under done and it's a shame people are down voting this movie as they don't see the significance of the tribute. With or without this tragedy, I promise you it is worth the watch. As someone who knew very little about Paul, his life and significance, it hit me right in the feels and the rest of it definitely was worth my time."

The question is not what is possibly the best Fast & Furious, is THE BEST.<br/><br/>Leaving for the end to Paul, the film has other innovations, compared with the prequels of Lin. I would say the best is the addition of Jason Statham/Deckard Shawn as enemy. And the incorporation of Kurt Russell.<br/><br/>I think that Furious 7 is a one of the best movie action of this year. The scenes are brutal, if you liked the movies of Lin, this if you like more.

","Saw Furious 7 starring Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Jason Statham, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous, Dwayne The Rock Johnson, along with Kurt Russell at Regal Cinemas tonight! I got to tell you, it was worth the wait! This movie was action-packed throughout, with several funny and also heart-breaking emotional moments. If you are a fanatic of fast cars, exotic places around the world like Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emerates, beautiful HOT women, and most of all, the ""Fast and Furious"" Franchise, then this movie is for you! This time, bad guy International Terrorist ""Deckard Shaw"" played by Statham seeks revenge against ""Dominic Toretto"" and his family ""Torretto"" (Diesel). <br/><br/>The family is under fire from one-by-one killing attempts by ""Deckard Shaw"" who is the younger brother of an International Terrorist named ""Owen Shaw,"" as he seeks revenge for his now comatose older brother. ""Torretto"" is out to get his own personal payback for the death of one of his family members, ""Han-Seoul-Oh"" who was killed off in Tokyo, Japan at the conclusion of Fast and Furious 6 in 2013 when actor Sung Kang decided not to return. ""Torretto"" also spends time during the film to help ""Letty"" (Rodriguez) remember all they've been through.<br/><br/>The already action-packed plot thickens when a Somalian Terrorist by the name of ""Jakarde,"" played by Djimon Hounsou and a shady government official, ""Mr. Nobody"" (Russell) both desire to steal the same computer terrorism program, ""God's Eye,"" that has the capability to track down anyone, anywhere, and turn any device into a deadly weapon. ""Torretto"" gets his team back together one more time to stop ""Shaw"" and the other terrorists by planning an air entrance out of a cargo airplane with fast cars on to a mountain-side rescuing a kidnapped girl by the name of ""Ramsey"" played by Nathalie Emmanuel and uses her to hack the system in order to dismantle ""God's Eye"" program. All this happening during an intense struggle for power between terrorists and the United States Government.<br/><br/>Finally, I totally loved the emotional memorial dedication to Paul Walker towards the end of this film! Definitely go see it and take your date! Not too sure if ""Furious 8"" will happen, or if anyone is interested, but it is rumored if this does happen the film might take place in New York, New York!

"The_Film_Cricket","Null","1","3","7 April 2015"," A mixture of heart and heavy metal . . .
","It would only be in a perfect world that terrorism could be dealt with by Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson and a Gatling gun. That ISIS problem? Finished! Furious Seven is as joyfully and gloriously bombastic as that image. When you're dealing with a sixth sequel it's nice to report that the energy hasn't gone out, even when the goals of the movie are to be one-part heavy metal and one-part heavy heart after the real-life death of one of the series regulars. The relief is that these two opposing goals don't trip over one another. It's nice that a movie can be emotional and full of beans at the same time.<br/><br/>Furious Seven is a big movie; big and loud and noisy and over the top. That extends, not only to the stunt work but also to the acting which is gregarious even when the actors are called to get all dramatic and emotional. The movie doesn't help you catch up. If this is your introduction to the series, then you're likely to be left out in the cold. Furious Seven wastes no time with recaps and flings us immediately into the heart of a story already in progress.<br/><br/>It seems that all that business back in London in Furious 6 has ticked off meat-headed tough guy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who is out to pick off Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and the rest of the FATF crew one by one. The death of one of the group's friends in the previous film sets the plot of this film in motion. Shaw breaks into the office of DSS agent Luke Hobbs (The Rock) in order to hack his computer – an office that, fortunate for an action picture, is made of glass.<br/><br/>Shaw puts Hobbs in the hospital which leads Dom and his crew – Tej (Ludacris), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Brian (the late Paul Walker) – to stop Shaw who seems to know their every move. That knowledge comes courtesy of The Single Greatest Tracking Device in the History of Mankind, subtly named ""The Eye of God"". That information comes courtesy of a very scene stealing Kurt Russell as a seemingly indestructible intel guy colorfully named Mr. Nobody.<br/><br/>But who cares? The plot is beside the point anyway. Bad guy wants good guys dead. Good guys get the drop on bad guys by trying to destroy their super-toys. Chase. Shoot-out. Lather. Rinse. Repeat. Furious Seven tries to do too much in trying to be one-part ""Grand Theft Auto"" and two parts ""Mission: Impossible."" When it tries to have a plot, it gets a little snoozy, but whenever the characters are behind the wheel of their cars, the movie is spectacular.<br/><br/>There are at least three car stunts in this movie that belong in a hall of fame somewhere. One takes place as the crew drive their cars out the back of a military plane and pop parachutes; Another scene takes place on the top floor of a skyscraper as Dom drives a sports car out the window and in through the window of the building next door – and THEN through the window of the building next to THAT!; Then there's that white-knuckle scene in which Paul Walker escapes a runaway bus that is about to fall over a cliff by climbing up it as it falls. Everything else in the movie is pretty much perfunctory – whenever it has to deal with car crashes, the movie works beautifully.<br/><br/>Speaking of Paul Walker, now we must deal with the elephant in the room. Walker's death has hung over this production, not as an intrusion but as curiosity about how the producers were going to handle it. As you know, much of the movie was re-shot and re-written after Walker's death in a car accident almost two years ago. Walker's role in the film is somewhat miniscule when compared to the earlier films, and the scenes that had to be reshot after his death don't feel like glaring omissions. The movie leaves the tributary stuff for the ending, an emotionally but restrained tribute in which we get flashbacks to Paul Walker's contribution to this series. Walker's death doesn't overshadow the movie's sense of fun. This is a giddy, goofy, over-the-top action picture that give you what you expect – a lot of heart and a lot of heavy metal."

Maybe it hurts because someone close to my heart died in a car wreck not even 2 months before he died, so I know the pain all too well.. Maybe it's because I know how much he meant to you guys.. Or maybe it's because my dream was to meet him because of the respect I had for him after he started ROWW.. I know we find a way to keep going after losing someone we love, that's life, and it's just something we have to do. But that hurt just always creeps back in right when you think you're OK.. No counselor can offer words of wisdom, there's nothing anyone can say.. And our worlds stop for a second but then people around us keep going, and you think, ""don't they know what happened? Don't they know that someone I love just left me?"" I wonder everyday, why did my friend get in that car? Maybe grief is still talking.. I don't know..

","A great movie The way James wan access all the remaining parts that Paul had filmed really stunning. My tears come out every single time Paul had appeared (didn't exaggerate) The movie begin with a fight scene and end it in a phenomenal way to tribute Paul. This part I reckon would have trigger something in your eyes even if you're not fast franchise fans. The stuns of this show had move to another level, jumping from car window to car window was way too cool! Car drop from plane, drone chasing car, lykan hypersport jump from building to building, this is all the element that only fast and furious would have it. Thanks to the screenwriter, Chris Morgan, the plot of furious 7 was amazing but with only one flaw - the shooting was move way too fast, just a second decide to do a stunts then the next sec, the stunts was happening. Tej and roman were gold joker in this franchise, their conversation keep the atmosphere cool. James wan rotating shooting skill had also boost this film to another level, the stunts was more perfect and stunning. Nowadays, girl-girl fight scene is very rare, but in this franchise, it appear twice. The ending, I think there is nothing to comment or add, it is flawless. RIP Paul!"

","About two years after the last movie, Dom jogs Letty's memory, but she's tired of it. Brian's now a good dad. Elena works with Hobbs. Hobbs catches Deckard Shaw hacking his computer. They brutally fight, badly injuring Hobbs. Dom gets a package from Tokyo and Shaw calls, then the package explodes destroying the Toretto family house. Dom meets Hobbs about Shaw. Brian hides Mia and Jack at a friend's and Dom goes to Tokyo to bring back Han's body. At Han's funeral Dom spots Shaw and chases him. Shaw lures Dom to a standoff, but a ""Mr. Nobody"" steps in and lets Shaw escape. Mr. Nobody briefs Dom of a kidnapped hacker Ramsey who created a powerful program, God's Eye, with the terrorist Jakande in the mix. Dom agrees to get the God's Eye in exchange for Shaw. The team's assembled with Letty added. They bring their cars parachuting from a cargo plane to reach the terrorist motorcade. They manage to free Ramsey but Shaw interferes. Dom, with Ramsey, and Shaw veers off road while Brian fights out of the motorcade with Letty saving him at the end. Shaw escapes but Dom gets cornered by the terrorists. He crashes his car down hill with the team saving him below. <br/><br/>Ramsey and the team goes to Abu Dhabi for the God's Eye. They go to a billionaire's penthouse party, which houses a hyper-car with its ECU containing the program. Letty sneaks into the man's room while Tej and Ramsey hack the security. Roman distracts the crowd as Dom and Brian sneak to the hyper-car. But Letty's caught by the bodyguards and the plan shifts. Dom and Brian decide to take car instead. Making matters worse, Shaw comes in. Dom brings the car flying through to the adjacent towers, jumping off as Brian nabs the ECU. The team gives God's Eye to Mr. Nobody after they use it to track Shaw. They go after Shaw but Shaw has Jakande as an ally and a shootout ensues. Mr. Nobody gets shot so Dom and Brian evacuate him, leaving Jakande to acquire the God's Eye. The team goes home, preparing for the enemy to come to them. The plan is to counter-hack the God's Eye and inserts a virus to it. The team circles around and Jakande's men picked up Dom, so Ramsey starts her hack. But she's made and the terrorists send a drone at her and Brian. They manage to escape but Brian loses his car and the terrorists blow up a signal tower, cutting Ramsey's hack so Brian manually climbs a building to restore the signal. Dom faces Shaw at a parking building's top while Ramsey gets transferred to Letty's car.<br/><br/>The drone almost had them but Hobbs comes and slams an ambulance at it. Ramsey completes her hack and the terrorists lost the God's Eye. Jakande in his helicopter finds Shaw and Dom and send a missile to the building, collapsing it. Shaw falls at the collapse and as Jakande aims at Dom, Hobbs barrages the helicopter with bullets. Dom gets some time and escapes as Jakande continues to collapse the building. Dom launches his car at the helicopter, throwing Shaw's grenades into it, and Hobbs finishes the job by shooting at the grenades. Hobbs, Brian and Letty races to see Dom unconscious, and Letty admits her memory has returned. Dom wakes up and Shaw gets arrested. The added epilogue is not for me to divulge for it gives me the real shivers. <br/><br/>The story is a very nice addition to the great saga. Impacted by the loss of Paul Walker, the story changes turn out to be quite unpredictable and very much emotional. The revealed Shaw revenge is actually only a small portion. Despite the obvious signs of the movies getting more and more strange in the action selection, the other main theme of family of the crew, including character depths and character relations, are really taken to a whole new level.<br/><br/>I like how the movie acknowledges the breadth of the story so far and didn't focus on adding new characters more and more. Although new characters are added, with big names playing them which feels like potential comebacks at future sequels, I see this seventh installment actually focuses more on the main character quartet of Dom, Brian, Mia and Letty, who have the most share of story depth and screen time. The story nicely play on reminiscing from the first movies. I also enjoyed how this movie connect Tokyo Drfit into the whole saga very nicely.<br/><br/>In any way, this movie leaves us with many potential for the next movie in line. And this is a good sign that the saga will continue even without Paul Walker. Throughout the movie I curious on those action sequences, about in which one will Brian meet his end. But I'm glad that Brian retires nicely and emotionally like that. Because if he's ended by dying, it will face Mia and Jack to a painful irony concerning something Brian said about his father from back in the fifth movie.<br/><br/>The action is done greatly despite the tendency to be more and more unbelievable. The fight scenes are also a great job, I really like the spinning cameras. The dialog gets more and more emotional at the right times. I'm glad Tyrese Gibson still plays his part very nicely as the crew's funny-man. The acting in overall is just at a standard level from all the cast members. The story so far, character relations, nostalgic points, and the emotional content are the things that make this movie a good and entertaining piece of action movie.<br/><br/>For me Furious 7 (2015) deserves and 8 out of 10 score and a recommendation. I maybe a bit biased I've following the series from it's first movie. But this movie manages to be good at the action side as well as the emotional side."

In second one casting and star performances were awesome and in this very recent one, action is the best you see in whole series ... This movie gives average screen time with Paul but gives his work a fine and beautiful tribute ... The story lakes the magic which we can see in Fast 5 and Fast 6 but if you're Fast and Furious fan it'd not be big thing cause the stunts and actions on this title is the best in the franchise yet ... The hero side is strong and well performed as before Vin, Paul, Rock is a cool trio hero side without a doubt but villain was bit weak, Jason did his job at best but the character itself was not good enough, and was not as good as Fast 6 .... The actions and sequences are really well performed as it is shown in trailer. And they have put some comedies on and gonna see hot chicks in bikinis so will be fun. But I think they have disappointedly give less importance to Paul until the end. And end was not as my expectation but still it was very beautiful and heart touching .... By all means, Cast - 8/10, Story - 6/10, Stunts - 10/10 .... so again if you are fan, go for it ...."
"quincytheodore","8","1","3","2 April 2015"," Full throttle with sheer accessible fun and honest tribute to Paul Walker
","Furious 7 is a legitimate powerhouse of action movie, there are abundance of crazy stunts and breathtaking choreography it may very well be Mission Impossible. The stars are already well known for the series, acting becomes easier to them since they naturally personify the characters. Add Jason Statham, and real martial artists Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey, this is an ambitious line-up geared for heavy dose of adrenaline rush. Above all the hectic action and set pieces, its genuine heartfelt homage to Paul Walker is arguably the best bit.<br/><br/>After the event of previous title, the crew is being hunted by Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) for the persistent purpose of revenge. They are ultimately embroiled in espionage mission in attempt to locate a surveillance device that can pinpoint Shaw's location and collect resource to take him down. The story takes them through the city streets, mountain paths and even skyscrapers. Needless to say this is the biggest title in the series.<br/><br/>The film throws action scenes one another with reckless abandon. There haven't been many hybrids of vehicular mayhem, shooting spree and fisticuff carnage this magnitude in recent years. James Wan creates the view of these sequences with poise. The camera work is made to appreciate its chaotic action, either it's CGI made or real collision of metal and flesh. Choreography is rough and incredibly quick, although a couple of the scenes have confusing rotating shots. Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey deliver knees and punches to the mainstream audience.<br/><br/>Characters should be familiar for the fans of the series, the actors have become so comfortable with their roles that it gives them an advantage for the acting. There are a few narrative flaws, script can be thin and predictable. However, when Vin Diesel gives the family speech, perhaps because they have spent so much time together in real life, I believe it. There's authentic feeling beyond on-screen characters here.<br/><br/>It's not often that a film can convey profound feeling to audience. Furious 7 gives its tribute to Paul Walker in an elegant manner. It's a prove that you don't need to be an Academy Award winner to move audience, you just have to deliver a sincere humble message. Furious 7 may have a few plot speed bumps, but with explosive entertainment value it accelerates well into the finish line."
"eklavya-cwk","8","1","3","2 April 2015"," More Furious, more blasts.......memories of past ( hope Walker could last )
","Fast and Furious series has two sides that needs to be discussed, technicality and entertainment. While the former parts of the series were typical, fast and furious is growing to be a well developed and appreciated action sequence in forthcoming installments.<br/><br/>Entertainment is the gripping part, its eventful, fast and holding, full of actions, stunts and drama. Just like its previous part, this part has put efforts in showing out new stunts, not to forget the loss suffered at Abu Dabi. It's about cars, speed, guns and bullets, bombs and missiles and a lot of bang-bang! A lot of effort is put on filming locations which were splendid. A realistic feeling is given where the sound of cars vanish when the camera is shooting from height and then we come back closer with vroom-vroom in its action, goes back again coming back to the cars. Although the things to be praised are limited, yet the movie serves you two hours of motion. Dialogues and attitude are same as previous ones, the official good bye to Paul Walker could have been better.<br/><br/>Technically we know what this film is but even then the characters were not exposed that equally and properly-fitting which was much more better in the last movie. Rodriguez was undeveloped, Statham did good, Rock was under-used, in all there was absence of the connection of viewer with the characters in all."

After watching this movie, I agree with the reason which this movie is called ""sky mission"" in spite of car action movie. As this title, action is very brilliant. On the other hand, O'Conner got his son, so he has something to wanna save. This gap is also interesting. What I was disappointed is the story line. I think more clear what and why they do these mission, we can get into the movie world more. Through all the season, O'Conner's posts were very important for these movies.

","*** This review may contain spoilers *** When I first started to view the movie, I thought that may be this time, they could have done something good, although I didn't have to wait much time to check that this movie wouldn't be that. From top to bottom by this movie we can assure that Dwayne Johnson, Jason Statham and Vin Diesel are entirely made out of steel, since all of them fight take and gave some punches and kicks, on body and on the face, but the two only things that happened was a broken arm on Dwayne Johnson and a scratch on Vin Diesel face, after being beaten on the face by a steel stick!!! That's impressive and ridiculous. Not only that was really bad, they compile a whole bunch of stupidity and nonsense, I think that my ""favorites"" are by the end, first when the building collapses by the space where Statham is and the following scene where Vin Diesel can put the bag of grenades on the helicopter....Reminded me of an also nonsense scene of Transporter...Probably the presence of Jason Statham inspired that also horrible scene. In conclusion is a bad movie, with an awful story, really bad directed...A bad cinematic experience."

Jason Stratham plays the same character as he plays in all his films, very poor as usual. However it is the over the top stunts and fight scenes which really ruin the film, truly beyond reality. How the film industry keep getting away with these high budget rubbish films is beyond me, and the actors should have a bit of dignity instead of a big bank balance.

","First of all I'd like to say this- I respect Paul, I think he was a good actor and had a nice personality. The thing is, I did not see ALL the F&F movies, but this movie was terrible. Of course some will agree and some will not, but except for a few nice landscape shots- I did not like this movie one bit. I did not see anything new, nothing completely different from the other movies that made me say ''wow, this truly is a great movie, unlike anything I've ever seen before''. The fighting scenes were no different than some older and other action movies I've seen, the story wasn't new at all compared to the other F&F movies and other action movies... This movie actually felt like a cliché movie to me. Every single cliché of every action movie- was there. The ending was obvious, the story wasn't a bit new, this movie didn't feel new or worth watching in any way. If you're a F&F movie, you'll probably enjoy this. The reason I gave this movie 3/10 is because of the soundtrack by Wiz Khalifa, the nice landscape shots throughout the movie and the cast (Dwayne, Diesel, Paul and Michelle)."

Especially the scenes from the first two movies (Which I did enjoy very much). <br/><br/>Al the rest? Just a lame ass Hollywood milking cow. Bad Story, and Sorry, even the action was predictable, not believable and stupid.<br/><br/>After the first two movies it only went downhill. Every sequel in this franchise gets worse and worse. Absolute waste of time.<br/><br/>And what about the cast? I had my hopes up for Jason Statham. Not a state of the art actor. But knows how to deliver some good ass action. His role in this movie was unfortunately too small, but still pretty bed in comparison to a film such as Crank."
"pjbhaumik","6","3","18","30 May 2015"," If the Avengers Had to Drive Without Superpowers...
","There was one race scene, one convoy scene, one get away scene, and one chase scene. The first Fast and Furious had at least three or four of each. The settings have become a little more diverse with at least three different regions of the world represented. Less race scenes meant less street tuners though some of the armored mods were still innovative. Overall the attitude of the Fast and Furious saga had been toned down from careless joy rides to now saving the world! Paul Walker's death definitely changed the relationships and trust amongst the familiar cast. Most visible was the change in Vin Diesel's acting. Tony Jaa was suppressed since he could definitely beat anyone there in a martial arts contest, and any action actor was suited for Jason Statham's hyped role. Tyrese and Ludicrous were still exchanging funny insults for the babes, and Dwayne Johnson always keeps energetic and motivating."
"rollstop","3","3","18","28 May 2015"," Sharknado on Wheels
","""Hahahahahaha!"" That's what I kept saying throughout this intellectually insulting and predicable movie. This movie came from the brain child of an 11 year old! Wow! They actually far exceeded my expectations of the ridiculousness I knew would ensue while going into this movie and all the typical phrases and clichés are present. It has the heart of Sharknado injected into the fabric of the F&F universe. I have seen all of the F&F movies. Furious 7, however, took the franchise to whole new level of preposterous.<br/><br/>The whole Furious crew is after this guy Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) because he killed the snack eating Japanese guy, Han. But in order to get to him they have to team up with Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) who is after some sci-fi tech called the God's Eye that was created by this hacker, Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), whom some private terrorist group have captured. This computer chip has the ability to see every camera, hear every microphone, ATM, computer, in the world to instantly locate anyone on the planet. For some unspoken political reasons all US agencies have been ruled out to find Ramsey and the chip, which is why, of course, they need Dom and his team. If the Furious gang steals the tech then Mr. Nobody will let them use it to find Shaw. <br/><br/>Of course the government affords them tricked out cars to go find this special chip. A 4x4 '69 Dodge Charger is the first thing that comes to my mind when I need to chase bad guys. Does Dom always have to drive a '69 Charger? He drives like 4 of them in this movie! <br/><br/>One of the many things that do not make sense in this plot is whenever they are after this chip, Shaw conveniently shows up as well, I guess, to get the computer chip too or he is chasing the 7 crew? We never know much about Shaw or where he is throughout the movie; he just magically appears whenever it is convenient for him to be in the plot. This happens more than once. But isn't the reason they are after the chip is in order to get Shaw? So why don't they stop chasing after this chip and everyone direct their energies at Shaw while he is there? No, they want to get away from him first, get the tech they need, to ultimately put themselves back in the same situation they were in when he showed up unexpectedly to then exact revenge. And if he is actually chasing the F&F gang (w/o sounding too logical :/ ) then why not just wait for him to show up instead of risking their lives for some computer chip? <br/><br/>The final showdown of this movie is too long to go into here as there would be too much to write. Basically it is one unbelievable piece of action after another. One highlight was when Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) is in the hospital and flexes his broken arm in a cast to break it off. WHAT!? Later when he crashes the EMT truck over the bridge at the exact moment the drone is flying under to blow it up was when I seriously lost it and broke out in laughter! There should be a category for movies that are hilarious when they aren't meant to be. And just think, the first movie portrayed everyone (except for Paul Walker's character who was trained F.B.I.) as common street racing thieves in L.A. to this movie where they are now practically trained operative spies taking down mercenaries and chased by missile launching drones. Each subsequent movie becomes more out of touch with reality than the previous. But this one outdid the last and I wonder what was the director James Wan thinking when he approved of all this? What will the next one be named, ""Fast and Furious 8 in Space""? <br/><br/>With all of that said, it was still entertaining to watch, like bubble gum for the mind. Even if there is no sensible plot it is still watchable for the laughs almost like Naked Gun (1988) or Airplane (1980). That is kind of sad considering they really can't make a spoof version of this franchise because it is already woven into the films. The characters do not need much development since we know who they are already, which allows for more time to focus on crazy stunts and absurd action. The cars are quite cool, though the focus is no longer on the cars or racing, but more on revenge, espionage, and heist and some short side-show soap opera scenes.<br/><br/>The very end was somewhat redeeming to this wacky flick and actually the best part of the whole movie; it kind of got to me. I felt they did an enduring send off for Paul Walker and his character, though it really didn't seem to fit with the rest of the movie. They created a smooth double entendre monologue to say goodbye to Brian the character while actually meaning goodbye, Paul. The top view shot of them in their cars riding side by side to then see them split on different paths was moving and fit perfectly with their friendship, passion for cars, and his exit from the series.<br/><br/>However good the end was, 5 minutes does not outweigh 2 hours. You cannot legitimately give this movie a 10 because of that. I think Paul Walker would have been shaking his head left and right and sinking further in seat if he were at the premiere. ""Sorry Paul"" is what the end should have said for making his last movie so bad.<br/><br/>3/10. 2 stars for action and entertainment. 1 star for Paul Walker tribute."

","Furious six or fast six was in my opinion an irrelevant movie, it was only made to make money and not to tell a story. With furious 7, its just a big mess.Many people rate this movie highly because of Paul Walker, make no mistake this movie gave him a good tribute. But in terms of the franchise, its a horrible entry! The Lines are cheesy as if written by an eight year old. The action scenes are amazing to look at but thats all they are, eye candy! They are not relevant to the plot at all. Deckard shaw was actually intimidating in the first 40 minutes of the movie, but eventually, just gets caught up in a lot of nonsense.The globe trotting is not necessary as it adds nothing to the movie, one minute they are here, the next there, without really making sense. The worst of all is how disappointing this movies final act is. When you watch it you'll see how anti climatic it is. The first fast and furious was good , the second decent, tokyo drift good, fast 4 moderate, fast five excellent, fast six and seven irrelevant.

","I had serious high hopes for this movie, I really did. I pretty much like everything. Not only, did this movie not entertain me, It made me angry and sad. I Like Paul Walker movies, including the others in the Fast and Furious series. I own quite a few myself. As I write this review, there is an internal struggle within me because this IS Paul Walkers last movie. His co-stars and the creators of this movie really cared about him and it shows in the end. That being said, this movie really disappointed me. The cars?...awesome. The acting?...not bad. The action?... mostly unrealistic. The best action scenes you will see in the previews and you can save your money.<br/><br/>As an example, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson is exploded...falls five stories onto the roof of a car...implodes it...and doesn't die. He breaks an arm and a leg. I may have been able to swallow that if it wasn't for the fact that he breaks out of his casts with the explanation that ""daddy's got to go to work"" and runs around the end of the movie holding a chain gun. I seriously didn't know whether to laugh or cry at that point. The crew gets constantly shot at and nothing happens...but when they turn the same weapons on the bad guys...they die horribly. Vehicles drop from extreme heights and don't explode. The fight scenes are brutal with hardly even a scratch. My last example is when Dom is presumed dead at the end. Brian wants to deliver CPR, which is what you should do if someone's heart stops, but instead turns him over to Letty who whispers in his ear and all of the sudden he awakens. The Paul Walker montage at the end is what really upset me, because he will never have a chance to be in another movie worth watching and this is the movie that capped his legacy. Fans of the series will find it watchable but will agree with me as they walk out of the theater or turn off the DVD player."

","I was surprised by the fact this film is so inept , randomly plotted, hastily put together , indifferently acted and clumsily directed (James Wan directed this?). I consider my self a fan of Big budget brainless action pop corn films , however this is nothing but a series of ""money shots"" , (the skyscraper jump, the airplane jump, the bus dangling over the cliff) thinly glued with the flimsiest excuse of a plot about a shadowy bad guy , a lady ""hacker"" (another throw away character), and a government agent. Ultimately we come away none the wiser, save for the knowledge that Dom would rather lay on a beach drinking corona with his buddies and ""family"" (ha! family values!) than fight his evil adversaries and save the civilized world from terrorists. But that's what he does and what he is going to keep doing in the inevitable sequels. And it's a pity to see Kurt Russell in this wreck, but even by Jason Statham standards, this film sets a new low. It all ultimately adds to this: The audience will flock to see on the big screen the over the top Hi-tech Hi-Def Hijinks promised in the preview trailer , no matter if the audience's intelligence will be grossly insulted by the producers of this pile of crap. A worrisome conclusion for the current state of cinematic affairs."
"bencsik-laszlo91","5","3","18","1 May 2015"," Absolutely ridiculous but still entertaining.
","Let's face it, this movie is popular because of three things: cars,chicks and action. Other major elements like script,story,acting,logic are completely missing.<br/><br/>If you can accept this fact and overcome the lack of reality you will have a great time. As far as i'm concerned it is an entertaining, action packed and sometimes funny movie. Most of us know what to expect, so i would like to mention two major problems which made this movie less enjoyable than the previous ones.<br/><br/>The biggest problem was the Deja Vu effect. There was a feeling that carried me through the whole movie. I have seen this before and this time they couldn't convince me with stunning moments and spectacular actions. Every moment imitated moments from the previous 3 movies. Every dialogue, every scene summoned elements that i have seen already. It is hard to describe this feeling but it definitely can't be unseen. It ripped off literally everything from itself.<br/><br/>The total lack of reality is the other big problem. I know, i know. It is perfectly unnecessary to come up with a thing like this in this case. There is a border of tolerance and after a certain amount of stupidity it can not be ignored anymore. We may call this the Bullsh*t-Meter. My brain can consume 100 bullsh*t/Fast and Furious movie. Once it steps over the line i can not take it anymore. This movie established a new record with infinite number of nonsense. <br/><br/>The characters are still racist but after 6 movies i get used to it. However I could barely endure the simple existence of Tyrese Gibson. He wanted to be funny all the time but whatever he said always ended in awkwardness.<br/><br/>Action scenes are still amazing and intense, cars still look fabulous, chicks wear even less clothes ... soooo... basically thats it. It is an average action movie with literally nothing else to offer. <br/><br/>It is not a bad movie but i do not know what crazy stunts are they going to do in the next one. Maybe Vin Diesel will fight with King Kong on a ship which slides down from the Mount Everest! Who knows?"
"nicolechan916","4","3","18","23 April 2015"," Repetitive story with fast cars, action and average acting.
","I'm going to start by saying that I do not like these kinds of movies, and they hold no attraction for me anymore. Stories based on revenge and action, and men being all masculine showing off their muscles and justifying killings and destruction. Not to mention the objectifying of the female body. Is it really necessary to have women extras walking around almost naked and having close-ups of their asses? NO. I really cannot stress this enough, and how I really cannot stand movies that do this.<br/><br/>The story seems really identical to the other films. Though I did not watch all the movies I do remember watching the 6th one and the 3rd one, and this series is just so formulaic. Bad guys, crew members who are like family taking the bad guys down, authorities stepping in, destruction, guns and fast cars. There isn't really anything new with the films and I really wonder what makes it so popular.<br/><br/>That's about all I've got to say. Nice cars, cool races and action with some verging on impossible. I'm getting tired of watching films based on action and masculinity. For heaven's sake The Rock tensed his muscles and his cast came off! A super cheesy and super wtf moment.<br/><br/>Also, I was wondering how they ended up fixing Paul Walker's parts, and it actually isn't very noticeable. I think his nose looks a teensy bit sharper towards the end, because they were using CGI effects in addition to the help of Walker's brothers but it could still go unnoticeable. There are quite a few scenes in the film in which had me thinking they had an editing problem though. Some lines would be repeated and some of the same shots played over again in the same sequence. I don't know what happened there.<br/><br/>I know many might not agree with me, but I write how I feel and you don't have to agree. We all have different opinions. <br/><br/>Read more movie reviews at: championangels.wordpress.com"

","""It is soooo good! Oh my god you will cry at the end! Such a good film, Paul Walker was amazing!"" <br/><br/>...are all I seem to be hearing about this film, which I reluctantly went to see. Meh, I thought, a it'll be some mindless violence and if people are raving about it, perhaps it will be better than I expect...<br/><br/>...It wasn't. <br/><br/>Fans of the films are going to love it either way. Everyone else will be divided by either how gullible they are, how much they enjoy mindless action, and how humorous they find things.<br/><br/>Don't me wrong, I absolutely love mindless action movies, But the thing for me with this movie, is that it's not actually clear if they are taking the film seriously. I know, obviously it's not meant to be realistic, but if they aren't taking it too seriously then they do a bad job of showing it.<br/><br/>Usually in decent action films, the characters sometimes reference how out of control a situation is. Even if it's just a ""woah that's crazy"" or Take Bad Boy's II for example. They had cars thrown at them during the chase scene, but it was OK because the characters acknowledged that it was not a normal thing to be happening ""They're throwing cars at us Marcus, how am I not seeing that!?"" With Furious 7, not a single character seemed to realise what they were doing was complete and utter bonkers. (It still baffles me how they can drive a car through three skyscrapers and everyone just acts as if it's no biggie).<br/><br/>And oh the cheese! In the end I spent more time laughing out loud at the films ridiculousness, than actually really even enjoying it. <br/><br/>This film oozes with cheesy dialogue, cheesy clichés and cheesy performances. <br/><br/>The nail in the ol coffin even came pretty early on when they jumped the shark with Statham and Diesel crashing their cars head on to each other and getting out with a scratch. From there, I couldn't take anything they did at all seriously. Everything was laughable, even the obviously supposed 'dramatic' parts such as the aftermath of Vin Diesel pulling a 'Die Hard' and trying to take down a helicopter with a car.<br/><br/>At least JohnMcClain had the sensibility to get out of the car first.<br/><br/>Plot wise, trying to make it anything more than a revenge film, just made it a mess. In some parts, it even felt like watching cut scenes from a game.<br/><br/>Annnnd now onto the Paul Walker send off. Personally I thought it was OK, kinda cheesy, and didn't stir up any emotions. (For me his best role was in Running Scared, so his character in this was 'meh' to me.)<br/><br/>They did do well making a film with one of the main cast passing during shooting, however it was just not a good film. And I refuse to give it praise just because it was Paul Walkers last film. A bad film is a bad film.<br/><br/>In the end I give it a 4, but more like a 5 just sheerly because I really did enjoy laughing at it."

","It is a good thing the franchise sampled the heist element into its defining genre of car and culture, otherwise hardly would it have reached the level it has now. Growing through sequel after sequel, in this seventh installment of the beloved, sentimentally-charged series, the only problem is - it goes beyond adequacy.<br/><br/>Finally stitching together the third film and its sequels, the plot takes you on a revenge game from the antagonist's side. The Toretto-O'Connor family has developed over the years, and the sentimentality is all over the place, giving the plot a considerable dose of melodrama. But the past is back to haunt them as Shaw (Statham) is vowing to avenge his brother's free-fall from that never-ending runway in the sixth film. Starting with an attack on Hobbs (The Rock), Shaw visits Dom and gang from time to time like he's an insurance agent coming in for monthly checks. All he does is arrive, talk, shoot few bullets and beautiful grenades, and leave.<br/><br/>Then the plot drifts to a side story about a hacker who is being pursued by a dumb marauder. Unfortunately the primary bad guy (Statham), as one can possibly detect, has a screen space less than that of the Indian lad Ali Fazal. He is vindictive, agreed, but switching ON and OFF between the scenes is equivalent to a show without a villain. It mostly looked like that Dom and his gang are fighting and driving for nothing. That is confirmed when in the second half you see all of Hollywood crammed into one big setting, where all rules of science, logic, and common sense go take a hike. The second biggest problem with the plot is that Hobbs, who as an anti-hero changed the way the audience saw The Fast & The Furious series evolve, is left out. It was a delight watching him in the last two films, but in here, he is not even given his fair share of comedy. Tyrese may make you laugh with maintained humor, but he definitely overdoes it. <br/><br/>However, fans expecting explosions WILL get explosions. After tanks and freighters, here we have flying cars and buses fit with machine guns. The action goes couple of notches higher, with breathtaking (is the right word) sequences helped by beautiful photography. The camera work is better due to the use of slow-motion stunts. If you take the advice I have mentioned in the summary, you will find delight in watching these scenes that unfold in the first half. Second half is tedious and draggy. With a climax that lasts an eternity adds further boredom to the viewing experience and makes Hollywood look like Bollywood. Even the music is a let down.<br/><br/>The character of Letty (Rodriguez) was best left dead, because she is one player causing sameness in the film. With that silver Christ locket exchanging necks and hands more than a regular one dollar bill, it would have been wiser to prune the family business, now that Mrs. O'Connor is being cast only for the purpose of producing babies. Diesel is fine, Statham is badly cast, while Walker is purportedly the man of the show. A glorious tribute at the end closes the show with a tear.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Watchable, because it very well defines what the franchise is all about - ones and zeros as in binary which relates to fear and loyalty as in family. So, limit your brain and experience the high-octane drama. 6/10.<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family? YES"

","Just came out to see Fast & Furious 7 last night.<br/><br/>I was expecting a lot from the movie, especially from the crazy unrealistic stunts they pull out for some times. I was not disappointed on that part, the first part of the movie gives great stunts and shots, a lot of humor, a real Fast & Furious.<br/><br/>However the movie lacks a lot in it's second part. The finale is long and boring. We are stuck for more that 30m with a chase between a car and a drone, repetitive, unimaginative, dark, without much meaning.<br/><br/>I left the movie with mix feelings, I had both a good time and a bored time.<br/><br/>While I do appreciate the farewell to Paul Walker at the end of the movie, I found it even more troubling regarding the storyline of that movie.<br/><br/>It was touching, but it just doesn't makes sense in the movie. Toretto is leaving the beach... alone as if he was leaving everybody. Brian follows him, they ride and they split. All of those shots with good narrative on how much they will miss him...<br/><br/>In the storyline, what is the points of those words? There is no clue whatsoever that Brian is going to die (does he have cancer in terminal phase or something?), Considering they intend to do a F&F8 and F&F9, I was hoping they would set up the next movies, especially what will happen to Brian, they didn't.<br/><br/>I give that movie a 6, I think it is still worth a 7, but I found the ratings so far overrated"

","Everything is so predictable in this movie. I was never a big fan of the Fast and Furious franchise but the more sequels they roll out the worse they get. There are scenes where everything falls apart around a character and after 5 minutes of buildings crumbling and debris falling all over, he gets up and has almost no scratch or bruise. If I go for 10 minutes trough a dense forest I get out of there with more cuts and bruises then the guys from this movie.<br/><br/>For every fight scene the characters uses brand new cars. It's like they have a warehouse full of cars and they can replace them just as fast as they trash. If I start to think about it, the amount of cars that have been crashed would value more then these guys could earn in a life time.<br/><br/>All in all, the action was predictable and kinda unrealistic but the cars are awesome!"

","As someone mentioned before, definitely the worst movie in the series. However, three things look promising: direction and two (maybe three or four) actors who know acting (Dwayne Johnson and Jason Statham; maybe Michelle Rodriguez for a moment and Kurt Russell). Others are there just to say their lines (Diesel) with absolutely flat facial expression or to smile stupidly (late Walker) and basically just to smash as many expensive cars as possible and destroy basically everything in their way with no consequences. Oh, yes: there are many ""deep philosophical"" thoughts about family, brotherhood and other cheap crap. It's not even fun any more. Reminds me of Mission impossible in a worst possible way. Well, you've probably watched first 6 sequels and you'll go for the seventh (as I did). Go then, but be warned: this movie should have not happened. Poor cars."

The Rock was the one that made F&F reasonably fun in the last 2 movies, they literally striped him to a bed for the whole film, what a waist.<br/><br/>The whole memory loss thing was a bit odd to me, it kinda didn't make any sense and was pretty pointless to the movie. Then you have the crew go around the world to find a gizmo to find the Shaw, Shaw shows up but you still worried about the gizmo. The whole plot made absolutely no sense, it was distracting when Shaw appeared 3 freaking times in the location where you are trying to grab a thingymagic to find Shaw. WTF?? Not going to mention the silly action, I agree that if these were set up as superheroes I would mind less, but not a big deal. Nice touch at the end with homage to Walker.

I saw so many of these, similar ones before, that I really can not be impressed very much with repeating action, which increasingly looks the same in all of these expensive action films. Scene, when car is crashing trough three towers is probably the most memorable one. Otherwise, all other scenes looked very much similar to other action films I have seen over the years. <br/><br/>If you are a fan of high speed, lots of crashes and no brainier plot, this is a film for you, otherwise, you might freely skip it."

What a beautiful ending, I got goosebumps when Paul pulled up next to Vin's car and said ""you don't think you were going to leave without saying goodbye"" with a huge grin on his face, just beautiful. <br/><br/>It's so sad that we lost Paul and to be honest I thought they were going to kill him off in the film so I was waiting for that but when I realized they didn't I was actually relieved and touched that they chose to give him a beautiful end instead of something that would open wounds that have not fully healed among fans, friends and family.<br/><br/>Now my question is, will Mia and the two kids be in the next movie? I doubt it since they have been fazing her out in the past two, with her only having at most fifteen minutes during the film. Han and Gisele are gone as well (sigh so sad, they were my favorites).

","FAST AND THE FURIOUS 7<br/><br/>What do we expect from 'Fast and the Furious' movies? <br/><br/>a) Speeding Cars and heists b) Overtly thrilling action sequences c) A good plot which does not make the movie an abrupt affair<br/><br/>With 'The Fast and the Furious:Tokyo Drift', the movie series had taken a side-track from its story-line. But, many should concur that this movie has by far been the benchmark of a quality movie based on racing/car-action. It had all the qualities of this adrenaline- pumping genre and except the heist part, it serves all the expectations of the Fast and the Furious franchise.<br/><br/>Anyway, even if beating the benchmark of Tokyo Drift is a far- fetched job, one can surely expect! But, I should confess that I was a bit disappointed with the latest sequel, i.e FF7. <br/><br/>Many would like to say that it is good that the latest sequel does not include street-races, as they seem childish. But, I had always been a fan of this franchise because of those street races (Need for Speed games being the trigger for it), and lately I've been disappointed with the movie plots which do not include those 'childish' races.<br/><br/>So in this sequel, speeding cars and heists - Yes. Races - No.<br/><br/>Coming to the part about thrilling action sequences, yes the movie delivers on that. Most of the scenes are top-notch and nasty, and as it goes, unbelievable. Obviously more 'fantastic' than 'gutsy'. The sad part is, a good chunk of it was already there in the trailer. <br/><br/>And lastly, the plot. Well, in layman's terms, it is bullshit ! You'd probably cry almost every 10 minutes uttering, ""What the hell is happening?"". At one moment Dwayne Johnson is hospitalized with serious injuries; in another, he rips off his plaster and goes on firing the villains with machine guns. Well obviously, he is 'The Rock'! An actor like Jason Statham seems a sidekick in the plot. And then again, there is our ""Joy Lobo"" from '3 Idiots' playing an Abu- Dhabi guy. :P<br/><br/>There are just too many characters doing little jobs rather than less number of characters doing big jobs.<br/><br/>So finally, we come to the primary reason which urges you to watch the movie, and precisely the reason why it is doing such good business. It is the ending, which pays a very fine tribute to our beloved Paul Walker weaving the story-line into an emotional ride, which leaves you gasping and with soggy eyes.<br/><br/>People who feel an attachment towards this series and towards the actors pertaining to the series, should watch it for the final homage to Paul Walker.

Also, his family's probably pretty well off, with the 25 million dollar estate that was handed down upon his death to his daughter.<br/><br/>Just because you saw him on a screen, doesn't mean you're family. Use reason. Respect the living; simply remember the dead. It is not necessary for everyone to know how sad an actor's death makes you. You don't have to be the most mournful. You don't have to be mournful at all, if you didn't know him, or the family.<br/><br/>He's been dead for close to a year and a half, by the by, so this ain't ""too soon"". People already forgot about Robin Williams.<br/><br/>I never met Paul, and so I'll review the movie as a movie.<br/><br/>The action sequences in this film are mostly good. Fight choreography, also pretty good. It's all meant to be over-the-top, and while they take great liberties with physics, it's fun to watch.<br/><br/>The ""story"" and ""acting"" sequences in-between the action are awful, often ridiculous, especially near the end, when, at one point, they eschew medical procedures for a friggin' story - and that works, somehow.<br/><br/>You may not have seen this many clichés and catch-phrases in another movie, so that's something they might have achieved. Not good clichés, mind you, just borrowed ones from every other action movie you've ever seen.<br/><br/>So many ""nick-of-time"" sequences were included, it's hard to stay on the edge of your seat for the whole movie, and eventually, everything becomes somewhat too ""extreme"", and subsequently deflated.<br/><br/>The tribute to Paul Walker at the end was very tasteful, well done, but that isn't going to gain it anything in the ""movie quality"" department.<br/><br/>The movie itself is not much of a tribute to anyone, and will quickly be forgotten by this viewer.<br/><br/>The 5/10 is for the work the guys behind the scenes did to make this thing worth watching in some way; the digital guys, the choreographers, the coaches, etc.<br/><br/>The end sets everything up for ""FF:InfuriEight"" (suggested title).<br/><br/>Theater:No; Buy:No; Rent:Yes, Free:Yes."

(Spoiler) The God's-Eye story arc was unreasonably far-fetched to begin with, but the further sub-plot about it being sold to an Arabian Billionaire was completely inane.<br/><br/>The film's main appeal, the action, was not enough to redeem it in the slightest. Too over the top and CGI dependent, it just came across as silly and completely unbelievable (and I'm not meaning, 'suspension of disbelief' unbelievable, I'm talking just plain stupid)<br/><br/>The obligatory 'good guys almost lose, but win in the end' plot points were painful to watch, and did not manage to create a sense of suspense in the slightest. The 'romance' between Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez was excruciating to experience, as was much of the cliché dialogue. The only tolerable performances came from Jason Statham and Tyrese Gibson (with Gibson managing to offer *some* comedic relief). It is difficult to decide who gave the poorest performance; Vin Diesel or Dwayne Johnson (the latter, I am fairly certain pronounced 'cavalry' as 'calvary', a word with a completely different meaning). Kurt Russell's appearance was downright sad. The one-liners seemed almost like satire. <br/><br/>The montage of Paul Walker at the end was endearing, but it is ultimately sad that he was associated with such a poor film. There did seem to be some real emotion from the other cast members in the final scene, but it was unfortunately overshadowed by the long, excruciating, ridiculous film that preceded it.<br/><br/>As of the 7th of April, this title is rated 8.2 on IMDb.

This is a pretty darn bland movie with some poor editing and super cheesy and poorly executed action sequences. Mainly because of the camera execution, it was just lame from start to finish. The acting is pretty bad and seems like regular civilians with shaved heads, some muscle and a beard participated. Or guys that just look slick or a bit geeky played these roles. I like watching movies where it's survival of the fittest, but this movie was boring. I have seen much better from amateur youtube videos and much entertaining as well. Vin Diesel for most the time, looked like he didn't know what he was doing. The movie is about two hours and seventeen minutes and they try to milk every second of it. Because apparently movies have to be at least 2 hour and 17 minutes or close to it. Sure this can play a part in the story, but not when it's constantly shown over and over again. This is a action movie, but just about all of the action in this movie is downright stupid and doesn't make any sense. The story seems like something someone can come up with in like an hour by just sitting and writing. Even the interactions between characters was so bad, cliché and boring. Just pass on this one, it's a waste of time. I give this movie a 3 because they seem to have tried really hard to make a cool, stylish quasi video game style movie."

","This series has been showing numerous numbers of unrealistic stuffs. And I've been quite enjoying them honestly. But this seventh film has just broken the limit. Now it's just ridiculous. They used to show few innovations in the previous films. But this time they've probably figured, ""Hey, we've gotten the fans hooked. We've brought in a new star, and a core star died. So there's no way this one need anything new. We'll just repeat 50% stuffs from the previous movies, steal another 20% from other franchises and add a lot of clichés to fill in the rest.""<br/><br/>I didn't expect the cast to do any legendary acting, but the least they could do is actually be in ""character"" during the filming. All of the actors were like just ""being themselves"".<br/><br/>And about the stunts and CGIs, be as ridiculous as you want just represent is somewhat believable. The subplots are probably some of the worsts. ""God's Eye"", seriously? Seriously they expect to sell this crappy idea??<br/><br/>The only reason this film is this much successful is because of the death of Paul Walker. There I've said it."
"RomeoKnight","4","3","20","3 May 2015"," B-class action movie with A-class sfx
","I don't even know where to start but this film was perhaps the most mind numbing action film I've seen for a long time. Definitely not worth going to theaters. That's it in a nutshell.<br/><br/>Fast and Furious has come a long way from the first movie to its seventh installment. Franchise is very popular and hence the high amount of sequels. I genuinely liked the first one and few sequels were okay too. But now, director James Wan tries to poke the series with his ""vision"" that seems more like a producers and studios vision. Director has made a lot of good horror movies which I like a lot. Seemingly the guy can technically make a fast paced action films like this one too but the end result lacks charisma and is very messy with music video style fast cuts, shaky cams, ""camera rolls"" and what not. This is a movie for ADHD generation for sure since its mostly hard to make out anything what's happening on the screen. Viewer is filled with constant stream of V8 growl, fist fights, missiles blowing up, cars flying trough mountain cliffs, cars flying trough sky scrapers, ... well you get the point. You can leave your brains home if you go see this. There is very little drama or calm moments and when there is such, the dialog is juvenile and ultra clichéd. ""I should have done that long time ago"", ""I belong home and I love you forever after"", etc etc. Such poor and uninspired writing. Even much poorer than I though is possible for this franchise.<br/><br/>So the script was pretty ridiculous with a lot taken from James Bond, Oceans Eleven series or your generic buddy agent film. I guess they are starting to run out of ideas if they have to transform a street racing subculture film into an agent romp with bullets flying. FF was never about guns or ""breaking in to top secret facility with a team of highly skilled specialist"". Script was just all over the place with explosions, fist fights, going to random places, throwing forgettable one liners... That saddened me. Cars and racing culture were not in the limelight. I was so begging the film to end midways since there was too much non-stop generic action that I've seen million times before. There is absolutely nothing new and memorable in this film you haven't seen in any b-class action movie already. <br/><br/>Physics and realism were totally forgot and people jumped from high speed moving cars to asphalt, rolled 100 meters down a mountain cliff, had head-to-head car crash, got hit multiple times with iron bar, flew from fourth floor landing on top of a car, and all this without characters barely sustaining a scratch! Wow. This is actually more superhero movie than Avengers because you can't kill those guys! I expect mindless action movies at least have a decent respect to laws of physics and human body. Oh yeah, and then there was a scene with cars dropped from a plane and landing perfectly on the tiny road many kilometers below them. Just splendid... Also the action and sfx wasn't that spectacular either and I'm truly baffled how they managed to spend 190M on this. They actually used stickers as ""bullet holes"" on cars in many shots. Last time I saw that being done was some Steven Seagal movie from 90s. Surely there was lots of cars being wrecked but somehow it all seemed bland perhaps because of fast cutting or shaky cam. <br/><br/>I will give this 4 instead of 3 just because of the touching montage and salute they put for Paul Walker at the end. Too damn shame that he passed away since I liked him a lot as an actor and he seemed like a nice guy. He would have deserved a lot better movie than this unmemorable piece of action mess."

That's it about Furious 7. <br/><br/>Now, let's focus on Paul Walker cz that's what matter about this movie, right? I tried to track the CGI scenes from the real ones,,, it was a difficult one cz the CGI were executed perfectly, and here is my conclusion.. I think the movie turn after Paul's death was the park scene after Abu Dhabi where the team goes back to the US. From here onwards, that's not the real Paul. You can detect it from the clear avoidance to show his face, and make it appear only when it was pure necessary, camera angle, lights,,, and in some parts where he had to show emotions, especially over the phone with Mia.<br/><br/>But also, I believe the scene at the beginning of the movie where he's talking to Mia and the house explosion. I think this was done to add to the plot and make sense for the movie end.<br/><br/>You can sleep the whole movie, but it would be a sin to miss the farewell scene. It was beautifully executed,,, full of emotions and would be hard not to cry. It was a perfect way to say goodbye to Paul. I believe the full gang said goodbye,, and it was obvious that it was more than Brian's becoming a family man. <br/><br/>Goodbye Paul,,, Good bye Brian.."
"food-movies-sleep","3","3","21","8 April 2015"," The movie was Fast but I am furious!!
","This was supposed to be a franchise where car racing or car chase based action was supposed to take centre stage! Cars parachuting down on to the highway?? Come on!! I would rather see A-Team where they shoot ammo from the tank to guide it mid air. This movie seemed more like a spin off from Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol!! And as the movie progressed it was less about Statham finishing his younger brother's fight and more about generic geeky mumbo jumbo stuff. It would have been awesome if the whole movie was a cat and mouse game between Statham and Diesel. The chemistry between Paul Walker and Diesel was almost non-existent may be be because Paul(may his soul be at peace) passed away before those scenes were shot. And I may be the very few who feel this way but the tribute to Paul Walker was not THAT impressive. Very clichéd. And I am going to watch Eight Below to remember the good sensitive Actor that Paul was. I hope the series ends with this movie. And please let James Bond or Ethan Hunt take over such plots."
"bodhi-13262","6","3","22","18 May 2016"," It's not just about being fast...
","'Furious 7' is the latest installment to the franchise and the last for the late Paul Walker. Nothing much has changed as far as the tone of the movie goes, but it still delivers on the things it does right.<br/><br/>1. The initial plot involves Deckard Shaw's (Jason Statham) quest for revenge against Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) for the crippling of his brother Ian (Luke Evans). This should have been the major following of the film, however it diverts into something irrelevant and confusing. Shaw somehow has a lock on Toretto and finds him at every turn, yet Dom decides to go in search of a device that would allow him to locate Shaw instead. The film uses this second-hand plot in order to travel to exotic locations to progress the film. Even though it's intriguing, it's completely pointless.<br/><br/>2. Jason Statham was perfect casting for the main antagonist, yet the inclusion of Djimon Honsou and Ronda Rousey are unnecessary and terrible (respectively). It's quite obvious that Jason Statham is known for being an expert martial-artist in real life and it mirrors his character in the film. Neither Dwayne Johnson (Hobbs) nor Vin Diesel (Toretto) can match his skill even in the film, but somehow they manage to get the upper-hand in their fight scenes. This is hard to believe among the many other things that one needs to suspend his/her disbelief for. <br/><br/>3. The action is impressive for the most part, but the movie borders on ridiculous for the most part. I can stomach the set-pieces throughout the film, that is....until the end. This is where the 'Mission:Impossible' films will always rank higher than these, cause they never fall into the 'goofy action' territory. Only in a different world would someone walk away from a tumble down a 30- story cliff or parking garage. It seems Formula-1 racing doesn't exist in this world, cause if it did, then those drivers would undoubtedly be the best, not a bunch of criminal street-thugs with toy cars.<br/><br/>The movie concludes on an emotional note as it says farewell to Paul Walker, due to his untimely death during production. Basically, I'm kinda bored and exhausted by this franchise at this point, but if you love it......then by all mean......keep driving forward."

","After the events in 'Fast and Furious 5' where Dominic Toretto and his friends defeated terrorist Owen Shaw in London they thought they could finally relax they didn't count on Owen's tougher brother, Deckard, a former SAS soldier who is now out for revenge. He has already killed Han in Tokyo now he is after the others. One bomb puts Hobbs in hospital and a second destroys Toretto's house nearly killing him, Brian and his family. After Han's funeral Dom goes head to head with Shaw but they are interrupted by a special ops force led by 'Mr Nobody'. Shaw gets away then 'Mr Nobody' explains why he is there; a hacker known only as 'Ramsey' is in the hands of the terrorist group led by one Mose Jakande and he wants Dom and his crew to get her back before the terrorists get their hands on her 'God's Eye' program a hack that gives access to all CCTV cameras which uses facial recognition to find anybody in minutes. If Dom gets her back he is promised use of God's Eye to find Shaw. Of course it will not be easy; they will have to parachute, in cars, to a remote road in a Caucasus Mountains; jump between building, in cars, in Abu Dhabi; and finally back to Los Angeles where Jakande is coming after them with a helicopter gunship and drone equipped with missiles not forgetting that Dom and Shaw must face each other once again.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of over the top action then this is the film for you; a minimum of time is spent to explain what is going on before getting into the nearly nonstop action. Expect numerous explosions, car chases, shooting, fights and some exciting (CGI assisted) stunts one couldn't expect a stuntman to jump a car between the upper storeys of three skyscrapers! It isn't just about the action; there is also a solid cast who have developed a great chemistry over the course of the seven films. This is particularly true of Vin Diesel and Paul Walker as Dom and Brian; this leads to a poignant farewell for the later character as a tribute to the actor who tragically died during filming. The rest of the regulars were on good form to and fine performances from new-comers too; most notably Jason Statham who is great a Deckard and Nathalie Emmanuel who impresses as Ramsey; I wouldn't be surprised if they return in later instalments. Overall I'd say this was probably my favourite 'Fast and Furious' film so far; the action was great and the characters are people anybody who has watched the whole series will care about."

"LadySailor1975","8","1","4","23 May 2016"," Best One Yet
","I have seen all the F&F films and love them all. The only thing I could ask for is more Mustangs (my favorite car); especially either a Roush or Saleen Mustang.<br/><br/>The action in this one was very over-the-top, which made it more fun. The addition of Kurt Russell as Mr Nobody was brilliant; Russell can NOT make a bad movie, no matter what. I have liked him for years, since about Overboard. I also like Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez, and Dwayne Johnson. I would, however, like to see a handsome actor with long hair, which I love on my men; preferably Scott Whyte or Jeremy Davies.<br/><br/>Of course, the have to love the fast and beautiful cars (most of them) and fun insane driving stunts. I am a big fan of cars, racing, drifting, etc; and this has led me watch the entire series over and over again. Again, I want some Mustangs added. There have been a few, but we need more. I also like Ford GT.<br/><br/>The loss of Paul Walker was a terrible tragedy and he will be missed in future F&F films. May he rest in peace. I will surely miss him. I hope his family finds peace.<br/><br/>I am not a fan of Ludicrous, but he still did a good job in his performance as Tej.<br/><br/>The few downsides or mistakes that I disliked were; one, when Mia says she is pregnant it is so early that you cannot see and this means there is NO way to know the gender of the baby; that takes about three months, not immediately; two, Russell needed more camera time; three, needs more Mustangs. Finally; I hate that all these movies depict only ""sexy"" super-skinny women in string bikinis and provocative clothes. Added to the women in the background, parties, and other events should be normal, realistic, and average women also; maybe one in a wheelchair or something; just to show that not all men are narrow-minded sex-hounds and don't expect all women to have perfect skinny bodies.<br/><br/>This may seem small, but I like realism to some extent and I noticed that when the house was blown up Mia screamed her son's name in panic; most movies say ""my baby!"" and that's a mistake. Using the child's name is what parents will do more than 96-percent of the time. Using the name personalizes and individualizes the child; even if the parent has only one child, they will most likely use the child's name, not ""my baby"" or ""my son"" or ""my daughter."""

","This time around, the villain from the previous movie, Owen Shaw, is in a coma and his brother, Deckard (Statham) swears he will avenge him. So he breaks into Hobbs office to download info on Dom's team. A fantastic fight between Shaw and Hobbs ensues.<br/><br/>Meanwhile Dom and co. are living the quiet peaceful life until Shaw blows up Dom's house and kills Han. During the funeral Dom spots a dark car and chases it. It's Shaw. As they are about to confront each other some special forces team shows up and Shaw escapes.<br/><br/>Turns out the guy in charge (Russell) wants to make a deal with Dom. Some terrorist has grabbed an unknown hacker who has created Persons of Interest's The Machine that spies on everyone at all times. He wants Dom to retrieve the hacker and The Machine, here called God's Eye. In return Dom gets to use it to track down Shaw.<br/><br/>The hacker is being transported in some convoy in the Caucasus. That leads our team to parachute in cars no less, and go after the convoy. They find the hacker who turns out to be some girl. In the process they have to fight the terrorist's men and even Shaw appears for no good reason. Some cool fights with Tony Jaa ensue as well as some wild gravity-defying stunts.<br/><br/>So know they have The Machine right? Wrong. The hacker girl has stored it in a drive and given it to some guy in Abu Dhabi. Off they go then. But the guy doesn't have the drive anymore but sold it (?) to some super rich guy who has installed the drive in his super car (???). So now the crew crashes a fancy party in a high rise penthouse where the car is kept (?). They are caught and skinny Rodriguez has to take a beating from Rousey. Meanwhile Dom and Brian have no other choice than to take the car and escape, flying from one building to another and another.<br/><br/>OK, now they have The Machine, or is it Samaritan, and they track down Shaw. Shouldn't be too hard to grab him. But he's super special forces, and ambushes Dom's crew and the special ops guys and grabs God's Eye in the process.<br/><br/>Now our guys will try to set a trap for him in a LA. He does go for it and so does the terrorist who goes after them with a military chopper and a drone, while Brian has to face Jaa and Dom and Statham finally get to beat each other up. Hobbs, who been in the hospital all this time makes also appearance in Rambo fashion in the end.<br/><br/>Yes, there's a lot of story in the long Furious 7. So much that it could easily have been turned into 2 movies. Or they could have ended it after the Caucasus adventure.<br/><br/>This installment benefits greatly from director James Wan, someone who actually knows how to direct a movie. Some of the shots during the fights are amazing. All of the fighting scenes have some memorable moment and overall are really well done. It's not easy to impress with fight scenes these days, but Furious 7 does it. But it's not just the fight scenes. Granted that driving isn't much at the center of these movies anymore, what driving there is, is pretty good. And so are other stunts. The scene of Walker escaping from a bus hanging over a cliff is spectacular. So is the attention to detail as when a bad guy falls from his seat and nearly takes out Walker as he hangs from the bus's door. Or when Jaa and Walker race down stairs on a door.<br/><br/>Finally some of the cast has been trimmed, no Han, no Giselle, fewer other goofs, very little Elena. Instead they added a bunch of great villains--Statham who fortunately doesn't say a whole lot but looks menacing instead; they finally hired someone who can fight--Tony Jaa. And they hired someone who can act--Kurt Russell. There's Hounsou as well. It wouldn't have hurt to hire a second writer to add some dialogue. At least this time around, the dialogue isn't entirely embarrassing. There's still some silliness but less. Some of the humor does work though. No doubt there's plenty of room for more cuts in the cast--we could do without Brewster, Rodriguez, Bridges.<br/><br/>The unfortunate death of Walker would be a great opportunity to put an end to this series, while they're on top. Instead ""Diesel"" already warned us there are 3 more movies coming. Why? With Furious 7, the franchise grew up into a legitimate full-blown mega summer blockbuster. With that however, the prospect of where this series will go from here are dim. More and crazier stunts will drive it into lousy Michael Bay CGI territory. If they end up hiring more and bigger familiar faces, it'll end up being The Expendables On Wheels. I just hope they find the strength to not hire Bruce Willis. If they keep traveling around the world for missions it'll look like and urban team version of James Bond. The next movie would be the right time to return to the roots and go for something smaller and tighter. If they keep Wan on board they may have a chance."

","Over the Top car stunts, combined with a great sense of fun, and fast paced action sequences make Furious 7 a great example of dumb fun done right. Perhaps the greatest strength of Furious 7 is that it takes the stunts of the last film and ups the ante even more. Even more impressive is that while the whole film thrills the part that will hit you the hardest is the unavoidable ending. Which is what I want to focus on, yes the films funny, yes it's fast paced, and yes it over does the family themes, but the ending of this film as I'm sure you've heard, if not seen, is what makes this film so good. Being a filmmaker your single greatest achievement is to make an audience feel emotional, whether it be sad, really happy, shocked (not gore shock, but shocked by the plot), or any other great emotion. The ending of this movie makes just about everybody feel something, which is a massive accomplishment."

"dreamtakers","8","1","4","18 April 2015"," For Paul.
","I'm an avid fan of the Fast & Furious franchise and even more so since Fast Five was released. Paul Walker's passing have left me stunned and saddened beyond measure and left me wondering on how Furious 7 will turn out with his absence. The end product has turned out pretty good as I imagined it would be. James Wan (of Saw, Insidious and Conjuring fame), with his fresh take on action movies, has created a bigger, better, faster and louder movie than its predecessors. The movie starts off with the introduction of the new villain, Deckard Shaw (Jason Staham), the big brother of Owen Shaw who appeared in the last two movies. Deckard Shaw's mission is to eliminate the people who are responsible in the downfall of his brother. Furious 7 is all brawls and bangs and jumps right into action right off the bat. Agent Hobbs discovers Shaw hacking into his office computer to retrieve information about the crew. We are greeted with an intense battle between Agent Hobbs and Shaw, which sees Shaw succeeding in injuring Hobbs with explosives.<br/><br/>The original crew is back once again with their familiar faces and kick-ass energy. With Hobbs out of the picture, they have to hunt down Shaw on their own. Shaw has blown up Dom's house via a bomb package and killed their crew member Han, reiterating the need to track down this dangerous man as soon as possible. Deckard Shaw, however, is a lurking shadow and virtually untraceable – that is, till they met Mr. Nobody and Ramsey the Hacker; in addition to having their hands on ""God's Eye"". However, things went South at an alarming pace. Shaw has formed a secret alliance with a terrorist who is eager to coerce Ramsey into helping them control the ""God's Eye"". Furious 7 delivers a non-stop action fest in its two and a half hours entirety. Bountiful car chases, death defying crashes, leaps between fast moving vehicles, crazy shooting and colorful explosions ensure viewers that there is not a dull moment. There are also many fancy camera tricks used by Wan that I really like. The most memorable action scenes would be the ""car drop from sky"" over Caucasus Mountains and ""flying car jump"" through the magnificent Etihad Towers in Abu Dhabi. How very creative, insane and ridiculous.<br/><br/>Diesel, Walker, Rodriguez, Tyrese and Ludracris shine through their roles and display solid acting. As always, Diesel plays the cool, headstrong leader, with Walker as the equally strong and fearless sidekick, Rodriguez as the tough cookie, Tyrese and Ludracris as the witty, bickering old ""couple"". Nathalie Emmanuel did a decent job as the sexy and smart hacker Ramsey and Kurt Russell as the mysterious yet helpful Mr. Nobody. Staham's good as what he does, playing the elusive, gun-wielding, grenade master Shaw. Johnson has his share of limelight by appearing at the final hours to save the day as the last minute hero. Furious 7 has its touching moments. When Letty painfully clutched at an unconscious Dom and recalled her old memories, I almost shed a tear. The final beach scene that bides farewell to Paul Walker and character Brian is beautiful and simply perfect. The gazes written on the faces of every crew member as they look upon Brian and his family is a mixture of emotions – pain, sadness, longing - as they say their final goodbyes to their close friend and brother-in-arms. ""For Paul."" These two simple words shook me to the core and brought me a new wave of sadness all over again. I cried.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, Furious 7 is a popcorn fest, with its galore of fast cars, hot chicks, high octane action but also serves as beautiful tribute to the late Paul Walker. Non-action fans may not appreciate the movie as the stunts are over-the-top and breaks every law of physics known to mankind. You just have to suspend your disbelief and stop questioning whether Vin Diesel is a human or android in order to fully enjoy the movie. Watch the movie, for the memory of Paul."

The car chases (even though at times you must suspend your disbelief) are incredibly well done. The scene with the car jumping through all 3 buildings was amazing to watch! The fight scenes were a little disorienting, I didn't like the camera spinning as it took me out of the moment. Michelle Rodriguez is one of my favorite actresses, so watching this fight was pure excitement for me. It would have been better to see that fight without all that camera flipping.<br/><br/>That was my only true issue with the movie.

"lesleyharris30","9","1","4","17 April 2015"," A Perfect Finale for Paul Walker,
","Furious Seven is a fantastic movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It is without a doubt my favourite movie in the franchise yet, it has all the fun action and chemistry between the cast that you would want, as well as a strong storyline that keeps this series moving in the right direction. Another thing that makes this movie so great is that it is a perfect send off to Paul Walker, I was very nervous when I heard they were still going threw with this after his death, but after watching it I can see they knew what they were doing, they wrote out Brian O' Connor in a very true and sincere way, the last scene brought me to tears and they couldn't have finished it any better. I don't mind if they make more movies, and I feel like they will, but if they don't that is fine to me, the film ends in a way that we know where all the characters are going, and another installment dosen't feel necessary, but if they do they will have a high standard of work to try and improve on. Action packed, fun and emotional, I would recommend Fast & Furious 7 to anyone looking for a good action or crime film. <br/><br/>The brother of an old enemy of Dominic and his crew is seeking revenge, bringing the team back together as they put their entire lives at risk. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Vin Diesel Worst Performance: John Brotherton"

","Let me just start off by saying that this movie defies logic and rules of physics. People falling from heights and escaping with just a bruise, the villain showing up in every single scene (I mean how the hell does he know when and where to show up every time), cars FLYING, people breaking a cast simply by sheer force of squeezing their muscles really hard, people surviving grenades tossed right at their feet, people surviving a whole building collapsing on them and not have a single scratch on them, cars falling from a mountain and get crushed yet everybody in it survives, the absence of government/military during a terrorist attack. I mean, whatever impossibility you can think of, this movie did it. So if you are the type that goes 'nah this ain't possible' or 'what a bunch of bullocks' then you might not enjoy this movie at all. But if you are like me, who enjoy any kind of action no matter how unreasonable as long as it is executed perfectly, then this is the movie for you. The four main characters: 'Vin, Jason, Paul and Michelle' Kick so much ass and do it all by hand to hand combat in scenes that were very well directed. The scenes that didn't involve people fighting to a pulp had cars - duh. You'd think that by the seventh movie they would be out of ideas for car stunts. But no, much like George Clooney, it gets better with time. <br/><br/>P.S, welcome Jason to the Fast family. <br/><br/>Finally, the tribute. Getting in, I only knew that CGI Paul was used in the final scene, but in reality, CGI Paul was used in almost half the movie and I didn't even notice. The final scene is a beautiful tribute to him, I don't think there was a single dry eye in the theater. You can tell that the only reason they didn't chose to kill the character off is not because of the fans, or the movie, or the money .. but because of Paul Walker. Some other shows/movie decide to do that (kill off a character) once an actor dies such as Glee and Big Bang Theory (as a recent example) and some do not address it at all (like Dark Knight). I am glad that they didn't do that, watching Brian get his happy ending gave me a sense of solace.<br/><br/>If you enjoy 'crazy' action movies, then this is the movie for you. A highly entertaining film that many people of different ages can watch and enjoy. Be prepared to get a box of tissue for the ending scene."

","""Furious 7"" delivers what I've come to expect from this series: style, fast cars, sex appeal, humor, and enough cheesy dialogue to make a delicious fondue. However, what sets this movie apart from the rest is the truly genuine heart of it all; the ""seasoned"" characters all display raw emotion that I can't help but think was fueled at least in part by the tragic circumstances surrounding the creation of the film. The ongoing theme of ""family"" envelopes these characters, and indeed it should considering these actors have been portraying these characters together for the better part of 14 years. I saw the film as a joyous celebration of the franchise and the people who've been involved with it for so long; because of this, I am more than happy for forgive some of the film's truly over-the-top silliness...regardless, I was grinning from ear to ear the entire time.<br/><br/>Let's get this out of the way first: in my humble opinion, Dwayne Johnson and Kurt Russell damn near steal the show in this film. They portray their characters with such gleeful fervor and an overt self-awareness that I was simply left wanting more from them. Tony Jaa deserves a mention as well...his athleticism is truly a sight to behold. <br/><br/>Now, as I said before, the cast we've come to know all play their parts very well. I would have loved to see a bit more, I don't know, RANGE from Vin Diesel (his deep monotone utterances started to wear on me after a bit), but alas such is the character of Dominic Toretto. Michelle Rodriguez truly surprised me in this film...one scene early on between her and Vin Diesel shows a very mature and skilled actress, an unexpected departure from her usual ""tough girl"" persona. Tyrese Gibson, in my opinion, continues to improve as an actor, and his character has been toned down quite a bit, but in a good way -- he still provides a lot of the movie's much-needed comic relief but his awkward and forced ""street lingo"" has been replaced with much more natural sounding dialogue. Jordana Brewster does well with what she's given, and you can still sense a deep chemistry between her and the film's most important character: <br/><br/>Paul Walker's Brian O'Connor. <br/><br/>It's honestly hard to tell which Paul we see on screen is the actual person and not his CGI face on another person's body...but there are a few scenes that prove truly how much the actor had improved since his first ""Fast"" outing. There's so much to say about the man, most of which has already been said...I was confident that director James Wan was going to handle the sendoff of Paul's character with grace, and I can honestly say my expectations were greatly surpassed. No spoilers here; all I will say is that I could not have imagined a more heartfelt, respectful, and beautiful tribute. You will not leave the theater with dry eyes."

"MovieNinjaGuy","10","1","4","16 April 2015"," Stunning film. Masterclass in film making
","I thoroughly enjoyed Furious 7. I knew this would probably be quite good as it seemed to continue on from 6 quite well and there were already some favorable reviews before I went to the cinema to see it.<br/><br/>Sure the action scenes are ridiculous, over the top and often impossible and there are countless of clichés here and cheesy one liners. However that is exactly what I want, but these need to be delivered convincingly and with a good heart to be worth my time. <br/><br/>You can expect amazing action sequences that have a very realistic look and feel I think (even if these are actually impossible). It is very obvious most of the stunts and action sequences are actually real and that digital effects have been used to enhance these rather than generate them from scratch. The latter just never works well I think or gets boring to watch as a translation of the exact physical world seems to get lost (things like Transformers, it just doesn't matter what the hell happens sometimes in those films or compare Man of Steel to the Dark Knight trilogy for example, real is just better).<br/><br/>I've seen people write Furious 7 gives driving films a bad name etc and that things are just unbelievable. I don't go to the cinema expecting a two hour realistic Formula 1 race (which BTW is quite boring to watch I think - coming from a once F1 fan). Other people love complete fantasy such as Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings. I don't. I like it when films force you to have some suspension of belief but are at the same time based on some logic and physics. In there sure Furious 7 stretches the boundaries but to me it never got boring or unbearable to watch or anything. I wanted to know how it all played out and was quite overwhelmed with the amount of set pieces included in the film and often the climaxes making this film seem like a trilogy of events in its own right.<br/><br/>To me there was a perfect blend of action, story and new ideas to keep me longing for even more F&F in the future. On top of this the chemistry between the actors works so well making them indeed seem like a family. I just hope they give each subsequent films as much thought and they don't start to give it to complacent film directors. James Wan has done a stellar job here and so has the rest of the crew and cast. Loved the fight scenes camera spinning. A great touch.<br/><br/>The Paul Walker tribute was perfect and the whole thing seemed so well handled. During the film I kept thinking any minute now Paul is leaving or something (I had heard they wouldn't kill him off) but I was pleasantly surprised to see him during the entire film. I know a lot of his scenes were completed by using stand ins and effects, never obvious to me to be honest. <br/><br/>Some people say this shouldn't have been released because of Paul's death etc but I seriously doubt that's what Paul would have wanted himself. Also it would have been crazy to have hist last work sit somewhere on a shelf and not be seen. He was an actor, an entertainer and in the entertainment that the entire cast and crew of Furious 7 created there is, I think, tremendous beauty. A good heart and exactly that is what is lacking in Michael Bay films post Armageddon in my opinion. It is that good heart that together with great actors and great stunts / effects (non digital generated but rather digitally enhanced) can together create a great piece of entertainment and feel good fun. You have to look back at Star Wars / Terminator 2 / Titanic / Armageddon to see movies on this epic level I reckon. Furious 7 is I think Hollywood at its best. A complete masterclass in movie making. To me it's the best thing since F&F 6 and the epic Disney trilogy that were Frozen / Maleficent and Guardians of The Galaxy.<br/><br/>I saw Furious 7 in 4DX and the seat honestly hardly stopped moving during the entire film. It really made you feel more involved in the action and even simple driving scenes when you can feel the car engine slightly. Perfect integration and I'd recommend it if you have the chance to see it in 4DX.<br/><br/>$800 million worldwide within 2 weeks. I can understand why. A thrill that is thrilling to be seen."

","Finally, I watch this movie. After hear my friends talk about it in social media, in front of me, see the media. And one reason I want to see Paul Walker in his last Fast Furious 'Series' #haha. Because of their many sequel. OK, let's talk about the movie then.<br/><br/>This movie opening by Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who beaten all guard and wreck the hospital only to see his brother Owen Shaw. Who didn't know Statham, who play in Transporter movie, familiar with chase and speed. He want to take revenge for his brother.<br/><br/>So, his first mission was to find who behind his brothers dead. So, he came to see Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson). He took all files of Torreto (Vin Diesel) guys. After he collect all data, he make problem by killing one of Torreto's crew and blew up his house. So, automatically it makes Torreto's angry.<br/><br/>Because of injury, Hobbs can't do anything to help Torreto. But, he found a new friend, Mr.Nobody (Kurt Russel) , who can give all facilities to help him find Shaw. But, first he must help him to find a tools 'God Eyes' which can find anything in this world. So, Torreto's crew must find Ramsey, who have this tools.<br/><br/>I really enjoy this movie. With their action, their drama, their speed, their fight, their cars, and the girls. Like the moment Torreto and Letty, Brian and Mia, confrontation Tej and Roman, their jokes. You will fully entertained by this movie. And About the CGI's people talking about Paul Walker, it so smooth, i really didn't find when the CGI start replacing Paul Walker. Even you're not follow the Furios movie, you will enjoy this movie."

There is a soul in it and all of us, fans, people, we loved this story, we loved Paul. His death was timely, his life was too short but he left a spark in all of his family, friends and fans. He was a great actor and an amazing man, and I am absolutely sure that the place he is right now is better than the one he left. So no, it's not just a movie with fast cars, good fight scenes and famous actors, it's a one lifetime. <br/><br/>Rest in peace, Paul William Walker. And be proud of your fellows, they did it great!"

With an all-star cast and some brilliant action sequences, 'Fast & Furious 7' is proof that certain franchises can continually make great movies. The most notable moment however in the entire film is the emotional and respectful ending during the send-off of Paul Walker, the film finishing with a montage of Walker in the previous six films, finishing with just two words, 'For Paul', this is the first time a Fast and Furious film has affected me emotionally, and it is arguably the best in the franchise.Furious 7 is set to be the largest hit for the Furious franchise yet; and rightfully so."

","Dominic Torreto's (Vin Diesel) team is back in action to take on Owen Shaw's ""necessary evil"" older brother Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who is out for angry an vengeance after Toretto throwing Owen Shaw out the cargo plan in Fast and Furious 6, paralyzing him and ruining his plans for world domination.<br/><br/>The entire cast is back in this high octane, fast paced-adredaline, thriller, even Hector from Fast and The Furious made a cameo appearance to show to the audience that the producers of the franchise are wrapping this one up tight to make this last movie a memorable one for the ages. The plot is fairly easy to follow as you jump from one car to the other to keep the action going, literally. What makes the plot move along is the sound track, with smooth transition of up beat EDM at social settings like a party, to the good feel of hip hop music that hits the heart hard. The score of the film is amazing as well, keeping you on the edge of your seat that compliments the cinematography of the film as if you are in the car with the characters, flying off cliffs and free falling out of a plane.<br/><br/>Family is a frequent word used through out the film to set the theme. Toretto heavily emphasizes to Brian O' Conner, that family is everything and that you do anything to protect your family; that it's not about the cars, the girls, the money or glamour in life, but about keeping the family together no matter what stands in the way. The team is loyal, selfless, and in a literal sense they are risk takers, willing to do anything to get the job done. <br/><br/>Finally, this film is a heart-warming tribute to the actor Paul Walker, who died towards the end of the shooting of this film, but thankfully the editors and producers of the film did an outstanding job of ending the film with out having to find a replacement for Paul's character Brian (Paul Walker). His brother, Cody Walker was a grateful help to do any voice over or filling in scenes that weren't quite ready for the final cut. It is a weird, but good feeling when watching this film that you don't realize that this actor, Paul Walkler had such an impact on people's life because you got a sense from hearing stories from the actors, reading about this charity events, and his acting that he was a good person. The end of the film, with the song See You Again by Wiz Khalifa feat Charlie Puth, was a memorable and fantastic way to end the series of Fast and Furious. I would like to congratulate and thank all the people who were involved making these fun, fast, paced films for audiences to enjoy, not only in the U.S., but around the world as well."

Admittedly some of the chases are frenetic and shot that way, think Doug Liman and the Bourne Identity fight scenes. This only makes me excited to see the extra footage on the bluray.

"RforFilm","10","1","4","8 April 2015"," With with right set of hands on the ignition and an acceleration for car stunts, Furious 7 takes the franchise to unbound heights.
","Last year, the world lost actor Paul Walker. His persona carried plenty of charisma that belonged in action movies. I place him within this genre as I haven't seen enough of his other work to make a fair assessment. Work like Brick Masons and Eight Below are not the best examples I can give, but they did prove that the man could carry a story throughout. He'll be remembered for his contribution to The Fast and Furious series; a series that I doubt anyone in Hollywood would have bet that this would go beyond it's street racing roots into something far larger.<br/><br/>As said, the first film has it's moments, but it's nothing like future sequels that would take the problems I had, fix them and yet keep what it's most famous for; car stunts. Car action movies have been around forever (Smokey and the Bandit, Cannonball Run and Death Race 2000 come to mind), but Fast & Furious, Fast 5 and Furious 6 have now established the franchise as one of the most successful blockbusters and perhaps even one of the best action movies ever. Somehow, the makers of the latest movie figured out how to work around the death of Paul Walker and deliver us Furious 7, my new favorite of this continuing series. <br/><br/>After the events in London (Furious 6), Dominic Toretto (played by Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (played by Paul Walker) and the rest of the crew have returned to Los Angeles to settle down and live like the family they've always wanted. Unfortunately, Luke Hobbs (played by Jason Statham) is the older brother of the previous film's villain and he's out for revenge. This leads to fellow crewmember Han's death in Tokyo (another previous film) along with a planted bomb that nearly kills the crew. <br/><br/>Toretto goes after Shaw and engages in a fight, but is beaten by the latter's martial art skills and manages to slip away as a covert ops teams comes in. Led by Frank Petty (played by Kurt Russell), he makes a deal with Toretto that should he and his crew manage to track an evil warlord, he will help find Shaw again. Toretto agrees and his team head for the Caucasus Mountains where they fail to get the wanted warlord, but manage to rescue a hacker named ""Ramsey"". They then go to Abu Dabi to retrieve the ""God's Eye"" software that could track the people their looking for. With each new location comes a test in physics and awesomeness with the continuous car stunts and kung fu fighting.<br/><br/>You would think that it would be easy to compare this to the continuous nonstop dumb action from the Transformers, but I would actually put this along the sleek coolness nonstop action of James Bond. Furious 7 somehow keeps it's car stunts from becoming boring and even manages to make me jealous. As I sat munching my pop corn, watching Vin Diesel crash his car through two skyscrapers, I got lost within the excitement, wishing that I could do all of this even though it's probably impossible by the laws of physics. <br/><br/>The story is also pretty goodor at least as good as this kind of movie will get. It may be a revenge story and something that's nothing groundbreaking, it really is like a James bond movie with it's exotic locations and further use of high tech weaponry. Perhaps The Fast and the Furious will leave a mark on Hollywood Blockbuster history after all. Finally, the tribute to Paul Walker in the end is beautiful, fitting, and something that I will not give away.<br/><br/>I'll give this ten supercars out of ten. Furious 7 is the super charged car ride you want, the revenge thriller you want, the far out travel story you want, and most importantly, the emotional Paul Walker tribute you'll want. Grab your keys and get to that theater!"

The final scene and tribute to Paul was very fitting and very emotional to watch, honestly almost bringing me to tears, which doesn't really happen with films.<br/><br/>The film managed to be as funny as ever specifically the character Roman played by Tyrese Gibson, while keeping to the overall action theme. <br/><br/>How they finally after all these years connected Tokyo Drift back into the franchise was nice to see, tying up any loose ends. Although I loved the film it was not my favourite of the franchise as at times it drifted too far away from the theme of cars, and became more like a Mission Impossible or a Bond film. Particularly the final 3rd of the film. <br/><br/>Great work was done by the editing/CGI team in the scenes after Paul's death as it was flawless work that looked exactly like him. Well done to Paul's brothers also for filling the void he left and helping finish the film. <br/><br/>I would have loved them to go back to where they originally started and done more scenes like those from the first films.The hundreds of street racers in the garages for example, one of my favourite scenes from any film I have watched.<br/><br/>Great film all around."

If anything, this movie pays a lot of respect to the first. Sure the effects and outcomes of action were way over the top. But it didn't pretend to be realistic. It was purely for thrills. The budget of this movie was obviously carved out nicely. People expected gratuitous action sequences to close out the series. I couldn't imagine getting caught up in some lame ""story"" and then after 2 and a half hours sitting in my chair thinking to myself, where was the finale?

With this movie they've put an amazing, breath taking, pulse raising, touching, loving, heartwarming and tear raising end to the end of Paul Walkers movie career.

Have to admit that it was Fast and Furious series which showed us the unseen fast cars, American Muscle power, Classy Drifts, Drags, cop chase and crazy plans of robbery. <br/><br/>To start with, it gives me Goosebumps to see Jason Stathom to be part of the crew, Stathom(Shaw) plays the role of a big bad brother of Owen Shah who was hit by the Dom crew in the last edition. His motto is plain and simple.. To destroy Dom's Family.<br/><br/>There is another group of gangsters just to keep them in the game who kidnaps Ramsey( a lady hacker role which Deepika Padukone had refused) who has invented 'Gods Eye' a surveillance/tracking device. Kurt Russell played as Mr.Nobody has a job for Dom and the crew to save her. As Dom says 'this time it ain't just about being fast' which explains there is lot more than just a drag or drift, A sky dive of cars to touch down the unreachable roads, breathtaking run of O'Connor from the falling bus and Letty's full drift to pick him up.. Goodness I was on the edge of my seat. Not to forgot Gibson's humor makes you laugh out every moment. Post Ramsey rescue, they pull off to Abu Dhabi..to get the chip from a trustworthy friend... (remember Joy Lobo from 3 Idiots) Here starts luxury when the crew gets into the most secured towers to steal the chip. Just forget all the laws of physics and watch this scene for the classiest car jump ever in Hollywood. The Lykan HyperSport $3.4 Million was worth every penny to be jumped from the triple towers. With the help of Gods eye Dom finds Shaw and gets rattled by the Gangsters looking for the Gods eye. The crew gets back to their own lands for the final battle against Shaw and the gangsters. The moment Dom steps inside his own garage you will lean forward and whistle when he uncovers the epic Dodge Charger he is been carrying all through the series. <br/><br/>The final battle Dom vs Shaw -- The Battle of the year which we have all been waiting for, Aston martin Vs Dodge Charger, the gladiator moment when both rushing into each other. Just when you get disappointed that Dom doesn't do a wheelie there it is .. Boom.. A wheelie just when its about to hit... No other movie in this world can give you this. A street fight with heavy rods suited the players better than a gun.<br/><br/>Gangsters vs the Dom crew - The Drone which follows up to kill Ramsey is a chase worth watching. Car to Car shift while it drifts though it looked impossible but shot well taken.<br/><br/>The Rock - Cant miss Dwayne Rock Johnson fighting Stathom and that one freaking ''rock bottom'' he smacks where the camera rolls the same way..Mind-Blown..Best rock bottom ever. <br/><br/>To the end - It's a respectful thing that the movie didn't kill Paul, he lives in everyone's memory as a Good hearted drive crazy cop. To be honest I din know they have cast his brother Cody as his Body double to complete the rest of the scenes after his demise, until I read about it post movie. Thanks to technology !!! Its truly emotional to watch the last 5minutes. <br/><br/>To rate - Though there is no much script in the movie which we cant expect in this genre, it kept me intact for every scene as its loaded with action. Not too many cars shown yet it dint make difference cos this time it was just not about cars. Kudos to the creative cinematography. Best dialogue of the movie - I am the cavalry<br/><br/>Future of F&F - Hoping they wont stop the series, Since Stathom can replace Paul's exit. <br/><br/>#PaulWalkerTribute"
"rogerdarlington","Null","1","4","4 April 2015"," My first F&F but certainly not the last in the franchise
","Between 2001-2013, the first six movies in this incredibly lucrative franchise totally escaped my attention but, on a wet and gloomy Good Friday in 2015, two young friends organised that we should see three new releases in one day and chose ""Fast & Furious 7"" to start the project. I found it utterly mindless but totally entertaining. The acting is wooden and the dialogue is dire (such gems as ""Let's do it!""), but it is an action-packed, adrenaline-pumping roller-coaster full of car chases, fist fights, and some breathtaking stunts with exotic locations and some scantily clad women for good measure.<br/><br/>The villain is Deckard ('deck' and 'hard' - get it?) Shaw, played by British 'actor' Jason Statham, who is upset that his brother was badly treated in the previous movie. So he is out to get the old crew led by Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Connor (Paul Walker) who find that they can turn hunted into hunter by accessing a super surveillance system called ""God's Eye"" that (somehow) has not yet been revealed to the world by Edward Snowden. The punishment that these adversaries can take and the feats that cars can apparently perform (leaping from one skyscraper to another is an special treat) are ludicrous but fun.<br/><br/>For fans of the franchise, a poignancy about this seventh outing is that, during filming, Walker was killed (by all things through a car accident) and how his loss is dealt with in plot terms will please the devotees."
"abouhelier-r","9","1","4","4 April 2015"," Furious 7
","Deckard Shaw seeks revenge against Dominic Toretto and his family for the death of his brother.<br/><br/>You know what's more surprising than there's seven of these? The fact that they got better! Especially the last two movies, which are both very well directed action movies. Here James Wan - well known for The Conjuring and the Insidious films - is taking over the direction. I was truly excited for Furious 7 and it is actually a lot of fun: it is a big unrealistic good time with cars flying out of air planes using parachutes, explosions, fist fights and there are all great things! However a part of me has to sit back but I came to the conclusion that some movies aren't meant for that, some films are just meant to be awesomely dumb. This film knows it doesn't make sense at all, we watch it just to have a good time and not to be the most realistic movie in a franchise and it does that very well because every time something happened I was like ""that's not possible"", while simultaneously I stepped aside and was like ""who cares, that's so cool!"". I was so pleased with the car chase scenes in particular. James Wan was able to get some more intense camera angles. Moreover, the production had to face a major problem when Paul Walker tragically past away, everyone was really sadden by that, myself included; which may explain why the plots seem very confused and different. It's almost like two very different movies in one. And YES! It is painfully obvious when cgi Paul Walker is around, you can just tell and it makes it a little bit awkward. Still I can't, in good conscience, say too many negative things about that because it's unfortunate but unavoidable. Most of the fans are going to be satisfied with this film. It is a fitting send off for Paul Walker character. In fact the final scenes, when Paul Walker longtime colleagues say their farewells while he still appears on screen with them, is genuinely moving. Once again they handled that the best way they could. They really think through it, found the best way to do this movie in a respectful way while dealing with this tragedy.<br/><br/>Furious 7 incorporates a lot of the things that people liked about the franchise before it was taken to a whole new direction: particularly showing these drag races that they did in the first movie. Fans come to see a red sport car (one so expensive only seven were made) be stolen from a billionaire penthouse in Abu Dhabi; to watch it burst through his windows, fly through the air and crash into not one but two skyscrapers. Anyone who can buy that bit of computer-generated thing should have no trouble believing Paul Walker is in this movie from the start to finish. There are a little too much heavy weaponry for my taste. Like Dom, I prefer fist-cuffs and car chasing, to apocalyptic explosions. It's a typical 90's action movie, not only because of the action in it but the dialogues! If the movie was actually made in the 90's, where it belongs Arnold Schwarzenegger would be in this film. Finally, this film is not as well formed as the physique of Dwayne Johnson, who gave this ensemble a much needed charisma boost when he signed on in episode 5. He has a likable presence as an actor and he made them way better than they could have been; but I was disappointed because he's barely in this one. He's got a short but cool scene at the beginning and at the end but that's it. Plus, Jason Statham as a villain is a fantastic idea, but he's too underutilised in this movie as well. He shows up only to cause problems while the bigger picture is happening and then he's gone. Apparently it's no longer enough that turbo-boosted muscle cars drive really, really fast. Now they also have to fly. <br/><br/>Overall Furious 7 is both a stupidly entertaining and amazingly ridiculous movie. But most importantly it is a perfectly fitting send off for Paul Walker character"
"kevinbui-56905","9","1","4","3 April 2015"," Amazing movie and truly the best fast and furious
","This movie exceeded my expectation and I am a huge fast and furious fan. All the action and drama wrapped up in a story about family was just amazing. The action and stunts involved in the movie took it to a whole new level and it was just fun to watch. I loved the way the movie focused a lot of the late Paul Walkers character and they did a very nice job with the cgi for scenes he was not able to finish before his passing.The ending got me good and it made me feel happy,,sad,and like all types of different feelings. The ending was the best part of the movie and it gave Pauls character a proper retirement out of the movie. I'm glad i watched it and i will sure as heck watch it again."
"Allen_The-Shep_Shepherd","8","1","4","2 April 2015"," Furious 7 Review
","My Thoughts: <br/><br/>First, let me say, I am sorry for the long break in material on the site. It has been slow for movie screenings, and I've been quite busy in real life. I will do my best to keep the page up to date, but I will be moving at the end of April, so I might be a little down until I get internet in the place.<br/><br/>But back to the movie review...<br/><br/>I have to say, I have loved the Fast & Furious franchise since the beginning (yes, even Tokyo Drift). And Furious 7 delivers everything and more. Dom and family are now back in LA where it all began so long ago, but things are now different. Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) still does not remember any of her past. Brian (Paul Walker) is trying to settle into married life, and he finds it a little chaffing. All of this quiet and walking down memory lane doesn't last long due to Deckard Shaw coming out for revenge for his now-crippled brother. At the beginning, it looks like he is just going to work his way through the Fast crew, but Dom gets some help from Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) and his black ops group who has been looking for Deckard Shaw. Before Mr. Nobody can help them track down Deckard, however, Dom and his crew need to do him a favor. There is a hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) who has wrote a program called God's Eye that can pretty much track anyone in the world; once Mr. Nobody has that, then he will help Dom find and take down Deckard.<br/><br/>This movie was excellent; if you are a fan of the franchise, you will not be disappointed in Furious 7. With them going back to Los Angeles, we get a trip down memory lane from seeing old sets that were in the first one as well as a few cameos from some of the cast that was there too. We also get to see how Fast & Furious Tokyo Drift now fits into the franchise, and we get a few cameos from that movie as well. I find it great that Vin Diesel and crew are taking the time to try to make all the movies and cast fit into the Fast & Furious lore that now exists instead of pushing them to the side and forgetting about them.<br/><br/>The action--oh my god! When you think that they have done everything they could have done with cars and action sequences, Fast & Furious proves you wrong, be it dropping out of airplanes or jumping buildings. Usually, I am one for nitpicking things that defy logic or physics, but for some reason, with these movies, I just buckle up and enjoy the ride because I know I am going to have one helluva good time. You will not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The fighting (which I think has now become a stable to the franchise since the addition of The Rock in Fast & Furious 5) is awesome to watch. This time, they have added Ronda Rousey and Tony Jaa to the list for some great, over-the-top fight scenes that you will not be disappointed in. One of the only negatives I can say is that Ronda Rousey looked a little stiff delivering her lines, but she makes up for it 100% with her fight scene.<br/><br/>Even though the last two movies had easter eggs during the credits, there is not one in this movie, so there is no need to stay to the end.<br/><br/>Last but not least: Paul Walker. I am not going to spoil it for people. It is an emotional time watching this movie as a big fan of this franchise to see them pay tribute to Paul Walker and give him such a beautiful send off. They were definitely tugging on my heartstrings towards the end of this movie, and one of my friends was actually crying.<br/><br/>My question to you guys: should they make a Fast & Furious 8? Vin Diesel and Tyrese Gibson have both come out saying that they want to do a Fast 8, but with the loss of Paul Walker, would the franchise be the same? What are your thoughts?<br/><br/>My Recommendation: <br/><br/>If you are looking for a movie that offers you high octane action and some great fight scenes then you will want to see this movie."
"roccop6","3","3","23","18 October 2015"," Really?
","Spoilers ahead... Just... REALLY? The action don't make sense, the writing is awful, the acting is a disgrace and well cars jumping through buildings, people surviving a fall of hundreds of meters inside a car that's rolling down a cliff, people getting from one car to another thought the windows while the two cars spin around one another in the middle of a drone persecution, a person that breaks his arm cast only with the pressure that his muscle provides, and why do you take a tech to track people through the internet with you to every single mission, it function through the INTERNET!!.

"sphanish","6","2","15","25 April 2015"," honestly i didn't get it
","A lot of people told me about this movie being really good and apparently it also lived up to its 'hype'. I'm not a big fast and furious fan but i had seen all of the movies in the series. I honestly didn't get it why everyone thought this movie was amazing i personally thought it was one of the worst of the series. not the worst but definitely in the bottom 3.<br/><br/>the plot of the movie was pretty bland on strongly relied on its caste to make it a enjoyable run and it totally did.performance delivered by jason statham, the rock and vi diesel were really good and made up for some really cool characters that i couldn't help but like. the co caste was also good and actors like Michelle Rodriguez, Paul walker and tyresse Gibson only help fuel the great ensemble of caste it already had.<br/><br/>The movie showcases a lot of exotic places like abhu dhabi and Tokyo which were pretty fun to watch and action was really entertaining too but along the lines of it loses contact with realism and ultimately turns the whole movie a lit senseless.<br/><br/>fast and furious was a fun movie to watch and would give the necessary adrenaline rush that most action movie lovers expect."
"kraemerj-86609","6","2","15","18 April 2015"," Not the best
","I love the fast and Furious franchise. They are unique movies that have managed to carry a compelling plot line through several movies, despite rewriting the continuity once some rather cool characters were introduced in Tokyo Drift. That being said I was very much looking forward to seeing Furious 7 but I came away feeling defeated? No. Maybe the word I am looking for here is uninvested. <br/><br/>After a week or two of thought it isn't the knowledge of Paul Walker's death that sours the movie for me. I think it mostly has to do with the change of directors from Justin Lin to James Wan. Lin had built up something spectacular, directing from Tokyo Drift all the way through Fast and Furious. Wan was not really able to take up the reins and steer the ship after the death of Paul Walker blew the rudder off. While set design and action sequences are fantastic and worthy of the cost of your movie ticket alone, the dialogue is severely lacking and everyone of the actors seems to be acting out of a sense of parody for the genre that the Fast and Furious franchise created."
"MartyScoreSaysSee","6","2","15","15 April 2015"," A fitting tribute to Paul Walker
","I believe the process for creating a Fast and Furious film involves thinking up ridiculous stunts, figuring out how to actually do them in real life, executing them in an incredibly awesome way, and then calling upon the writers to shoehorn it into the plot. <br/><br/>The stunts truly are great, though all the best are given away in the trailer. Many have been executed with less CGI than you might think, and look it. <br/><br/>The acting is as expected. I'm not sure how they landed Kurt Russell, but I'm interested to see him fight Helen Mirren in Furious 8. The Rock is in too few scenes and is, by tradition, sweaty in all the scenes he is in. <br/><br/>The story is rather poorer than expected, though it begins with a promising villain introduction and premise. Too quickly it devolves into a tale that a third grader would probably file away for future revision. The best case scenario would a be a story that neither helps nor hinders the movie's impression, but sadly it falls in the latter category.<br/><br/>The scenes where Paul Walker had to be composited in are very well done, and unnoticeable unless you're looking for it. The ending is a perfect and touching tribute, and very appropriate. The scene pays homage to Paul and sets up the Furious world that, sadly, will be worse off without him. Unfortunately, I was unable to properly enjoy it as someone was cutting onions in the theatre at the time."
"yaya119977","6","2","15","7 April 2015"," trying to be fair. (RIP Paul)
","So .. I watched this film by accident since the film I wanted to watch was removed for a new animation. It's hard to tell a story without spoiling the film. So all I am gonna say is. The story line involves revenge against the Dom.family and of course they all Respond. Whoever is left of them anyways. Mr Statham surely has his own charismatic appearance but I get the feeling the director was lost between making him the bad guy or just a good one cause.the HERO of the movie is the thrilling car chase scenes .. I mean think mission impossible only with cars involved you will get the pictures .. I think the movie that literally makes cars fly in the air is definitely a winner for cars lovers. For that part the movie gets the 6 stars for me. Cause for the acting the scenario and other non car chasing scene there is nothing to follow. Another good thing about the ongoing car action scenes is that they don't give a chance to think about the silly old school dialogue I heard in other scenes.<br/><br/>Having said that it is an enjoyable film for series followers and for those who want to watch an action film without thinking much<br/><br/>Paul walker. Everything I saw him on big screen I teared up a little. The tribute to him was quite beautiful.<br/><br/>Watch out for the gasping breath holding bus scene. You will know when you watch."
"fansafari","4","3","28","17 April 2015"," its only for the money ....
","I didn't liked the movie at all they lost it after fast and furious 4 in my opinion all the other movies they are about the money i liked the scene with Vin and Paul. I liked how they said goodbye ... But it was just very bad the story was ..... no words they shouldn't make a new movie but they will again only for the money ... Watch it if your a fan of the movies but i don't think you will like it a lot. I was expecting again more from the movie and in the end i was like why i payed to see this movie.... Vin played good and the other cast but the brother of Paul i didn't liked him so much i think he is not an actor (i read it somewhere)"
"agmoldham","4","3","28","16 April 2015"," Number 3 for me
","I saw a couple of the early Fast & Furious movies, but this is the first one I've seen in a few years. Was a little surprised about how many of the original cast are still in the movies. Having taken a look at some of the actors biographies this is even more surprising.<br/><br/>The fact that this is the first of the Fast & Furious movies I've seen in a few years indicates that it isn't a genre that I'm passionate about. The plot and script take a resounding second fiddle to the action. The movie follows the revenge of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) who's brother must have been killed by the gang in a previous movie. The action sequences are undoubtedly what the movie is all around. There is absolutely no doubt that if you loved the previous franchise movies you'll love this one as well!! Bearing in mind the box office figures it seems that there are plenty of people who love this movie."
"Jawillis93","3","3","28","14 April 2015"," Furious I didn't walk out
","This movie has drama in all the wrong places, when there is drama its corny and not believable. The action scenes are good, but overall this movie is a rental at best. Spending money on tickets and popcorn is a waste of time and money to see this at the movies. Furious not known for plots, has a weaker plot than a high school play. The director should of asked more from his actors and not let the mediocre performance go through to the final cut. The writers, what writers. There are many fights and not one drop of blood, not that I was wanting blood, but it lends to the believability or lack of for the fight scenes. Was the special effects guy on vacation, guess so, there's always catchup, which would have fit well into this lackluster direction. RIP Paul Walker."
"jtindahouse","8","1","5","4 November 2016"," Not like the rest
","I'd be the first to admit I'm not the biggest fan of the 'Fast and Furious' series. I've seen nearly all of them somehow and just never really enjoyed them. Cars do absolutely nothing for me and the rest of the action I often find bland and uninteresting. This one was unquestionably different though. The death of Paul Walker in 2013 shocked film lovers. He was never the best actor going around, but he had been in some fun films and played some entertaining characters. 'Joy Ride' back in 2001 (incidentally the same year the first 'The Fast and the Furious' movie came out) is a personal favourite of mine. Of course it was reported that he was halfway through filming 'Furious 7' at the time and the film went into limbo until a decision on how to proceed was reached.<br/><br/>If you had a crisis in the film making department, there are very few people I would rather have than James Wan at the helm to deal with the problem. The man has shown he is a class act. In a day and age when horror is all but dead, he has done the seemingly impossible and revitalised the genre with multiple franchises. 'Furious 7' is far from being a horror movie, and yet his film making capabilities continue to shine through. How they dealt with Walker's death, in regards to the film, was impeccable. If you didn't know going in that he hadn't been able to film half his scenes himself you would never have known the difference. I was quite blown away by just how well they did this.<br/><br/>The film itself was surprisingly enjoyable. The opening scene introducing Jason Statham was a piece of brilliance and set a wonderful tone for the film. The action sequences were entertaining and well shot, however they did go on very long and I feel a little bit could have been trimmed off these to keep the run time down. Almost all of the cameos were well done, with the one exception being Ronda Rousey. Her complete lack of acting ability were very off putting and her celebrity status brought nothing to the film. Finally, the touching tribute to Walker near the end was quite beautiful and a lovely send off for the man. Well done to all involved for handling a difficult situation with class and aplomb.<br/><br/>RIP Paul Walker"

Yay I admit it could've been better with the story line but all the action and the hot ladies and these supped up cars is what you get in these movies. This movie was flat out just action packed all the way till the end. The only scene that made me cry was at the very end. When they played that song for Paul walker and when they split up, that was a very sad scene. I would give this movie an eight because it is not as good as American sniper. That was a bad ass movie but I'll get to that later. I like the part when they all fall out of the airplane that was cool."

"parleon-thedon","8","1","5","18 April 2015"," Furious Seven - Review
","Get ready for things to become even more ridiculous. (note) I don't really care for the previous fast and furious movies. However, ever since fast five, I feel like this franchise is breathing new life into itself. (Fast & Furious) bracket: 1. The Fast & The Furious - don't remember 2. 2 Fast 2 Furious - like it as a kid but, when I grew up I wasn't so sure anymore. 3. TF&TF: Tokyo Drift - don't care 4. Fast & Furious - hate it 5. Fast Five - awesome 6. Fast & Furious 6 - best in the franchise with all that being said, what do I have to say about Furious Seven...<br/><br/>First off, if you're not a fan of this franchise, then don't go out and watch this movie; if you are a fan of this franchise, then by all means see this movie (plan, simple, and period). <br/><br/>I fell like this franchise is starting to fall down the rabbit hole. Things in this franchise are becoming even more ridiculous then with what had started in Fast Five.<br/><br/>Furious Seven rises the bar for what they had already laid out in the previous two movies but, I do fell like this one truly jumps the skyscrapers.<br/><br/>Furious Seven is so over the top, stupid, pointless, and ridiculous that I really did become tired with the movie during the third act.<br/><br/>There is so much action in this movie that I feel like it's way to much. The movie does slow down a bit and gives you a couple of stories that are pretty interesting, however, I feel like there's no real satisfaction with a couple of the conclusions to certain stories. (note) there is one story in the movie that I felt was perfectly executed and it did make me cry during the ending.<br/><br/>Lets talk about Jason Statham. I'm not really a huge fan of Jason Statham's work; You can say what you want about Statham's acting ability (he's not terrible at acting but, he's not great at acting also) but you can't deny the mans ability to kick plenty of a$s.<br/><br/>I was excited to see a true villain be apart of this franchise; if anyone could play a great villain I feel like Jason Statham would be one of those guys at the top of the list.<br/><br/>I feel like Jason Statham was underutilized in Furious Seven. Statham had his moments but, ultimately I feel like Statham's presence was worn out by the third and final act.<br/><br/>I really didn't have any major problems with Furious Seven because I knew what I was getting into. I knew what I wanted to see, I knew what was going to happen, and I knew what I was going to get... I just didn't expect to get this much of it (and to that I say wow). <br/><br/>Over all, I felt like there was way to much action, Jason Statham was underutilized, some of the story plots didn't have good payoffs (there was one that did), and the movie was just way to over the top. I see it... the Fast & Furious team are the Avengers now but with cars being used as their source of power.<br/><br/>I liked this movie and I had fun watching most of it but, I also feel like they should just stop making these movies before things get really out of hand."

They defeated an international terrorist named Owen Shaw and went their separate ways. But now, Shaw's brother, Deckard Shaw is out killing the crew one by one for revenge.

Torretto must reconvene with his team to stop Shaw and retrieve the God's Eye program while caught in a power struggle between terrorist and the United States government.<br/><br/>So, if you didn't watch previous Furious movies, you can still watch Furious 7 because the story is not that connected. I watched the first Furious movie and Tokyo Drift and now this. The characters are still the same: Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel), Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker), Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) etc. All of them did good. I'm not going to say great because the movie is filled with clichés and stuff. Like JeremyJahns sad, you can play a drinking game where every time Diesel says word familly"" you take a shot. Trust me, don't do it, you'll die.<br/><br/>The action scenes are great because this movie is all about action and race. They are exciting, fast and furious (of course). Car races are done good as well.<br/><br/>Soundtracks are done well. Everything fit.<br/><br/>So, Furious 7 is really good movie, not better than Kingsman, but better than Taken. I was fully entertained and I think this movie deserves a good rating."

","I just don't know what to say. the movie is just out of this world , the stunts , all the action and a bit of comedy makes it the perfect movie. really guys , I don't have the words to express how great this movie is................love the jet stunt ,, the drone ,,, VIN making Lamborghini scream over those buildings ,, Paul walker doing that bus stunt ,,, i don't know , i mean everything in this movie is just fabulous .

"Georgeqiaozihao","10","1","5","4 April 2015"," The Memories.
","I did not expect to be this touched, but by the end of this movie, all those memories kept rushing into my head and I couldn't help it.<br/><br/>I did not have any idea about how Universal would handle the franchise after Paul's tragic death, so I was really nervous at every turning point in the storyline and was afraid that the James Wan would give Brian O'Conner a convenient way of death. Thankfully, he didn't. <br/><br/>The long and winding California coastal road took Paul; in the movie, Brian O'Conner kept driving on this road that seems to be neverending by the sea, and slowly disappeared into the gold melting sunset. <br/><br/>Thank you Paul for all the good memories and may your soul rest in peace.<br/><br/>P.S. Stupid in a bad way = Transformers; stupid in a good way = Fast and Furious. I am looking at you, Michael Bay!"

","This movie has it all, one of the best furious movies, I feel. A must see for a fan or anyone who likes good movies. My 7 yr old was glued to the screen the whole time, and that is good for him. All I can say is America lost a great actor for shore. I can not wait till it comes out on DVD to see it again, and I hope they sell a set with all the movies, as I feel these will become classics for my children's children to watch in the future.The only complaint I could possibly have it that I can not watch it again tomorrow and that there will more than likely be no other furious movies in the future. Rest in piece Paul you have done your friends family and fans well with this movie."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","5","3 April 2015"," The absolute best thus far in its series and a great tribute to Paul Walker
","When a series hits theaters with an entry that has reached beyond two trilogies, it shows that something is being done correctly (and I don't mean straight to Direct-to-Video releases). Amazingly for all the flack the first number of films critics gave it, each entry managed to become better and better. All around they were good popcorn action flicks that kept things moving (rightfully so). However it wasn't until about Fast & Furious 6 (2013) that it felt like the story to these characters was beginning to grow into a powerhouse with real substance. This particular aura only became more potent with the untimely death of actor Paul Walker, who essentially was the core of it all. Vin Diesel was also the main character but Paul Walker's character was how it all began. To say that the last couple of films have been the best is now only an understatement. This IS the franchise's greatest output thus far and a satisfying closure for Paul Walker.<br/><br/>After Dominic Toretto and Co. defeated Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) in the last film, Deckard Shaw (Jason Stathom) Owen's older brother returns to finish the job. Unfortunately, capturing Shaw won't be any easier than tasks given before. After putting Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) in the hospital, Dominic and Co. are recruited by Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), a friend of Hobbs to bring Shaw in, which also requires a prior favor. The favor is getting a flashdrive with important info on it by saving a computer hacker named Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a ruthless arms dealer named Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). It is a lot to take in but it can be digested. Chris Morgan's screenplay is for the most part at the top of his game. The timeline is correctly working in order the minute it starts and continuity is kept tight. All main characters that have faded into the background remain; audiences just see less of them. All backstories and subplots are completed the way they should've been.<br/><br/>All actors are worthy of the role they play (including new additions). Nathalie Emmanuel plays her part smart enough to compliment Tej's (Ludacris) wits. Kurt Russell's big return to mainstream theater releases is also a grand welcome. Russell is able to play his character comically while also being serious. Jason Stathom also looked like he enjoyed his role. Considering he usually doesn't play villains, it certainly wasn't his usual typecast. Djimon Hounsou as the arms dealer was probably the only character that was the least interesting. He had a significant part; it just wasn't memorable. Every other main cast member to this film has mastered his or her role. One of the big reasons why there are no flaws in the main casts' performances is because of how real the relationships are. All the emotions shared on screen feel real because they are real. That means comical, serious, dramatic and heartfelt moments. The interactions are as authentic as they get. With only Paul Walker having half his scenes filmed when he passed, the end result is again only several times truer than they could have ever been.<br/><br/>Cinematography provided by longtime veteran Stephen F. Windon & additionally by Marc Spicer hasn't lost the touch. With sweeping wide panning shots of various landscapes from the Middle East to the city streets looks great. The action was well staged too. James Wan was a smart replacement for Justin Lin because of his experience with Death Sentence (2007). As ridiculous as the action keeps getting in the series, this was by far the most creative. So many things happen that many viewers may not expect (other than what the trailer showed). The choreography and special effects all worked well in the mix too. Viewers should not be able to tell what scenes Paul Walker missed. It's as good as Brandon Lee's The Crow (1994). You really can't tell. This shows that everyone in this production did it for Paul and it's sincere it in its delivery.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, even the music by composer Brian Tyler was an improvement. Unfortunately, for such a long running franchise there is still no main theme. Aside from this though, the action scenes do have energetic tunes to maintain proper flow. However, it is the emotional scenes either between Dominic and Letty or Brian and Mia (it's mostly for Brian though) that the cues Tyler creates for these moments that truly standout. Plus with some of the exchanges the conversations have, it hits closer to home because of the knowledge that Paul Walker is no longer around. If there's anything to say about the movie that doesn't feel right, it's the fact that so much destruction happens in all these recent entries that the physics do not apply anymore. Seriously, these characters are superhuman! Viewers can't even knock on Letty's amnesia or that no consequences come to these characters after all the destruction because if you're a fan for this long, nobody honestly cares.<br/><br/>Of all the installments before, it cannot be denied that this is by far its greatest accomplishment. In order to agree with this, you have to be a fan of the franchise or at least find them moderately entertaining; and to make it through 6 films before this, you must be dedicated. Its action is even more over the top than before with physics that still do not apply regularly but every other element overrules them by an enormous margin. Paul Walker's last film is a respectful and loyal knockout to the end."
"dacifu","1","2","16","20 May 2015"," Was Uwe Boll behind this? cause is one bad movie.
","Seriously!! This movie was simply awful. Unrealistic even for a film. A helicopter flying above Los Angeles and no government agency picked that up and do something about it. Explosions all over the city and you don't see one single police/military vehicle. Explain to me how a group of garage monkeys without any military background can survive all those attacks and military personal dies left and right. Toretto (Diesel) jumped in a car from the top of a very high building while collapsing. For some anti-physic law reason he fall on top of the wreckage. They pull him out of the car and has no visible injuries but appears dead. Walker's character start CPR (which by the way CPR does not restart the heart)but then he stop cause Toretto is freaking dead; however, Letty manage to bring him back to life with the power of love. The Rock saw the mayhem in the news while at the hospital. So obviously he suit up. WHy did he have his gear and so many weapons at the hospital. Everybody who ever been at the hospital for just one night knows how hard is to find your own underwear, let alone your entire wardrove, but he conveniently didn't have that issue. Then he stole an ambulance(cause after all the destruction there were no injuries and nobody was in need of one so he found one just parked outside the hospital with the keys in ready to go)and then he managed to find everybody and crashed the ambulance on a freaking drone while jumping head on from a bridge and sustained no injuries. The action was dumb. Tony Jaa was underused. How the heck did Jason Statham survived? again, with no visible injuries, not even limping. F&F 5 and F&F 6 were actually pretty good but this one was just an abomination. I have so many thing to say about it but I already spent too much time on this. The Paul Walker send of/tribute was very nice though. RIP."
"brent_or","4","2","16","17 April 2015"," Poignant But Franchise Excess At Its Worst
","The lifeblood and virtually only redeeming factor in this film-- aside from a couple of the car sequences--is the emotional backbone of character continuity. Elephant in the room, Paul Walker but also Diesel, Rodriguez, etc. Without that, this is just an absurd maelstrom of cars and bullets and buffoonery. Most of the action is just staged chaos, most of the humor is unfunny and most of the story is contrived setups for the action, as well as emotional exploitation.<br/><br/>Granted, one should not go into this film expecting anything different from all of that, but even so I think that this film can basically be filed under ""escalate by any means possible."" The ending hits the bittersweet beats that the audience expects, and that alone is worth something, but the couple of hours leading up to the ending constitute a a big, crazy mess, entertaining perhaps depending on one's tastes but not anything worth high praise. Take that for what it is."
"dxtrhllnd","5","2","16","13 April 2015"," So unrealistic and predictable i can cry
","As it's already said, tribute to Paul Walker is great! But, that does not mean that just because this is his last film deserves to get high scores.<br/><br/>I couldn't enjoy the movie, because i knew how every scene will end. <br/><br/>Another thing i hate about last few F&F movies is the fact that races are totally ignored and all over, story turns to action and fights that are unrealistic like WWE and destroys all the pleasure of watching as it was case with first three movies.<br/><br/>Tyrese Gibson is the reason I enjoyed the most during screening, and how it seems and the rest of the audience as well ... His jokes were the funniest.<br/><br/>However, it remains to me, a little faith that it will be yet somewhat corrected in the eighth part."
"alexpitiris","6","2","16","5 April 2015"," Quality keeps falling
","I am a great fan of Fast and Furious and I expected the movie to be as fascinating as it was advertised and said to be. I always enjoyed the emotional side of the film and the value of family that was behind the characters loyalty as well as the action. Although, I need to say that I was totally disappointed. We have all observed the small changes from film to film to the action scenes becoming more unrealistic and unbelievable but in this film we where left far away from reality. Cars were flying from planes and from skyscrapers to other ones while everything around them was exploding. And, don't take me wrong, I went to the cinema to enjoy the action – which the film was full of – but not like this. The car racing has been altered to 'flying and exploding'. And this has been obviously made to fill up the story. Our friends have become millionaires in the fifth film and there is no doubt that racing is no more needed for living. So now a new evil has come from nowhere to destroy their happiness. On the other hand the film maintains the funny side – and produces it even better – with numerous great jokes from the starting to the ending.<br/><br/>To conclude, the film is still a great full action-packed movie and every fast and furious lover will enjoy it. But to those who prefer a believable movie this one might end up being boring or even annoying. As far as I am concerned, the movie objectively deserves the 6 stars for the action and jokes though offered in lower than ever quality"
"king-bimur","5","2","16","5 April 2015"," Weakest film of Fast & Furious series!!
","I was eagerly waiting for this movie!<br/><br/>Actually this movie was one of my most awaited movie of the year besides .. Mi-5 , 007 and Avengers-2.<br/><br/>Anyways i was very disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>Let me tell you the reasons :-<br/><br/>It felt like Furious 7 was a superhero movie .. Jason Statham was a super-villain, And Vin-Diesel was SUPERMAN.No matter how hard they hit each other THEY won't DIE.Even Car crashes Can't kill them!! Way TOO many actors,With ZERO character development of Jason Statham!! LAME super-villain The story is very weak...Felt it was just written for STUNTS. You will see Vin diesel & his MUMBLING most of the time... Actors like Dwayne Johnson , Tony Jaa , Djimon Hounsou and LUCAS BLACK are totally wasted here! Stunts/Actions are so UN-believably over the top that it even beats Tamil/Telegu movie stunts/action!<br/><br/>The connections between the old films and the new films have previously been well thought out and well written ahead of time. In ""Furious 7,"" they just make stuff up, and attempts to extend the franchise somehow..<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" doesn't really work. The ""Fast & Furious"" franchise has always been silly, but for the first time in its 14-year history, it's really dumb.And the WEAKEST film of Fast & Furious FRANCHISE.<br/><br/>The franchise has clearly become Vin Diesel & UNIVERSAL's CASH COW.<br/><br/>The only thing i liked in this movie was PAUL WALKERS TRIBUTE..<br/><br/>My ADVICE : Don't waste your hard-earned money .. wait for HDRip/DVDRip/Blu-ray."

Letty's fighting skills were immensely improved and flying car was a bit too much. last part was way much better.

","Action packed right from the moment the ""Universal Studios Globe"" leaves the screen. This movie has a lot in store for fans of the ""Fast & Furious"" series. Highly anticipated due to Paul Walker's passing, this movie has been the perfect tribute to him! Apart from the Brilliant Babes, Remarkable Rides and the Climactic Clashes, what strikes most in the movie is the truth in emotion felt throughout the movie. The movie has a very tangled story-line which leads to pointless (at times) action scenes but all in all, its the perfect movie given the message and the history. What better way to give a perfect send off to Paul Walker?"

"justinwfirestone","4","2","17","12 July 2015"," Pretty bad movie.
","I appreciate it when a movie requires you to check your brain at the door, so imagine how much I might like a movie that requires you to check two brains at the door.<br/><br/>Full disclosure: this was the first of the Fast and Furious movies I've seen. I thought they wouldn't be my cup of tea. Meh. I was right.<br/><br/>Having never seen the other movies, I wasn't sure whether this group of heroes were supposed to be super-heroes or normal people. After all, they surely do things that aren't possible, like survive falling several stories from buildings or taking brutal physical damage in street fights. I was really impressed that no rocket could harm them, and bullet hits seem reserved only for extras.<br/><br/>It's hard to tell whether any of them can act, especially when given single lines that have none of that tongue-in-cheek guile that Arnold Schwarzenegger used to deliver so well. Specifically, Vin Diesel's stilted monotone confused me, because if he just slightly winked after each line, it would've been a comedic command performance for the ages. Sadly, the deceased Paul Walker is the only one who seems to have had any acting chops, and Kurt Russell gets to ham it up with glee.<br/><br/>I never learned how to drive a manual transmission, so watching a lot of clutch releasing and hard shifting was not as erotic for me as it was for the rest of the audience. The whole affair is certainly heteronormative, what with all the hot women scantily clad and the dudes competing for their attention. The movie fulfills all the requisite stereotypes, clichés, tropes, patterns, and formulas. The studio's algorithm knows how to make a movie.<br/><br/>Most problematic is not that the heroes could never survive or pull off any of their actions, but that their plans make no sense, and no one would act the way they do. This seems like a film wanting to make a new superhero franchise, yet the superheroes simply drive awesome cars really, really well. At 137 minutes, it runs about 37 minutes too long, and I almost left at the two-hour mark out of sheer boredom.<br/><br/>But I did stay to watch the ""tribute"" to Paul Walker, and although I believe a woman next to me cried a little, I had to stifle laughter at the horrible delivery of Vin Diesel, whose sadness of losing a brother belied the entire film's heterosexual vibe.<br/><br/>It's apparently okay to admit you love your brother, but only after he's dead.<br/><br/>Grade: -7."
"alindsay-al","7","2","17","4 May 2015"," a good action film that is enjoyable
","I will start this review by saying that this is the first time I have ever seen a full fast and furious movie so I didn't really care to see it that much. But word was buzzing about it so I decided to see it and I must say I enjoyed this film for what it was. Vin diesel, the late Paul walker and the rest of the crew go after the brother of their previous enemy who is looking to hunt them all down. While the US government gets the team to help them locate an item that can track down anybody on the planet. Now vin diesel is the biggest believer in this franchise and he is good in the role as the head of the family and you truly buy his role and you see him as a badass by the end of the film. Obviously allot of the talk was about how the film would cope with the loss of Paul walker and I think for the scenes he was in walker was great and even though occasionally it is obvious when he isn't there I think they did the best they could in a bad situation. I love Jason Statham as an actor and he was great in this movie too as the antagonist even though I do wish we had known more about his character but this film is long enough without it. Michelle Rodriguez was good in the film even though I haven't seen the previous ones I understood her individual story and liked seeing how she progressed throughout the movie as a character. The rock is back as Hobbs and he was great for the small part of the film he is in which sucks because the rock is one of he best things in Hollywood at the moment and they barely used him in this film. Now originally I just thought this was going to be a film where the team has to take down Statham Who is looking for revenge which would have been fine and when we see it it's good stuff. But the problem is that the film adds this completely pointless story about a piece of tech that the good guys don't even need so it comes across as half the The film is pointless really. There are some funny moments in the film with allot of funny dialogue but there is also a lot of cliché to the lines and you just shake your head thinking to yourself that you have heard these a thousand times. The style is a mixed bag, the hand to hand combat and most of the driving action scenes are great but the over the top ridiculous moments just really take me out of the film and make it seem like it is a sci-fi film because none of it could ever happen. I also want to give a shout out to a great tribute to Paul walker which was probably the best part of the film for me. Overall I had fun with fast 7 and even though it has its problems it does a good job at just being a fun film."

It's replete with corny one-liners that would make Schwarzenegger blush, and much of the dialogue itself is cringe-worthy. As the movies have gotten bigger, so have the casts, and this film is no different. We have the equivalent of guest stars in this film with people like Tony Jaa playing a lethal terrorist and Rhonda Rousey playing the head of the Charlie's Angels type security team in Abu Dhabi. Jaa holds his own, but Rousey is such a godawful actress, she can barely belch out her three or four words before she does what she does best, which is go toe-to-toe with Michelle Rodriguez in a girlfight.

","While the things happening in the first movie of the franchise were highly improbable, they were, mostly, possible. That was the most interesting thing, you were like ""that can't happen"", but after some thought you were like ""ahh, it actually could"".<br/><br/>By this 7. installment, all the reality is out of the window, going all the way through the windows of the surrounding buildings. It's way too much and leaves you wandering ""why?"". There are many ways to create suspense and thrill without resorting to such things. This is not a Sci-Fi movie. What's more, they did it before, so, again, why not now?<br/><br/>The acting is pretty flat, too. Sure, in this kind of a movie, what do you expect? Actually, by the 7. installment and ""everyone back together again"", you do expect more. Those are more experienced actors playing more experienced people. Yet, none of that shows, really.<br/><br/>Well, expect on Jordana Brewster. It's really amazing how much different she looks now. You may think she's beautiful or not, but she sure is hardly recognizable.

"dlancecarrington","3","2","18","24 September 2015"," Worst of the franchise
","I awarded this film 3 stars mostly out of respect to Paul Walker. Unfortunately, he's not in the film enough to elevate it over its cliché-riddled, cartoonish, incoherent final cut. Clearly, the franchise has run out of any credible plot lines. What is left is tired. Vin Diesel mumbling through his lines, espousing all things family has gotten old. Michelle Rodriguez is still suffering from memory loss, although it doesn't really add anything to the film other than to make it more frustrating. And, Dwayne Johnson takes muscle bound buffoonery to eleven. Nothing about this move makes any sense. Things happen for the sole purpose of setting up an action sequence. It's starts from the beginning, where Jason Statham shows up as the brother of the previous films baddie, Shaw. How convenient! Also, how lazy. Inserting Statham into the equation is a micro chasm of all that is wrong with this movie. Everything feels manipulated and artificial. Introducing the character of Hobbs in Fast Five was great. The chase that ensued was fun to watch, kept the movie going at a good pace, and kept all the characters involved. But, bringing The Rock back for the 6th film took the franchise where it was never meant to go. Somehow, a team of gear heads planning military style ops and having large scale shootouts is just plain silly. It's also not fun to watch. Everyone looks too old. Everyone seems like they're trying too hard to get their lines out. Ultimately, Fast and Furious 6 showed how far away from the original concept this franchise had come. Watching F&F 7 felt like watching an old episode of Scooby Do. I kept waiting for someone to come along and pull the mask off of Jason Statham to reveal the REAL bad guy. Who knows, maybe Scooby will show up in the next movie."

","Okay, so I've waited as long as I could to put up this review and I must start by saying that yes for what this movie is, it does compare to all of the others. So... here we go!<br/><br/>Furious Seven (2015) is in fact a fairly put together action packed movie with an all star cast, this film is also filled with everything that the average teenager would want to watch over and over. Furious 7 is the 7th addition to this ""let's go fast in expensive cars while going slow in front of hot girls"" film franchise; it's the perfect movie for junior high. For what Furious 7 is the film does deliver, it followed ""The Crow"" franchise and continues to deliver the same altered movie over and over trying to reach the success of the original and it will continue until the sales drop. Furious 7 2015 is your average film which claims to be a block-buster until you watch it, it's the same ole thing. It's like NASCAR, continue watching the cars turn left until you finally get dizzy or some action starts.<br/><br/>Yes I watched this movie and have watched all of the Fast and the Furious films, and not once has the layout or story delivered any different route, it merely delivers with a change up in actors and yet another villain to deal with. The acting in Furious Seven was as expected, the story-line for the most part was fair, and of course the action was unbelievable like in recent releases of FAF Films ""driving cars under big trucks""; the realism was there. lol"
"timvincent-90482","5","2","18","7 July 2015"," What happened?
","For those whom may be familiar but have not seen any of the Fast and Furious franchise, I strongly recommend you do not start with this film because it will almost definitely turn you off from what are a great few films. I've generously given this film a 5 star rating only for the decently exciting action sequences and the few actors and actresses that continued to portray their characters well. As for the rest, what happened? This film is about the older brother of Owen Shaw, that the FF team took on in the previous film, wanting revenge for the harm done to his brother. This new antagonists name is Deckard Shaw, the last film's ending reveals that the accident that killed Han, A FF team member, in the third FF movie was actually cause by Deckard Shaw. This movie pretty much starts from there and revolves around the battle between Shaw and the FF team.<br/><br/>Now I've seen all the actors and actresses in this film act very well in other films, so I tend to blame the poor acting on the director and script. Dominic is nothing like the character he once was, he's a completely stiff meat head that speaks nothing but cliché sentences. It's like the screen writer typed ""Bad*** one liners"", into Google and tried to find a way to fit every one of them in the script. I haven't seen Vin Diesel ever play such a paper thin, boring, predictable character other than Riddick, only in Vin's self produced horrible sequel to the first 2 films. (Pitch Black and The Chronicles were actually good flicks.) I could go on and on but to sum it up its a classic Hollywood case of, more boom(Explosions) and less substance. It's a disease that plagues some of the best franchises and struck this one right around its 4th movie, though only a slight case in that film, so it was still enjoyable.<br/><br/>Keep this in mind, I'm a fan of this franchise and of what its about. If anything my opinion should be biased in favor of this movie, but its really just that bad.<br/><br/>Lastly I'd personally like to say I'd like to see more of Sean Boswell in the up coming films. The first Fast and the Furious and Tokyo Drift are my favorite in the franchise. And after Sean's mentor(Han) was killed, his character only seeing 2 minutes of screen time in this film was a complete joke. Furthermore, so was the scene that explained Dom beat Sean in a drift race. Sean was DRIFT KING, Dom was in an old heavy muscle car and we have seen no experience with him in any actual drift races. This scene is synonymous for the entire film. Defy absolutely every piece of logic and realism to make Dominic Toretto look like the most bad*** man whom ever lived. Had they worked less hard on that maybe they would have made a decent film.<br/><br/>R.I.P. Walker"

"BuffyD","4","2","18","8 April 2015"," This movie died when Paul Walker did.
","The filmmakers did the best they could in gluing what pieces they had together, but the fact is, this is an incomplete movie that is unengaging until the final two minute Paul Walker tribute - which isn't ""really"" part of the movie's story proper. Of course, there was really no way around this. The series main protagonist is ""present"" in the movie, but is himself not really engaged in any of the movie's happenings. Whatever Walker's original story arc was, and whatever footage he shot for it was clearly mostly excised. Given that this was intended to be the 1st movie in a new F&F ""trilogy"" then this obviously had to be done, as there was no way there could ever be a continuance or payoff to the story arc without Walker. His arc is instead replaced by Diesel and Jordanna Brewster talking about how Walker wants to be a good dad and is 'over' being Fast & Furious as a setup for his eventual exit at the end... but he's not really involved in these conversations, as that wasn't the original plan.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, you can't simply remove the protagonist from the story and remain engaged. And make no mistake, though Vin Diesel has given himself top billing ever since becoming a producer on 4Fast-4-4ious, these films have always primarily been about ""Brian O'Connor's"" journey, with Toretto as the deuteragonist in the later movies. And when you remove Walker's character, all you're left with is ""spectacle"", and Vin Diesel trying to be Superman. Regarding spectacle, this movie has few equals. However, it's ultimately meaningless if your protagonist is disconnected from it and has no stake in it. Regarding Diesel, his character simply isn't interesting without Walker as a foil and can't carry a movie on his own. His only real character connection is to Letty. Han is dead, Roman & Tej had established relationships with each other and Brian O'Conner in 2Fast2Furious, but never really establish a rapport with Toretto. The glue of this ""family"" was Paul Walker's character, and now he's gone. Nobody wanted to see Diesel as an unstoppable action hero in XXX or Riddick, and it doesn't play here either.<br/><br/>Aside from the aforementioned issues which were directly related to Walker's death, this movie has a few more issues. The first of which, is that it totally glosses over the death of Han. His death and bringing justice to his killer is the WHOLE MOTIVATION for the larger story. I have a feeling this aspect may have been affected by Walker's death, as they didn't want to dwell too much on character who died in a fiery car wreck like Walker did in real life. However, it didn't do the story any favors to be almost dismissive of the incident providing the characters motivation. Furthermore, it didn't make any sense for Sean Boswell - who spent a whole movie being mentored by Han, and thus has the strongest connection to him - to only show up for a cameo and NOT to join the team in trying to avenge him. Wasted opportunity to truly incorporate Tokyo Drift in with the main series. Finally, Jason Statham is by far the biggest ""name"" to be cast as the villain in a F&F movie, and I feel like they kind of botched it. The movie goes off on a tangent with Djimon Hounsou and Statham sort of disappears and didn't get the chance to shine as the villain like all the lesser names in previous installments got to. Really, too bad. F&F needs to learn the ""Batman"" lesson that more villains isn't better. Furthermore, there's no point in bringing in badass Jason Statham if Toretto can just straight up beat him up. You've completely neutered his character, killed any dramatic tension and there's no point to even casting Jason Statham then.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion, the movie was irreparably harmed by Walker's death. But even if it hadn't, there still would've been several missteps in it. If the plan for the future installments is Diesel as Superman, just kill the franchise now. On the plus side though, the stunts and ""spectacle"" aspect of the movie was top notch."

Minor villains like arms dealer Jakande (played by Djimon Hounsou) were by far more interesting and the Dubai scene was unnecessary and dragged on for about 20 mins.<br/><br/>The final part was worthy of raising the score but not as much.<br/><br/>Over all, a very fun movie, an extremely well done fun movie."

","Furious 7 (2015) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>Seeking revenge for his brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) goes after the crew and this time both sides are wanting to gain access to a hacker who contains a bit of hardware that could change the game in regards to tracking people.<br/><br/>FURIOUS 7 has one major, major problem and it's the fact that it's nowhere near as great as the previous two entries. It's really amazing to see how far this series has come because the first movie was good, the second fair and after a horrendous third I had pretty much given up. Then the series got back on track and with the fifth and sixth films it pretty much was rivaling any action series out there.<br/><br/>The biggest problem I had with this movie, other than the rather unsatisfying ending, is the fact that these human characters were performing things that not even Iron Man or Thor could have done. I know all of the previous films had moments where you had to turn your brain off but I think a lot of the stuff here just crosses the line to the point where you lose connection with the characters because of the downright crazy stunts.<br/><br/>Now, that's not to say the stunts are bad or boring. They're far from that including the scene where the cars fall from a plane and land on a road where cliffs are everywhere the cars go falling. These scenes are certainly well directed, although there's way too much editing going on. I'm not going to spoil the ending but I think it was a tad bit unsatisfying and especially when the final stunt doesn't really stack up to what we've seen in previous movies.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriquez, Ludicrous, Tyrese Gibson, Dwayne Johnson and Paul Walker are all good in their roles but by this time there's no question they own the parts. Of course, Walker's death certainly changed how the film probably turned out but there is a nice tribute to him. Statham spends a bit too much time in a car when his specialty is fighting but he still adds a nice touch to the picture as does Kurt Russell in his part.<br/><br/>FURIOUS 7, as I said, doesn't reach the same levels as the previous two movies but if you're a fan of the series then you'll be entertained."

","Just came back from the furious 7 movie! One of the first screenings in the world.. bought my ticket like a month ahead.. here's my take on this.. this might contain some minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I was really hyped for this one and super excited.. I'm a real fan of this franchise.. with furious 6(sadly still) being the best.. <br/><br/>This movie had some crazy action sequences, some knee-slapping humor delivered by roman pierce(Terese Gibson) and some surprises like what tej(ludicrous) did when he had a little encounter with a guard..<br/><br/>First of the action was just amazing. The cars jumping' from airplanes, the cars jumping from buildings in Dubai and the whole action sequence in the city at the end was really cool as well. Tony jaa was really cool in this movie showing off his ninja-like skills and the WWE girl was amazing as well! <br/><br/>The actors were again fine. Im not waiting for Oscar-winning acting and you're not getting that from anyone. You could really feel some emotions flowing through the movie when Brian(Paul walker) came on screen. <br/><br/>Scenery and Camera-work/director: A new twist to the movie was definitely the way things were shot.. You really got some nice shots from abu dhabi.. and the cars jumping from planes was amazing as well! How The rock slam-dunked Jason into the table and the camera turning with them were those little things that a did like<br/><br/>But.. there were some flaws and a general thing that just.. wasn't fast&furious; The thing I have always liked in these movies was the team.. being close.. cohesive.. i felt something missing.. the rock coming in action really late in the movie.. Jason getting help from some random Mafia group.. Those things are what really took me out of not the movie.. but the franchise.. <br/><br/>This movie felt like a complete other movie and that's not what I came for.. After fast 4.. fast 5 was a perfect sequel.. became my favor one.. than fast 6 came out.. even more so.. because the family became more tight.. close.. the began a certain bond and when you were fighting you saw that.. My favourite scene out of the whole franchise.. the whole plane action sequence with a certain highlight(Dom getting pushed by that enormous steroids guy and then he got punched by the rock and the rock and Vin diesel were standing there..). specific moments like that are the ones I missed.. Something felt off.. it didn't feel like a perfect sequel.. they could've done more with Lucas black(like actually show the freaking' race between them).. i mean in fast 5 and 6 you at least had the police-car race and the Vin against Michelle Rodriquez race. <br/><br/>A lot to complain yet still giving this 8 of 10(give the previous two 10 of 10), because it still a good movie.. you still feel like a part of the family.. and of course.. the end.. with Paul walker and Vin diesel driving of their separate ways was so enormously touching.. <br/><br/>8 stars out of 10 folks. there you have it!"

In addition, I have had the chance to see a favorite Asain actor of mine, namely Tony Jaa in a Hollywood flick.<br/><br/>Although, all these news are encouraged me to watch this movie, the final outcome was disappointing for me once again. Starting out with the pros, the movie was really well-directed! I raise my hat before the director and the producers (and stunts of course) because the entire movie is well-edited. It is stuffed with a lot of actions, which are rhythmically followed by some more sluggish dramatic scenes, which are really required here IMO. However, the playtime counts more than 2 hours, you won't feel bored for a single minute, and this is what I call an achievement! The acting performance and the chemistry between the actors are still awesome. Just like in the prequels, Vin Diesel is calm and serious at the same time, Paul Walker is the cop, who rarely shows his emotions factually, but still effective, there's Letty, who still struggles with her memory, but we could see a quite good character development in her case, and yep, there's Roman, who still has some hilarious moments. The movie manages the balance between threads of the previous installments in order to entwine them with the current state of the storyline.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the other members of the crew are a little bit pushed in the background. I would have liked to see more of Tej, and especially Hobbes! However, he was more than bad-ass in his moments, but this cannot be compared to the badassness of Jason Statham, which was more than exaggeration. I do not wanna spoiler those moments, but the way he is sleazy and though at the same time was quite ridiculous for me to take him seriously enough. And the same goes for the action sequences. There were too much over-hyped, close to impossible scenes, which was not attributable to the first few installments of the franchise. The abundance of slow-motions, explosions, gunshots and flying cars were torn me out of the movie and made me an outsider, who was just sitting in the theatre with huge eyes without believing what is really happening n the silver- screen.<br/><br/>All of this would have been excusable for my part if I have seen any trace of an illegal race! Honestly, there were quite a few moments in the movie, where I actually felt from the signs made by Dom, that there could be something like what I mentioned. But it was only a hope, unfortunately. The old, good feeling of the streets has been transformed into an action-packed moneybag franchise by Hollywood.<br/><br/>In summary, this was an average action movie for me. I would recommend it if you wish to pump up your adrenaline level, do not care about reality, wanna enjoy few humorous quotes and see, how the story goes on with the Toretto family. Buti f your desire is to receive something of the old times, then you will be disappointed, because is has long-disappeared.<br/><br/>My final rating is 5/10. Thanks for reading!"

","I am in short, a movie fanatic. I've seen thousands of titles and continue to download, watch and go see pretty much everything that sees the light of day ( apart from horror, that stuff just doesn't get me going ) <br/><br/>Obviously I know that this film wasn't intended to be a serious, deep or reality-driven flick. That being said, they took the entire premise of this series ( Cars, and their drivers ) and they destroyed it. This film is nothing but a lengthy sequence of ridiculous action scenes. There isn't a word or single action in this movie that could be credited as plausible. <br/><br/>Every time I thought they'd gone and done the most absolutely improbable action I conceived possible, they topped it the next minute. THROUGHOUT 2 HOURS. Don't expect any character development or meaningful moments because it's one-liners glued together by plain absurdity.<br/><br/>People revering it because it was Paul Walkers last project is the sole reason this film stands at an astonishingly undeserving 7.8.<br/><br/>The only reason I finished it was because I was watching with friends and couldn't really turn it off at two thirds of the film. This was easily the worst film I've seen in the past decade and I saw the likes of Cloud 9, and every piece of crap Steve Austin and Seagal throw at me.<br/><br/>I was looking forward to a fun, decently acted ('cause come on), well shot, driver / car oriented action movie and was sorely disappointed."

","So many people liked this movie but is it because the movie is good or because one of the actors died? People who did even know the name of Walker were so sad because of his dead that they suddenly realized they were his biggest fans. Apparently his tragic dead made him also a better actor.<br/><br/>Well... I am a person who looks objectively on things and I have to tell you I just could't wait until the end, I had to leave. But then again as 99.99% of the American movies the end is always obvious, the good guys defeat the bad. The end. I didn't really need to watch the end.<br/><br/>Why was it so bad? The reason is, it is absurd. From the first scene we see one guy who managed to almost destroy a hospital. SUVs crashed into the building, SWAT teams all dead and our guy visiting his brother and threatening the doctors. Walks out and finds his car parked right in front of the entrance while everything else is destroyed... and in all that time the police is nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>In the Fast and Furious universe you can jump with your car from a plane and land on a very specific location without any navigation what so ever. You can also crash your car dawn a mountain hill and not only be alive but also without a scratch. In addition, you can have a device that can access all cameras and mics in the world simultaneously and find anybody but when the special ops teams go to apprehend that someone, they would not use any surveillance and go blindly so that they can be superseded that there is an entire army waiting for them there. The US government does not use satellite images and infrared to asses the situation...that's just for losers. On top of everything military helicopters and military drones owned by private individuals can fly freely over American cities and fire missiles on whatever they want without being detected and obviously without being interrupted by any government agency. Why? Very simple. Our good guys have to defeat the bad guys by themselves. Otherwise it will not be that ""dramatic"" and the victory wont be theirs.<br/><br/>As usual for the Fast and Furious, the acting was mediocre and when it comes to plot...well there isn't any. As long as there are nice cars and they show you an ass or two it OK. That is all you need."

","I'm quite a latecomer to the FAST & FURIOUS franchise, having gotten on with the fourth entry, but not really liking it until FAST FIVE. Here we are, seven films in, the series has morphed into something else entirely different from the street racing formula it started as. While the previous two were heist films, FURIOUS 7 goes into full superhero mode. I mean, can nothing kill these people? Still, once you embrace the absurdity there's a lot of fun to be had with the over-the-top action and quip-making. The plot, as if it really matters, involves Dom and his team going after Deckard Shaw, who is hunting them down because of what they did to his brother in the previous movie. It's actually an interesting dual family dynamic that, sadly, isn't really played up save for one scene at the beginning. That's also the scene where we're introduced to just how bada** that Shaw is by seeing the aftermath of what he did to the hospital where his brother is staying. Sadly, nothing in the rest of the film lives up to that level of awesome. Along the way, the team has to extract a hacker so that they can get some incredible piece of technology that will help them find Shaw. However, the ""God's Eye"" is merely a plot-driving MacGuffin that extends the running time, and kind of useless because Shaw just keeps showing up where Dom and company are anyway as the plot requires. And that's generally the biggest problem with FURIOUS 7: it relies too heavily and coincidence and convenience to drive the story. Still, the film delivers on the action it promises. Big time. The coolest stunt in the whole film is probably where they parachute cars down onto a mountain, which looked to be achieved practically (at least part of it). I can only imagine what an adrenaline rush it would have been to see it on a premium format screen (like IMAX), but it was still effective on my laptop. But, for my money, the film's best action sequence takes place in Abu Dhabi. James Wan, best known until now for directing low-budget horror films, was at his directorial best here deftly cutting between concurrent action sequences and witty banter courtesy of Roman (Tyrese). After this show-stopping segment, the final ""street fight"" was almost anti-climactic by comparison. As for the lulls between the action, there was plenty of talk about family as is typical for the series. Yet, none of it really felt genuine until the emotional final scene which pays tribute, and says farewell, to Paul Walker. That moment alone, out of all the other similar ones throughout the series, was heartfelt and touching without being clichéd. So, is this highbrow entertainment? Heck no! But, it knows what it is and delivers what the target audience wants."

","Pieced back together in the wake of Paul Walker's tragic death in an automobile accident in 2013, the seventh instalment of the Fast & Furious franchise comes with a morbid sense of curiosity. Just how much of the original movie remains, and how will long-serving series advocate Vin Diesel and newcomer director James Wan deal with the fate of Walker's character Brian O'Connor? Thankfully, anyone trying to spot the CGI trickery and attempting to tell Walker from either of his stand-in real-life brothers will be disappointed (although there are some questionable camera angles), and the climactic send- off could not have been more moving.<br/><br/>Fast & Furious 7's (or simply Furious 7 given its alternate title) problems lie elsewhere. Whether it be the cast, the running time, the plot, or the sheer amount of carnage played out on screen, the movie is as bloated as Dwayne Johnson's neck. We have finally caught up to the events of the third instalment, Tokyo Drift (2003), and the gang of lovable ex-cons, ex-cops and gear-heads are drawn out of retirement by the extremely p****d British special forces assassin Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who happens to be the older brother of the baddie from the sixth film Owen Shaw (Luke Evans) and is hell-bent on revenge. Sadly, as a straight-forward revenge story is no longer enough to satisfy the masses, Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his crew are also tasked by a shady government agent dubbed Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) to track down God's Eye, an omniscient piece of spy software.<br/><br/>The franchise is now so removed from its original premise of an undercover cop trying to bust a gang of hijackers, that the sight of Dwayne Johnson's oiled and impossibly ripped cop Hobbs firing a huge Gatling gun at a helicopter in the streets during the film's climax will come as no surprise. Characters have died and come back to life, and now display martial arts skills so refined that they can take down the likes of Rhonda Rousey and Tony Jaa in a fist-fight. They are now superheroes, capable of cracking their necks and shaking off a wrench-blow to the head. The preposterousness of it all means that the film-makers are now simply looking to make things bigger than they were last time rather than taking the time of building tension or making things coherent.<br/><br/>So, only two set-pieces really get the adrenaline going - one involving Brian escaping from a coach dangling over the edge of a cliff, and the face-off between the bald pit-bulls Diesel and Statham, as the two go at each other with bits of car wreckage. The film is at its best in it's quieter moments, where comedy-relief characters Roman (Tyrese Gibson) and Tej (Ludacris) squabble over the attentions of super- hacker Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), and Dom and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), still suffering from amnesia, try to piece together their relationship (though Dom ramming the idea of family being the most important thing down our throats is getting a bit old). Despite it's gaping flaws, there's still something oddly addictive about this series and I'm eager to see if even more sequels will come. and the loving tribute to Walker at the end will bring a tear to the eye of even the most hardened petrol head."
"ebamovies","6","1","13","18 April 2015"," The good...the bad....the end.???
","Dear movie fans...I base this review strictly on my opinion without agreeing or disagreeing with anyone on IMDb or around the world....<br/><br/>The BAD: Directing....No racism involved, but why in the world did they switch an Asian director with another Asian director? Was there a point in this? After watching this movie I am convinced that McG or Peter Berg would do a much better job. By the end of the whole thing I felt I like was watching a Zack Snyder movie. Not because of excellent CGI skills with Paul Walker's double (not that Zack's CGI skills are excellent) but because it felt more like Man of Steel than Furious franchise topper. OR even worse...Avengers...seriously the whole LA gets destroyed like NY was in Avengers 1st one....WHY...HOW...WHY every place Shaw shows up gets blown up...WHY....whats the point?<br/><br/>Script: Who ...seriously who wrote this script? A 6 year old...I mean beside the fact that none of the actors knew how to deliver a punch line when it was suppose to be brought...why were the dialogues so played out and just stupid....<br/><br/>Acting: First, not every wrestler/fighter is a good actor. Rock and John Cena are exceptions to the rule. I still think Be Cool was Rock's best role. Why did they have that female MMA fighter in that role, say a few words and then not deliver an end to her character...she gets knocked out by a fall and thats it...she is gone. If you were to bring someone famous to a role...finish the role properly..or just bring someone who can ACT. Second, after this movie I am also convinced that Vin Diesel should be our next Batman. I mean any deeper voice and nobody can understand him. Third Tyrese and Luda are just bad....come on..Can I check my email??? Really that was suppose to be funny...nope ...dead line like every line they both brought. And back to Hobbs...whats with the REDNECK remarks? <br/><br/>Story: God's eye? The best name they came up with? Eagle Eye didn't come up as a film where an almost similar technology was used so obvious movie fans would call this a copy of that idea in that film. So Shaw hunts them...even though he had a USB with all of them he technically only took one out in Japan the rest just followed Dom...Then they loose Shaw and really cannot locate him until this Mr.Nobody shows up to help them find him...but they don't really need to do all of this dangerous work since Shaw shows up everywhere anyways...Besides the question of HOW does he show up everywhere, why do they need this EYE thing if Shaw is going to come anyways. Mr. Nobody winking and almost dying...then only get rescued in a second and be OK....Then say goodbye and we never know what happened to him?Thank you. How did Letti know that Brian is running on the bus to jump?WHY does Hobbs have a daughter? And how is this important to the whole story? Race world , we started it? Really when? Looked more like Nitro circus episode. Wouldn't it just be really much better to make this a one by one death story. Shaw finds them and takes them out until he reaches Brian and Dom. Dom lets Brian live to have one last fight with Shaw. Kicks his ass, Hobbs catches him end of story. Brian lives forever in our hearts while we never have to see Tyrese and Luda ever again in this franchise if it ever were to come back. I remember everything...2 minute BS , flashbacks....then again??? I remember everything...wow...what an end...Abu Dhabi? Why not Dubai? Abu Dhabi is what Ottawa is to Canada ...nice to visit but boring and too political...And why show us the dunes and stuff....we know where Middle East is...we know it's full of sand...again instead of dunes show us some races...Racing movie remember?... THE GOOD: Tony JAA: Old but still awesome. Excellent work on Paul Walker's face. The BEST for last...: The last 1 minute monologue by Diesel and moment of Paul Walker. Very touching and full of that Paul Walker grace that we will miss...<br/><br/>I really hope they don't come back and if they do, please bring a director who was not only known for his scary movies, good scary movies too and somehow switched from tortures and ghosts to...cars and action..."

I could deal with a few scenes being over the top, but every freaking scene is a little too much. Hell, I have a better time believe Star Wars or Superman could happen before I believe everything in this movie, and the writing was horrible even for a Fast & The Furious movie.

","The only reason I gave this a 7 was because the final 10 minutes of the movie were done very well and was a nice homage to Paul Walker. Actually 7 is a little high but the movie is better than a 6. Now there were 3 parts of the movie that really irritated me. 1. Kurt Russell and his super-secret special ops agency need Vin Diesel and his street racing crew to help get back a hacker and her special program from a terrorist group. Really? This U.S. black ops agency's only hope is a mechanic/street racer, his street racing girlfriend suffering from amnesia, a tech savvy black market dude, a former FBI agent and Tyrese whose skills are a mystery to me other than bad jokes and the ability to complain more than everyone in the crew combined. 2. The military air drops equipment and vehicles all the time. But not on 2 lane mountain road from 30,000 feet. At one point someone says the parachutes are guided by GPS. What? They looked like normal parachutes to me. If they weren't going to take the time to explain or maybe show some special equipment that guided the parachutes then they should have said nothing. 3. By far my biggest gripe with the movie was the attack chopper flying through L.A. wreaking havoc and chaos. How long does it take the police to realize there is a war in progress in downtown L.A.? How long are terrorists flying a war machine equipped with rockets and machine guns before the National Guard gets alerted? Not to mention the drone that the chopper craps out which blows up enough stuff to make Die Hard fans proud. I didn't hate the movie though. Parts of it were really cool and like I said, the ending was done very well. This is especially impressive considering that one of the main actors died before completion of the movie. Makes me wonder what the original ending was going to be?"

","So we speed up to #7 in this gigantically popular action series.

The film is overly long for the paucity of content, but for F & F fans it will satisfy. <br/><br/>Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew thought they'd left the criminal mercenary life behind.

","As if speed-dragging a multi-ton safe and jumping the tank wasn't enough, here comes another larger than life set of car chases, girls' asses, shootouts and mass destruction. And if you thought that the sixth installment was over the top, then brace yourself for a complete re-definition of that term. Because compared to what our old friends do here in Furious Seven, the feats of Ethan Hunt are a wee child's walk in the park.<br/><br/>There's one undoubtedly good thing about this film, and it's the fact that it brought Nathalie Emmanuel, hands down the hottest babe from Game of Thrones, back to the big screen. She was definitely the right person to break that typical ""nerdy hacker"" stereotype, although for the relevant skills she hardly presents anything besides tapping helplessly on the keyboard when it doesn't even matter and the British accent. But who cares really when you have such hair, face and figure.<br/><br/>Other than that, it's the same old Fast'n'Furious routine, which always goes exactly the same way, except this time we all know something unexpected happened in the real world and someone managed to get himself proper f@cked, as Jason Statham could've said in a different time and in a different movie. This is pretty unthinkable for a franchise famous for its damage-proof characters who can get blown out from the 4th floor or fall from a cliff and hardly bleed after that.<br/><br/>I wish i could cut the cynicism and get a little sentimental for the film series i spent all my maturity along with, especially since the ending of Furious Seven is a real tearjerker, with Vin Diesel's soliloquy that sounds as if coming both from his character and himself as a person. But the filmmakers simply couldn't resist the temptation to capitalize on Paul Walker's death and announce that the film would be released anyway and that he'd be digitally recreated for whatever scenes he didn't get to do. So instead of simply enjoying the show i came to see this movie for, i couldn't help playing the guess game of whether it's the real Paul or some masterful CGI. And i guess i even found at least one ""fake Paul"" scene - a few moments in the episode with the drone and the truck carrying pipes. Or was that the stunt double? Nah, he better not be, otherwise it would ruin the game.<br/><br/>Seriously, do you know any other action franchise that outlived the actor playing the main role? (Well, one of two main roles, but whatever.) Can you imagine Mission Impossible without Tom Cruise? Or Expendables without Stallone? Nope, it's just unreal. And even if those actors died halfway through film production and the movie makers decided to finish the job anyway, would their characters be kept alive? Don't think so. Why? Because it's not how the heroes go. They were risking their lives on screen, they were doing it again and again because it meant something for the world, or for themselves. Or maybe they were just missing the bullets. So if they were meant to finally go for good - especially after what happened with Paul who died doing what his character loved the most - they at least deserved to go with a real bang and not in some sappy PG-rated scene. This is an old geezer's way, and the heroes must always die young to be forever remembered.<br/><br/>But even if the film didn't do you proper justice, hopefully the time will. Rest in peace, Paul, and may they never make another F&F movie. It would just not be the same without you."
"Jamarlie","6","1","14","29 June 2015"," ... I wasted my time...
","...and I wasted a lot of it. I gave this movie a go since everybody was starting to bug me about it. ""OH THE ENDING IS SO GOOD U MUST SEE IT!"" was probably the reaction I heard the most. This somewhat raised my expectations to an absolute all time high. I sincerely thought I would get a quality movie-twist ending the likes of ""Who Am I"", ""Memento"" or ""Fight Club"". So I started, and not with F&F 7, but with F&F 5 to catch up with the story to make 100% sure that I get the full enjoyment out of this so praised ""really good movie"". After a 4 hour marathon of all of testosterone pumped explosions, boring races and muscle packed action I finally got to the main course: F&F 7. The movie couldn't get any better for me when I saw one of my favorite action-actors, Jason Statham, being in the cast as well. When the credits started to roll in after another two hours the only thing I said to myself was: ""Someone owes me my mother****ing 6 hours back, and I want them back right now.""<br/><br/>To conclude it in a more polite way: This movie is not bad. But it is not good either.<br/><br/>*Spoilers begin here*<br/><br/>The ending, at least for me, started with a fighting scene in the old warehouse. At that point of the movie I was so bored that I sincerely tried to figure out when Paul Walker passed away and at which point he started to get doubled. In the end I expected some kind of huge twist, which was probably the thing that pulled the entire movie down for me. That twist never happened. You see the two protagonists cruising down a road next to each other. Paul Walker smiles, takes a left turn, camera turns in the sky, ""Rip Paul"", credits. WHAT. This literally showed me that the people who actually said this movie had a great ending never saw a good movie in the first place. I felt absolutely scammed when that ending came up, hell, I even watched the entire credits to see if something story-relevant would happen afterwards... My mind was repeatedly saying to myself: ""Have I been watching the WRONG movie? Did people talk about a different movie with a cool ending?"" This does not mean that the ending was not fitting, that means that the ending was way below what I expected. But then again, maybe my expectations got a little over- hyped. <br/><br/>And don't get me wrong here: The movie was not bad. It had some funny moments, some nice special effects (although jumping through 3 skyscrapers with a high torque car is more comedic than realistic), it has an okay story line for an action movie (Aka, the uber-cool protagonists, the muscle packed human tank that is never shy of a cocky statement, female... let's call them ""charms"", a villain with an unbreakable will to be evil and a load of explosions) but then again, this is about what every action movie since the year 2000 has. There is nothing new to be found here, the only difference is that those explosions can now be enjoyed in 1080p, big bloody whoop for that. <br/><br/>All in all, an average action movie which does not differ in any way from any movie. The only thing that actually makes this movie so popular is the sudden hype around Paul Walkers death, an actor who was literally of no interest to anybody before his death and who suddenly turned everybody into whining fans of a movie sequel they never watched in the first place."

"3xHCCH","7","1","14","10 April 2015"," Over Activated Adrenaline!
","""Furious 7"" follows the same adrenaline rush formula that fueled the first six film in the franchise to box-office success. The barely-there story just functions to string together some of the most memorable and impossibly spectacular stunts involving the most muscular cars ever captured on film. As the stunts get more and more complex and incredible, there is a dramatic real-life twist that would challenge the filmmakers further for this seventh installment, and that is the death of star Paul Walker in, as fate would have it, a race car accident. How they deal with Walker's death in the film will be a matter of curiosity among fans of this franchise. <br/><br/>The plot here follows right from FF6. Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), a Black-Ops savvy brother of a former fallen enemy, is out for revenge big time. Striking a deal with a secret government agent code-named Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his posse rescues Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel), a hacker who had been kidnapped by Jakande (Djimon Hounsou), a terrorist with military-grade firepower. Ramsey had developed God's Eye, a powerful tracking system which can use all available digital devices around to locate any subject.<br/><br/>On the action front, this film is on adrenaline overload as the gang goes from Los Angeles and Tokyo, to Azerbaijan and Abu Dhabi.. The cars here don't only look great, they also do the most amazing things. I'm sure it was really very hard to top the already over-the-top stunts we saw in FF6, but the insane stunts we see here in FF7 could definitely match them. Cars jumping out of planes ( a major stunt dubbed ""air drop""), cars hurtling down cliffs, cars jumping from skyscraper to skyscraper -- they have got it all here! <br/><br/>With Jason Statham there in the mix as the main antagonist, there would not be a dearth of heart-stopping, bone-crunching mano-a-mano fights. Right off the bat, Statham would engage Dwayne Johnson in a hard-hitting brawl that destroys an entire office. Of course, there will also be a climactic Aston Martin-smashing face-off with Vin Diesel himself at the end. Paul Walker had his own breathtaking fight inside a moving van against Thai martial arts star Tony Jaa. Michele Rodriguez had her dynamic fight scene in full evening gown regalia vs. MMA star Ronda Rousey in an elegant penthouse suite.<br/><br/>The FF series is as much about family as it about action, and this is not forgotten here. Toretto is dealing with the amnesia suffered by his wife Letty. Walker's character Brian is trying to quietly settle down as a family man with Dom's sister, Mia (Jordana Brewster).The much- anticipated final send-off and goodbye to Paul Walker was touching yet very manly. <br/><br/>Director James Wan takes a break from his horror films and successfully orchestrates these visually spectacular out-of-this world vehicular stunts with his crew. They were also able to give Paul Walker a fitting and dignified farewell. The scenes where Paul's real life brothers Caleb and Cody stand-in for him were not obvious as the editing was very well done. <br/><br/>Of course, they made Toretto and company virtually superheroes the way they can emerge from all those incredibly dangerous situations unscathed. It does seem absurd, but isn't this really how fans consider them? The ""humor"" of Tyrese Gibson's character Roman can be groan- inducing, especially in that party scene, but I'd say it's tolerable.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say that this particular installment of the FF series definitely achieved what it set out to do. This is a very entertaining film indeed. The Lykan HyperSport and Nathalie Emmanuel look fantastic. When put side by side with the other FF films I've seen though, I think Fast 5 and FF 6 were still better than this. 7/10."

","This is for those of us who didn't think Universal had a super hero franchise. I've never been a fast and furious fan and was roped into watching this for my son's birthday. It's a great film and a wonderful, emotional and fitting tribute to Paul Walker. The action is intense, absorbing and gripping, the dialogue is.... well... poor but about as creative as you might expect in this high octane low plot franchise. The plot is spread over a foundation of clichés The biggest feature of the film is the action. It is seat edgingly intense and relies on two brilliantly delivered elements - the car chases (as you'd expect) and the fight-action sequences. The action is even occasionally original (particularly the next generation cat fight)"
"PyroSikTh","6","1","14","7 April 2015"," A disappointing send-off for Paul
","The F&F franchise is a franchise unlike any other. It just keeps getting more and more successful. I have no idea how they managed that. I remember being captivated by the first one, started drifting with the second, skipped the third, and then found an old love with four and five. This one, unfortunately, was hit with tragedy due to the untimely death of one it's leading stars; Paul Walker, and it's future looked shaky at best. Re-writes and reshoots aimed to salvage the movie took place and, more than anything, I was intrigued to see what kind of effect it all had. The good news is it had barely any effect at all.<br/><br/>Owen Shaw's brother, Deckard, is back and seeking revenge after the events of the last movie. This (somehow) leads Toretto into the hands of a shady Government arm led by Mr. Nobody who needs a hacker to activate a government surveillance program. Uh? Apparently Toretto needs to find Shaw before Shaw finds him, and to do that he needs the surveillance program. Unfortunately the hacker's been kidnapped by some guy so they need to get her back first. This all results in that massive cliffhanger from six meaning jack-s***. Deckard is not the main villain here. We do not get an intimate story where the Furious Family is hunted by a stone-cold killer. Instead we get a nameless villain with more military hardware than the rest of the world combined, and Shaw just appears every now and then to make the heists more difficult.<br/><br/>Yeah, story wise I am left very disappointed. It didn't deliver on anything it promised from the last film. Okay, that's a bit of an exaggeration. The movie has a very strong start. We see what Deckard is capable of and our characters are left in a sustained peril as they're being hunted by him. Key characters are temporarily (and permanently) put out of the picture. It's going good. But as soon as Mr. Nobody and his bizarre organisation comes in, the great direction is left as a sub-plot to a much inferior angle. I understand they're trying to establish Mr. Nobody ready for an upcoming movie, but it ruined this one.<br/><br/>The stunts and action sequences are even more over-the-top than what you might find in The Expendables. You've got cars parachuting out of planes, drone chases in downtown LA, hypercars jumping three skyscrapers, and The Rock loses. Okay that last one was actually done really well, defeating Hobbs the only way you could imagine defeating him. The rest though? I'm out. I get the over-the-top, fun angle. It's going for those classic action movies that are so bad and so silly they're good, but I feel at this point it's come far too far from it's roots. I mean, this is like 2 Fast 2 Furious all over again.<br/><br/>Which is ironic because the film definitely tries to tie to it's roots. We get even more cameos from past cast members, including Hector from the very first movie (Who's Hector? He's the generic latino guy that speaks maybe two lines) and Lucas from Tokyo Drift, and of course the dedication to Paul at the end complete with flashbacks to all the other movies. This is the film's single biggest saving grace. It was nice to tie more solidly to Tokyo Drift, the movie I still haven't seen yet, and bring Hector back for two more lines. Paul's memorial though? Perfect. I was almost brought to tears. It was a great send-off and the best way to tie the franchise off with a nice little bow. Shame it's going to get undermined by the incomprehensible box office success. Furious 8 will crash and burn without Paul, I guarantee it.<br/><br/>On that note the lack of Paul was barely noticeable. I kept a keen eye out for some bad CGI of his face, but honestly it was so seamless I didn't notice any. The only time I could really tell was his last big fight scene with Tony Jaa. You don't see his face at all. It's all filmed in the dark using the same camera trickery they use with stunt doubles. You know it's Brian O'Connor, because you don't see a different face. The fact you don't see his face doesn't undermine that at all. Big props to how they handled that. That said, for the only particularly noticeable Paul-less scene, it was a bit superfluous and unnecessary. They could've just cut it out and saved themselves the bother.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is a disappointing send-off for Paul. It has some good ideas, particularly at the beginning, the ending is wonderful, and there's some real comedy gold here as well, but the whole middle section, forcing in a heist for no obvious reason, introducing new characters without reason, and not really developing them either, let the whole thing down. What breathed new life into the F&F franchise was a slightly new direction. That new direction has not only gone too far away from it's roots, but it's also starting to get very repetitive. I will not be rushing out to the inevitable Furious 8. I give Furious 7 a disappointing 6/10."
"km-aaroha","6","1","14","8 April 2015"," Fast and furious 7- The ultimate truth
","Fast and furious is one of those movies which you put into a category called overdoing it. The action sequences are ridiculous and outrageous, from cars sky-diving perfectly into a narrow road to flying from one building to another and much more. The fighting sequences are a different story altogether, the protagonist group have somewhat turned into a superhero group like the Avengers, immune to kicks and punches and even blasts. The plot is basic and clichéd, put into one word: revenge. The brother of the guy whom the Toretto group killed in the last sequel is hunting for the group responsible for his brother's death. For a series known for its cars and races has well, neither car's nor races (expect maybe one or two). For a movie having so many flaws, there has to be at least one thing that they should've done right, well that I have to say is the ending where Paul Walker is given a tribute, the last 7 minutes of the movie was beautifully done, tear jerking and applaud worthy if I dare to say so. If you want to watch this movie you have to do it either for Paul or for your excess love for action movies. The perfect word for summarizing fast and furious 7 is: overrated. However I can't end without saying this, RIP Paul."

","A nice movie with a lot of stunts and cars as most of you would expect. It was an emotional last 5 minutes dedicated to our beloved Paul Walker(which was really good to see). I am rating this movie just a 7 because of the goofs I spotted in the movie, for example the first scene where Jason Stratham gets into his white car (a left hand drive) from the right door and zooms away. Other bits of the movie were good but nothing ground breaking, nothing that you have never seen before. Some of the 3D effects were really good and nice fight scenes. It was good to see Paul walker fight Tony Jaa (Pun Intended) This movie will give you a good dose of action but do not expect something that you have not seen before.

This leads him to Tokyo, finally tying the continuity gap between Fast and Furious: Tokyo Drift and the three sequels after it, which were in-movie-timeline before Tokyo Drift.<br/><br/>The crew is being systematically targeted, and it is up to Vin Diesel as Dominic Toretto to protect his family, but most importantly his new extended family of his nephew, while O'Connor struggles with the settled down life of being a family man.<br/><br/>The movie's ending, due to events, had to be rewritten to give Walker's character a proper send-off. Any details would rob viewers of its potency and heartfelt emotions. However, the tribute, and this film, show that the franchise can survive in the face of tragedy, and this film's theme can be felt in two simple words:<br/><br/>For Paul."

Though the screenplay falters especially the climax action sequence ( which never ends :) ) but the gripping performance and well- choreographed stunts will keep you on the toes. I was entertained throughout the film and was almost on the edge seat while watching the car dropping down from 10,000 feet or jumping from one building to another building. Cinematography is excellent . Art direction is spellbinding. Editing could have been better. I think the entire star cast gave a captivating performance and were true to their character.

They original team who wrote, produced and directed the previous ones should have been retained. Overacting, corny scenes and unrealistic scenes characterized this movie. Hopefully, Furious 8 will redeem this epic failure. The score of 9 was for Paul Walker scenes. My overall score was -12. I don't know what to say anymore as this site is forcing me to type more.

","Furious 7 is the latest installment in the Fast & Furious franchise and by far the worst one. It's a well known fact that this type of movies is mainly directed towards excited teenagers who don't mind leaving their unexperienced brains at the entrance of the movie theaters. Given this target audience it's no surprise how much success this latest sequel had.<br/><br/>Along with the combination of tasteless music and half naked women you may expect the usual dialogue and humour with the most ridiculous one liners ever to hit the big screens. The mindless, insane and unrealistic action sequences are back at a level never before seen in the franchise. You will be left with the sensation that you're watching The Avengers Age of Ultron or some sort of super hero movie, of course combined with the always overused CGI. The plot is centered around personal vendettas with each side trying to take the advantage. Full of clichés and subliminal concepts and messages, it's clear that despite covering up the movie as a ""tribute"" the studios were clearly expecting, in one way or the other, to take advantage of Paul Walker's popularity and his death by appealing to the sensibility and emotions of the fans, and it worked. This may hurt the naive minds of some innocent young folks but it's the truth. The last scene with the tribute to Paul Walker is probably the best piece in all the movie. having said that, it's hilarious to see how much the media, specially the mainstream, advertised and praised this movie, contributing to this collective brain wash. Meanwhile, some movies in this genre, despite much smaller budgets, were reasonably better and yet are labeled as ""poor copies"" of this junk, the irony of it all..."

","Oh, Fast and Furious. You never change, do you.<br/><br/>Having seen The Imitation Game and Interstellar recently with my family, we all agreed we wanted to watch something lighter and not as emotionally draining as the aforementioned cinematic masterpieces, so we went with the most obvious choice there was.<br/><br/>When it ended, we all let out a collective sigh of utter relief.<br/><br/>This whole film is, quite honestly speaking, an insult to the viewer's intelligence. I can deal with one or two exaggerations in the film for the sake of awesome visuals, but this ENTIRE film is just one big exaggeration. What is worrying to me though is that someone actually sat down, came up with all those ridiculous scenes and thought they were good. Even more unsettling, others agreed that was the case. Golly me.<br/><br/>Statham's purpose in this film, unless it was for the sake of comedy, still has to reveal itself to me. He just seemed to pop out of nowhere every time the music got dramatic, fire a couple of bullets and then disappear again. I don't think he got to speak for a collective 3 minutes in the entire film. However, I have a feeling that even if he spoke more, it would have just been cheesy, cliché lines or 'I will mess him up so bad he gonna go cry to his mama after I'm done with him' kind of threats, which for some reason always seem to be present in this franchise. <br/><br/>Credit must be given where it is due though, and I do have to admit some scenes are very carefully and beautifully shot, although the use of CGI is deplorable at times. Also, the ending was worth enduring the rest of the film, as the tribute brought to Paul Walker almost brought tears to my eyes. May he rest in peace.<br/><br/>I wanted to watch something funny and light, but this ended up being funny for a completely different reason other than the one intended. Learn from my mistake. Don't be afraid to skip this one; you won't be missing out on much, but, most importantly, you won't lose your self-respect. Once it's lost, it's difficult to bring it back... trust me on that one."
"Typhic","4","1","15","8 August 2015"," They were dealt a bad hand, and did the best they could. It's disappointing that their best was still terrible.
","There is no doubt that the studio went through a hard time trying to complete the film after the tragic death of actor Paul Walker. It's never easy to as seen in other films in the same situation. The only other choice was to scrap the film altogether; however, if that was the case, we wouldn't have to worry about reviewing it.<br/><br/>If you take into account this difficulty while watching Furious Seven, you'll see that the studio actually did a great job piecing together what they had into a watchable film. They were dealt a bad hand, but they finished the best that they could. If I were to take this into account when rating the film it would be a solid 7 or 8.<br/><br/>Fortunately, I'm not going to rate a movie based on any other factors but the movie itself; and with that: It's disappointing to say that this series' quality has drastically decreased. Furious Seven can easily be argued to be the worst in the series--yes, even before 2 Fast 2 Furious.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes, albeit nice to look at, abandon any realm of realism that existed in previous episodes. It seems as if the producers decided to get more and more ridiculous with each passing sequel. Considering their films have made well over 3 billion dollars, it's understandable that they would continue. If you as a viewer are fine with watching a film whose only positive feature is a few scenes of action absurdities, look no further. Feel free to exit this review here. But if you're a viewer who wants a bit more out of a film, then you may want to pass on this one and look elsewhere.<br/><br/>The plot jumps around, the scenes appear a tad out of place (given the death of walker) and the new characters are given no development that connects you to them or the plot itself. Perhaps worse of all, the acting of some of the cast was definitely poor; less than what I have seen in previous episodes. Some scenes give off a forced-sentimentality feeling. It's almost as if the film was rushed. All of these things made watching this movie too distracting and withdrew me from the even sub-par immersion that I expect a film to bring me into.<br/><br/>When your movie seems less like fun and more like work to watch, something is terribly wrong. This studio may continue to care more about the profit than the quality of the film, but if they decide to make a sequel (which they would be crazy to) and care about more than just that, they should start learning alchemy and turn trash into gold."

The dialogue is childish, there is absolutely no logic behind any of the concept or stunts or fights in this movie. However this movie is commendable for the tribute paid to Paul Walker but only that isn't enough for a good movie. is it?? James Wan should stick to making his trademark horror-thrillers instead of an action flick. The character development really sucked in this too.

","There is nothing redeeming about this movie. Horrible writing, wooden acting, cliché upon cliché, insulting lack of logic or plot. The fact that $180 million were wasted to make this movie is bad enough, but the insulting assumption by the makers that this is good enough to release and the willingness by the crowd to praise it is truly mind boggling. Watching this movie is like wrestling a mattress down the stairs. Line after line made me blush in the embarrassment for the actors who had to say them. Is the only reason it is rated so high is because of the death of Paul Walker? I can' think of any other explanation. This is the type of a movie that gives Hollywood its reputation of being unable to produce an original, smart work any more."

Furious 7 is so entertaining that you don't notice Dwayne Johnson is missing from action much of the time, only that he kills it when he shows up. If incoming director James Wan (""The Conjuring,"" ""Saw"") falls the tiniest bit short of what Justin Lin brought to the third, fifth and sixth entries, Furious 7 nonetheless ranks a very successful fourth place overall, with at least one gargantuan set piece that ranks among the series' finest.

Also the movie is predictable. I guess the movie was not as good as its previous parts because the director's been changed.<br/><br/>This movie entertains you it gives you absurdity, everyone has a great time in the movie and the crowd goes crazy all the time.

There were many scenes repeated which the audience have already seen before like the car going under the truck, Toretto making his car jump (signature move) etc. Dwayne was given a very small role. I felt that the actors were playing their roles to the best of their abilities but the plot was not interesting enough to keep me enthralled. The movie lacked cliffhangers but it was good for a one time watch. The last scenes of the movie made me cry as they were dedicated to our very own hero 'Paul'. May his soul rest in peace.

"matthewssilverhammer","5","1","15","10 April 2015"," Don't Believe the Hype
","The 6-film ""Fast & Furious"" series began 14 years ago, and I've somehow managed to never see a single one. For some, this could disqualify my opinion of Furious 7, the latest in the most unlikely of gigantic franchises. While it's clearly not devoid of entertainment value, especially in the action and the outright silliness, it is devoid of one important thing: a brain. Mocking laughter was often as prevalent as the edge-of-your-seat thrills in what should be titled Furious 7: Cliché City. Not that it isn't oddly refreshing to see a movie that's so unashamedly dumb. The formulaic setup provides some space for sound design and action set-pieces that are engaging and good-looking. However, the script is terrible, and the actors are hit-and-miss at best. Imagine the cast of The Expendables circa 2035 being threatened by a charisma-less Statham villain, and you've got the gist. Rodriguez is annoying and Diesel is nothing more than a walking/talking piece of beef whose incessant mumbling is beyond tedious. On the other hand, Gibson and Johnson have some fun moments, and Walker's lack of acting range is bolstered by some general likability and a tasteful handling of his death. Director Wan does have a nice touch, specifically handling Walker's passing and in managing the giant scope of the appropriately ridiculous combat scenes. But you know everything you hate about living in Panama City during spring break? It's all glorified here. Like an SNL sketch about American-action-movie excess, Furious 7 spends as much time un-ironically worshipping guns, fast cars, UFC stars, bad dialogue and objectified women as it does being simple dumb fun."
"champjohnson29","5","1","15","10 April 2015"," Enjoyable, But Didn't Live Up To The Hype
","We all know that this franchise has a faithful following that has been following this movie since the beginning. I am one of those people. Of course I thought the 4th installment would be the last one, so of course, I was a little annoyed when I heard about Fast Five. Then I was shocked to see the new direction this franchise was going. Fast 6 was no different. It was randomly good and I was surprised at how much I enjoyed. Justin Lin did a good job with the direction he took this franchise. Then, James Wan happened. I'm not saying he's a bad director, but I think he should stick to horror...at least, for now.<br/><br/>While, Furious 7 is huge in spectacle, it lacks in every other area. From beginning to end, the action was Big and Grand. I was on the edge of my seat, (sidenote: Tony Jaa is so amazing) but everything else was just a miss for me. I respect the director and cast for trying to add a layer of emotion to the film but it seemed so forced. The scenes where Michelle Rodriguez or Jordana Brewster had to be vulnerable and cry just made me cringe in my seat. Then that ending scene with Vin and Michelle made me laugh out loud at how cheesy it was. And unfortunately, the banter between Tyrese and Ludicrous was not funny at all to me. It's usually one of the things I look forward to but this time, it was a yawn fest. It's also obvious that the director is a fan of The Rock from the WWF days, which would explain all the terrible one liners Dwayne Johnson was expected to deliver. I'm surprised he didn't bust out laughing in every take. Lastly, Jason Statham was a very weak villain. I understand wanting to get revenge for the people who killed your brother, but his motive still felt empty.<br/><br/>Like I said earlier, the action was great. Hand to hand combat, great. Car scenes, etc. all great but in this day and age, you cant expect for audiences to be satisfied just because the spectacle is big. You need a solid script and actors who can deliver on those emotional scenes that add weight to the story and gets the audience more invested.<br/><br/>This film was definitely ""For Paul"". I hate to say it, but if it wasn't for Paul's untimely death, I don't think this film would be getting as much attention as it is.<br/><br/>Coming off the of high success of Fast Five and Six, this movie had the opportunity to keep the flame lit but that fire went out when the studio decided to trade in Justin Lin for James Wan. I know a lot of people won't agree with me, but this film just didn't live up to the hype and I wish I had waited to catch it on Redbox. Insurgent is a much better film than this and I hate Shailene Woodley."
"sibloo","5","1","15","9 April 2015"," This is a bad film
","Well as an avid movie goer I use IMDb to give myself a flavour of the films potential. This was getting over 8/10 so I assumed that it would be the best in the series. Well this is my first review of a film on here, I was so compelled to write something because quite frankly I feel that I have been duped. This film is god damn awful. Ridiculous action, atrocious acting and a non existent storyline. The ONLY good thing in the whole film is the tribute to Paul Walker at the end which lasts for 5 mins or so, it was the only time that the actors showed any sort of emotion in the film, probably because they weren't acting! Hollywood keeps churning out rehashed films and they're making money! It beggars belief but ultimately it's our fault for paying good money to watch this trash."
"ppnj4","5","1","15","8 April 2015"," Not Bad but Not Good Either....
","For those not looking for spoilers (which are below) I gave this movie a 5 out of 10 for the poor acting and ridiculous story line. Movie was 3 hours long with previews so be prepared. Worth a DVD rental - not worth movie theater pricing - not even for sound or graphics. And, don't wait past the end...there are no scenes during or after the credits.<br/><br/>I love the F&F franchise - and I own all the movies. I'm also a big Diesel fan and one of my favorite movies of all time is Chronicles of Riddick. With that said, he is a hit and miss actor. Some of his roles are great and he delivers them with a natural ease - making you see him as the character and not an actor playing the character - other roles seem so fake it's hard to watch. This was one of those movies, most of the main characters acting seemed very forced and even the relationships lost chemistry. You would think after nearly 7 movies together their chemistry would get stronger, not weaker. Acting wise, for most of the characters, this was B movie level...way below box office hit.<br/><br/>***** Spoilers Here *****<br/><br/>The second issue I had was the complete unbelievable directions these films are taking. I watch movies to escape and there is always an unrealistic nature to them, but the fun is being able to imagine yourself in those situations if they were real. The draw to the original F&F movies was that there was a real-life element to them. A culture that really existed and you could be a part of. There was nothing real about this movie. You destroy half of Los Angeles and the entire police force is missing?? OK. You crash your car off a thousand foot high cliff and walk away like nothing happened?? Yeah. All of a sudden a bunch of street car racers have military and black-ops fight training?? Sure, no problem. Your run of the mill street racing car gets hit by a rocket from a helicopter sized drone and you keep racing like nothing happened?? Absolutely. The government has an entire special-ops force at their disposal and only you can parachute a car out of a plane?? Right. One guy took down an entire army of special forces soldiers and destroyed a hospital just to see his brother, but your wife is safe at a magistrate's house in Barbados with a few armed gun men who look like they came straight off a drug dealers property? Gotcha.<br/><br/>I believed the movies when they were heist movies that focused on their on relationships. I believed them when they needed to infiltrate bad guys and undercover cops were too noticeable. But, I do not believe they are the only group of people that can find and rescue an unknown hacker...who has the most sought after invention - EVER...causing billions of dollars worth of damage across multiple continents and have no notice taken by local law enforcement or other government agencies than the CIA (who mysteriously disappears so only The Rock can save the day).<br/><br/>Other less obnoxious issues - the cameos by Iggy and Roussey - neither where very good or added to the film. The fact that everybody stood less than an inch from the other persons face when having a conversation...why so close? And, finally, at my son's request, the fact that the race between Dom and Sean in Toyko was never seen. It was the one element he wanted to be in the movie that wasn't there.<br/><br/>See it, the ending was sad, you could hear sniffles across the whole theater. But, don't bother spending movie theater prices. Nothing offered was big screen necessary or big sound necessary. And nothing more disappointing than dropping $20 a person between tickets and snacks to see a movie that could be enjoyed on your couch for a fraction of the cost."

","Furious 7 is the next tale of Dom, Brian, and the gang driving fast cars and surviving everything like they have some sort of invulnerability cheat code on. In this one, Jason Statham plays the baddie, out for revenge after the defeat of his brother in the last movie. It's a decent set-up that plays out really boring in the beginning. It takes quite a while for the movie to pick up (though there is one decent fight in there). Then they drive cars out of an airplane onto a narrow mountain pass, drive cars into each other at a hundred miles an hour and walk out unscathed, and all kinds of other assorted ridiculousness.<br/><br/>I spent most of the movie laughing at how stupid it was, but that's not a bad thing. It's a tad overlong but once it gets going, strap in for a fun ride. After all the destruction (which includes tons of civilians dying, most notably a truck driver), we get a nice tribute to Paul Walker and that's it.<br/><br/>It's a ridiculous, stupid movie that shouldn't be taken seriously. It's the kind of popcorn movie I enjoy going to the theater to see. But I walked away from it feeling slightly dissatisfied. It has no staying power beyond the one viewing. It's pretty shallow except for the end and the action, while crazy, feels like it would only be effective one time. Hell, it was barely effective this time since all the crazier stunts were shown in trailers and commercials.<br/><br/>Also, the acting is pretty awful. There are a few cast members who do a good job but I've always found Diesel wooden and boring and some of the secondary characters, especially a female villain later on, are God-awful.<br/><br/>A lot of people hate the series for changing so much; I personally feel the movies come out better that way. The racing movies felt like straight-to-DVD trash and I feel the series would probably head down that road if not for the insane stunts and action.<br/><br/>Should you see Furious 7? I think so. If you're a fan, you'll love it and if you love action films, you'll find some of the better car chase sequences of recent memory. But the biggest problem I have--the reason I give it a 5--is that it has no staying power. It's a one-and-done movie that you won't need to see again, nor probably want to."

The end was very cloying but it was fitting for the loss of Paul, the only man in the film that could act.

What's with those awkward ""drama"" scenes?! (Like the one Letty harshly says 'Goodbye, Dom!' What the...?!) I wasn't there, I didn't feel ANY connection with the characters! I wasn't feeling sorry for them! Dom's last action scene (the big jump) is... lame. I was like ""well, you deserve to die now, for you're way too stupid"". I must admit, Letty's speech afterwards is emotional. I should better talk about the scenes I liked, because the scenes I didn't like are way too many. Anyway.

","An air of impending alarm hangs over 'Furious 7′. Every time the late Paul Walker is on screen, you wonder if this was the last scene he shot, and even the cruelty of watching it now given the circumstances of his death. Paul Walker, the non-bald, non-bicep-flexing hero of this franchise, died in a car crash midway through shooting. The film later used previous footage, body doubles (including Walker's brothers) and some tech wizardry to complete his scenes. It's a smooth exercise, ensuring that the actor with the unquestionable charm is a constant presence. However, while this may be enough to get Paul Walker and F&F fans to 'Furious 7′, even the die-hard ones will be hard pressed to find anything new in its chases, crashes and collisions. Except that cars don't just frequently drive off cliffs and other such heights, they also airdrop down to Caucasus mountains, and race off one tower at Abu Dhabi to land inside another, and then another. The last is a quizzical choice, given that some may see traces of 9/11 in the episode. But chances are — and new director James Wan (The Conjuring) and old scriptwriter Chris Morgan realize this — the audiences of 'Furious 7′ are not the discerning type. Otherwise, Azerbaijan's mountain mayhem and the United Arab Emirates's penthouse pandemonium may not pass muster with nary a diplomatic row. Abu Dhabi is a case in point, whose prince has his party gatecrashed into, his house wrecked, his women bodyguards (from reading too many Muammar Gaddafi stories) beaten up, and his car totalled, before Dom (Diesel) and his crew simply walk away and fly out. Wan does keep the wheels turning though, relentlessly. So what starts with Deckard Shaw — Statham, returning after a cameo long back in the franchise — seeking revenge against Dom and his men, becomes a world-war domination story involving black ops, special operation groups, and a bad guy with an all-leather attire (Hounsou). At stake is a software, 'God's Eye', developed by a hacker (Emmanuel), which can trace anyone, anywhere in a jiffy. ""If we had it, we would have traced Osama in a couple of hours,"" says one of those government types with no names played by Russell. When everyone wants it, there is only one person they can think of, which is how Dom and his men, and the still amnesia-stricken Letty (Rodriguez), come in. Brian (Paul Walker), who continues to struggle with domesticity against his ""love of the bullets"", is easily persuaded to join them. Yes, family again hangs around all the time in continued"

Other than that, just like everyday action crime movie that involve some car chase? This one, its just getting more ridiculous and logically impossible since ""Fast Five"", where I think F&F start to lose its sense. The only problem here is Dom, he is so immortal and have the highest confidence ever. He will do a lot of dangerous stuff and will not die out of it, not even a scratch on his neck appear. Actually, this is not his fault anyway, its the writer who wrote this weak script. But I think its OK, they just got 1.3 billion anyway. One thing I think they need to have if they want to make this movie better is, a twist. Because everything happen in this movie is so predictable, we know that Dom & his crew will be alive, the one who died is just some extra who doesn't have any dialogue at all. They need to make this movie more exciting, thrilling and unpredictable.

With Statham as the antagonist, the film feels a little more urgent, and to say that Shaw is the most over the top character in the whole franchise is an understatement. He's like The Terminator, turns up everywhere out of the blue all guns blazing, but when the crew find him, he's usually just sitting there calmly, in the dark, almost as he's psyching himself up for the next major set piece, because it seems as if the film uses his character as a cue for an action sequence.<br/><br/>And it's business as usual for the rest of the crew, Johnson's hardly in it, as he was too busy with earthquakes, and the rest of the characters haven't changed, because they don't need to.<br/><br/>Walkers untimely death is handled with the utmost respect, and I defy anyone not to shed a tear during the final minutes of the film. It's feels as if it's the actors themselves talking about their friend, rather than the characters, and it's a perfect ending to his career.<br/><br/>Some of the effects though for Walker are very noticeable, and there were times when I couldn't help but think of the Burly Brawl from The Matrix Reloaded when the same CGI was used for Weaving.<br/><br/>And there is a scene where the gang are standing in a line and the camera is angler so we never see Brians face, and he is filmed from the back saying something. That really took me out of the movie for a few seconds.<br/><br/>But all in all, it's a solid movie, totally stupid, over the top, and never once in the real world, but that's why this franchise is so big, it takes you away from the real world, and entertains."

We're in the basements of a corporate building with this where makers are trying to piece together a contraption that will make sparks.<br/><br/>Like many of those, it isn't driven by a maker of some vision, it's a matter of how different things come together. It was marketed to teenagers for a couple of films, then Diesel came back bringing notions about family and brotherhood that he can support. That was while Nolan was taking Hollywood by storm so they sent a team to write narrative in that vein. <br/><br/>How it went from nothing to something being seen again widely is basically the production and filmmaking teams changed and some of the parts fit together well enough around Diesel.<br/><br/>I don't find a single one of the films to be great from start to finish but certain hues and stretches in the fourth and fifth worked. Tangible mechanics of car crash. Diesel could anchor formulaic notions in a low key way that didn't grate. The heist team wasn't cleverly fancy like Oceans but that too felt alright - it became about sticking together the way families do. It was the same gravity across all these things.<br/><br/>But now more things in this bloated entry fail to work than actually do and it was always a fragile balance. The energy is less the zip of French Connection and even more the noise of Marvel. The attempt to build Nolan gears into it is like a spare part bolted there.

Another thing that I really like is that the CGI is not to be seen so far, either it's so good or it is oldschool baby~! <br/><br/>2h 2minutes – it is so stupid, I feel my brain cells are dying but there is so much action going on, you don't really have time to bother about it lol<br/><br/>A very nice and touching ending it actually brought some tears to my eyes<br/><br/>tgchan's rating: 6.5 /10"

","So here we are at Furious 7 brought to us in a convoluted way after the death midway in filming of Paul Walker. The series sees Jason Statham after revenge because of the events of the previous movie (A Plot) as the gang evade Statham they are also on a mission to find a micro chip (B Plot) leading to more crazy and over the top stunts including driving out from one Abu Dhabi tower to another for example.<br/><br/>Its an enjoyable and high adrenaline ride but you feel that despite the forced rewrites that the series is running out of gas and the future films will needed to be reworked. As an example look at how Johnson's character was effectively written out after the opening segment and then conveniently pops into the action at the end.<br/><br/>The plot and the villains are rather nonsensical, I suppose given that this one will be the most financially successful yet Universal Pictures will need to be careful not to sit on their laurels as viewers will demand better stories and more plausible settings."

","First of all if you're going to watch the movie in a cinema, try to get something to protect your ears! All you see throughout the movie are explosions. The movie does not really seem to have a script, it's all ""let's take our guns and go""! The movie was so ridiculous that everyone was just laughing all the time. And seriously, I had never seen a movie where the main characters were so surprisingly invincible! The guy's car gets crashed, they take him out without an scratch, and try to resuscitate, then suddenly the other female character says stop, and she telling the guy a story brings him back to life! I have two words for this movie, STUPID and LOUD!"

","I greatly enjoyed the first Fast and The Furious movie; it was about the illegals and illegal drag racing, which us kids were involved in back in 2001. It was about the hooked up cars and modifications. Since Fast and Furious became a franchise, I've been disinterested in seeing any its sequels; they just lack substance, and a real story to get into. <br/><br/>Fast and Furious 7 had too many impossible scenes, almost a comic style reality where anything is possible. Flying cars? No problem, it was just horrible. I wanted to leave, I saw a few people leaving the theater, at one point I closed my eyes to sleep.<br/><br/>Honestly I don't even know what the movie was about, other than that 80% of the time, was shooting, things blowing up, racing, crashing, and so on. It just sucked!"
"room102","Null","1","17","9 October 2015"," Watch the scene starting at the 40 min mark. Skip the rest.
","I'm not following the series and I'm not sure how to rate such a moronic movie, so I'll just rate it based on entertainment value.<br/><br/>All the talking and background ""story"" is boring and you can skip all of that.<br/><br/>When it comes to the few major action scenes, it's better. There are some nice chases and stunts. However, there are 2 major problems with them: 1. ""Michael Bay"" extreme close-ups and extremely fast editing which sometimes doesn't even let you understand what is going on in the scene. 2. It's all so over-over-over-the-top that it's completely unrealistic and unbelievable. Cars and people survive giant crashes and falls, everything fits in place by mere chance again and again. Yeah, it happens in every action movie, but not so over the top - there's a limit to the suspension of disbelief, even in this kind of movie. Needless to say, there's no real tension since you know the good guys will always survive/win and the bad guys will always lose - but that's nothing new either.<br/><br/>All in all, the few major action scenes are entertaining, yet extremely unrealistic and sometimes hard to follow. Everything else is not even worth mentioning.<br/><br/>So, the highlight of the movie is a long chase scene starting at the 40 min mark and lasts 20 min - and it's more or less the only reason to even consider watching this movie.<br/><br/>One more thing: I'm not sure how much Paul Walker had to film before dying, but I was surprised to see that he was left as a main character throughout the entire movie! So either he filmed most of his stuff, or they did a very good job with body doubles (including his two brothers) and CGI. Being non-PC, I have to say that Walker's death added a lot of publicity to this film and will probably have a great contribution to its success - I myself didn't follow the series, yet watched this one."

","The seventh instalment in The Fast and the Furious franchise, Furious 7 packs in all the big- budget blockbuster ingredients to give its viewers an extravaganza worth the price of their ticket but in its aim to provide a larger-than-life entertainment, it ends up becoming so over- the-top, overdone & overlong that the whole experience of sitting through it doesn't amount to much in the end.<br/><br/>Taking place after the events that transpired in Tokyo Drift, Furious 7 finds Dominic Toretto & his family back in the United States after he & his team earned their amnesty by finishing the job they were assigned in the previous chapter. But their peaceful life is soon disrupted when Deckard Shaw begins seeking revenge for his comatose brother by eliminating Dom's crew one by one, thus forcing Dom to reassemble his team to stop him.<br/><br/>Directed by James Wan (best known for Saw, Insidious & The Conjuring), Furious 7 marks his first attempt at blockbuster filmmaking and while he does a good job when compared to the big-screen spectacles released these days, the very sense of fun which made previous two instalments such an enjoyable ride is sort of missing here. The main plot is compelling to an extent but it is unnecessarily contaminated with a needless subplot it could've done without.<br/><br/>The screenplay makes use of almost every clichÃ© one can find in a story like this plus all its attempts at humour fall flat most times or isn't as well timed as before. Set pieces do get an upgrade, cars include both old-school & modern beasts, Cinematography is a letdown for the camera is in motion even when it isn't required but its action sequences are wonderfully photographed. Editing isn't up to mark either as a number of scenes are just thrown in and don't play any role in the final outcome.<br/><br/>As far as visual effects go, Fast Five reverted to the old-school formula and made extensive use of practical effects. Fast & Furious 6 wasn't far behind but it nevertheless used CGI for a few ambitious/ridiculous sequences. Furious 7 however goes completely overboard when it comes to the use of CGI and actually revels in it as its action set pieces are too absurd to have any ground for believability. While the previous chapter toyed with the laws of physics, this one simply slaughters it with one ludicrous sequence after another.<br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, the cast brings back the team of Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne Johnson & others, with new additions being Jason Statham, Kurt Russell & Djimon Hounsou. And the sum of all performances is passable at best. It's a shame that Johnson isn't given enough time on the screen, Diesel & Walker carry their roles like they have in the previous chapters, Hounsou's input is just pathetic, Statham is nothing special despite his strong intro, and the arc of every character here is disappointing to a considerable extent.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Furious 7 isn't entirely devoid of fun and can be easily enjoyed if one is used to mindless blockbusters but after the resurrection of this franchise with Fast Five and the continuation of the same momentum in Fast & Furious 6, this vast drop in quality due to more emphasis on its CGI-laden action than its plot or characters wasn't expected, at least not this soon. Nevertheless, there are a few cool stuff to be found here and for the majority of its audience, it will be a much satisfying ride but for a few douchebags like me, Furious 7 is a lost opportunity."

","So I finally got around to watching this, and I actually got more than I bargained for. <br/><br/>F7 reboots the franchise and fixes the chronology, which now looks like this: The Fast & The Furious, Tokyo Drift, Furious 7.<br/><br/>All continuity errors are now solved, and the remaining films are no longer canonical.<br/><br/>F7 was notable for its broad audience appeal. Box office figures showed that it was the first film in the trilogy to be enjoyed equally by gays, blacks, Muslims, and normal people. <br/><br/>Vin Diesel attributed this success to the richness of its cross-cultural references and the broad diversity of its cast (heterosexual whites, heterosexual blacks, more heterosexual whites, and some other heterosexual whites).<br/><br/>I personally found F7 to be the most rewarding and realistic of Vin Diesel's F movies.<br/><br/>I rate Furious 7 at 16.65 on the Haglee Scale, which workes out as a generous 5/10 on IMDb."
"MUFCOK","7","1","18","7 June 2016"," Adrenaline fuelled roller-coaster of a movie with an emotional element, which needs to be viewed without any logical thinking or hopes of realistic storytelling.
","Furious 7, the seventh instalment in the Fast and Furious franchise is bigger than ever; The action scenes are longer, more spectacular, more ridiculous and more adrenaline pumped! It's best for you if you just ignore the plot of the movie and enjoy it for what it is; a fun popcorn flick with some brilliant throwbacks to 90's action movies with its cheesy dialogue and clichÃ© moments.<br/><br/>The action: No matter how you look at it or what overall opinion you have of this movie or indeed the franchise as a whole; the action is breathtakingly good. Of course many scenes are clichÃ© Hollywood with choppy editing and shaky cam, especially is the one on one combat scenes but that is something you should expect when it's a cast of Hollywood actors and not martial arts experts. The car scenes are superb, it has a real heist movie theme and the scene in the base when they drive out of the plane and the tower block scene is ludicrous, practically hilarious but very well made all the same. Instalment upon instalment these movies get bigger and bigger and if you were to rate Furious 7 on the execution and creativity of the action sequences alone, It would be a very strong movie.<br/><br/>The Plot: The plot really is very week and all over the place, it lacks any real cohesion by being far too jumbled, contradicting and fails to maintain basic common sense. Jason Statham plays Shaw, brother to the villain who is defeated in the previous movie, who is after revenge against Vin Diesel and his crew. However Vin Diesel, in order to try and get to Statham first, works with the government to try and obtain a worldwide super tracker which is a very intelligent item which hacks into CCTV all around the world and can locate somebody in a matter of minutes. So while they are chasing the people who have stolen this piece of kit, Statham is also chasing them. No matter where Vin Diesel & co go in the world, Statham crops up trying to kill them while they run away again. Essentially they are chasing a team which have this tracking kit, in order to use the tracker to locate the man who is constantly following them. Yeah, as I said, the plot is stupid and offensive to anybody who has an IQ of 25 and upwards, so it is much better if you simply switch off from that and enjoy the action. It's almost as if they created the action scenes they wanted to use and then struggled to link them together so they came up with pointless reasons for the actors to go to completely different locations for the action sequence to play out, and then for them to move on completely from that location to somewhere new for another blockbuster action scene. Now, I'm not naÃ¯ve, I didn't go into Furious 7 expecting the Shawshank Redemption in terms of story-telling, but at least try and come up with a cohesive , interconnected storyline that we can get immersed into in-between all the action.<br/><br/>Paul Walker: Having watched all 6 previous movies, I was sad to hear of the sudden death of Paul Walker part way through the filming of Furious 7. I was intrigued to know how they would complete the filming of the movie after they announced, against a lot of speculation, that they wouldn't scrap what they had already filmed and they would be completing it. I take my hat off to the whole team and director for what they did, it must have been such a hard task to do it so convincingly but they worked with what they had and pulled it off as best as they could. They apparently used body doubles, CGI and Paul Walkers brother for the scenes filmed after his death. I noticed the body double scenes during the fighting scenes, a couple of one on one scenes we don't see Paul Walkers face, just strategically timed shots of the back/side of his head and lots of body shots. The CGI is a little awkward to see and I can imagine it was upsetting for his family and friends, it isn't used too heavily and looks like a video game character but for certain scenes we really needed to see his face. You can tell the storyline is a little jumbled up due to his death but the final moments were emotional and gave a fitting, heartfelt goodbye to Paul Walker, it wasn't too sloppy and kept within the feel of the franchise. It was in context of the movie but was also felt on a personal level from Vin Diesel.<br/><br/>A big gripe for me was the lack of involvement from the Rock. Whether it was his choice to have a small part due to other commitments or the creators deciding to give him less screen time, whichever it was I thought it was a shame that he didn't have a bigger part. Some of the best scenes come from his presence being in them and to not have him for the majority of this movie was a negative move.<br/><br/>Overall, Fast 7 is a decent action movie with some simply incredible scenes. It's a popcorn flick, and that's it. The plot is a mess and the storytelling is probably the worst of the lot (beside Tokyo Drift, obviously). The send-off to Paul Walker was emotional and fitting, adding something special to the seventh instalment of this franchise. There will be an eight movie, which has been confirmed, I also wouldn't be surprised if there was a ninth, tenth and so on. It's a cash cow, it's not everybody's cup of tea and it's far from perfect but it did entertain me, and that's what it tries to do.<br/><br/>7/10"
"bob the moo","Null","1","18","4 November 2015"," Fun nonsense even if it carries itself with an earnestness it doesn't warrant, and complexity in the action that doesn't add to the fun
","As high-brow as I would like to think I am, I do enjoy a good blockbuster and for many, many years, the Fast & Furious franchise has been there offering up something for that habit. I won't pretend to remember all the films (this is not their role) but mostly I have enjoyed the last couple of the big dumb fun they provide. As a result I was looking forward to this film, while also knowing it would be nonsense. To be fair, the film mostly delivers on that remit, which is to say that it is overblown nonsense, but that it does provide a certain amount of fun with its world which crosses the sexuality of music videos with the action of video games â€“ which is a combination that fits well with the target audience.<br/><br/>This is not to say that Furious Seven gets it right throughout, because it doesn't. Even by the standards of the series, the action is overblown, and the defiance of gravity is extreme, and it doesn't always work. To really be enjoyable and to be 'fun' rather than 'daft' one does need to have some engagement in the action, but in this case the narrative devices and the action sequences are so overblown and lacking in anything to hook to, that it does rather make them overblown, but losing out in the fun a little bit. It is a balance that I think the last couple of films has done better. In addition to this the film carries itself with a bit too much earnestness. Okay, this is the seventh film, which makes this a great franchise with characters which we have in theory invested years in; so perhaps there is justification for some soapy elements to the narrative? Other than the (well handled) ending for Walker, the rest doesn't really work and just seems to take up time that could be better spent.<br/><br/>Actually that time could have been edited out, because as well as carried its longevity a bit too much, it also has a running time that doesn't totally suit it. The content screams disposable and slick, but the 2 hours + running time works against this; it is a film that could have done with fewer 'things' going on, and would have been leaner as a result. Having said that, all those things do bring lots of good cast members onboard, even if most of them don't have a great deal to do. Emmanuel, Hounsou, Russell, even Iggy Azalea â€“ lots of names and faces. It is even nice to see that the film gives Tony Jaa a couple of well shot scenes (not seen him in many of those recently). The regular cast are their usual selves. Walker is slick and fits this series well â€“ the montage at the end shows how much the films will miss him as he is by far the star of the films, regardless what Diesel thinks. Speaking of which, the big man is front and centre of this one, but he never looks natural in front of the camera â€“ his body is awkward and he doesn't look the match of the others in his scenes. Specifically Russell (taking his cheque but at least having fun) and Dwayne Johnson (other commitments but still is a good lead). Statham is a good villain but doesn't get as much use as I would have liked; the usual supporting cast are fun, with Gibson and Luda being quite funny, while Rodriguez at least gives the film one female character who is, well, a character, as opposed to a body part.<br/><br/>The seventh film in this franchise is just what you expect it to be in the broad sweep of things. It is not as fun as the previous films, and it doesn't carry the soapy material, all the baggage, and the longer running time, but when it is being big and dumb with a smile on its face, it is hard not to like."
"prestonwardcondra","7","1","18","18 September 2015"," It was fun but, it's time to end it.
","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie but, I think it's high time this franchise was put to rest. <br/><br/>Shortly after the death of Paul Walker in November 2013, ideas were scrambled on what would happen in Fast and Furious 7 and after watching it, they did a hell of a great job with making the movie have some semblance of a plot without his death, getting in the way of things.<br/><br/>However one thing has been bugging me since 5th one, the fake CGI sequences hamper the action and suspense for me. <br/><br/>I remember there was one part in Fast & Furious 7 where Dom (Vin Diesel) and Brian (Paul Walker) drove through three glass buildings, and the car had no visible damage, glass didn't shatter the windshield, glass didn't fly at them, they escape mostly unscathed just with a few minor few bumps and bruises.<br/><br/>I don't care what state of the art car it was they were in, they would NOT survive going through three glass buildings.<br/><br/>To me whenever they make a Fast and Furious 8, the only way they can possibly taking it forward is that if the President gets kidnapped or something and it's up to Dom and the others to rescue him. After that mission, Dom retires from the drag racing scene for good.<br/><br/>Granted I know Dom gave a great explanation why he's doing this in the first movie but, I think that might be a good way to wrap everything up for good.<br/><br/>This was fun to watch, but it's time to put this series to rest. Enough said."

All of a sudden the characters of the movie are now that of the expendables and the movie is based less on cars and more on hand fights done by super humans surviving insanely unrealistic explosions at close proximity. <br/><br/>We went from a movie (2001) that was about family, betrayal, cars, and love to a movie where they all don't care about their life doing this larger than life stunts and acts for mundane reasons to show how good ""The Crew"" is at what they do.

","Some movies are bad in interesting ways (""Olympus Has Fallen"" and the original ""Independence Day"" come to mind). But ""Furious7"" is a badly written story with a script that shouldn't keep a middle-schooler interested. Nothing makes sense: The main villain appears by magic, entire armed squads appear by magic, helicopters and armed drones appear by magic. The plot disappears by magic. <br/><br/>""Furious7"" is a series of action sequences, allegedly spectacular stunts and special effects separated by...I'm not sure what to call the non-action sequences: Narrative? No, because there is no coherent story told. Exposition? Nope, nothing is set-up or explained. Boring? Pointless? Amateurish? YES! That's it! Amateurish writing. Bring on a script doctor...and pronounce this ""Mission Impossible"" rip-off DOA.<br/><br/>Less than half way through ""Furious Seven"" I was entertaining myself by making mental notes about the illogical, nonsensical, and often irrational elements (dropping cars from an airplane and having them parachute directly onto a roadway!?!?) that are meant to pass as story. BTW---why air-drop the cars onto the roadway? Why not use the same magical device Jason Statham (as Deckard Shaw) used to get to the same site? Or just DRIVE there. <br/><br/>Other fun WTF's: Why did Shaw destroy the hospital on his way to visiting his injured brother? Why does anyone in the Furious gang trust each other since they are constantly keeping secrets about and from each other? Dwayne Johnson (as Hobbs) has a broken collar bone and a fractured arm (which is encased in a cast) but at a critical point in the movie he removes the cast by...wait for it...flexing his bicep and BURSTING the plaster. Never mind the miraculous healing of broken bones which has occurred in such a short period of time that no muscle atrophy has happened, he burst a cast by FLEXING HIS BICEP. I have a mental image of a doctor and several nurses following him out of the hospital yelling ""Your medical record will indicate you left against medical advice!"" The list of such nonsense is as long as the script, so if you get trapped into watching ""F7"" (hey--the F7 key on many computers opens the spell check or thesaurus apps---that's kind of on-the-nose) perhaps you will find some pleasure in finding more plot black-holes.<br/><br/>I rate ""Furious7"" a 2. I'd give it a 1, but there was ONE good line of dialogue:<br/><br/>Letty (to Dom): ""Why didn't you tell me we were married?""<br/><br/>Dom: ""You can't TELL someone they love you.""<br/><br/>Seriously, that's the high point of the script for a very low movie. <br/><br/>I saw ""Furious7"" on a BluRay (it didn't make it any better) I borrowed from the library. Had I paid to see the movie I might have asked my bank to decline payment on the debit card charge.<br/><br/>RIP Paul Walker. At least YOU looked good in the epilogue."
"hissiossi","6","1","19","17 May 2016"," Walker's death doesn't equal good movie
","Let me start by saying that I was emotionally touched by the tribute they gave to Paul Walker. It was so special and I feel sad by his death even though I have only ever seen him in Fast and Furious. His death however does not make this a good movie.<br/><br/>Sure it had good moments and it was full of action and nice cars going fast. However what bothered me most was how Jason Statham felt like a totally ignored opportunity as the main villain here. The writers included too many aspects to this movie. Kurt Russel and his gang of black ops characters felt completely misplaced here.<br/><br/>The truly unrealistic portion of this movie is how Statham, a highly trained assassin who has an exceptional military training, defeats a man like Dwayne Johnson who's twice as big as Vin Diesel and could easily one punch a guy like Statham. Yet Torretto and his street fighting skills were enough to defeat him. Basically with pure anger. Something every true fighter knows to avoid when entering a fight.<br/><br/>The ending was truly disappointing as it lasted too long. I cannot see how in any realm after 9\11 in the US it's possible for a private party to bring out an attack chopper in a highly populated area without being shot down 2 seconds after by fighter jets. <br/><br/>Totally unrealistic overblown action flick with second grade actors. The only thing that makes it great is the cars."

I like the action genre, sure, but this is an aggressively dumb franchise and I usually see Scorsese, Tarantino, Ridley Scott or Spielberg films. But I had no idea that a movie where people drive cars out of an aeroplane, drive a car from one of the Etihad Towers into the other and the Rock breaks his cast off his arm by flexing his muscles would actually make me all emotional at the end. In a year stuffed with action films, this was actually one of the better ones too.

But it may seem that way to general public.<br/><br/>The story was.... well.... just stupid. Eye of god? Really? Track the location with people's cell phone cameras? Couldn't they just put on a mask?

","It would be too hypocritical to say that the Furious 7 might have been more appealing if only the characters were super heroes in full costume and drove extra terrestrial automobiles. Assuming that you can't insist on logic and reasoning if you are a fan of super-hero movies, there should be no reason to not like and enjoy the Fast & Furious franchise.<br/><br/>It wouldn't be untrue to say that the Furious 7 is inspired by the Avengers and the Transformers. But this bunch of non-pretentious super-human beings don't wear super hero suits, and they aren't known by super hero names. They are motor-heads gifted with the skill to mate automobiles with different capabilities and deliver an unassuming hybrid. And their ability to deliver ice cold dialogues with stony expressions is only shadowed by their gut blasting humor.<br/><br/>I wish I'd left the cinema with a t-shirt wet from my drool, watching all the jaw dropping action sequences. But instead I was left with fingers sticky from eating the chokingly sweet caramel popcorn.<br/><br/>Despite being #1 on the IMDb list and scoring over 80% on the Tomatometer, the Furious 7 makes it to the top of my list of 'Super Bad Movies'."
"Buddy-51","7","1","21","24 January 2016"," One of the series' better outings
","Written by Chris Morgan and expertly directed by James Wan, ""Furious 7"" will, of course, be forever remembered as the valedictory film for beloved star Paul Walker, who died tragically in a car crash in 2013. But this seventh in a series that began in 2001 is notable for other things as well.<br/><br/>The movie picks up where the previous one left off, with the team back home after having just brought down a notorious baddie, Owen Shaw, and received a pardon for all their previous legal infractions as a reward. Trouble is Shaw's older brother is out for revenge so he heads to the States to pick off the team one-by-one.<br/><br/>Under normal circumstances, Vin Diesel's wretched acting would be like a black hole in the center of the movie, sucking everything of quality into the void (and Michelle Rodriguez isn't much better). However, in the case of ""Furious 7"" - as it was NOT in many of the previous outings - the other elements are so good that they can withstand the gravitational pressure and keep the movie from collapsing into itself. <br/><br/>The challenge for a decade-and-a-half long series is to keep coming up with new and exciting stunts to maintain the freshness - and ""Furious 7"" meets that challenge head-on. After all, they've done just about everything they possibly could with these cars on terra firma, so why not just drop them out of an airplane as prelude to one of the most spectacular and thrilling automotive chase sequences in movie history? Why not indeed? <br/><br/>In terms of action scenes, that is certainly the high point. The second big set-piece - a chase through the streets of Los Angeles involving some sort of mega-drone or mini-spaceship and exploding skyscrapers (we're practically in ""Avengers"" territory at this point) - is so high-tech and over-the-top that it makes us a little nostalgic for the series that began as a simple tale of a bunch of guys drag-racing just for the sheer hell of it. The ""Fast"" franchise has always operated, to some extent, in the realm of fantasy, but, even in this CGI-crazed era in which we now live, movies can sometimes go just too far. And ""Furious 7"" does at times.<br/><br/>As usual, the action scenes are supplemented by smart-alecky dialogue (some of it quite funny, actually), gooey sentiment and endless corny homilies about the value of camaraderie and family. And, of course, the human body is forced to not only endure more punishment than a human body should but to then bounce back unscathed for yet another go- round.<br/><br/>I must confess that I haven't always been the biggest fan of the ""F&F"" movies, but ""Furious 7"" strikes me as a fitting sendoff for the late Mr. Walker.<br/><br/>And that pitch-perfect coda will have you weeping like a baby."

"amandamadden","1","5","307","8 May 2015"," Worst movie I've seen in a while
","I'll keep this nice and quick and simple. This movie is absolutely awful. I get the whole Paul Walker tribute thing but even that isn't enough to make up for the extent of horrible that this movie easily reaches. I got dragged out there to see it with a few friends, expecting it to be at least half decent (considering how hyped up it is) and I was surprised. Not pleasantly, either.<br/><br/>The acting is absolutely atrocious. The story line is clichÃ© and not even the least bit creative or believable for that matter, but I'll get into that in a moment. Corniest thing I've seen. Maybe ever. Not to mention the fact that it is almost 2.5 hours long! I understand a good movie being that long (i.e. Fight Club) but this was just 2.5 hours of complete idiocy. The only half decent thing about the movie is that it does have some pretty beautiful visuals. Other than that, complete trash. The storyline has been done. It tried to be hard and sentimental, but turned out to be cheesy and weak.<br/><br/>I understand a movie being a bit of a fantasy or having fantastical elements, but this just slaughtered any hope I had left for this film. Various completely unrealistic and predictable fight scenes, cars flying off of planes and through buildings (and still, miraculously, surviving the fall), a ton of things that didn't even make any sense (that might just be because I pretty much kept falling asleep), and a bunch of completely pointless car engine revving and head on collisions. This may seem a bit nit-picky, but the thing that really bugged me throughout the whole thing was the fact that no matter how many intense, violent fights happened, not a single scratch could be found on any of the characters. They rolled a car off a cliff at tremendous speed, crashed a train, got smacked around in horrible fist fights and wrecked pretty much every car that they came in contact with in an incredibly destructive way and still, nothing! They just pop out looking perfect and unscathed! I think that's just poor production and a complete lack of attention to detail.<br/><br/>None of the characters were particularly likable, the only one I even really cared for at all was Brian, Paul Walker's character. Everyone else I pretty much disliked equally. I was disappointed because it had a pretty good cast of actors and actresses and I expected something of much better quality. Overall, waste of time. If you really, really love Fast & Furious franchise, give it a go. But this was just atrocious. Not even remotely worth the $10 theater ticket. But I guess that's a different argument altogether."

The action is bigger and crazier than ever. Jumping from one building to another is not enough. They have to jump one more building and that's what is so fun about this movie. It doesn't care about realism. The movie revels in going over the top. There is an exuberance when the car does another jump when nobody expects it. This movie also has to deal with Paul Walker's death. Director James Wan does it in a classy way with the montage. It actually raises the tension in the bus chase when one is never certain that Paul Walker's character wouldn't be killed right there and then. The fights, the stunts, and the CGI destruction are all top rate. The biggest problem is some of the dialog early on. Some of the exchanges and performances are too overwrought and stale. It reminds me of bad soap opera acting. It starts the movie on the wrong foot but thankfully it stops after the first act. The acting is mostly good with a few exceptions. Tyrese Gibson and Ludicrous have great fun chemistry and I wouldn't mind Nathalie Emmanuel joining the family in the future."
"BA_Harrison","7","0","1","3 March 2020"," More of the same. Which is why I watch them.
","I watched The Fate of the Furious and Hobbs & Shaw without seeing Fast & Furious 7, figuring that it wouldn't matter much since they're all practically the same film anyway: dumb as hell, with extremely silly action sequences, very fast cars, really hot women and indestructible heroes. I wasn't wrong: the plot for 7 is fairly forgettable: the good guys try to stop the bad guys from using a surveillance program that can locate anyone, anywhere on the planet. Meanwhile, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks revenge for his brother, targeting Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his team. It's not a particularly imaginative or compelling storyline, but it's the outrageous action that really matters, and director James Wan really goes for broke, delivering some of the craziest big-budget carnage to ever hit the silver screen, never allowing the laws of physics or the mortality of his characters to get in the way of sheer spectacle.<br/><br/>As the movie unfolds, numerous expensive vehicles are trashed and buildings are wrecked, but none of the good guys gets so much as a scratch, not even when involved in a high-speed head-on collision or when leaping from a speeding car onto tarmac. None of it is meant to be taken seriously, and those looking for any semblance of realism will be sorely disappointed. Die-hard fans of the series, however, will no doubt love the sight of Dom and Brian (Paul Walker) hurtling from one high-rise penthouse to another in a W Motors Lykan Hypersport (I admit it... I had to look that up) and Dwayne Johnson brandishing a mini-gun. For me, though, the highlights were Tony Jaa (as a mean Thai henchman) kicking ass, and the brawl between Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Abu Dhabi bodyguard Kara (scary yet sexy MMA fighter Ronda Rousey, who should definitely team up with Gina Carano for an action film).<br/><br/>7/10, which is how I rated parts 6 and 8 as well."

Now, visually, he manages to create some beautiful shots, and some of his action sequences are really great, in the ridiculous and beyond over the top and physics kind of way the franchise turned into. But I have to blame him for making a movie that chose the easiest and dumbest turn every time something remotely interesting or surprising could've happened. And also for the atrocity of the intro, which is basically an MTV music video.<br/><br/>But that takes me to the writing. Not untalented, because I really like how they, movie after movie, manage to connect the whole franchise. But as soon as they have to write the dialogue and exposition, they turn into the worst. This might be related to the fact that the lead actors are atrocious, but still.<br/><br/>But that takes me to the acting. How can I only blame the writers when they can't expect even one good/decent acting scene from the cast (other than Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson). Vin Diesel's acting is regressing from a very low point. The same is happening with Michelle Rodriguez. The rest never had any potential.<br/><br/>Whatever.

The makes of this franchise know what people want to see and this delivers even more of it. The action is non-stop, the stunts are ridiculously insane and the characters are over the top macho versions of themselves. The ending was also a very sweet memorial to Paul Walker. Jason Statham makes for an incredible villain that I actually think they underused just a little bit but he still is great in his role. Vin Diesel is exactly what everyone wants him to be in the film and he is great at it. I don't particularly see why this instalment seemed to be so massive compared to the others but then I also get at an enormous run time and the scope of the action that this is as close to action-epic as you get. It was definitely a fun watch and gets the adrenaline pumping and is anything but boring.

Basically following the defeat of Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), and past crime pardoned, Dominic ""Dom"" Toretto (Vin Diesel), former FBI agent Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) and the rest of their team have returned to America to live normal lives again.

Shaw next breaks into the office of DSS (Diplomatic Security Service) agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson) to extract profiles of Dom's crew, he and Hobbs fight, Shaw escapes after detonating a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom learns from his sister Mia (Jordana Brewster) that she is pregnant again, he convinces her to tell Brian, but Dom is called by Shaw, who is in Tokyo, Japan, he detonates a bomb that kills team member Han Seoul-Oh (Sung Kang). Dom visits Hobbsijn hospital, he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother, Dom travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, he also meets with and races Han's friend Sean Boswell (Lucas Black), who gives him personal items found at the crash site. At Han's funeral in Los Angeles, Dom notices a car observing them, after a chase he catches the driver, it is Shaw, they prepare to fight, but Shaw flees when a covert ops team arrives and opens fire. The team are led by Frank Petty aka Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell), he offers to help Dom in stopping Shaw, if he helps him to obtain God's Eye, a computer program that can use any digital device to track down people and turn a device into a weapon, and they must save its British hacker creator Ramsey (Nathalie Emmanuel) from a mercenary named Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). Dom, Brian, Letty, Roman Pearce (Tyrese Gibson), and Tej Parker (Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges) airdrop their cars over the Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, they ambush Jakande's convoy and rescue Ramsey, she tells them she gave the flash drive containing God's Eye to a friend in Abu Dhabi. The team there and find the friend, Safar (Ali Fazal), who has sold the drive to a a billionaire, this leads the team to a party where they plan to get it back, they escape after Letty fights with Kara (Ronda Rousey), the Head of Security for the billionaire, and Dom and Brian use a fast car, with brakes damaged and crashing through the near buildings. The team use God's Eye to track down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory; Dom, Brian, Petty and his team attempt to capture him, but Jakande and his men ambush them, they flee and Jakande obtain God's Eye. Petty requests to be evacuated by helicopter when he is injured, Brian and Dom continue without him, the team have no choice but to pursue Shaw, Jakande and his men to Los Angeles, meanwhile Brian calls Mia, she tells him about her pregnancy, he promises he will retire and fully dedicate himself dedicate to her and their children, once they deal with Shaw. Brian and the team are pursued by Jakande in a stealth helicopter, and with an aerial drone, Ramsey attempts to hack into God's Eye, Hobbs watches the team in trouble on the news, he leaves the hospital, and eventually catches up, to destroy the drone with an ambulance. Ramsey regains control of God's Eye and shuts it down, Brian engages Jakande's team member Kiet (Tony Jaa) and kills him when he falls down an elevator shaft. Dom and Shaw engage in an aggressive brawl in a parking lot, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both, Shaw is defeated when the parking lot ground collapses beneath him, Dom launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, throwing a bag of grenades with it, Hobbs shoots at the bag, the helicopter is destroyed and Jakande is killed. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead, Letty cradles him and reveals she has regained all her memories, including their wedding day, Dom regains consciousness, simply saying ""It's about time."" Shaw is taken by Hobbs to a secret high security prison; Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe Brian and Mia playing with their son, they acknowledge Brian is better off retired with his family. In the end, Dom silently leaves, Ramsey asks if he's going to say goodbye, Dom says, ""It's never goodbye."", but Brian catches up with him at a crossroad, as Dom remembers the times he had with Brian (with flashbacks from the previous films), they bid each other farewell and drive off in separate directions. Also starring Elsa Pataky as Elena, Wonder Woman's Gal Gadot as Gisele and singer Iggy Azalea as Female Racer. Diesel delivers as the team leader, Walker gives a good final performance, his remaining scenes completed by younger brothers Caleb and Codym and brilliant CGI, there is good banter between the supporting cast, and Statham is a suitably nasty villain. The majority of the films have been more style over substance, thankfully this has a well crafted story, especially the moving and fitting goodbye to Walker, featuring the brilliant chart-topping and Golden Globe nominated ""See You Again"" by Wiz Khalifa feat. Charlie Puth (which overtook ""Gangnam Style"" as the most watched video on YouTube). Obviously there are the over-the-top moments that border on ridiculous (cars dropping from the sky and parachuting), but you can't complain with the many cool cars, and exciting stunts, chases and explosions, a really entertaining action thriller. Very good!"

","Another year, another FAST & FURIOUS movie, this one standing out as being the last to feature Paul Walker due to his untimely death in a car accident (what else?). As such the film plays out as a tribute to the actor of sorts, particularly at the climax, and it's occasionally distracting to see his role completed by old clips, stand-ins, and CGI. The rest is business as usual.<br/><br/>Having hospitalised Luke Evans in the last movie, this new film sees Jason Statham on the rampage and seeking revenge on our team. He begins the film by putting The Rock in traction before crossing wits with the normal crew in a variety of exotic locations including the UAE. This film is overlong and features a variety of drawn-out sequences which are completely unbelievable for anyone with a basic understanding of the laws of physics; the writer seems obsessed with having cars flying through the sky, a theme which pops up time and again.<br/><br/>Fans of the series will know what to expect by now and this is very much in the spirit of the previous instalment. There's a stand-out multi-vehicle car chase which is a real highlight along with some tough fight scenes and a lot of CGI heavy explosive action. Statham is on great form even as villain and he does show Vin Diesel up when he appears. Newcomers include Nathalie Emmanuel and Kurt Russell, who are both welcome presences. Best of the lot is my personal favourite Tony Jaa, who has more to do than in the recent XXX: RETURN OF XANDER CAGE."

","Review: The Fast & the Furious 7<br/><br/>Do you like street racing, violence, and fancy cars? Because the Fast and the Furious series had all of that and even a little more. But from the older movies like 1,2, 3, and 4 till now those movies were the a starting point for each movie like in 5, 6, and 7 the stories from the older ones were brought back to be dealt with. Actors like Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Jordana Brewster, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous and Sung Kang were all in most of the movies and with these characters they made these movies great to see. In Fast and the Furious 7 these characters were all in except Sung Kang because his character in the previous movie was killed in a car accident while racing. This movie gradually picks up from that point in the story and they build off of that. The Fast and the Furious 7 starts when Han is dead and a bomb that was sent to Dom house (1327) and when Deckard Shaw called to say ""you don't know me but your about too"" then the bomb blows up there whole house right after Mia (Jordana Brewster) told Dom (Vin Diesel) she was pregnant but she still never told Brian (Paul Walker). Then Dom goes to Han's funeral and sees Shaw so he takes in his car after him. They meet up and crash into each other but then while they were going to fight Mr. Nobody shows up to save Dom but allowing Deckard to escape. Eventually they work together to stop Deckard Shaw and meet a hacker by the name of Ramsey who created something known as god's eye, Which helps to find anyone in the world. Also in this movie Letty will find her memory back from all the tragedies that happened in the older movies. To me this was good but the one thing that makes this movie special is that it was the last one Paul Walker will be in because of his death. At the end they pay tribute to Paul Walker and send him to heaven in style."
"lev-nemkin","10","0","3","21 January 2017"," Amazing film and a great tribute to Paul Walker...
","I've seen this film quite a few times now I remember first seeing it in theaters in May 2015 the tribute to Paul Walker at the end with the song See You Again really brought tears to my eyes I still can't believe that he's gone...gone but not forgotten by his Fast and Furious family I loved I could tell that what Dom was saying at the end was really from the heart Vin Diesel really thought of Paul Walker as his brother in real life as well as in the films and that really touched me. We all know what this last film is about...Deckard Shaw seeks revenge on Dom and his crew for crippling his brother in Fast and Furious 6 you see how he goes after Han first then hacks into Hobbs' computer to find out who else was involved after calling Dom and sending him a message by blowing up his house so this is pretty much an action/revenge film in the end Deckard and Dom have a street fight which is pretty epic the soundtrack in this is also amazing to me this is probably Vin Diesel's best performance in the Fast and Furious series I also loved Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw and I'm glad he's coming back in The Fate of The Furious which is coming out this April but for me I don't think it will top this one it looks awesome but not as good as this. Paul Walker you are missed R.I.P. I give this a 10/10 and if you're a fan of the films and have not yet seen this I strongly advise that you do."
"The-Sarkologist","7","0","1","12 December 2016"," Walker's Last Hurrah
","I have to admit that there was something of a dark cloud hanging over this film, especially with the closing shot that was in effect saying goodbye to the late Paul Walker, who died in a rather tragic car accident. I guess the death did impact the film, and the cast and crew, especially since it happened halfway through the filming. Mind you, with the technology that we have now the fact that Walker wasn't able to complete the movie doesn't really stand out unlike other films such as The Crow, and Peter Sellers (where the entire second half of the film had to be rewritten due to his death).<br/><br/>Anyway, this film follows directly on from the previous film, and a few lose ends up have been tied up as well. First of all Han, who was a major character in the last four films had to meet his end, especially since we know that he died in Tokyo Drift. So, what happens at the end of the previous film, and the beginning of this one, is a more detailed explanation of his death,.It turns out that the bad guy from the previous film – Owen Shaw – has a brother, Deckard Shaw, who is none too happy that his brother has met a rather bad end, so he decides to hunt down the team that killed him. As it turns out Deckard is an incredibly nasty piece of work, and with Jason Stratham playing him certainly adds a lot of punch to the character.<br/><br/>Actually, it was when I found out that Stratham was playing the bad guy in this film that I suddenly decided that I wanted to watch the series, and while the first lot were pretty forgettable, by the time we get here the films are becoming pretty intense action wise. In fact in this one we have drones flying about Los Angeles launching missiles here, there, and all over the place. Mind you, the film doesn't take place entirely in Los Angeles because we travel to Dubai and the Caucauses to have some pretty intense action, and car racing, shots there.<br/><br/>Actually, one of the things that they have managed to do well (or Lim at least), is to merge what originally was a film about car racing into a full blown action movie with some pretty intense car chases. The thing is that car chases have been a staple of pretty much most action films, however what we have in the Fast and Furious series are precision drivers who add another dimension to the car chases. In a way by making them full blown action films, and taking them away from the race tracks and putting them on city streets where they are being chased and hounded by bad guys, mercenaries, and special ops forces give is a pretty decent edge.<br/><br/>Mind you, as I mentioned, the film is stained somewhat with the passing of Paul Walker – in a way you know that he won't be appearing in any more of the films, and it is going to feel different without him. Sure, Vin Diesel and The Rock certainly stand out, and in some ways Diesel is the centerpiece of the film, however since Walker has been in all of them except for number three (and the fact that Johnson seems to sit most of this film out, with his character being consigned to a hospital bed), the series just isn't going to feel the same."
"fluturoj","6","0","17","2 September 2016"," Emotional
","Being a fan of Paul, the end was quite emotional and touching and I must say they have done an amazing job of not letting his absence be felt in the movie. A goodbye well done and well handled.<br/><br/>In general now I expected more from the movie. The only thing that I like about it was the storyline and telling. It has a great development of events so hats off to the writers. Characters however, are not done so great. They lack depth or character dilemmas. I think Deckard Shaw will develop more in the next part so maybe thats why in this one it was so hallow. <br/><br/>Some of the fight scenes were done great such as that between Toretto and Shaw in the end, and some were done poorly like the fighting scene at the beginning between Toretto and Hobbs. <br/><br/>I felt that the tried too hard to make it 'cool' and used too many 'catch' phrases in the attempt. They said out loud what should have been implied and left to said in the minds of the audience. When you do that you risk in not showing the audience what you want but telling them which is always poor. <br/><br/>There were scenes that just are cringy and don't make sense like Toretto waking up from the dead just because Letty says she remembers everything. Or that Ramsey will help them without thinking twice. Because they are loyal to each other? What if they were loyal but used all the good that comes with that for evil reasons? She has no motive to believe or help them at all. And while we are talking about her who is she? All we know about her is that she is good with computers. The shallowest character I have ever seen. <br/><br/>So a lot of things that I dint like but it has a solid story (a substory wishing a greater story) which I liked and which made the movie interesting enough. Some of the action scenes were also well done that make the movie quite enjoyable."

","While not reaching the mighty heights of fast five (my favourite in the series) it is a marked improvement on fast 6. Though the plot is kind of ridiculous it makes you ignore many illogical things in the movie like vin diesel driving into three buildings and stuff like that. Jason statham puts in a good performance and there are more annoying one liners from tyrese this movie perfectly kicked off the summer blockbuster season of 2015 and surely thrilled a lot of fans. Now as for the ending, that is definitely one of the best i ever seen ever. It was so touching and i felt that paul walker would smile from heaven if he saw that.

","I'm not a car fan. I know just enough to get me by with owning one but for some reason, I love these movies.<br/><br/>I can't tell you what the hell they are driving but there look nice!<br/><br/>If you watch these films and expect cinematic brilliance, then you are going to be very disappointed! It's just some mindless fun to sit back, turn your brain off for 90 or so minutes and watch some awesome action with awesome stunts!<br/><br/>I've loved this cast from the beginning, which is probably why Tokyo Drift is my least favourite, and with every movie they just seem to get closer and closer, as both characters and actors, which translates onto the screen.<br/><br/>You knew things were going to get to a point where they would get sad and that happened when you started to notice that it wasn't Paul Walker you were seeing. There was one scene in particular where his face was constantly obscured - be it by shadows, camera angles or just plain back of the head views.<br/><br/>I do wonder how the film would have gone if Paul hadn't died, how much of the story changed.<br/><br/>I'm very glad they didn't kill him off at the end, I think it would have been very cheap but the baby storyline was obviously only an inclusion due to his death because you never see anyone directly tell him and when he has a phone call with Mia and she tells him the news, he doesn't say anything about it.<br/><br/>I can't even imagine how hard it would have been for the cast 1) to lose him but then 2) to watch his brothers have to come in and play him, especially in the final scene.<br/><br/>An awesome movie, just something to sit back and enjoy. Will be watching again and will also be purchasing when it comes out on Blu-ray!"

","The sudden death of Paul Walker in late November 2013, by car accident nonetheless, prompted a whirlwind of shock and tears from the film and car community. One of their own was taken by the very same vice he used to propel his name in film and exercise his passion in the real world. It was a stern reminder to people of two very important things: one, as much as we can go see each new installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise, we must remember that cars are weapons that many of us operate or embrace each and every day and, two, that living religiously by your passion can also warrant you dead by that same passion, and in my mind, that's not a bad way to go.<br/><br/>With Walker's death and a cast and crew in mourning, the completion of the seventh installment of The Fast and the Furious franchise was in limbo. Using the process of CGI, an elaborate digital program that allowed for flawless facial reconstruction, casting Cody and Caleb Walker, Paul's brothers, to double as him in numerous scenes, and not focusing too intently on Cody or Caleb during his scenes with close-ups or long takes, Furious 7 was able to be completed and now serves as a satisfying sendoff to an actor that, even non-fans can agree, was taken too soon.<br/><br/>At any rate, it must've been tough being Paul Walker's Brian O'Conner character. Not only can you not make up your mind about whether or not you want to leave the FBI or become a full-time fugitive/street-racer, as of late, you're raising a kid with another in tow and have gone from driving tricked-out hot-rods boasting nitrous to a minivan - a vehicle with a sliding door you can't even figure out how to operate. Such is life for O'Conner in Furious 7, as him, his wife Mia (Jordana Brewster), her brother Dom (Vin Diesel), and his wife Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) have returned to the United States after having their fugitive status revoked by U.S. Diplomatic Security Service agent Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson). The gang are trying to live a normal, suburban life when a mysterious package is sent to them from Tokyo and subsequently explodes, causing their home to blow up in smithereens.<br/><br/>The bomb was delivered by Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), the brother of Owen Shaw from Fast & Furious 6, who has come for vengeance. Deckard's plan is to exterminate each and every member of Dom's crew, and after successfully killing Dom's trusty mechanic and do-all man Han (Sung Kang) and putting Hobbs in the hospital, Dom knows he's not playing around. Brian, who has admitted not only to missing the bullets and the gunfire above all the racing and the girls that came with it, and Dom have no choice but to round up the remainder of their crew to try and settle the score.<br/><br/>The first three Fast and the Furious films were all playful romps that exuded some level of believable qualities and a method to their madness. The fourth film began the descent into grittier action territory, while the fifth film unevenly merged the silliness with the sleek action formula that created a lesser Italian Job film of sorts. The sixth film, the first good film in the franchise since the second, successfully merged the sleek with the silly, emphasizing some pathos and interjecting it in with some seriously eye-popping action sequences. Furious 7, on the other hand, is entirely absurd; a highly energized film filled with muscle and emotion (but not enough to corrupt any masculinity, I assure you), it manages to crank up the lunacy to entirely new levels. While the film may be reset in Los Angeles, it's a Los Angeles that ostensibly takes place on an entirely different planet. Most setups and occurrences in this film are so baffling and logic-defying, they make the famous ""safe"" scene I expanded upon in my review of Fast Five look completely and totally plausible.<br/><br/>While these sound like criticisms, they are most certainly not. Each Fast and the Furious film comes with a truly riveting and memorable race scene, and this film's most notable one is the series' most bizarre, and this is also considering the opening scene of the fourth film. It involves Brian and Dom escaping a high-rise building in an unfathomable sports car by smashing through its glass front. That seems pretty standard on the surface, until you realize that the two are about sixty stories in the sky and smash through the glass front of the window and successfully land on another skyscraper only to do the same thing and leap to another skyscraper. Watching this play out gave me the feeling that the homey Fast and the Furious films, the first and second one specifically, that echoed those fathomable sensibilities I mentioned earlier are long gone.<br/><br/>Unlike the repetitive and almost entirely unrelated Fast Five, Furious 7 keeps the emotional pull here, with the constant emphasis on family and brotherhood in a way that, as cliché as it is, tugs at the heartstrings given the real-life circumstances that really brought this film together. Here, we begin to see Brian and Dom as real people, despite them being ostensibly immune to damn near everything.<br/><br/>This is a film that's a sendoff, a love-letter to itself and the communities it helped build and inspire, and those who have watched these characters for well over a decade and have grown to respect them as if they were in their own car group. The film is one big, celebratory ""cheers,"" and the multitude of cars revving and reaching incalculable speeds is another way of hearing the ""clink"" the champagne glasses - or Corona Extra bottles - make when brought in contact with one another. Drink up."

","Finally, the anticipated Furious 7 has been released in theaters! Get ready to experience some next level action, as cars jump out of planes and buildings! Just like the rest of the series, Furious 7 has some action and it's very exciting! But it is also very emotional, and it was genuinely moving at times. As you all know, one of the main actors, Paul Walker died last year in a car crash while in the filming process of this movie. Due to his passing during the production of the movie, his two brothers had to replace him with the help of CGI work. It was extremely devastating for the entire cast and crew. They even had to take a step back to figure out if they could finish it and how. Luckily, director James Wan created an amazing finale that was absolutely beautiful for the character and to Paul Walker's memory. <br/><br/>In many ways, this franchise has evolved so much from where they started. They were able to embrace diversity and use that as a strength! My eyes teared up as the music ""See You Again"" started playing, not just because it was wonderful, but it brought to me so many memories from the times when Brian O' Conner (Paul Walker) was on screen. Also, the song goes well with the movie because the characters are well known for their gangster style family. <br/><br/>Unlike the previous Fast and Furious movie series, you can jump right in even though you've never seen any of the Fast and Furious series. The film opens with an introduction of Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). He seeks revenge against Domonic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his family for injuring his brother. That's it. The movie plot is that simple! However, there are a lot of complicated technicalities that the screenwriter throws at the audience. But in the end, the film is driven by the most underlying motivations. <br/><br/>The plot is unimportant. Family is everything, and ""Furious 7"" is a blast! The movie director of ""Saw"" and ""Conjuring"", James Wan did a great job in making a confident jump to a big budget action filmmaking. He tries everything to make sure that every scene has a sense of momentum, whether it's just the dialogue or one of those crazy monster action scenes. We are not sure if the next movie will come out, but it will sure feel empty without Paul Walker. <br/><br/>84/100"

","Through most of the movie I was waiting for the tragic death of Paul Walker's character. It says something about the franchise that they didn't go that way. That instead the movie gave Paul Walkers character a kind of happy ending. The movie itself became more of a tribute to him and in so doing that lifted itself out of a mere action movie into something more. Yes there are the usual things you see in the franchise. This is a high octane action movie after all. There is a scene where you literally see a car flying from one building to the next. Hell flying cars is what made this franchise famous. Like every version of the franchise it has its flaws. However if you like Fast & Furious movies I would highly recommend this one. If for nothing else then to say goodby to Paul Walker."
"squarterman-86176","7","0","18","1 December 2015"," Good but long and over the top
","I have been a huge fan of the F&F movies since the beginning, with my personal favorites being 2 Fast 2 Furious, and Tokyo Drift. The recent movies have deviated from the original just street racing and fast cars premise to a more summer blockbuster action type movie. Although it is nice to see a movie be able to adapt what it does since a lot of people weren't fans of just the racing, but I think they changed too much. I fell in love with all the characters when they were just racers with an occasional fight for a girl or because they were in a sticky situation. This new movie along with the previous two while entertaining just has so much over the top action almost as bad as the expendables. The acting is okay but not great, Jason Statham is great in his normal hard ass role, and you know whenever he is on screen you will get some goo fight scenes. Vin Diesel is okay, has some good fight scenes and some ridiculous car stunts, but his one-liners are stale as are the Rocks. Paul Walker is great as usual and I have loved his Brian character since the beginning. They did a great job towards the end with stunt doubles and CGI keeping us from even noticing that he wasn't able to finish shooting the movie because if his untimely death. Ludicrous plays his hacker character well, but Tyrese Gibson's character has become stale also, although some of his lines are funny they are usually not placed well in dialogue. Towards the end they did a good job closing up everything, but I don't like how they left open the possibility of having a 8th installment. I think the way they ended it was great giving Paul Walker the send off the did was awesome so I don't think they should come back and make another movie. My last problem with the movie is that it has a 2 hour plus run time which is kind of long for the type of movie it is. All in all it was a good movie and if you are looking for over the top action, and fast cars and race scenes, and don't care much about a story then you should definitely check it out."

","I'm not a fan of this fast & furious franchise, but it grabbed my look of those movies such as F&F 2011, 2013 and Tokyo Drift(2006). To watch it as racing movies, I think Tokyo Drift had proved it unlike those other seasons ( I haven't watched 1,2 & 4 seasons). But, as a fan of action movies, with the bombastic promotion as usual (same like Marvel's) , I asked myself to forget 100% about racing and just focus on the action and story itself, and take a look at the sports car that just being an eye-catchy of the film than the sexy women ( those cars are really delicious).<br/><br/>The story is the sequel of Tokyo Drift(if not mistaken). It's nothing great or heavy about the plot(fit with an action), it just about Deckard Shaw that want to get revenge of his brother Owen Shaw from Dominic's team due to Fast 6. But what I like is, the story is not going to straight seems like Deckard is chasing Dominic, Dominic is chasing Deckard until the end of the story. It makes this movie has the other little story to show rather than about revenge but it still sticks to the plot where Dominic's team need to save '' , a hacker(seems like that). With surviving this hacker, their job to find Deckard will became easier. The actions that James Wan(director) delivered to us are pretty well fit with the scene to scene. Yes, the actions well showed in full blast with the 250 million USD. The cars jump scene was really making me amazed, I didn't expect about this scene , it's a fresh idea. Regarding to Wikipedia, that scene didn't use CGI at all, it was trained many times, many cars to make this great scene. It didn't make sense at all why this film took 250M USD. But, there is a few scenes that challenged my logic thinking like a scenes ""cars don't fly"" and ""escaping from terrorist at a hill"" etc. It made me a little bit annoying when the action is everything to make the characters keep alive. <br/><br/>For me, the special effect is pretty good but I still can see the weakness at scene ""Brian O'Conner's house exploded"". I don't know about how the others think but I just feel that way. Off course, the CGI was nice for me after all, it's a Hollywood movie guys! About the cinematography, it's well played and the actions captured very well, I felt great for watching it. It's a pop corn flicks, I enjoyed."

","Every Fast and Furious episodes in the series are most likely about cars and action scene, lack stories. Which isn't a bad thing, for some reason. I personally do not mind, although i enjoy a movie with better story. However this episode of the series, which may be the very last we get to see Paul Walker again has probably the better story of the series and outside of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself isn't that bad, nice action scene, really nice action scene. The story is alright, but considering a movie that is base of the characters' relationships (Family comes first, something I believe on) and cars. The movie it self is a personally taste, whether you like action more or story driven movies. I personally don't get why people don't like watching action movies, it still has a story. The quality of it is a debate for another day, but the entire F&F series actually tells a good story. Believe it or not, since its an action based film.<br/><br/>However the biggest thing about this film is Paul walker-RIP. Paul walker passed away on November 30, 2013, at first I was sad, I was fascinated by how the movie is going to be developed when it was half done. But the pain didn't stay for long, considering I'm actually a huge Paul Walker fan. Now that the movie came out, wow. When you finessed the movie, you realized that this is the last time Paul Walker will be in a movie and LUCKILY its the F&F franchise. Let that sink in, the last, very last, Paul walker's movie.<br/><br/>Paul walker's impact on the franchise, is something worth applauds for. Not just the relationship with the cast but how well he represented his character. He did it so well, that you cannot imagine another actor playing Brian O'Conner. Bu Family come first, that was what I learned from the movie. Rest In Peace Paul Walker. You will be missed, in the movie and outside of the movie. To be honest, I don't really know what to write. Im extremely sad that this is the last time I get to see part of Paul walker again."

","Furious 7 was meant to have a lot of action, stunts, and crazy story lines. Do not see this if you expect anything else. There aren't any Oscar performances or anything like that. Vin Diesel is classic with his cheesy acting and terrible one liners. That being said, Furious 7 is a fun movie. Just like in the previous 6, there are fast cars and crazy stunts. At one point Vin Diesel even dead lifted a car. Really? Probably not, but still awesome to see. Another good point was Jason Statham. He really did have a exciting performance as the villain. He battled Vin in crazy situations throughout the movie, and just kept coming back. He even escaped death at the end in a seemingly guaranteed death scene. All this being said, the cheesy one liners are really what put it over the top for me. There were a few times where the ""good guys"" repeated earlier lines to the villains right before a death or intense moment. It really did take a way from the surrounding excitement. All in all, a fun movie, but not a great movie by any means. At the end, there was a nice farewell to Paul Walker. The tribute did a great job of leaving a lasting and warming ending to the movie, and Paul Walker. Paul Walker played his character greatly in this series, and he will be missed in the future. RIP"

","I have not seen all of the ""Furious"" series of movies. But I was a Paul Walker fan since I saw him in 'Pleasantville'. His death in a car crash almost 2 years ago was so close to real life imitating art. Filming for this movie was not yet finished so they had to jump through a few hoops, including using Paul's two brothers as body doubles in unfinished scenes. Plus using some footage and cut footage from prior 'Furious' movies.<br/><br/>All in all it works very well, if we had not known of Paul's death we would never have guessed that he was not involved in the whole shoot. Now 'Furious' movies are not for all tastes but when you look at the box office numbers one must recognize the success of the franchise. I like the 'Furious' movies for the absurd action and sound they provide. Plus the actors are all good, the characters all interesting, and the story is good.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, also a producer, is back as Dominic Toretto and Paul Walker as Brian O'Conner. A new villain is introduced, Jason Statham as Deckard Shaw. He is a trained special ops guy who has turned to crime and in particular he is out to get those who put his brother in the hospital. <br/><br/>So most of the movie has the good guys chasing Shaw and the men who help support his cause. There is a very cool mountainous chase scene supposedly in Eastern Europe but actually filmed on Pike's Peak in Colorado, both the winding roadway to the summit and the crashes down the mountainside. <br/><br/>Michelle Rodriguez is back as Letty, needing to get her memory back. Of course Dwayne Johnson as Hobbs. The cool new character is Kurt Russell as 'Mr. Nobody', providing tactical support for the good guys.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the end, of course, Toretto gets the best of Shaw, and as the movie draws to a close Shaw is shown being put into a maximum security prison cell. I suspect he will escape and be a villain in a future 'Furious' movie. Plus there is a tribute of sorts to the deceased Paul Walker, we see his body double on the beach with his wife and child, then as he and Toretto are in separate cars, driving side-by-side, conversing with windows down, an aerial shot shows the cars parting as they come to a 'Y' in the road, Walker's car going its own way."

","Andrew Sindt<br/><br/>Furious 7 70<br/><br/>Overall, the film was good, with good action scenes, good actors, all with the keyword ""good"", not great. I assure you that I would have gave a much worse review if it wasn't for the great send off for Paul. Before it came out, it was supposedly going to be filled with awesome action sequences with practical effects, seeing the cars drop out of the airplane and all. But it was the opposite. It seemed almost every single scene was filled with CGI. I'm not talking about Cody or Caleb Walker, but the cars and scenery. I've still been told a lot is practical but it sure looks like a computer did most of the action. The story was almost as if a child was writing it. Jumping around from crazy scenario to the next with no character development. And when I say crazy scenario, they are extremely crazy. Every action sequence just had to be filled with at least one moment of something happening and the actor tried to be funny and every person in the audience chuckling to themselves about it. This next comment might be wacky, but the Fast and Furious franchise is almost like the Transformers movies, really, they aren't much different at all; not completely bashing each series though. They are just absurdly crazy. Enough about the bad, the good CGI to it was on Brian O'Connor. I really couldn't tell which one was Paul and which was the CGI. But again, the retirement of Paul's character was extremely touching and I give my best to his family."

","If you want girls, guns, fast cars and lots of explosions this will not disappoint. A mixture of James Bond, Expendables, Mission Impossible, Bourne and the A Team on crack cocaine, the story races along, looking good, with the volume cranked up to ten. In the credits the stunt crew easily outnumber the actors.<br/><br/>The set pieces are outstanding. A motorised parachute drop and car escape from skyscraper to skyscraper stand out. More routine sequences with a coach on the edge of a cliff, and a helicopter and drone attack in a city's streets are no less effective. The script is corny, the cod philosophy risible, the jeopardy unconvincing – but who cares? You have girls, guns, fast cars and lots of explosions.<br/><br/>Jason Statham is solid as the baddie, Vin Diesel is of course cool as **** the hero. Kurt Russell acquits his role well as the mysterious Government Mr Fixit. Djimon Hounsou glowers in an underwritten role, Paul Walker is as reliable as ever and will be missed following his untimely death in a road traffic accident. Director James ""Saw"" Wan is relentless in his storytelling. Nathalie Emmanuel smolders and shimmies as the hacker.<br/><br/>Although the seventh in the series, the drone strikes , hacking, and omniscient surveillance maintains the films contemporaneity and stays abreast of the day, the appeal of a fast car is of course timeless. Fans will be delighted, the curious will have more than enough to engage them,this is no thriller, just an action ride, but an excellent one."

"midas-jacobs","7","0","14","8 August 2015"," An over the top movie, but still fun to watch
","I have watched the extended version so keep that in mind while reading this review, also at the ending of my review are gonna be some spoilers<br/><br/>So Furious 7 is again about Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew. His crew has just lost a member (I am not going to say who they have lost because I want to make this a spoiler free review). This person has been killed by Deckard Shaw. Deckard is the brother of Owen Shaw, Owen was the villain in the previous movie. In furious 6 they almost killed him. Now his brother (Deckard) searches for revenge against Dom and his crew. But now that Deckard has killed someone of their crew they also search for revenge against Deckard...<br/><br/>I did the best as I could to explain the story because it kind of doesn't make sense. If you have already seen the movie you will probably get what I am going to say now, and if you haven't seen the movie you could see this as a minor spoiler. So to find Deckard, Dom and the crew have to search this device that can track Deckard. But with each part that they get closer to finding that device Deckard shows up, He literally shows up almost everywhere they are! So what I don't get is why they just didn't have a whole team of SWATT guys standing there ready to take down Shaw? <br/><br/>OK now that I have said that lets talk about the directing. It is directed by James Wan (the same guy from 'The Conjuring') The begin fight scene between Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Shaw (Jason Statham) is pretty good, not to fast edited, and there are no shaky cams. Also the driving sequences and when they jumped out of the plane with cars was pretty well directed. And the fighting scene in the bus with Brian (Paul Walker) and this Asian guy wasn't directed that great, here was it to fast edited and you couldn't really see what was going on. They also used slow motion very often, it was used nice at times but it was also a lot of the time unnecessary.<br/><br/>Here is a bit more about the writing and acting. Statham was like Statham is in every movie, but his begin lines were pretty good actually, also when he walks out of the hospital it is funny to see all the SWATT guys on the floor because you didn't expect it to be like that. Paul Walker was also pretty good as Brian, he just fits the character. Vin Diesel is what you would expect from Vin Diesel a very monotone acting job. His best scene was at the funeral of the person they have lost. Dwayne Johnson was my favorite character of the crew, and i thought it was stupid that they only put him in the movie for a couple of minutes, but he still acted pretty well. I also liked that they put Hobbs in the hospital so you can see that he is also a human and not some invincible being, but he is the only one that gets hurt in the entire movie, the rest of them are like super humans, because they are also very strong. Natalie Emmanuel was very good, I liked her very much in the movie, Jordana Brewster was good for the part of the movie where she was in, because she (just like Hobbs) had not much screen time. the rest of the crew had Oké performances. The writing was not too bad, the jokes thy put in to the script were funny for most of the times. <br/><br/>I didn't like that they made everyone to powerful, they should have made the characters more human, and venerable. There are a lot of clichés in Furious Seven, but i didn't really mind. Some parts are also pretty over the top, HERE ARE GOING TO BE SOME SPOILERS, like when they jump from the one building to the other and the fighting scenes are sometimes pretty funny. Because it is so over the top. And near the ending of the movie when Dom stamps on the floor and takes down Shaw is just laughable. The ending is also pretty straight forward, the bad guy gets captured, bla bla bla. But the last couple of scenes are very emotional. the special effects are very well done. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this movie, just don't think to much with it and you will have a great time watching it!"
"briggnalle","7","0","13","4 August 2015"," Another thrill ride as promised.
","I love The fast and the furious. Every single movie I love with the passion. It went from a simple cheesy racing/crime movie to revenge and hunting, and then straight to pulling off insane heists in Rio and taking down terrorists. Cheesy? Yes. Entertaining? Absolutely.<br/><br/>Is Furious 7 my favorite? No. But it was still the exciting and entertaining thrill ride every single movie in the series everyone loves. There are good laughs, great racing and action, and beautiful cars. Do I think the series went just crazy after the fifth one? Yes. Yes I did. Do I think the developers and crew ever think about logistics, laws of physics or general safety in thought? Absolutely not. However this series was made just for fun anyway. So what is the harm of going as far and beyond as you possibly can? Just ask Diesel and Walker (RIP), and you'll agree that this story (Among every single one in the series) is yes good and a little cheesy and just plain insane, and intense with all the laughs, race, and people we fans love.<br/><br/>If you are a fan, I say give this a try. If you are a hard-core fan of the series, you need to see this movie. It is an absolute definite, and a great success in my book."

","FF7 has pretty much almost got all you'd expect from the franchise. Almost! But Walker's got replacements so fear not.It's an excellent movie! Well worth the time and money. If you're paying to see some ""real"" action, you're gonna get all that and more. A little bit too much more actually - I'm surprised they get away with it every time. But not this time! <br/><br/>I get it, FF is about really fast cars, but I'm really surprised how much time the cars spend flying through the air instead of on the ground. Paul Walker's character even says: ""cars can't fly"" right in the beginning of the film, as if to illustrate my point! Hack, one guy keeps his vehicle parked at the top of a skyscraper. ""He can do whatever he wants"", they say. Seems like anybody can do whatever they want in this film. Granted, every film has it's sins and flaws but this particular film seemed pretty unapologetic about them. I think Statham makes for the worst villain ever. But we like him so we'll forgive them. The Rock isn't all that funny either.<br/><br/>It has its brilliant sides. For one, the cinematography is exquisite! Aaaannndd.... Yeah, that's pretty much all I enjoyed about it. Don't get me wrong, it's not a complete do- over. It's actually quite good. It knows it's a a fun pop corn movie and lives up to that. Well worth the watch."

","Although as you can imagine, the Fast&Furious franchise will go on. But for those unaware, before the filming was completed one of the main stars throughout the series Paul Walker died in a car accident. That fact alone is terrifying and horrible, the movie therefor got delayed initially. Reshoots were ordered and there is a digital Walker in here (he's not difficult to spot, quite the opposite, though I'm not certain, if we are not there yet, technically or if they chose to do it that way, so people would know).<br/><br/>Whatever the case, the movie knows and plays with the expectation of that fact (and in a very fine way too), while we wait for that resolution to happen. Some might argue, that therefor the movie is too serious, but it's just the way it is. While the way the handled the Paul Walker storyline (or rather his characters) might have blinded some people (for the better concerning the movie, it's tough not to be emotionally involved especially with one particular song that sums things up), the movie itself closes its page on a chapter ... but makes sure you know there is more to come.<br/><br/>A lot of crazy stunts and a Tony Jaa who is actually fitting in the small role he has (something that unfortunately can't be said about his role in Skin Trade). So overall more than a decent effort and if you give the movie special points of how they treated Paul Walkers character (apart from the bad CGI that is), you might feel it deserves an even higher rating."
"the_donace","7","0","14","6 July 2015"," In the 8th movie of the Fast and Furious series....
","In the 8th movie of the Fast and Furious series, the crew led by Domnic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and Brian O'Conner (Paul Walker) is, once again, brought back together against a common threat to their family. After dealing with their last nemesis, Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), returns seeking revenge. In the early stages of the conflict to come, Deckard Shaw comes after the agent, Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), that helped Dom and his crew defeat his brother in the previous movie. This, in turn, leads Hobbs to aid Dom in capturing Shaw, in exchange for this help in rescuing a computer hacker that created an extremely valuable program. The movie begins with the introduction of the new villain in the series. Deckard Shaw is seen inside of a hospital visiting his comatose brother, Owen Shaw. As the scene concludes, it shows that Deckard Shaw broke into the hospital while leaving nothing but destruction behind, exemplifying his ability to cause havoc. Deckard Shaw makes one more move that sets the rest of the movie in motion, he decides to confront Luke Hobbs. Hobbs returns to his office only to find that Deckard Shaw had broken into his office, and was downloading the information on Toretto's family. We see the first ""showdown"" between two of the main characters of the movie, which concluded in Shaw defeating Hobbs and getting away with the information. Now that Toretto's family in involved, the crew is then put together for one more mission. The movie begins its conclusion with Dominic Toretto and Deckard Shaw having a ""streetfight"" on a rooftop parking lot. In the midst of the showdown between Toretto and Shaw, the building that they were standing on was soon to collapse. The conflict between Toretto and Shaw ended as the building collapsed with Shaw falling through the cracks as Toretto looked at him safely from above. Shaw ended up surviving the aftermath of the collapsed building, however, Hobbs had captured him and placed him in a max security prison. <br/><br/>The story was solid as well as interesting, not to mention, a great continuation to the storyline of the series. The director and the writers did a great job with the alteration of the movie after Paul Walker's passing. The altered plot and scene sequencing were great. The writers did a great job, with the ending, writing Paul Walker off of the series while reminiscing on the life of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner, through the earlier parts of the series. The final scene in which Brian O'Conner and Dominic Toretto are racing and then part ways on the road was a great conclusion to the relationship between the two main characters of the series, as in real life. The scenery in the last scene of the movie struck out to me as well, it seemed like an exotic location. The use of sunlight and the seemingly endless road added to the notion of the indefinite parting of Paul Walker's character, Brian O'Conner.<br/><br/>The actors that played the main characters in Dominic Toretto's crew, or family, acted consistently with the direction of their characters given to them by the previous movies. The biggest change in the way a character was played was Michelle Rodriguez's character, Leticia ""Letty"" Ortiz, because she had to deal with amnesia while attempting to continue her relationship with Dominic Toretto. All in all, I found to be good and remained loyal to their fan base."

","Fast and furious 7/ furious 7 is the seventh installment of the fast and furious franchise. The film continues from the events of furious 6. Deckard Shaw the brother of 'Shaw' from furious 6 is back looking for revenge on Dominic Torreto for what he did to his brother previously. <br/><br/>This film is my favorite of the franchise it took a more comedic and thrilling approach and was less about a 'hood family'; which I think was a smart decision by director James Wan, focusing more on the funny stuff than the depressing let's all die together ideals. I think that Tyrese Gibson was really funny in this movie and the dialogue between his character and Ludicrous' character was quite humorous. What I like about and fast and furious movies and can expect from them is hot girls and hot cars in this movie they went all out with the babes and motors with cameos from Iggy Azalea and Ronda Rousey. In this particular film the action wasn't necessarily realistic but amazing to look at for example when Dom (Diesel) and Brian (Walker) drove a car through skyscrapers in Dubai it looked spectacular. Also since Paul tragically passed away, to shoot the rest of the film they had CGI the rest of Paul Walker's scene on to his brother's body and I couldn't tell the difference the CGI was impeccable. <br/><br/>Having said this some of the action was too unrealistic. Usually it all just looks great so we ignore it but the scene where the cars parachuted out of a plane was absolutely crazy and there is no argument for it, no way can cars parachute out of a plane. I also didn't enjoy the moments when Toretto and Letty (Rodriguez) keep on talking about her amnesia and try to bring back her memories with all these references to the previous movies.<br/><br/>Overall I think this was a good film appropriate for some laughs with the lads or whatever."

","The 7th installment of the ""Fast and Furious"" series comes packing with many of the ideas that defined the previous six movies. It never ceases to amaze me how producers are able to create and develop more movie plots or characters as the series goes on because I honestly thought this franchise would not have gone any farther than the fifth movie. However, if you are a person who gets tired of watching the same material used over and over again like the previous films, you will probably not want to spend your money here.

This is in the same caliber, it has a lot of focus on the action and that works out in many ways, both with and without cars. The story is actually also quite fitting and adds a lot of details and together with the beautiful scenery, the bass pumping music and the ode to a great guy (Paul Walker), it is just a good movie, fast moving, high impact and a lot of adrenaline.<br/><br/>I found it very entertaining, with a lot of great things, maybe it gets a bit sentimental, but it is alright and fits the story well."
"saranjoker","7","0","13","26 May 2015"," A tribute to Paulwalker
","One of the most expected movie of the season and didn't disappoint mainly because of stunt choreography and of course Paul Walker.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is just an excuse for some of the best car chase/action scenes recently seen on screen. But then, plot and story is not what you go in expecting when you sign up for a fast and Furious film. You go for men who are men doing stuff you thought laws of physics did not allow, you went for big cars and pretty girls in itsy-bitsy nothings and campy fun. You get a taste of what's to come in the beginning, when Shaw and Dom, much like two testosterone-fuelled bulls, ram their cars into each other head-on. No one backs away; no one bats an eyelid. They then step out of their mangled metal steeds and almost come to blows before Dom is rescued by Frank, who calls himself 'Mr Nobody'. A deal is struck: Dom and his crew will help Frank nab the terrorist Jakande (Hounsou, with some ridiculous lines) and the 'God's Eye' device and in return, Dom can use the device to locate Shaw. Ludicrous is spot-on as the jester, whose cringing caution is a great counterfoil to the rampant machismo on display. The Rock packs some serious weaponry.<br/><br/>At its most basic, a Fast and Furious movie is as weird and contagious as—and more large-hearted than—a Top Gear episode. This one is a blockbuster with smack-you-in-your-face set pieces, death-defying stunts, muscle cars, family-first ethos, ridiculous one-liners which get all the taalis and an apology of a plot. <br/><br/>The extreme action and explosions in the film come interspersed with emotional moments. A funeral scene where the crew is bidding goodbye to a fallen comrade is especially moving given Walker's death. The send-off to Walker's character is so subtle and real that it leaves your eyes moist. Not that you notice too much, with his brothers Caleb and Cody, plus some computer trickery, filling in the gaps.It just feels natural that this glass-shattering, asphalt-breaking film should end so poignantly. Because after cars have been smashed and big-ticket weaponry unleashed, it is really about family, friendship and loss."

","These petrolhead films get more wilder and wilder, each time around, and defy realism, pushing beyond the boundaries of it. You'll find yourself rolling eyes, muttering ""What?"", ""Yeah, right"". Here's a movie, so pumped up with action, and I'm talking real hairy thrills, you can only forgive it, as this is just a too cool flick, with the works, the best in the series I've seen. Think back to the first one, which seemed so basic and small fry. This film again doesn't let you forget not to underestimate it's action, with some nice family moments, concerning Walker and Brewster. Another thing it has going for it, is revenge, with a capital R, ala Mr Straham, a terrorist, who's on a personal vendetta, for his brother who was taken out by the Toretto gang. Watching him and Diesel go head to head, not just in cars, but in that great perpetual fight scene, where we cut back and forth to it, near the finale, were moments I really lapped up. In steps Russell, as what you might call a shadow who works for some kind of intelligence agency, who throws a job their way, a catch 22, if you will. If they accept this job, they'll ensure Straham, won't take out any more of the gang, as having taken out that Asian dude, if you can remember from the third one, and we meet the southern talking likable dude, from the third again briefly. Their mission takes them to a desert city, adding a refreshing change of atmosphere to the film. A city pumping with activity and being a F and F fan, you'll no what kind. Director Wan who's taken a different avenue here, has wholly impressed me, with a movie, so good, you can't pass it up, with more explosive action, bad acting, and humor on behalf of one particular black dude, it's an amazing and underestimated acting spectacular that shoots from all cylinders, and hardly stops, ever. He's created one long cool movie, one to be proud of, but really folks, the series should end here, on such a great note. But no, that need for speed and those tesosterone pumps had to kick in again, didn't it. Pity. I really only saw the late Walker's stand ins in the last couple of scenes, with a nice little tribute to Paul. action spectacular, to be proud of. Excellent."

","Fast? Of course, Furious? Certainly. was it what I expected, definitely. Would I watch it again, no doubt. but was it the best yet, arguably.<br/><br/>Stunned as I was to see the that Paul Walker lasted the entire film. It wasn't the most shocking twist I've seen, yes it was an unbelievable film, yes I regret in slating it in the slightest but honestly, there was a lot of the same things, the romance, the action and the very long fight scenes. <br/><br/>I just felt this year they could of added more. Yes it was an improvement from last year, ever so slightly and I feel this was only due to the amazing ending that payed tribute to Paul Walker, but other than that it was played safe. <br/><br/>Not one of Vin diesels ''family'' died not even the villain (Jason Statham) died. It worked last year with Vin Diesel just making it out alive, but again. Really. <br/><br/>A lot got carried over from the previous fast and furious', a lot we have already seen before and nothing really got tied up at the end of this one. Which leaves us wanting more, that's amazing I'm the first to admit it. I just wish more lose ends were tied, before they start the road to the next one. <br/><br/>Again we are already waiting on number eight and I didn't want to feel like that this year. Although I am complaining about the fact it is opened doors for another fast and furious, which excites me just typing it, this film was excellent and did keep my immersed through the entirety. <br/><br/>I was just waiting on that moment where I thought it really did get me, that wasn't what I was expecting.

"TheFilmGuy1","8","0","4","13 May 2015"," Big, dumb and bloated but still very enjoyable
","Furious 7 is essentially The Raid 2 but with cars. It's big and globe trotting, feeling like a crazy Bond film. It's also pretty stupid. but I will say it seems aware of that... half of the time. It's not my favorite of the series, but it's certainly the biggest, and it can be quite a bit of fun.<br/><br/>The two big flaws here are excess and stupidity. The film is 2 hours and 17 minutes, and it really feels long. As much as I love action, this film is like 92% action scenes, and with a film this length, you need to pad it a bit. Here's an example. The Raid Redemption was almost all action, but it was 90 minutes. When it's sequel turned out to be around 2 and a half hours, they padded it with drama scenes. Here, it can feel a bit like a punch to the skull for its whole run time, making you feel numb from the action and taking away from it. It seems like every 10 seconds there's a punch, slam, boom, or crash. There's guns, cars, explosions, the whole works. When there's too much, it's sensory overload and it all becomes one big ball of loud. It does contain some of the most ambitious action sequences in the whole series, and they are just insane. Cars with parachutes, cars going out windows, you name it. They are pretty well done, with a nice mix of practical and CGI. I did take issue with the way it was shot, as it could be quite shaky and fast paced, and it sometimes moves faster than your brain can process. A highlight for me was a fist fight involving Tony Jaa (who I am glad they didn't put to waste) that is just crazy. There's a scene that has a door going down a flight of stairs with the two fighters on it, and it amazed me, which is very difficult considering the mass amount of action films I have scene. When you can show me something new, I gotta give credit.<br/><br/>I'm sure a lot of people are wondering about the CGI Paul Walker, and I have to say they did a very good job. As someone who has seen a lot of CGI stuff, I could kind of tell when something was off, but it still had me unsure whether I was seeing really good CGI or the real Paul. The person I saw it with said she didn't notice it at all, so I guess that means that the general public won't notice a thing. It's difficult to make a human face look real with CGI, but they do a damn fine job. On that same note, there's a very touching Paul Walker tribute at the end that is tasteful and really well done. It was heart warming to see and they couldn't have done it better.<br/><br/>As I said, the film is kind of stupid. Yeah, the past entries haven't been smart, but they have certainly progressed further and further out of reality, and at this point it might as well be sci fi. There's clichés and stuff that just couldn't happen at all. Unfortunately, it's only self aware what feels like half of the time. It can crack a joke at itself, but other times it just feels cheesy. There's also things like Tyrese Gibsons' character, who they over use. He plays the comic relief, and it works at the right time, but when it feels like every scene includes a quip from him, you just wanna strangle the guy. There's also so many people in here, coming and going, cameos and bigger roles, you name it. Characters from past films in the series pop up for a scene, new actors are brought in as new characters, some of which more substantial than others, such as Kurt Russel being an important character, but Tony Jaa being a henchman. Iggy Azalea even pops up for like 5 seconds. That had me scratching my head a little.<br/><br/>Overall, fans will almost certainly enjoy it. I'm a fan of the series, and I know it's not high art, but I like to have some mindless fun. This film kind of feels like Transformers in that regard, with it's sensory overload of action and long run time, which is probably its biggest downfall for me in all honesty, but there's a lot to like here, and it gives a lot of fan service. My favorite is still Fast Five followed by the first one, but this is a big step above the disappointing 6th film."

"lucasversantvoort","7","0","14","6 May 2015"," Worth it for the ending
","If there's anything that would haunt this film, it's the death of series mainstay Paul Walker. Though it's been probably ten years since I last saw one of these films, I decided to see this seventh entry out of curiosity: how would they handle Walker's death? Would it profoundly affect the movie's premise? The answer is mostly no. Furious 7 never devolves into a trauermarsch of sorts and that's probably a good thing as drama was never this series' strong suit.<br/><br/>Like I said, I didn't see some of the previous entries in the series, but the film is very watchable even so. So basically, some guy, Deckard Shaw, is angry about the main crew hospitalizing his brother, Owen, and he wants his revenge. He kills one of them, off-screen mind you, and puts another in the hospital and blows up Dominic's home, though no one dies. This spurs the crew into action. But wait, there's more. Turns out a group of secret government agents led by Mr. Nobody (Kurt Russell) are after a super-duper hacking device called God's Eye, that hacks every possible camera in the world to constantly narrow down a person's location. A hacker known as Ramsey developed it and is captured by a Somalian terrorist, Mose Jakande (Djimon Hounsou). Mr. Nobody makes a deal with the crew: help him retrieve God's Eye and they can use it to pinpoint Deckard Shaw's location. But wait, there's more! There's also a subplot involving Letty and Dom's relationship. She suffers from amnesia and, though he's a teddy bear towards her, she has doubts about how this'll affect their relationship. But waitthere's more!! There's another subplot involving Brian (Paul Walker) struggling to adapt to being a minivan-driving dad: he misses the bullets and all that.<br/><br/>Man, I don't think the film could be anymore jam-packed with drama in between all the T&A and fancy cars. And therein lies the rub: the film tries too much with only moderate success. The inevitable result is that most of the drama feels like an afterthought. This ironically affects Brian's storyline the most, though you'd think—this being his last appearance—they'd pull out all the dramatic stops on this one. No, the storyline that receives the most attention is Letty and Dom's relationship, but despite Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez's valiant efforts, it's hard to care since it doesn't affect the main storyline. There's never a sense of danger of one of them dying or any of the others for that matter.<br/><br/>This leads us to the action, which is mostly pretty good, but, like I said, suffers from a lack of tension. Anyone watching this series knows it's all about insane stunts and so on which is fine as it allows for scenes like a car flying from one skyscraper to the next, but you'll not find any real tension here.<br/><br/>This leads us to the villain, Deckard, and the same problem applies here. Because the action never generates a sense of dread, of you genuinely fearing for the characters' lives, Deckard loses his potency as well. Not to mention the fact that, due to the gargantuan amount of plot, he rears his head less and less as the film goes on. He's at least more potent a villain than Jakande, who spends most of his time barking orders through his bleached goatee. Forgettable doesn't even begin to describe it.<br/><br/>Yet, despite all my whining, the film has its moments. Some of the action is pretty fun to watch and there's some good comic relief, not to mention a nicely symbolic tribute to Walker at the end. Despite all my complaints about the story, I gotta hand it to them: at least they didn't take the cheap route and integrate Walker's death into the narrative. Can you imagine if Brian had died midway and we'd get shots of the crew sobbing and what not? Not even a 0 to 100 in 3 seconds sports car would top the speed at which my respect for the series would drop. Anyway, for better and for worse, Furious 7's got it all. If you don't go in expecting Walker's death to change the series into something it's not and never will be and instead expect something akin to a summary of what's made the series so popular you'll probably have a good time.<br/><br/>Plus, Kurt Russell absolutely dominates as Mr. Nobody, so there's that too."
"mynameisibrahim","4","0","13","30 April 2015"," Hype and dollars notwithstanding, not as good as Fast Five
","The seventh instalment in the explosive racing turned heist franchise, which has surprisingly seen more mileage than expected, is finally upon us, a year later than scheduled due to the untimely demise of its lead protagonist, Paul Walker. The film is ultimately a celebration of his memory and his contribution to the long running series, which he launched in 2001.<br/><br/>Following their defeat of Owen Shaw and his team, the crew are able to enjoy their reprieve and lead domesticated lives. However, unbeknownst to them, they are now the subject of a crusade led by Shaw's sibling, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who is seeking retribution for his brother.<br/><br/>Given the series' transition from racing to all out vehicular warfare, it is imperative that the action sequences are executed well. Therein lies the film's predominant success. If you thought the plane sequence on the longest runway known to man was a stretch, Furious 7 requires an even greater suspension of disbelief, what with airborne cars leaping across building, off cliffs and from an active aircraft as well.<br/><br/>In going overboard with the action, the story is considerably compromised in the process. A paper thin narrative is accompanied by the lack of palpable consequences for the principal characters. Somehow, they always manage to recover from every collision and accident unscathed, which makes proceedings credulous and less realistic. Moreover, the primary cast's vibrant chemistry and exotic locales spanning several countries is a prominent feature as ever. Sadly, Jason Statham is relegated to being a generic nemesis and lacks his customary swagger. The latest chapter also adds new blood in the form of veteran thespian Kurt Russell, Thai action star Tony Jaa, UFC athlete Ronda Rousey and Game of Thrones' Nathalie Emmanuel, all of which feature in glorified cameos.<br/><br/>The relentless flurry of action also includes several epic confrontations between certain characters. While the muscle men all lock horns, the pick of the bunch is a brutal altercation between two women, namely Michelle Rodriguez and the aforementioned Rousey. In a testosterone fuelled movie, it is a pleasant surprise that the latter shines through when afforded a larger role. All of the brawls are extremely well choreographed. <br/><br/>In a franchise which has always emphasized the significance of family and brotherhood, the final tribute to Paul Walker is particularly poignant. An emotional send-off is matched by a few resonating dialogues, representing a beautiful farewell to the actor.<br/><br/>Slick and stylish but devoid of much substance, the series is showing no signs of slowing down. While it won't be the same without Paul Walker, with three more sequels in the pipeline, the sky's the limit."
"c_magbitang11","10","0","2","28 April 2015"," Why Furious 7 is the way it is and why we should all learn to appreciate it.
","First of all, personally, I love the movie.<br/><br/>I have heard many people complain about the franchise veering off street racing (and racing in general). I have to agree with you. If you came to watch Furious 7 expecting some racing action, then I am sorry but you will be disappointed.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the action in this movie is intense and with constant location jumps, be sure to have your seat-belt on, and try not to sweat. Now the reason for this major jump in action? As Vin, the cast, the producer have constantly emphasized, ""It gets bigger every time"". And to add, the addition of James Wan as the new director of this second trilogy (yes trilogy, I'll explain later), he came with the mindset of a major blockbusting action movie, and he did just that.<br/><br/>So some of you may be upset about the story, but you must come in watching Furious 7 in the mindset of the director and producers, then you can truly appreciate what they are doing.<br/><br/>From this point, I'm just going to explain other Fast and Furious things, feel free to move on or read on.<br/><br/>So first, the trilogies. The first trilogy is 'Fast & Furious' (4), 'Fast Five' (5) & 'Fast & Furious 6' (6). Although the stories are consistent with previous movies (Except Tokyo Drift but the order is a known fact) these were produced separately, and you can say this is where things began to veer of street racing. The next trilogy is 'Furious 7' (7) and then Fast and Furious (8) and (9). Now with the tragic death of Paul Walker, I think they should just stop at 8, some may think it will end at 7, but here's the thing, if Paul Walker was alive, he will call us all 'soft' (or the word used to define a small feline, or the part between a woman's legs) if the franchise was to end after 7. Now whether or not 9 will happen (8 is confirmed) is likely, but after that, there are no plans ready yet.<br/><br/>And just an interesting tip, Furious 7 is actually the movie with most involvement of cars and fighting out of all the movies, involvement in cars however barely includes racing (only the first race in race wars). It also has the least amount of NOS uses. The reason may be more action but also as the movie is longer than the rest (and watching it sure feels like it will never end)<br/><br/>#RIPPaulWalker #RIPRogerRodas"
"takumifujiwara","7","0","13","27 April 2015"," Greatly executed, but could be better still.
","For a movie that is directed by a someone who is generally a horror genre film maker, James Wan could do little wrong. The action sequences were well-planned, but some stunts were just a little over-the-top and defies logic. Sure, many lament that the franchise has since diverted from its original street racing roots, but times have changed. Most viewers are now into actions and explosions rather racing scenes, as evidenced with Need For Speed.<br/><br/>The final scene is probably one of the most beautiful tribute to one of its late actors, but it is not enough to make this movie an all-time great. Still has room for improvement."
"troyputland","7","0","13","27 April 2015"," The biggest and loudest one yet.
","Fast & Furious 7, or just Furious 7 as it's known in the US, is a fitting, endearing tribute to the late Paul Walker. Universal studios have taken the right path in his memory. Films 1-4 were all about the cars and the family, 5 and 6 upped the amp, focusing on the action whilst still holding a substantial plot. 7 follows the latter, resulting in the loudest, gutsiest ride yet. Dominic Toretto (Diesel) and his 'family' have crossed the wrong criminal. Derckard Shaw (Statham), brother of Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), want revenge on those who've put his brother in hospital. Toretto and the gang receive help from a government operation led by Kurt Russell. They cross countries performing some of the biggest feats in stunt history; some thoroughly believable, others highly ludicrous. You've come to the wrong place if you want an intricate plot, but if you want an action packed thrill-of-a-ride, look no further. It's funny, it's bold and the cast smash it with their various personalities. The big question is, how will they handle F&F8? Check out my other film reviews on http://straighttelling.co.uk"
"thvoicwethin","7","0","13","26 April 2015"," Action-packed and lots of property damage, the series is losing its touch.
","Before I get too in-depth, I'd like to add that this series is my childhood, what made me a car guy, and what made me believe that life's too short to drive boring cars. With that through the hoop, I'll continue. Furious 7 is technically a continuation of Tokyo Drift, wherein Furious 6, we lost Gisele in order for Han to stay alive. Before, they (Han and Gisele) talk about moving to Tokyo, and after the scene with the plane, Han says (not verbatim) ""I'm going to Japan, just something I gotta do."" Then, in Tokyo Drift, Han is rammed by a Mercedes, his RX7 catches on fire, and he presumably dies. This is where we find out...<br/><br/>It was Shaw's brother Deckard. Onto all the fight scenes and endless action! Furious 7 was so action-packed that it seemed to lose its roots from the previous films. Tanks, planes, one-off cars, and a lot of wicked crazy stunts. The Fast and the Furious and 2 Fast 2 Furious were all about the cars, and less about the ass-kicking action, which is why 2 Fast 2 Furious is still my favorite movie out of the series. Furious 7 seems to tone down the street racing, the modified cars (for much newer, more expensive ones), and the lack of an urban environment to race said cars. Because this movie mainly takes place outside of the US and they're all about kicking ass and finding Deckard Shaw, I dropped a point in my review just for that.<br/><br/>The plot seemed really strung out. I understand that Paul wasn't there for some parts of the movie to finish filming, and some things were added to compensate (Race In Paradise, Paul Walker) for a main character, but I believe they could have changed some things up. <br/><br/>Realism. No, we don't really expect much realism with the amount of cars being crushed, low-flying helicopters, and guns. Was it a bit too much in Furious 7? Yeah, a little much. Jumping through 2 buildings and landing is like winning the lottery twice and getting struck by lightning in the same day, just not likely..at all. <br/><br/>Finally, the ending scene. Yes, the moment that hit us with a freight train of the feels. Someone behind me was cutting onions, I swear. The ending is what saved the movie from a 6/10 rating. It was a beautiful tribute, and for those who remember the first time that Dom and Brian raced side-by-side, this was a perfect way to send off the character, and Paul himself. Wiz Khalifa's ""See You Again"" was the coal keeping the steam engine of the feels train at full speed. <br/><br/>TL;DR people: Less action, more racing street cars. More realism, less fantasy. Paul Walker send off was beautiful, I cry. The end."
"r-a-bacchi","7","0","14","23 April 2015"," Great Tribute - Not so great Movie...
","The movie itself is so over the top, absolutely unrealistic and has nothing to do with racing. The story is like..., bad. Jason Statham is a cool extra, but he's just too flat. He is just the bad guy and for like no reason the best bad guy in the whole world. The message is really the best thing ever in a fast & furious movie. Family over all, and a great tribute at the end for Paul.<br/><br/>The music is great and really supports this message. I can not imagine how hard it was to finish the movie, especially for Vin. <br/><br/>I wish the whole movie would be like the last 15 minutes, but as i said, good tribute."

It's a pity when someone has to die that young of age, but in my opinion he was a terrible actor, I'm sorry.<br/><br/>The seventh movie though was a big rush! It did not bore me a second. The action sequences were just amazing. I did not want to blink my eyes, hell even the dutch subs were partially blocking my view. The movie was not very realistic, but that's not what we are watching this movie for. It was original.<br/><br/>When I heard Walker died I hoped this would be the last movie of the Fast and Furious movies. Now I watched the seventh movie, I'm looking forward to the next. About the question if this movie should win an Oscar? If it would be up to me, fortunately it isn't, no. I love action movies, but the point of movies like this is that when it comes to the story, it's pretty much the same as we have seen before. Keep up the good work."

This story sets off with an explosive chase, the crew is brought back together to save the world against an evil forces. They move fast, talk fast, and act fast. But in the end, the need for speed is clear and this is one tale that will keep your head spinning. This movie is an adventure that will keep you going.

"sujanfaster","8","0","2","17 April 2015"," A great tribute and a good movie
","Its very hard to criticize this movie even if you want to. It is a commendable an effort by the whole team to bring a great tribute to one of their family members, Paul Walker. We were quite clear of the magnitude of this movie when they showed Statham at the end of 6th part. So the expectations were high. Though the story isn't that great, the team tries its best to keep the audience entertained. Since there are lot of big stars in this movie, the director makes sure everyone has substantial role even if it isn't necessary sometimes. Jason Statham entry scene is epic. This movie stays true to the initial Fast and Furious movies when it comes to cars and to the latest parts when it comes to outrageous action scenes. But who is complaining?<br/><br/>This is probably the movie with most emotional touch after the death of a leading actor. The Paul Walker tribute moves anyone in tears. Especially the last scene, wow... its just.. very hard to describe. Such a great way to retire a character. I can see how difficult it would have been the actors to perform in scenes without actually Paul being there. I wish the rivalry between Vin Diesel and Statham would have had much more magnitude. Nathalie Emmanuel is hot and impressive. Tyrese Gibson has everyone in splits as always. But remember, its Paul Walker who not only steals your show but also your hearts with his superhuman presence. All I can say is ""Thank you team and Miss you Paul""."
"xcvb_2003","8","0","2","14 April 2015"," One last ride.
","""One last ride.""<br/><br/>So finally watched the 7th installment in the popular Fast and Furious franchise. Its amazing how this franchise has increased its popularity and success, be this long, and not be based on a book or something. Directed by James Wan, who previously was known only for famous horror flicks like The Conjuring and Insidious, did a great job delivering a full on high budget action film and a great send off to Paul Walker, gotta give him kudos for this. <br/><br/>The passing of Paul Walker had an overall presence throughout the movie. And it only got more potent as the movie went on. This is the last film of his, and the movie gave him an amazing send off. The tribute at the end was truly beautiful. In fact, this marks the first time that I was brought to tears in a cinema. I did a full re-watch of all the previous parts prior to watching this, so everything was fresh in my mind and while watching the tribute, I Just couldn't hold it anymore. Knowing that this will be the last we ever see of Brian/Paul Walker, it just got to me. THE FEELS WERE JUST TOO MUCH!!<br/><br/>The film takes right after Fast and Furious 6 and finally ties in to events in Tokyo Drift and moves on from there. The main antagonist this time is older and more badass brother of the villain from previous part, played by Jason Statham. He was a great addition in my opinion, brought in proper badassness to the villain side. The rekindling of Dom and Letty continues in this part, and the team now gets together to find a way to hunt down the new baddie, which came in terms of a computer/hacking plot point, which was neither bad nor good, but it worked for the movie. <br/><br/>Story and flow of the movie felt disjointed. It felt like many of the scenes were just put in sequence without much thought given into how they'll fit and flow. I guess a much of this had to do with the passing of Paul Walker and they had to re-write the script and stuff. The movie retained the essence of the previous parts, especially the last two. Stuff like a lot of cheesy scenes, dialogues, action film clichés etc, but hey, that's a part of this franchise, so it's all good. Humour again was focused mostly on Tyrese Gibson, and it really did made me chuckle and even laugh a few times, even if it was stupid mostly. <br/><br/>Now, the action in this film is awesome. This is genuinely a great action film all round and the thing that made it really EPIC was that there wasn't just one kind of action in it. It had car/vehicle warfare, shootouts, hand to hand combats all mixed in nicely. And if you thought that previous parts were over the top, you ain't seen nothing yet. This movie takes ridiculous action sequences to a whole new level. Plenty of amazing sequences that will surely be a talk of action film fans for years to come. <br/><br/>Most of the CGI was great. Lots of awesome stunts and stuff. The movie also did a great job of using body doubles, CGI etc to fill in the scenes of Paul Walker as I didn't notice most of it. The soundtrack was good.<br/><br/>Some stuff that I didn't like was that while the action was great, I do think they went a little too overboard this time. You can only suspense your disbelief to a certain level. Heroes were not only surviving, but almost walking away unscathed from impossible situations a little too often. Also, some of the characters almost felt like superheroes to be honest, it was that ridiculous at times. Another thing that I didn't like was The Rock only had a few scenes, he is easily the biggest addition to this franchise, figuratively and literally. And that letty and dom romance stuff got a bit too much screen time and became annoying. <br/><br/>All in all, another great addition to the franchise, and since it is the 7th installment, it is only meant for the fans of the series. If you're a first timer, you better watch the previous parts first. Great action movie, great send off to Paul Walker. R.I.P<br/><br/>8/10"

"Hint523","6","0","13","14 April 2015"," The Fast franchise roars forward
","While every entry of a franchise usually totes itself as the 'biggest entry yet,' never before has it been so true. I successfully managed to avoid any actual trailers or movie reviews for the eagerly anticipated Furious 7, which has defied all odds and firmly established itself as a worldwide box office juggernaut. <br/><br/>Two summers ago in anticipating Fast and Furious 6, I rented all of the sloppily titled Fast and Furious movies (except the first one which I saw shortly after its release) to understand how exactly this franchise came to be. Unlike the superhero franchises which have a dense canon from which they are pulling stories, one of the admirable elements of this franchise is that it is not based on previous material and therefore can much more easily reinvent itself. Indeed, it's pretty amazing how well the series has managed to keep the same basic characters and story intact despite so many offshoot trajectories.<br/><br/>The main transition the series has seen is changing the characters from street racers to elaborate heist leaders, which has allowed the series to have a lot more fun and take itself less seriously. Slowly, more characters have been added, greatly expanding the 'family' of alpha character Dominic Toretto (Diesel). The story lines have always been the weakest part, which is why fewer people have seen the middle installments, but since Fast & Furious (the fourth entry – again the titles are incredibly scattered) each movie has successfully upped the ante. I stand by Fast Five as the pinnacle of the series where it fired on all cylinders (yet even that isn't exactly an A-level action movie), with the sixth film not too far behind. <br/><br/>In Furious 7, the mission is bigger than ever before, and feels less and less about the cars and more about spies and missions. The movie is attempting to widen the audience and be more broadly appealing than the humble originals which were all about urban street racing. Here, we go from London, to Abu Dhabi, to LA, with a few scattered cameos in between, all with massive action setups.<br/><br/>The part that the film does extremely well of is creating a villain worthy of opposition to the protagonists. Jason Statham is in fact more bad-ass than you could ever imagine, going toe-to-toe with both Vin Diesel and Dwayne Johnson. Another villain is also established, played by Djimon Hounsou. In two years, three movies have underutilized him as a villain: How to Train Your Dragon 2, Guardians of the Galaxy, and now this. It is truly a shame that an Oscar nominated actor is getting commissioned to throwaway bad guy parts with no real character. Regardless, Statham is a truly awesome guy to watch and makes the film all that engaging even though he isn't given a huge chunk of time. Another character that has unfortunately been completely sidelined by the franchise is Jordana Brewster's character. In the first few movies she could stand on her own and was a pivotal member of the crew. Now, she has literally been reduced to a housewife. Without Paul Walker, I fear that her character will be slimmed down in future installments. The first half of the film is much more entertaining, while the second half feels a bit tiresome despite a few epic action sequences. <br/><br/>Lastly, there is the inevitable question of what the film had to do regarding the unplanned passing of Paul Walker. I had no idea what they had planned, and let's just say they don't avoid the subject by any means. It is unfortunate how clearly different the ending of the film is than what they had planned – even a casual moviegoer can tell. But it's a nice enough tribute to the series co-lead. I truly do wonder what Vin Diesel and Co. will do from here moving forward. There is no right answer, but right now they've got the biggest movie yet on their hands and so much more to do. The passing of Paul Walker only heightens just how bizarre the trajectory of this franchise has gone, and while this series is certainly not the top of the line for action movies, I will remain along for the ride for any future installments that follow."

The latest film in the Fast & Furious action franchise, Furious 7, will be prominently known for being Paul Walker's final film (he tragically died (how else?) in a car crash on December 1st, 2013). The film serves not only as entertainment for the audience, but also as a proper send off for the 40-year-old.<br/><br/>You don't go to see a Fast & Furious film expecting to see a cinematically logic and quality film. You go for the sake of awesome (and very unbelievable) action sequences. I have to admit, the franchise deserves credit for never failing to surprise us. This seventh film stuck thematically with flying cars (out of: buildings, parking lots, airplanes, etc.) and having this thematic idea is what keeps audiences going. The premise and stakes for the story start simple enough; Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), Owen Shaw's (Luke Evans) older brother, seeks revenge after the events in Fast & Furious 6 left his Owen comatose. Fast & Furious 6 ended with Han's (Sung Kang) death at the hand of Deckard. In Furious 7 we pick up with Deckard continuing to avenge his brother and hunting down the remaining crew that battled his brother: Dom (Vin Diesel), Brian (Paul Walker), Letty (Michelle Rodriguez), Roman (Tyrese Gibson), Tej (Ludacris), and even the, now mother, Mia (Jordana Brewster) and the policemen Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) and Elena (Elsa Pataky). As self-defense the crew gets back together and goes on a search for Deckard. Apparently, Deckard is a hard man to find (was in the British Special Ops). This is where the plot complicates. The American government, represented by Kurt Russell and John Brotherton, employs the crew in order to find a device called ""God's Eye"" which is ""a tracking device on steroids"" as Russell's character explains, and uses all the electronic and connected devices in the world to track someone. From there on the story complicates immeasurably. The plot is forced to places ranging from LA to Azerbaijan, and the incredibly hard to find Deckard appears in every heist Don's group does.<br/><br/>As said before, it would be cruel to judge this film in contrast with the likes of Boyhood or even Interstellar. Instead, one should simply sit back and enjoy the incredible stunt work. The acting is fine as far as I'm concerned (Vin Diesel needs to learn to enunciate), the cinematography was acceptable and in some places daring (when filming fight scenes and car chases). The film is a fun ride that one goes for diversion rather than immersion. Speaking of diversion however, the Fast & Furious franchise is also known for having made Tyrese Gibson a comic. The script, however, is so scrappy that the jokes are as good as last film's ""that's not a plane, that's a planet!"" (when talking of a large plane). Tyrese's comic lines are extremely forced in this film, although more than once they end up working (A couple are bound to end up working right?)<br/><br/>But this film is different from the other movies in the franchise. Paul Walker's death is present throughout. People trying to spot his doubles or his CGI scenes shouldn't be looking at Paul Walker, but at his castmates' facial expressions. You can tell which scenes were filmed after his death by the look his cast-mates give the computer image or double they are working with; looks of mourning, of love and admiration, of longing. The last scene brought me, and the rest of the audience, to tears. We see the film and co-stars give Walker the send off. The lines spoken in the final minutes aren't acted out, the actors weren't speaking to Brian, they were talking to Walker.<br/><br/>We see Walker get into the first car his character owned in the first film. We see him smile as he prepares to race Diesel. A smile we've seen so many times, but which now is ghostly and touches us more than ever. The film ends with the message ""For Paul"" in the clouds.<br/><br/>But as Vin Diesel says in the film, ""it's never goodbye."""

","Cars? Check. Gunshots? Check. Adrenaline? Check. VFX? Check.<br/><br/>Some might wonder what's the difference between this movie and the past six.

Fast and Furious 7 had to change that due to unfortunate circumstances, but this change is what makes the movie worthwhile. <br/><br/>This movie focused on the meaning of family and home, something we forget in our day to day activities. It allows us to connect in many ways with the characters and their lives as they are endangered. And even if we have to say goodbye, we'll always be there for those we consider family.<br/><br/>FF7 adds an emotional roller-coaster to the typical racing movie and it's guaranteed to make more than one of you shed a few tears.

","This film is in the action genre, the writers of the film are Chris Morgan and Gary Scott Thompson. The director of the film is James Wan and the film was made in 2015. <br/><br/>The title is Fast And Furious, which means lively and exciting and the film is full of these moments including in intense races and high speed pursuits. The film begins with Deckard Shaw played by Jason Statham looking out of a hospital window, he begins by talking about avenging his brother as his brother lies in a hospital bed. He then walks out of the room for the audience to find that he has killed a large amount of people in the hospital. On his way out he asks a guard to hold a grenade and pushes him into a desk, before leaving the building. There is a big explosion and as he exits the building a large part of the front of the building falls down as the opening sequence ends. This is successful because it is a new beginning to a film in this franchise as the others films normally started with a race or pursuit, so by changing this I think it added different, unexpected elements to the film itself.<br/><br/>The main characters in the film are Dominic Toretto played by Vin Diesel, Luke Hobbs played by Dwayne Johnson, Brian O'Conner played by Paul Walker, Letty played by Michelle Rodriguez, Roman Pierce played by Tyrese Gibson, Tej played by Ludicrous, Mia played Jordana Brewster, Gisele played by Gal Gadot and Han played by Sung Kang.<br/><br/>Sound is used throughout the film in many different ways including music to create atmosphere and tension, explosions for added effect and to add tension to the scenes they are featured in, the sounds of roaring engines and gears changing during races for added tension and excitement during the races and the song played at the end of the film changes the mood completely as the final scene begins.<br/><br/>The film ends with Brian and Dom racing along the road as they begin racing, scenes from the other fast and furious films featuring Paul Walker appear, scenes even from the first film this was really effective as it shows how much he was a part of the franchise and how much the cast will miss him. Once the film resumes the two are seen parting ways on two separate roads and the words 'For Paul' come up on the screen I felt that this was really effective because dedicating the film to him moved me and emotions ran high and the song that played during the end sequence features on the trailer for the film, every time I hear it, I feel emotional that's why I think it was effective as the ending to the film.<br/><br/>The themes the run through the film include friendship, family and love. <br/><br/>I like this film because it includes all the things you expect from a Fast And Furious film with added surprises as the beginning was completely different, some more emotional scenes featured in the film which only featured in the last film and Fast And Furious Tokyo Drift. Also I like this film because of the way it ended.<br/><br/>One of my favourite scenes from the film is the fight scene between Luke Hobbs and Deckard Shaw, because the scene is intense and thrilling throughout and the way the camera angle moves with the characters is really effective. For example when Hobbs flips Shaw onto a glass table the camera moves with Shaw and it turns in a way that you can empathise with the characters pain in a different way to what you normally would. My other favourite scene is where Brian and Dom steal a Lycan Hypersport and drive it through three buildings. The way the scene plays out is really effective and how the scene is shot adds intensity to the scene which is what you want from a film. Along with the added shock that the pair actually make it through the buildings and don't fall out of the third certainly adds breathtaking moments to the film.<br/><br/>My favourite character is Brian O'Connor and always will be just because of the fact that he used to be an F.B.I agent. He is such a skilled driver and through the films you have seen him progress as a character, meet different people and see how their friendship progresses is incredible and that is why he is my favourite character and seeing how his relationship with Mia has progressed is also rewarding. Paul Walker was such a great actor and that's another reason why he is my favourite character.<br/><br/>I think visually that this film is incredible, the way the film has been shot and the time taken to process all the camera angles and put them into the film during fight scenes which I found was a lot more effective during this film than in the other films in this franchise."

","This movie, I must say was amazing, I watched it on the 10th of April and might I say, the producers did an amazing job for the fact that one of their main characters for the movie passed away. Even though they used Paul Walker's brothers to fill in for him and they used special technology, to make them sound like him and and to obviously look like him, you can rarely tell that it is someone else playing the part, what gives it away is the size of his brother, because obviously everyone has a different body size,so when they filmed certain parts with his brother, you can pick it out and say yes that wasn't actually Paul Walker, but other than that it was good. What I think they should have done was filmed more with Shawn (from Tokyo drift), as I think if they mixed him in with the gang, it could have been good and it could have been something different. But overall this movie was AMAZING and towards the end it was very emotional!"

","When you go in to see a fast and furious movie, you know what to expect...fast cars, lots of action, incredible stunts, and a moral message about how important family is. Great thing is you get this in the movie! It's always been about the cars and it seems based on each subsequent sequel, they try to outdo the last one with even bigger stunts and there is one in this which is just as much as ludicrous as it is incredible!<br/><br/>The problem comes with the story and execution. Fast 5 and 6 (although more the former) raised the bar for the franchise. They turned it from not just street racing but adding more to the story e.g. Elaborate heist; taking out a big bad rival gang etc. This movie could have been a great revenge story (based on the bad guy here) but the way the story was shown did not showcase that well and the story in the end with the sub plots ended up looking clunky. This isn't a huge problem in such a movie but I guess I was expecting a bit more or better.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, Michelle Rodriguez and Jason Statham are good in their performances and the rest do their parts as usual, but it's the ending that's quite bittersweet. Paul Walkers tragic death through filming was tough to take for all, but how they move forward with the filming had to be done tastefully to respect him. What they did was truly beautiful and possibly the best way possible to remember him. <br/><br/>All in all, a decent movie, but not the best in the franchise."

","Furious 7 bids a hearty farewell to Paul Walker and a near perfect one though. After FF6, the expectations was always high from the possibly final movie of the FF franchise. However, the movie disappoints on many aspects. <br/><br/>To start with what's good - the movie lives up to its reputation of a car dominated story. It provides you that - thrilling chases, jaw dropping stunts, brilliant modifications to the machines and an amazing showdown(s) between Vin Diesel and Jason Statham. The story has been compelling enough to thrill, in spite of being predictable to the last scene. The fight sequences and chases have been brilliantly directed.<br/><br/>However, James Wan disappoints with too less screen time to the supposedly lead antagonist Jason Statham. FF7 has been projected as the revenge story of Deckard Shaw but it appeared as if he had been given multiple cameos - coming out of nowhere to fire some bullets and then disappearing in solitude. One would expect him to be all over the place to stifle the Dom gang till his last breath. <br/><br/>Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez appear to be out of sync and pale throughout the movie, in terms of acting. Other actors make good effort but fail to some extent. Paul Walker has been effortless as usual. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie does good to pay tribute to Paul Walker and one must watch this to see Paul's ""One Last Ride"". Apart from that, it leaves a lot to be asked for."

","We were only lucky to find front row seats! And we had to book ahead of time. Heath Ledger may have received such a grandiose farewell in Batman, the only difference being in this case that ""Furious 7"" is in all actuality an obituary to the deceased star. <br/><br/>In Mirdiff City Center's Vox Cinemas/Dubai, Paul's first appearance in the film regurgitated watchers to sigh mournfully. It is sad, and it is safe to presume that the increased footfall, compared to the prequels, can be attributed to his death. Net gen attendees, for one, were motivated by the event to watch the movie on the big screen instead of waiting for pirated DVD copies to surface the internet hence, I hope Walker's family receives their fair share of the action. <br/><br/>It is a Bollywood type surreal action film where the action part is extremely exaggerated. The drama within is predominantly lame and disengaging. I love Diesel, I hoped he'd pull up something similar to his role in ""Find me Guilty,"" yet his performance hereof is at par with the sequels of Fast and Furious; an unconvincing alpha-male with a streets attitude and a fetish for vengeance. It is not hard to believe that the line ""I am Groot!"" translated across plethora of languages, by Vin himself, in ""Guardians of the Galaxy,"" was more convincing. I find it ludicrous that Ludicrous, Walker and Gibson's roles are more entertaining, albeit for the wrong reasons, with their gags and puns. Not a single actor among the cast outperforms his/her role and this is the second sad point. <br/><br/>That said, the movie has some artistic dialogues. A telephone conversation between Brian (Paul) and Mia (Jordana), which is poorly acted, incorporates Verbal Irony in Dramatic context – the crowd already knows how the real story concludes. Moreover, the dénouement of the conflict, due to real life circumstances, is dramatically convincing even when underperformed by a disengaged cast. <br/><br/>I personally love it, which may sound sarcastic given my previous remarks, but I really did. Although long, and action sequences that should not live up to more than milliseconds in real life extend to durations of 30 plus minutes, the movie is, in every bit of it, entertaining. All in all, ""Furious 7"" is a must watch, we owe that much to Walker's family."

If you did not, then you probably aren't reading this review, so it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>I really enjoy these movies. They have developed a rhythm that is fun to watch. The car scenes are...well...fast and furious, while the action and mayhem is over-the-top ""cartoony"" fun - where everyone walks away with maybe a cut and a scrape (that look really cool), unless the plot calls for a broken bone or - heaven forbid - a death.<br/><br/>But what drives these movies are the performance - and camaraderie - of our core group of heroes. It is this sense of ""family"" that really creates a place where you want to spend time with this group of people. Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, Tyrese Gibson and Michelle Rodriguez know what kind of movie they are in and look like they had fun making it. Add to this group, old pros Jason Statham and Kurt Russell (!) and the acting and characters are well taken care of.<br/><br/>I have to admit that I was distracted while watching this film with the knowledge that star Paul Walker passed away in a car accident in the middle of filming this movie. I know they had to ""digitally insert"" him in a few scenes and had his brother be a body double throughout. Could I tell when they did that? I think so, but don't know for sure. It is a sad thing and, for me, that added a melancholy shade to the whole proceedings.

","Furious 7 is all about crazy action and ridiculous stunts. Having seen both Fast Five and Fast & Furious 6, I went into this movie a little bit prepared; and it definitely payed off.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies where it would benefit if the viewer saw the previous installments in the franchise. It has a lot of connections especially to the sixth. That being said, I think after the first part of the movie one can definitely catch up on what's going on. The plot was easy enough to understand although some of it was a little complicated. The story is also easy to understand, but there are moments that aren't fleshed out and kind of leave the viewer hanging. Not to mention some plot holes here and there. <br/><br/>This time around, the franchise has a new director: James Wan. He brings a new feel to it for sure, but it's a nice change and Wan does a good job handling such a huge movie. <br/><br/>Furious 7 is one of those movies that has a ton of characters; and in this installment, there are more than ever before. The actors portraying the old roles and the new, do a decent job doing what they're here to do. <br/><br/>Brian Tyler does an excellent job with the score for this movie. It's an electrifying mix of electronic synths and strings.<br/><br/>Now we get to probably the biggest part of this movie: the action. There is a ton of it, but if you're used to the Fast & Furious franchise, this should come as no surprise. What should also not come as a surprise, is that a lot of the action is super ridiculous and over the top. Yet in this movie, the over the top action is just pure fun. James Wan brings a very unique style to the action, as he uses different cinematography methods and different action techniques. The action might be unrealistic, but it is extremely entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>Not being a lifelong fan of Paul Walker, I have come to appreciate in the last three F&F movies how great an actor he was. He was a highlight in this movie for sure and he was given a great send off at the end. He will be missed.<br/><br/>In the end, Furious 7 had a surprisingly good plot and strong story; albeit some plot holes here and there. Direction was different but still great, the music was fun, and the cinematography was unique. The action was crazy and ridiculous, but super fun. Furious 7 wasn't a brainy, thought-provoking movie, but it sure was an entertaining ride.<br/><br/>RIP Paul Walker."
"Rickting","8","0","3","10 April 2015"," Pedal to the metal fun and a powerful farewell to Paul Walker
","With Furious 7, it's amazing a coherent film ever came out of the gate at all. Following Paul Walker's tragic death midway through filming the movie had a very troubled production, but thankfully things have worked out and Furious 7 is the second best Fast and Furious film to date, after Fast Five. The brother of F&F6's antagonist is after the team, and after killing Han (As seen at the end of the third and sixth films) goes after the others. Some other bad guys after a ludicrous computer programme which can hack into every camera anywhere in the world. Just don't try and follow the plot. Furious 7 breaks the speedometer in terms of action but also has characters we care about. The storyline between the only slightly less blank than usual Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez is well handled, Tyrese is as hilarious as ever and there's a good level of humour to the film. James Wan makes a successful transition from horror to action, and the film remains suspenseful and tense however big the setpieces. Cars fly between skyscrapers. A man leaps off a falling bus and jumps on a drift turning car. Dwayne Johnson, as brilliantly badass as ever, battles a helicopter with the mother of all machine guns. What more could you want? <br/><br/>However, Furious 7 definitely has its issues, as do all of the films in the franchise. The plot is a bit messy and peaks too early. The film never quite reaches the level of the first action sequence again. The LA finale is fun but a bit convoluted and confused and at times the action is getting to be a tiny bit too much. Meanwhile, Nathalie Emmanuel is terrible in the movie and slightly blunts every scene she's in. As expected, this is a bit of a mess. It is however a genuinely moving tribute to Paul Walker, which will definitely cause tears for some. I didn't notice CGI Paul Walker at any point, although some others might. As a result, this is one of the most tear jerking action films ever made. Jason Statham and Dwayne Johnson, who both do a good job, are underused with Dwayne Johnson spending most of the film in hospital and Jason Statham mostly just turning up wherever the team go to beat loads of people up. Overall though, it simply has to be given credit as a fun action film and us a moving tribute to Paul Walker.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Imagine your favorite food. Let's use pizza, because 99% of the world loves pizza. Imagine a nice big pepperoni pizza. Always a good decision right? The cheese, fresh sauce, crisp pepperoni, nice crust. Now imagine that you pile nine pounds of pepperoni on top of the pizza. The ingredients are still good, these are still your favorite toppings, but the result remains overkill. That is Furious 7 in a nutshell: way too much of a good thing that results in the most ridiculousness and implausibility in the entire franchise. And yes it is indeed entertaining but for the first time we are seeing special effects totally overpower practical effects and the result is a movie that comes straight out of summer blockbusters as opposed to being a gritty and stunt-filled extravaganza like what we have been seeing in previous installments.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the recent string of franchise-altering movies, then you will be entertained here. Just know that Fast and the Furious peaked with the killer bank vault scene from Fast Five. Within the two hours of Furious 7 there will be elongated fights, massive car chases, and purely insane action sequences that forces you to remove your brain temporarily. Mixed in nicely with the carnage are the consistent themes of family and love---plus the now-famous final scene that will trigger emotions that Fast and Furious had never dealt with before. Paul Walker's passing gives this movie a haunting edge, as even some of the costume choices and dialogue ironically singled out Walker long before his actual untimely death.<br/><br/>The cast is mostly back, although I do find myself missing the Don Omar/Tego Calderon combination. Vin Diesel and The Rock are at their toughest, Paul Walker is the perfect partner, Michelle Rodriguez continues that tough chick streak, and of course there's Ludicrous and Tyrese (whom we forget are music artists) working their comedic magic. We have now three villains they have to look out for (remember my comment about overkill?) but Jason Statham is the one that delivers the strongest punch as he mixes espionage with muscle.<br/><br/>The movie paces and runs like a music video: combining gorgeous women (to a point of pure misogyny), gorgeous cars, lots of speed, plenty of quick cuts, and lots of slow-motion shots. James Wan quickly developed a knack of combining music video eye candy material with an abundance of testosterone-laden carnage seamlessly. He is far removed from his low-budget horror days. However this day and age when action buffs have become accustomed to Gareth Evans (*raises hand*), it's slightly tougher to digest the fights and chases that occur here without feeling the slightest bit underwhelmed.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is more of the same, except so much more it really doesn't leave much for the eighth installment. After parachuting from a plane while inside a car, what on earth is there else to do? Fast and Furious has had a fantastic run but with each installment trying to top itself every time it will reach a point in which every scene becomes laughable. When the audience is chuckling and giggling during a serious action sequence, it's not the right reaction, even if the audience won't regret the money spent to get in.<br/><br/>If you are fine with the Fast and Furious series drifting farther and farther away from the lower-key, more urban original flick that started it all, then Furious 7 will entertain you, thrill you, and leave you smiling. If you are looking more for a return to roots, a more realistic approach to vehicular action, run away from this movie. Furious 7 isn't the best, but it's definitely the biggest, and definitely the most emotional of them all. The stuntwork (when actually used) is fantastic, the directing is slick, and it accomplishes what it's set out to do. And lastly, Paul Walker despite his untimely departure cinematically gets to leave in the perfect time."

","A film critic I follow once made the following analogy: ""In a world of junk food, there's a huge difference between store bought cookies and your mom's homemade chocolate chips."" Fast 1-4, for better or worse, never managed to be anything than Chips Ahoy. But from Fast 5 onward, I've been enjoying nothing but warm goodness right off the pan.<br/><br/>The Fast franchise's recent momentum has unquestionably been driven by their keen decision to have each installment top the last one. Fast Five started the escalation game by being bigger and better than Fast and Furious. Fast and Furious 6 was bigger, better, and crazier than Fast Five. Furious 7 is in some ways bigger and in some ways crazier than Fast and Furious 6, but I can't say it's better. It keeps the over-the-top craziness in full swing while giving its ensemble fun, action-packed things to do while they trot across sleek and sexy destinations all around the globe. But while Furious 7 does a lot right, and trust me, it's a great ride; unfortunately, there's several big things it does wrong that stalls the expected evolution of the series.<br/><br/>The good is really good. The action is still ridiculous, balls-to-the-wall fun that defies logic and sometimes expectations. In addition, this movie really beefs up its emphasis on showcasing hand-to-hand combat, and the results are a blast. A climactic showdown between Diesel and Statham is gangbusters, and watching Statham eat a Rock Bottom through a glass table had twelve-year-old me squealing. The cast all continue to nail their respective talents; and even though he gets much less screen time, The Rock is still as charming and awesome as ever. Most of the new additions fit in snugly, with Jason Statham being the best he's been in years and Ronda Rousey being used efficiently enough to make her appearance a memorable one. The undisputed champ of the newcomers is Kurt Russell as a charismatic government agent so cool, Lando Calrissian would buy him a Belgian ale. James Wan manages to adapt to the franchise's look and feel with ease, but he still manages to fit some of his trademarks into the fold. A montage of glamor shots during the opening Race War segment contained the kind of fast zooms, whip pans, and shaky cam footage straight out of the Saw franchise, and overall, it works.<br/><br/>The bad however isn't a deal-breaker, but it certainly holds the franchise back in my eyes. The plot is a little too over-involved for a series that has always kept things straight-forward. I don't mean that in the sense that it's ""too complicated,"" I mean that in the sense that there's so much going on that some of it didn't warrant my concern. Chief-most: Djimon Hounsou, who shows up half-way in as a terrorist leader at the heart of a sub-plot involving hackers and surveillance technology. Not only is the role a complete waste of Hounsou's talents, but ultimately, neither Hounsou or his army are as compelling or as interesting a threat as Jason Sthatam's Deckard Shaw. The surveillance plot is timely I guess, but the entire conceit of it (That Dom and his crew need to steal back this surveillance technology and its creator from Hounsou in order to find Shaw) is rendered moot when the film has Statham constantly showing up wherever the gang is anyway. It drags down the plot, elongates the run-time, and even manages to take some of the satisfaction away from the final confrontation between Dom and Shaw.<br/><br/>Earlier I mentioned the greatness of the film's hand-to-hand combat. And while that's an ultimate plus, I realized that it's a huge problem considering that all the human fight scenes ended up entertaining me more than that actual car stunts. The Abu Dhabi car jump was thrilling, and the bus chase (the parts that weren't in the trailer) is great; but none of them managed to be more fun or inventive than Paul Walker and Tony Ja violently sledding down flights of stairs on a door, or Diesel and Statham sword fighting with wrenches and car parts. When you have a franchise built around cars, put more work into showcasing the actual cars.<br/><br/>But those gripes aside, Furious 7 continues the tradition of being loud, silly, and fun in the best way possible. Popcorn fare at its best. I'm unironically looking forward to the recently announced Fast 8, hoping that it gets over the hiccups of Furious 7 and drives the franchise onward and upward."

","There is a very nice send off to Paul towards the end of the movie that does leave you with a heavy heart when you walk out of the theater. Apart from that well, there is nothing much that leaves the theater with you. They have missed the mark completely with this one.<br/><br/>Of course there is a lot of action, some bone jarring fist fights and some furious car chases thrown in, but is that enough? A wafer thin plot, with extremely weak characterization and uncalled for emotional quotient reached new lows with this one. Yes, Jason Statham has a strong presence in the film, but we never get to know his thoughts as he does not say a meaningful sentence even once in the film. Given the impressive way Statham is brought in in most of the frames, his fall is unreal. Remember how Vanko goes down in Iron Man 2 after all that mayhem he creates? Dwayne has a good (and pretty much last) sequence towards the beginning of the film and Kurt Russell also gets to show his meat for the next Expendable movie but all in all, the plot completely rests on Diesel's shoulders with others having 'here-I-am' and 'here-I-am-not' frames. Also, only when I came out of the theater, I realized that there was Tokyo Drift cast also thrown in in-between for some reason only the director, James Wan can tell. <br/><br/>Dialogues are as cliché as they could get and I really missed the groovy soundtrack that this franchise has been synonymous with.<br/><br/>Now, coming to the USP of the film: Action. Most of it is very well done, but lacks the whole purpose to it, well in most cases. Take for example Diesel and Statham's 'I run my car over yours but I don't know why' sequence every time they meet. They might be real stunts and a lot of effort would have gone into their execution, but did I miss a point here? The long sequence of getting hold of one of the key characters in the film is well done, slightly over the top with the air drop and seen- that-before car chase but manages to keep you hooked onto the screen. I think the franchise nailed this in Fast 5 with a jaw dropping opening sequence and a super cool vault-hooked-to-the-car heist.<br/><br/>The movie is relatively better in the first half, but then sinks towards the second. As diesel puts it – ""This time it ain't just about being fast"", the movie has only half the soul of what this franchise is known for.<br/><br/>Watch it once though, watch it for Paul, one last ride!"

Yes its stupid and cheesy but the film knows it. Unlike Michael Bay's films, the Fast & the Furious films are actually tolerable. I think its because the action set pieces are properly shot with little quick cuts and shaky camera and hence do not induce headaches. The humour in these films are a lot more organic and not at the expense of stupid racist gags. The female leads while attractive are not sexually objectified. There isn't any weird fetishism involving the military. The action sequences aren't fireworks shows. And overall the, same film is not being made over and over again. <br/><br/>Yes believe it or not there is a proper well driven plot here albeit it gets insanely convoluted. Its a revenge story but it also involves the retrieval of this God's Eye MacGuffin, I dunno. The movie knows its stupid though and boy is it really really stupid. These movies now show you can basically do anything with a car, possibly open a beer bottle as well. And the human body apparently is made of steel too as it can survive being in a car tumbling down a cliff and ... screw it you've heard me say this before in the previous review.<br/><br/>I remember in early 2001 when I was 10 or 11 years old seeing a TV spot that had Limp Bizkit blaring in the background and people driving brightly coloured sedans starring that pretty blonde dude from Varsity Blues and the Iron Giant. This film looked stupid as it was one of those Point Break rip offs that explored a subculture. I would've never guessed it would turn into a multi billion TV show that jumped the shark. And there will be more. What you think they'll stop when there's money to be made?<br/><br/>I'll also have to admit I got really emotional when it came to Paul Walker's story arc ending. The film really handled his send off well and did a really good job in paying him tribute. Ultimately I'm glad this was his last film and not Brick Mansions."

","Furious 7 stands as the darkest entry in the franchise, bringing everyone deeper into the violent world they first entered in Fast & Furious 6. Hunted down by a revenge-seeking assassin and stuck in the middle of a power struggle between a new terrorist and secret government agency, Toretto and his team must reunite to prevent total global chaos.<br/><br/>While the movie ultimately suffers from its convoluted plot, remaining loose ends are tied and the casts compelling performances give this thriller tons of genuine heart. Combined with its bone-shattering fights and the craziest action sequences the series has ever seen, this latest chapter truly deserves its record-breaking box-office success.<br/><br/>Despite the film's limitations surrounding Paul Walker's character due to his tragic real-life passing, everyone involved put in so much heart and soul that you can't help but feel the powerful energy it delivers. Against near-impossible odds, director James Wan manages to give the fans one last ride that tastefully serves as a beautiful and touching tribute to Walker's legacy."

","One thing is for dead sure that the Fast and the furious Franchise is the most popular amongst the teenagers mostly. They do not know or could not criticise about the material which they are selling.<br/><br/>That franchise was all about the Illegal racing. And so the well known taste of that ""Illegal Racing"" stuff was missing.<br/><br/>Anyways, I already have accepted that as a different movie now. So regarding this version to be very exact, no doubt producer tried his best to provide the viewers maximum action he ever could have. BUT... It was more than a bit extra, that I cannot digest.<br/><br/>Without any spoiler, I will say, that it is a very good action movie. Probably a 'MUST WATCH MOVIE'(period)"

","Here I go again... but this time about something that was more furious than fast. Yeah, first of all, let me just tell y'all that I am no fan of this series, I'm quite the opposite of a fan-boy, but I have to say I really enjoyed the 7th one. Yes, this review will be more about how I saw the movie and not that much about the movie itself, but I think even the movie was like that, as I hope it changed immensely after the lose... I'm just saying this as I can already see how the 1000-word limit of IMDb reviews will restrict me again. The first restriction was on a joke I did, that worked out great, so it is like by design to be restricted again, but this time on an eulogy, of some sorts. So, let's start... it, by saying some of the most important things about this movie, and probably about the series, from my point of view: 1. He owns the fastest car in the world... but he keeps it in a vault! 2. Do you still miss the bullets?.. this time we don't need to be that fast! 3. I don't have friends... I have family! 4. I will not leave you... No, I'm leaving you! 5. Do you promise?... I promise! 6. If I don't call... you should go on! 7. You will live forever... through everything and everyone that have you! I should stop now, as it seems 7 is a number to be held, and behold... but everything will go on, so why shouldn't we?! There are so many things I could say about this movie, but maybe everyone should go and see for themselves, or not... like we all do... eventually or never.<br/><br/>8. I remember everything now... It's about time! Thank you all for being more Furious than Fast, Seven Tytwo Junior P.S. As a general... thing, even before anything happens, please keep in mind everything in this world still has all the cars, women, buffoons, computers, weapons, experts, shows, even explosions&special effects, but sometimes there's no need for any sex scenes... maybe just because, sometimes, all those things might mislead one's attention and could be harder to see through all of those what.... movies, and especially films, are all about."
"rcoulson-84036","7","0","13","8 April 2015"," Great send off to a beloved actor
","After seeing the latest instalment of the Fast and Furious franchise I left with mixed feelings. Comparing this to the first one I feel that the franchise has come so far away from its original narrative of street racing that when Letty has a race in the beginning it feels more like a cameo that has been put in just to let the audience know its the same franchise. I feel that it is now more of a superhero franchise that is getting more and more far fetched since the 5th film. <br/><br/>The film is fairly entertaining as always the chemistry between the cast is superb and they really do feel like a family. The choreography in the action sequences are well executed and I enjoyed the majority of the soundtrack. The overall narrative I found disappointing after showing Shaw walking away from Han's car and telling Dom he's basically coming to kill them all, he only really targets Dom and never goes after any of the other characters which I found slightly weird as I felt he was going to go after them one by one or at least target them all simultaneously. If they do decide to make more sequels I do hope they go back to more of a street racing narrative and take a step away from them becoming a non sci-fi guardians of the galaxy.<br/><br/>For the ending it was a perfect send off for Paul Walker. The song fitted perfectly and they showed a montage of his character from the very first film to the end and will definitely tug at a few heart strings for the majority of the audience especially those who have grown up with the franchise."

","The gang's seventh installment gives you all the action and fast cars that you have come to expect from the franchise. The fact that you have to leave half your IQ at the door should come as no surprise either.<br/><br/>The script and plot had me wincing in my seat on several occasions but I decided to wait and see if the action sequences would make up for it...again. They did (barely). Here's an idea: reserve .01% of the money used on cgi and put it towards a decent screenwriter and story collaborator. I think everyone who likes fast cars and/or a good action thriller should be insulted at how stupid the producers of this movie think we are. End on a positive note: loved the Paul Walker farewell."

","If you enjoy watching 2 hour compilations of explosions on Youtube, you'll love this movie. The explosions went on for so long I actually found me self yawning and surprisingly immune to the excitement of explosions by the last 40 minutes, which rarely happens.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel delivers the same amount of one liners as all of Arnold Swarchzenegger's cheesy one liners combined, most of them mention his ""family"", While Tyrese Gibson is just there to act like an idiot.<br/><br/>This film obviously began as a generic action movie that was just there to gain some money for the studios, but halfway through the film it begins to turn into something better, obviously after the passing of Paul Walker. By the time it begins to get better it's already too late but the final scene is worth watching the whole movie for as it is extremely moving and it's a great tribute to Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Originally I would have given this 6 stars but team seem to have changed their intentions of making a generic action film halfway through and that's why I have given it a 7.<br/><br/>Definitely not as Oscar worthy as Vin Diesel made it out to be but worth watching just to see the cool action scenes and the end."
"treistan","10","0","2","7 April 2015"," ""Let's Kill All the Movie Critics""
","The Bard said it best in Henry VI, Part II, ""The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers!"" For this act, we'll substitute lawyers with movie critics. I doubt anyone will mourn. In the spirit of Jefferson, I declare my independence from them and state that I shall not read another review ever again.<br/><br/>The modern movie critics have become disconnected and apathetic to the wants of the 21st-century audience. They have become the 1% that sent the French into a furor and brought Marie Antoinette to the guillotine. Case in point: Furious 7. I have seen the articles condemning the latest installment of the Fast and Furious franchise. The titles were eye-catching, spurious distractions, reeling in the unsuspecting. The articles, themselves, have done everything from outright trashing Furious 7 for being escapist and calling for the demise of the franchise itself. <br/><br/>Don't we go to the movies to...well...escape? See my point? Ignoring the defamation and seeing the film for myself, I'm ready to start the revolution. Start your engines!<br/><br/>Furious 7 might better be titled Furious Evolution, as this is exactly what the film does. In light of the tragic loss of Paul Walker, the franchise, this film, the story, and the characters had no choice but to evolve. If the movie critics (those smarmy 1% courtesans) had any real connection to real people, they might understand why this may well be the best film of the franchise. My fellow Furies, a.k.a. the fans, who have been there from the beginning and those who joined the race along the way, had an opportunity to watch the film deliver frills, chills and thrills like never before in this no-holds barred, high-octane quarter mile. In a 130 minutes, the audience had The Avengers, Mission Impossible, and Star Wars all on one IMAX screen and with fast cars! If the Imperial Empire had pilots with these skills, the Rebellion would have been crushed in the era of the first Death Star!<br/><br/>Vin Diesel and crew deliver once again, despite a catastrophic series of events, both on screen and off. For detractors who call the film a 130-minute montage to Paul Walker, clearly you have not been paying attention. Moreover, you are not Furies like the rest of us in the 99%. The film was a montage to everyone and everything (even the cars) that has made these movies iconic. <br/><br/>The lump in my throat began with Letty and Dom returning to Race Wars, reminding us how this all began. Complete with Dom's Gandalfian wisdom on the quarter mile and Letty unleashing her fist on familiar faces, the audience was taken on an emotional trip down Memory Lane. Like a Lamborghini Diablo SV with a bad suspension, our collective heart is driven down a familiar road, experiencing every scenic turn and every painful bump, and we go willingly.<br/><br/>I have to wonder if modern-day movie critics even know how a good story works. It seems simple to me: relationships. Move the heart, and the mind and body will follow. Read some Thoreau, movie critics, it's not a new concept. Furious 7 reminds us how Brian O'Connor and Mia Toretto met. Crappy sandwiches at a family-owned pitstop. It's certainly no mistake that Dom Toretto wields a wrench in his hands as he battles Deckard Shaw, played by Jason Statham. The Furies know this recurring motif well. The wrench was the tool of choice that sent Dom to prison when he assaulted a man. <br/><br/>Just when the audience is ready to roll on with the thunder of the action, we are yanked back into our seats with reminders of where we have been with our favorite family of gearheads and how very far we have come. Unlike super-hero movies with super characters, among them a billionaire, a god, and human experiments (one that went right and one that didn't), we can relate to this cast of characters: a mechanic, a glib ex-con, a techie, a cop, and the fabulous array of strong women who love them and keep them anchored (I'm talking about the cars...just kidding!).<br/><br/>After 15 years, the players are more etched into their characters than ever before with on-point performances by the returning cast. Sung Kang, who played the ever unflappable Han, was sadly absent from the team for obvious reasons. Not sadly, Sean Boswell, played by Lucas Black, got no more than fifteen minutes. There is a God! Even Michelle Rodriguez redeems herself. The acting lessons have paid off as she actually acts her way through the film rather than snarling like a rabid cat. Maybe some life coaching lessons will do her well off-camera. Good luck with that.<br/><br/>Deus ex machina. It means god from the machine. Leave it to the Greeks to invent great audience experience. I know the movie critics can pronounce it, but I am not certain they understand how it works for the 99%. Deus ex machina are those moments in the story where it's all over for the heroes. Lights out. Call the undertaker. Plant the daisies. And then, the impossible happens. Furious 7 delivers, on cue, and always at the best moment, keeping the audience literally on the edge of their seats. (Yes, quite literally. I sat in the back and watched them.)<br/><br/>While the covert theme of Furious 7 was to say or not say goodbye to Paul Walker, the overt message is one that has permeated every moment of the franchise since its inception: mi familia...family. Enough said.<br/><br/>So here endeth the lesson, movie critics. I shall not waste another moment with you, no matter how catchy your article titles are. You are dead to me. I am a Fury, one of the original ride or die fans, who could not get enough of this series. I'm not ready for the checkered flag to fall on this franchise. Hit the pedal!"
"sesht","Null","0","2","4 April 2015"," No matter what, gotta keep 'em chuggin'
","Well, this doesn't need a review, or any more time describing it - people are gonna watch it anyway. <br/><br/>I have had a nice time watching a couple of FF movies. This one, for instance, but more so the 5th instalment, the one that introduced Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to this series. Fat lotta good that did in this one for him though. You'll know it, when you watch it.<br/><br/>This one introduces Kurt Russell and Nathalie Emmanuel (Game of Thrones' Missandei), and continues to stay with Jason Statham, introduced towards the end of the previous instalment. However, even though we know this, heralding the inevitable sequel seemed extremely cheap to me, almost undoing the dignified send-off that the makers and the actors seemed to have planned for Paul Walker. Maudlin activities were completely cheapened, IMO. Ali Fazal's introduced as well, but mostly as comic relief, along with Tyrese Gibson, whose treatment, and response/s, do raise a few tired guffaws (simply not fresh anymore). Speaking of which, for most of the cast, other than few of the main leads, seems like this is the only avenue they have to be viewed in the mainstream milieu, and that's kinda sad, in a way.<br/><br/>Casting-wise, Jordana Brewster has been getting a raw deal since 2, perhaps (though her role in 5 was substantial enough), and she's given company in that department by Elsa Pataky, who was utilized much better in 5. Djimon Hounsou, who's capable of much better things than being Universal's thug-for-hire, both here and in 'Guardians of the Galaxy', fares the poorest, not getting his moment at all, even though both he, and his character, merit many such mainstream 'moments'. <br/><br/>Happily enough, a badly-marketed/credited Tony Jaa finds 2 fantastic moments to shine, and boy, does he craft some fantastically choreographed action-sequences. Why was he not there more, and why was he not at the helm of all the action-choreography. Statham could have been utilized more effectively, in his hands, for sure. And we might have got the kick-ass action movie this had promised to be. However, and here's where the makers know they are firmly in their niche, and won't indulge fanboy whims such as mine - this is all about the cars, and nothing else (sure, bikini-clad women too, but who's peeking?). In that department, this stays true-to-form, with multiple models making an appearance, and seemingly causing motogeeks to salivate at their sight, and reach the throes of you- know-what.<br/><br/>Based on this instalment, and the last one as well, the so-called well-oiled engine behind the series seems to be running smoothly, and though Justin Lin upped the ante with 4 and 5 (though he also has the middling 2 and the passable 3 to his credit, in addition to one of his best works, 'A better tomorrow' making for perhaps the best entry in his directing filmography, rather than this repetitive flicks), but James Wan directs unrealistic-action as competently as his mainstream counterparts, and I'm sure they can hire cheaper directors to work on the next instalments. Oh, don'tcha worry - they're sure waltzing our way, sure as a hurricane, sure as taxes.<br/><br/>Luke Evans' presence is teased for this one, but not fulfilled, since his big bad bro is at the helm of exacting his own form of revenge, which means being at the beck-and-call of the director among our heroes, as/when he's needed to remind us what this one's actually about (not God's eye). Strangely enough, I ended up missing Gal Gadot and Sung Kang too.<br/><br/>And the Mcguffin. God's eye indeed. Did not belong in this movie. This one could have been so .... mission impossible, maybe even much better than the 'Rabbit's foot'. So much could've been done with that. Still might, since most of Hollywood seems to think nothing of cannibalizing what their peers make, even recently (Run all night / Road to Perdition etc.). <br/><br/>The movie is extremely noisy, and I picked a 2D screening, so perhaps I was spared the additional effort of squinting at the screen using fogged-up/unclean 3D glasses. I'd love to do without 3D if this is the way almost all of my local cinemas choose to handle the glasses that they charge unduly for. I love 3D, if done the 'Avatar' and the 'Dredd' way, but given the option with the local cinemas ruining the viewing experience, I'd rather view movies in 2D.<br/><br/>Now, I know this review is not gonna affect mass-viewings, and that's sad since the makers know this, and this has become a huge juggernaut, and fanboys and girls are already looking forward to hearing sound-bytes about the next instalment. I do wish they had maintained a respectful distance to that in this one, due to the untimely and unfortunate demise of Paul Walker during filming (the CGI is clearly evidenced where it was applied, and I don't know if I was one of the few people who had an outta-movie experience whenever that was done)."

","'FURIOUS 7': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The seventh installment in the immensely popular 'FAST & FURIOUS' film franchise. It's also the last chapter to feature lead actor Paul Walker; who died halfway before filming was complete (his scenes were finished using CGI and his two brothers, Caleb and Cody, served as stand-ins). Actors Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson (aka The Rock), Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Chris Bridges (aka Ludicrous), Jordana Brewster and others also reprise their roles from previous films; while Jason Statham, Kurt Russell, Djimon Hounsou, Tony Jaa and Ronda Rousey all join the cast this time around. James Wan (who's known for directing horror flicks; like 'SAW', 'INSIDIOUS' and 'THE CONJURING') took over directing duties, while Chris Morgan once again wrote the screenplay (as he did the last four installments). The story revolves around Dominic Torretto, and his crew, being recruited by a covert ops team; to stop a mercenary from obtaining a dangerous computer program. It's the first film, in the series, to take place after the events of 'TOKYO DRIFT'. I think it's the best installment of the series and a fitting tribute to Paul Walker. <br/><br/>The story begins with criminal Deckard Shaw (Statham) breaking into the hospital where his comatose brother, Owen (Luke Evans, reprising his role from the previous chapter), is being held. He promises revenge and then proceeds to track down Dominic Torretto (Diesel), and his team, for what they did to his brother (in the previous movie). Deckard kills Han (Sung Kang) in Tokyo (an event that took place in 'TOKYO DRIFT'), which makes Torretto, Brian O'Conner (Walker), and the rest of their crew, bloodthirsty for revenge against Shaw. At the same time they're enlisted, by a secret government official called 'Mr. Nobody' (Russell), to track down a deadly computer program; and stop it from falling into the hands of a dangerous mercenary, named Jackande (Hounsou). <br/><br/>The film is once again filled with spectacular action scenes and breathtaking stunts. It's of course completely unbelievable and almost cartoonish, almost all of the time, but it's still immensely entertaining. I wasn't a fan of the original movie, or the series; until they added The Rock, in 'FAST FIVE'. That's when the filmmakers really took the series to a whole 'nother level (almost comparable to 'THE EXPENDABLES' franchise; with all of the action stars they keep adding to every movie). I've seen every film in the series (I just recently saw 'TOKYO DRIFT' for the first time) and I'm just now becoming a fan of the franchise. It's sad to see Paul Walker go, but they do pay a great tribute to him (in the end of the film). This is definitely (by far) the best chapter in the series (despite all of it's cheesy melodrama) and I look forward to seeing future installments now (especially if they keep adding more cool action stars). The series is definitely pleasing to action movie lovers (and not just for car lovers anymore). It's still not a perfect franchise but it does keep getting better!<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FUT8JIkuU9Y"

","For Paul<br/><br/>Furious 7 follows the death of his brother at the hands of Dominic Toretto and his eclectic crew, the cold, calculated Ian Shaw vows vengeance - and no one is safe from his reach.<br/><br/>I think we all know what to expect from the Fast and the Furious films by now. Yeah they stupid and the law of physics dose not exist in these movies, but the movies are so enjoyable when it comes to it's action and it's extremely cheesy one liners that all the law of physics stuff will fly pass your head just like that. Now here is the 7th movie in the franchises would you believe it well I wouldn't and who better to director it than the man who usual dose horror films James Wan, and him taking the directing chair was a nice move to do.<br/><br/>Now the one thing I was a bit worried about is how Jame Wan was going to handle the action in the movie but then I remembered he did Death Sentence and got a little interested. After seeing the movie I can say it pulled off perfectly as the action scenes looked net and well put together when it came to the big action scenes.<br/><br/>The cast and crew all return and some of them are not the greatest actors on the plant like Dwayne Johnson and many more, but just like Arnold Schwarzenegger you know they not the greatest but you like seeing them on the big screen because they always seem to be so likable that your happy to see them anywhere.<br/><br/>Jason Statham as the villain is basically Jason Statham acting all tough and mean for the movie.<br/><br/>Now early I brought up that the laws of physics dose exist in this movie, well for this movie this is the perfect time to bring up turning your brain off and enjoy what's on screen and I know it's hard for so people to do that (Like myself) but if you want to get through this movie without questing everything with characters getting into car crashes and walking out of it fine without a mark on them, just saying.<br/><br/>Now during filming of this movie the late great Paul Walker sadly passed way due to a car crash. Now Paul isn't my top pick for best actors but I really do respect the guy and I heard nothing but great things about him of how nice he is and always seem like his in a good mood. It must have been really hard for the cast to continue after his death with all of them know him so well. Vin Diesel spoke out of how hard it was for him and for him to break down in front of everybody in a movie premiere about his best friend or brother he likes to call it that is no longer with us, Imagine that for a moment and let that sink in.<br/><br/>The movie dose do a tribute at the end and I won't lie it almost brought a tear in my eye because it was just perfect and so moving that it was a good send off to Paul Walker. So from me to you Paul farewell.<br/><br/>For problems with the movie are very basically to be honest with the dialogue and some of the quick shot editing that everybody can spot straight away from problems, but at the end of the day this is like a 90's action movie with the cheese and goofiness with a little salt of heart to it."

","This is the first post Justin Lin Fast & Furious film, and I think it shows. Now obviously no one goes to these things for a great story or character development, but Lin's previous flicks (especially Fast 6, which I'd probably give an 8 or 9 score) were great examples of how to make super entertaining Hollywood blockbusters. The action scenes in those films were amazingly well crafted, very complex and creative. There were long intricate sequences involving modified F1 cars flipping other cars, cars driving through planes, driving off a moving train, cars battling tanks, etc... Unfortunately, the action in Fast 7 doesn't live up to these lofty standards. There's a particularly great scene with Paul Walker and Tony Jaa in a flipped bus, but otherwise the rest of the film is a bit inconsistent. There are even a few car chases that just end with two cars crashing head-on, anti-climactic and uninspired compared to the stuff we've seen before. <br/><br/>This isn't to say Fast 7 is a bad movie. It's entertaining enough and works well as a tribute to Paul Walker, but I think it suffers from having big shoes to fill, and some questionable writing. Much of the story revolves around the characters trying to retrieve a machine that allows you to monitor all electronic communications in an area and locate any target (like the machine in The Dark Knight). I have nothing against this concept per se (especially since it's relevant in today's privacy-centric/NSA spying world), but it's easy to see how such devices can lead to lazy writing in movies: ""hey, we need to find this guy."" ""There are no leads..."" ""oh wait we have magic machine that can pinpoint the location of anyone in the area!!""<br/><br/>Some other thoughts: - Jason Statham makes for a formidable enemy, but I can't help thinking that his character is more one dimensional and boring than his own brother and the baddie from fast 5. - I find Tyrese's character to be funny maybe only half the time, and he has a bigger presence in this movie. But humor's subjective. - Can't really tell when Paul Walker's brother is filling in for him (good job special effects crew!) - The Rock steals nearly every scene he's in. Seriously! He has some of the best one-liners and parts in this movie. He almost reminds me of a young Schwarzenegger here. <br/><br/>Anyways, go see this movie. It's Paul Walker's last, and it's a fine addition to the franchise."

","Often, we remember how people come in and out of our life more than what happens in between. First impressions are brief moments that can last a lifetime, and final goodbyes can be the hardest moments of our lives to endure. This is the message at the heart of ""Fast & Furious 7"", the latest installment in the car racing / action franchise now entering its fourteenth year.<br/><br/>The anticipation behind this film over the past two years has been enormous. As ""Fast & Furious 6"" left us blown away and wanting more, the seventh installment high-tailed it into production, planned to be released the following year. Then in November 2013, things took a drastic turn for the franchise. But let's wind back the clock to the summer of 2001, and the story of a little street racing film and its young star, Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Coming out of a few teen flicks, the young actor was cast in what would become his most famous and enduring role, but there's no way he could have known that at the time. Starring alongside him was the imposing Vin Diesel, hot off the success of the brilliant ""Pitch Black"". Diesel filled the screen with his presence and power, whereas Walker brought the vulnerability and naivety of a fish out of water. Playing undercover LA police officer Brian O'Conner, he infiltrates the street racing scene through Dom and his crew, getting caught up in their high risk antics. By the end of the first film, the lines between crime and the law were blurred as a friendship was formed that would take a long ride.<br/><br/>Originally due for a July 2014 release, filming on part seven was put on hold while the filmmakers worked out what to do. Walker had already completed about half his scenes for the movie, so with some creative thought, the production was picked back up again in April 2014, to be finished and released a year later. As we waited for the film to be released, bits and pieces of news emerged on the forthcoming sequel about its story and other cast members joining the ranks. Fans began to wonder how they were going to deal with the early departure of Paul Walker from a half-completed film, so the makers released a statement merely saying ""Brian will be retired from the series, respectfully"" No other information was released, so we waited to see what would happen in April 2015.<br/><br/>If you've already seen FF7 or you're intending to, then you're a series fan and I don't need to go into details about the story of the series leading up to this point. You know what's happened recently, and how the stage has been set for this new installment. And as exiting and awesome as things look in the trailer, that is just a tease in regards to what waits for you in the film. From the very beginning the action kicks off, and doesn't let up for a single moment. I enjoyed every minute of ""Fast & Furious 7"". As ridiculous as it is to see cars spending more time in the air than on the road, I switched off any sense of logic and reasoning, and went along for the ride. That's what this movie is meant for, as are all movies at the end of day. Films are a form of escape; a chance to leave the real world for a couple of hours, and see the world from a view where anything is possible, allowing us to suspend disbelief, relive some childhood fantasies and connect with our imagination. What's wrong with that? Nothing, in my opinion, and this is what the Fast & Furious series has become about.<br/><br/>As the action leaps off the screen, you can't help but feel a sense of sadness knowing that this is Paul Walker's last film, and every scene he has on screen, is among his last.<br/><br/>For a series about high octane car stunts and tough guys fighting it out, ""Fast & Furious 7"" takes an emotional turn in its last ten minutes. Using some clever CGI effects, Paul Walker is still there, even though you know it's not really him, you can feel his presence in the final scene. Having grown up on these films, watching the cast grow and evolve into their characters and take on more daring stories as the sequels progress, the ending of this installment is a perfect way to wrap that up. Brian's departure from the story is the end of a journey, much as it was the end of Paul Walker's short journey on earth. The cast are so well connected on screen and off, you can feel that their words and tears are genuine as they say goodbye to Brian, as for them, it was a way to say goodbye to Paul Walker as well.<br/><br/>As the final scene of the film played out on screen, and after two hours of action got plenty of gasps, whistles, claps and laughs, the entire theater sat in silence for Brian and Dom's farewell. Backed up perfectly by the song ""See You Again"", performed by Wiz Khalifa, it's a fitting, respectful and heart touching scene. Even if you're not a series devotee and feel a connection to the characters, I think you'll find it hard not to be moved by the final scene of this film, as it says goodbye to its long running star, who will certainly leave a gaping hole in the heart of the series and fans alike.<br/><br/>Farewell Paul Walker; an actor that was watchable and likable, taking the audience into the Fast and Furious world like a trustworthy friend. Rest in Peace. You will be missed."
"alexgarcia732805","8","0","12","7 April 2015"," Delivers on what you're promised; you get what you expect. (But are we expecting too little?)
","After Fast & Furious 6, I thought that we really didn't need another F&F movie. Add the fact that the plot of Furious 7 is just Owen Shaw's brother (Deckard Shaw) seeking revenge, and Furious 7 seemed like a somewhat unwarranted movie. Not because I was tired of F&F movies, but because I thought there was no reason (at least story wise) to keep making them. (Of course, there was still the mystery of who killed Han, but that's beside the point.) Nevertheless, I was enticed by the trailers and TV spots for F7. The promise of more impossible car stunts and dumb, crazy action lured me in.<br/><br/>The plot of F7 is as realistic as you can imagine, with lots of vehicular mayhem in Abu Dubai (that somehow doesn't get Dom & Co. in trouble?) and a dues ex machina computer program/MacGuffin that can track anyone, anywhere in a matter of seconds (called ""God's Eye""). But these illogical things are typical of the Fast & Furious movies, and at this point I don't expect anything different. Due to this though, I've heard people negatively compare the F&F franchise to the Transformers franchise. However, IMO the Transformers movies have become heartless, boring, cash grabs. On the other hand, the F&F franchise at least has MOMENTS of comedy, excitement, and true heart. The F&F stars are also likable, and relatable. After seeing these characters together for 7 movies, they're obviously more acquainted with each other than the average Hollywood movie cast. They have authentic chemistry. <br/><br/>If anything, Furious 7 is a Michael Bay-esque movie done RIGHT. While many of the events in F7 are really ludicrous, the overall themes of the movie & franchise (family, loyalty, vengeance) help keep Furious 7 from feeling like bloated with CGI and one- liners. Once again, the latest F&F film has been able to walk the line between just-for- fun, over-the-top popcorn flick and lazy, unimaginative Hollywood sequel. (Though I'm not sure that that will happen again.)<br/><br/>I definitely had a fun and enjoyable cinematic experience when I was watching Furious 7. The action sequences were as ambitious and over-the-top as always. F&F 7 is determined to top all previous films, and it succeeds--but is that such a good thing? (Nevertheless, films are a type of escapism from our unfortunately too-realistic lives. So don't feel bad about giving Furious 7 a large amount of suspension of disbelief.) However, I think that this latest movie asked for too MUCH suspension of disbelief. How many more car crashes and shootouts can Dominic Toretto & Co. survive? Are you telling me that Dom stood his own against Deckard Shaw, when an entire Special Ops team couldn't? And why didn't the US government intervene at all when a weaponized DRONE was in Los Angeles, and when Dominic was driving a super-car through skyscrapers?<br/><br/>I think it's fair to question the future of this franchise. Furious 7 actually managed to top Furious 6, but how will future films KEEP topping what has been done before? F&F 8 won't be the same without Paul Walker (R.I.P). Brian O'Connor was one of the main characters in the franchise, but Paul Walker has passed on. Will Dominic Toretto, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Hobbs be able to sustain this franchise by themselves? <br/><br/>Also, some of the F&F family are still struggling to have meaningful dialogue, like Tyrese Gibson as Roman and 'Ludacris' Bridges as Tej. They both have too many one- liners. Besides that, some actors were little more than cameos to appeal to all demographics--like Tony Jaa (as the martial arts expert that Brian fights), Djimon Hounsou (as the leader of a band of militant mercenaries), Ronda Rousey, and Iggy Azalea. (By the way, also think we should've gotten to know Ramsey a bit better.)<br/><br/>As a whole though, forgiving some of F7's flaws, Furious 7 is an entertaining movie. It delivers on it's promise of big budget spectacle, and it also provides a send-off to Paul Walker. (To be honest, I did get slightly emotional during that final scene.)<br/><br/>I have reviewed 40 movies (all on Metacritic and and some on IMDb) including the 2014 and 2015 films: The Divergent Series: Insurgent, Taken 3, The Interview, Exodus: Gods and Kings, The Hunger Games: Mockingjay Part 1, Dracula Untold, The Maze Runner, Nightcrawler, The Equalizer, The Expendables 3, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Guardians of the Galaxy, The Giver, Sharknado 2, Dawn of the Planet of the Apes, Transformers: Age of Extinction, Edge of Tomorrow, X-Men Days of Future Past, Godzilla, The Amazing Spider-Man 2, The Lego Movie, Divergent, Transcendence, Jack Ryan: Shadow Recruit, and more. <br/><br/>I also review other TV shows, such as: Agent Carter, Empire (2015), The Flash, Arrow (Season 3), Gotham, The Last Ship, Sleepy Hollow, Marvel's Agents of SHIELD (Season 1 and 2), The 100, I Wanna Marry Harry, Crisis, Gang Related, and more. I also have reviewed the mobile Android games Minecraft: Pocket Edition, Clash of Clans, and Five Night's at Freddy's"

","Once street racers and criminals, Furious Seven finds the Torretto gang in an international pursuit with terrorists and the US government.<br/><br/>Through the course of seven films, the Fast and the Furious gang changed a lot from the scrappy youngsters they were in 2001. By 2015, the group is now whittled down to a simple Furious Seven with near special operative training and global adventures.<br/><br/>It is rather amazing how far the Torretto crew has come since their early days in Los Angeles hijacking eighteen wheelers and street racing at night. With each installment the characters have become more brazen with hauls more daring and intricate than the last to near super human feats. Furious Seven takes off just where Fast & Furious 6 ended, with their pasts catching up to them with fatal consequences.<br/><br/>By now, the action formula associated with the Fast and Furious flicks is down to a science, so fans should be in for a fun ride though those less inclined for the franchise will be giggling at its preposterousness. Even the fans in the theater during my viewing were having a hard time not to chuckle with amusement at the ludicrosity of the plot of Furious Seven â€“ though that is where much of the entertainment stems from for these film viewers. With no formal training other than a brazen fortitude, this group goes head to head with black ops martial artists and live to tell about it.<br/><br/>Furious 7 has scantily clad women, car porn, an onslaught of even more daring car chases and races, and playboy billionaire parties galore and satisfies its fans for junk cinema. The dialogue is cheesy, proof that sometimes the stoic Alpha male character is not loquacious for good reason. But really, Furious 7 is a vast improvement to its immediate predecessor Fast & Furious 6 which was just excessively absurd and unrealistic. Seven even manages to poke fun at the ridiculous pursuits of its characters by referencing the audacious happenings of the past with a sarcastic levity. In an effort to up and ante with the seventh film while becoming more grounded as a film, director James Wan utilizes highly stylized angles and panning shots which will be disorienting to some.<br/><br/>Allegedly there will be an eight installment to the franchise, though I hope the studio bags that idea. Furious 7 concludes as appropriately and poignantly as it can, given its light-natured cinematic genre. It pays homage to the past, and to its most beloved star Paul Walker, with genuine heartfelt sentiment and any future film will just not have the same soul.<br/><br/>And for those simply curious about the scenes involving Walker's brothers Cody and Caleb: yes, those with a discerning eye can tell the scenes films after his untimely death.<br/><br/>Please check out our website for full reviews of all the recent releases."

","I went for it after the positive reviews I have been getting, I decided to give it a try. I have to say this movie was the most fun I had watching this year. The film is set in London, Tokyo, USA and Saudi Arabia and tells the story of Junior Shaw's older brother bad-ass Shaw (Jason Statham). The film is a revenge from Jason Statham for beating up his brother in the previous installment. <br/><br/>Overall the movie is fun, Cars, Girls and Tyrese and Ludicrous have made the movie very enjoyable. Vin Diesel seemed a bit flat, Dwayne Johnson didn't have much to do in the film rather than watching football and shooting a mini-gun at a frigging' chopper. Paulie was awesome. At the end, there's a 30 second tribute video for Paul which made me cry.<br/><br/>Overall, its a must watch, though the plot ain't hot. It's a very enjoyable movie."
"j-lindsay-sens","5","0","12","7 April 2015"," All action, no sense
","Hi, i usually don't do reviews but before i went to Furious 7, i read lots of reviews, saw how much it sucked, how much it rocked and how it was only good because of the tribute to Paul Walker....<br/><br/>The movie starts pretty quick, with the bad guy being introduced with a not too complex plot. EX-Secret military out for revenge that no one can stop, which pretty sums up the entire story. Not that that was bad, i though the story was pretty good.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes were to chaotic for me, too much camera shaking and changing of frames, would have liked to see some more fluid scenes. Some of the stunts were pretty awesome to watch, knowing full well that they were extremely unbelievable<br/><br/>So overall, i enjoy the pretty basic story, Jason statham did a really good job and played a good bad guy. There was lots of action and lots of variety in stunts. HOWEVER..there were some bads, like anymovie...<br/><br/>The main put off for me is that it was extremely unbelievable it was crazy. It was an action movie, im good with some crazy things time to time but scene after scene. Jumping from a moving car, going crazy fast, and walking/running away does not happen. This stunt, jumping from a car, happened way too often with literally NO injuries. Same thing with rolling their cars. Sure Vin Diesel had a rolling cage, but there are rocks, tree stumps and a girl who weights 100 lbs in the passenger seat...you can not tell me no one gets hurt in that roll, not even a concussion....Fight scene at the end, big wrenches and no blood? even though Rodeguez punched that guy at the beginning once and his mouth was full of blood....come on...<br/><br/>Overall, movie was OK for me, it had its moments and its surely not ""Oscar worthy"", but, even for an action movie, it was too unbelievable. It was touching what they did for Paul Walker tho, obviously the 8.1 score that it is as im writing this is high BECAUSE of Paul Walker and it is extremely sad, but for me, the movie is 6, 6.5/10....its not terrible or bad but...it could be better..<br/><br/>PLUS! Micheal Bay much? Corona, RockStar, unneeded explosions (American air force would be all over that helicopter at the end in minutes), Under Armour etc etc etc...i could go on"

Never have i been that desperate to watch a movie, tbh Furious 7 is the best action movie I've seen in my entire life.The stunts were simply crazy, in my opinion Furious 7 is a super hero movie. Even though there's a little problem with the story line and Paul Walker's CGI which was very poor. I still think it's the best of the franchise. Not to talk of the amazing tribute to Paul Walker. Tyrese also had his way in the movie through his humorous and funny jokes. It's a just a movie I can't seem to get over. thank you James Wan for making April a good month."

YES totally .<br/><br/>One thing to mention though is the characters in this movie , as you might know that Paul Walker passed away while the film is not 100 percent complete , so this makes me want to know how they going to handle his character , and in the end i must say they handle really well and this is probably the perfect ending of his characters.<br/><br/>Overall this is still the Fast and Furious we know and love about with all of these fun popcorn action scene and the bond between characters makes this movie worth the money to watch."
"OlieRendch","6","0","12","7 April 2015"," Stupid, but in a good way.
","I think at this point we can all say the Fast & Furious franchise is quite special. It's so completely stupid, but in a fun way. It's pure mindless action and stunts but we love it, and the fact that the tragic death of Paul Walker just makes this movie a bit more unique.<br/><br/>Now first off, the opening scene in Furious 7 tells you exactly what this franchise is, I laughed out loud at the over-the-top carnage before me, but in a good way; and from then on it's much the same. You can't really fault the special effects of these amazing stunts which add all the more excitement to what already is a car- themed action movie. You just sit back and enjoy cars fall out of a plane and parachute down because that's what you're there for.<br/><br/>So with all of that what was the actual plot like? Well this franchise is known for evolving with each film, and this is no different, it still has the backbone of the franchise, with car races, girls, and funky music and some references to the first film which I thought was nice, but now it goes into almost a comic-book like setting with a secret organisation, science-fiction technology and very much ensemble battles. I'm still not sure weather a franchise like this fits into that kind of setting as some of it felt strange and they had multiple plots going on as well which made the pacing a little awkward but all-in-all I enjoyed the majority of it and Jason Statham makes for a good villain.<br/><br/>Talking of actors, all the main crew work brilliantly together which comes from doing seven films which has built up some strong bonds, Vin Diesel and Paul Walker do amazing jobs and the ending did a brilliant send off to Walker's character showing that once again the franchise is going to change, unfortunately this time due to tragic circumstances but I thought they handled it with wonderful tact.<br/><br/>As a movie as a whole, it's a fun romp that's not perfect but who cares in a film where The Rock flexes a cast off his arm."

Furious Six took the cake when they survive a hundred meter drop into water and at the end when they drive THROUGH a cargo plane's nose on a 130 kilometer runway. Furious 7 is overloaded with BS scenes like that: Jumping (twice!) from one building to another in Dubai? Driving through forest for a couple of minutes? Hobbs lifting heavy stuff after breaking several bones? The parking garage scene? Impossible coincidences that conveniently save people? Shaw parading as the bad guy in Dubai without being shot by hotel security? And many more... When you're 12 you think: ""This is awesome!""

"eddiemondragon","5","0","14","6 April 2015"," Paul Walker's emotional Tribute saves Fast7 - SPOILER ALERT
","I thought that Fast7 was entertaining, but just like the last Fast movie, it once again left me rolling my eyes more often then not after some of the stunts these guys perform. I seriously think they should wear capes as not even Marvel Superheroes perform the stuff these guys do, and walk away with just afew scratches and bruises at most. The storyline was poor and extremely one dimensional. Half of the movie forgets about the main villain (Jason Statham), and focuses on the Fast Gang traveling across the globe to look for a spy who has a device that can locate the main villain at hand. Mind you, throughout all this, where's our villaun gone? What is he doing? Just having a cup of coffee waiting for the Fast gang to finish what they need to do? Yes he pops up for little cameo's here and there...but shouldn't they then worry about just tracking him down once he has popped up? To me it felt like the film was all over the place. I understand its ""just a movie"", but I cannot get my head around how these guys can perform half the stuff they do. Flying cars out of a plane and seeing them perfectly land on a road on the side of a cliff? C'mon not even James Bond does this kinda crazy stuff. However I will conclude with some more positives, as was the case of the movie itself. The final scenes with Paul Walker and his tribute was absolutely fantastic. For all of us who grew to love these characters ranging back to Fast and the Furious 1, it was a perfect way to say fair well to Paul and his character Brian. You can really see and feel the emotion from the actors, and I'm pretty sure there wasn't a dry eye in the cinema. For me this film was a must-see, merely because my 13 year old sister who passed away from Leukemia last year was a massive Paul Walker and Fast and the Furious fan. She was looking forward to seeing this film so much, and was extremely saddened by Paul Walker's passing. So the end brought all sorts of emotions for me, and I'm sure she was there in spirit by my side in the cinema as we said fair well to Paul Walker. But overall Fast7 was entertaining enough, but not a film I could classify as anything over an average rating. <br/><br/>R.I.P. to Paul Walker and my sister Erika."

A good movie for the sake of watching something that would never happen in real life but a lot of greatly dramatic scenes that make the movie seem like a joke. I liked it but wouldn't recommend spending $20 on two tickets or anything close to that. Ultimately, I feel mislead by what the parental guide originally stated and wonder where the world is headed that we are teaching 13 year olds that women are not being sexual by exposing themselves and dancing suggestively. I had to talk to my son after the movie and apologize to him that he always sees women portrayed so disrespected and it be presented as a good thing.

","So guys, 'Furious 7' may/may not be the last of this movie series, but it is surely the last of Paul Walker, one of the leading guys who rose to fame due to this illegal street-racing movie franchise, which slowly turned into a high-octane action-thriller ride. All thanks to not just the stellar star cast of names like Vin Diesel, Dwayne Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, to name a few, but even to directors like Justin Lin, who had re-invented the series from a campy illegal street- racing action movie, to a action-thriller series. Moreover, director James Wan ('Saw' and 'Insidious' fame) has pushed the envelope, drastically, with this latest entry in this over-the-top car-tossing franchise. Let's analyse.<br/><br/>After finding out that Owen Shaw is into a comatose stage in the previous installment, his brother (Jason Statham) threatens Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his 'family', for extracting revenge against him. A clandestine government operative (Kurt Russel) offers to help Dom track down Shaw in exchange for recovering a coveted surveillance device that has fallen into the hands of terrorists. It's a plot that sends our heroes shuttling between Los Angeles, Tokyo, the Dominican Republic, the Caucasus mountains, and Abu Dhabi, with the wall-to- wall action pausing only long enough for Tyrese Gibson to crack a sexist joke, or for Dom to continue to woo Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) who's still suffering from amnesia. There's a terrific, jaw-dropping set piece in the Middle East where Diesel and Paul Walker's characters drive a sports car off a skyscraper into another one ... and another one! It's preposterous, but that's exactly what makes it so much fun.<br/><br/>The same can't be said for the film's overlong climax on the mean streets of LA, packed with helicopters, drone strikes, car chases and some good ol' fashioned one-on-one combat. My head was throbbing through this frantically edited 20-minute showdown, which felt excessive and mind-numbing, and only worsened by the pointless 3D. Of the cast, Dwayne Johnson returns as the rough-and-ready Agent Hobbs, although he spends much of the film wisecracking in a hospital bed, after a duel with Shaw leaves him battered. Jason Statham is nicely menacing as the chief villain, proving a worthy adversary to our beefed up heroes. Bollywood up-and-comer Ali Fazal gets a two-scene cameo as a Middle Eastern fixer, and he does a good job with the comic accent. But it's Vin Diesel in the central role that the spotlight remains firmly fixed on. He's typically stone- faced yet charismatic, and you still want to chuckle each time he bandies on about the importance of family.<br/><br/>What really separates the new film from its predecessors is its emotional depth; the knowledge that this is Paul Walker's last turn as Brian O'Conner. Despite his tragic death midway through production, Walker remains a key figure in the film, thanks to the clever use of body doubles and nifty CGI effects. It's hard not to get at least a little misty-eyed during the touching finale in which his character is given a fitting sendoff. Who'd have thought we'd leave a Fast & Furious film surrounded by mournful silence?<br/><br/>Even though it's all preposterous and over-the-top, you still relish it, like trusted comfort food, you're happy to tuck into it knowing full well it has no nutritional value. I give this an 8/10. Without the pointless 3D, the car sequences were enthralling and Paul Walker looked gorgeous, even though for the last time. But anyway, R. I. P. Paul, we'll miss ya."
"rajeymufc","7","0","12","6 April 2015"," Memorable but not as phenomenal as it's made out to be
","Furious 7 was as good as action gets. Don't believe me? Six words. Cars falling out of a plane. Action scenes were fast, intense and sometimes ridiculous. If you are an action fan, you won't be complaining by the time this is over, as it delivers in every department.<br/><br/>As far as the story goes, it does a very good job of merging itself together as the continuation of Fast 6 and Tokyo Drift together, ensuring both hardcore fans and casuals are not confused as to what is happening on screen.<br/><br/>Acting is excellent for most characters, Jason Statham particularly brilliant. However he does not receive enough screen time, as, understandably, more screen time is given to Paul Walker, leading up to the final farewell. Vin Diesel does his thing, being a badass with no emotions. One particular asset of the F&F franchise has been how females are given just as much a badass enigma as their male counterparts and not just as sex-selling stand-ins. Tyrese plays a very memorable part in this one, offering genuine laughs. If I was forced to complain, I would do so in regards to Dwayne Johnson's lack of participation in this whole movie. He is, by large, a spectator. His impact in the last 15 minutes was clear for all to see, as the whole cinema hall turned into kids again.<br/><br/>If there is a flaw with this film, it's the dialouges. Cheesy as ever, it doesn't feel as if they put much effort into the writing. While it doesn't really deter the overall incredible experience, it can be an annoyance at times.<br/><br/>And there then is the final farewell for Paul Waker. Arguably the reason this film is getting all the hype. Wan's team has done an incredible job with CGI, recreating Walker's face on his brothers' in certain scenes. If you don't look carefully, you won't even notice it, thinking Paul was there all the way. His farewell was beautifully envisioned and, although it could have been much better, it would take a complete arse to complain about that.<br/><br/>Overall, Fast and Furious 7 will be memorable among hardcore fans of the franchise, for Paul. As a standalone senseless action movie, it does very well with it's high octane stunts and mind shattering action sequences. This isn't as amazing a movie as it is being made out to be. However, it's definitely worth the price of admission and popcorn."

"Joe_Chadowski","8","0","1","6 April 2015"," One of the best action films in years and a love letter to fans of the franchise all rolled into one.
","This is embarrassing to admit, but I spent more time deciding what star rating to give Furious 7 than I did actually critiquing it. Because for the first time ever, the part of me that pretentiously seeks perfection, the adolescent part of me that revels in heart- stopping action, and the car-loving part of me that is woven into the very fabric of my being all nodded in agreement at the same movie. I didn't know what to make of what I had seen. I quickly cycled through my previous reviews for a frame of reference. 6 stars? Easily better than that. 7? Yes better than Grave of the Fireflies and Heat. 8 stars? Up there with Judgment at Nuremberg and There Will Be Blood? There we go. Any higher and we'd be talking about Come and See and Social Network, and I can't do that. 8 Stars. Not bad for an entry into a series that couldn't give less of a you- know-what about how it compares with anything.<br/><br/>So to the film at hand; The longest entry into the Fast and Furious franchise, 7 passes the reigns to Saw director James Wan who lends his quick-cut, zoom-in-then-zoom-out, rotating camera work to a script from veteran Furious writer Chris Morgan. Morgan takes a step back here, in the beginning focusing on how our heroes have settled and moved after #6, before introducing us to Jason Statham and delving into the gravity-defying, physics-bending, time-warping absurdity we've come to know and love from this series. Although this time it's on a whole other level to the point I was expecting the Looney Tunes music to cue the next scene.<br/><br/>Cars attached to parachutes jumping out of a plane? 'Cudas with 10 forward gears? S65 AMGs and Rubicons that can appear out of nowhere? Chargers that can survive unscathed after a head-on collision? Apache helicopters and drones that can fly around undetected in the most populated city in the country? But that's what you're here for. Deliriously exciting chase sequences, fights, stunts, crashes, high- octane humor and hilarious gaps in logic. And Furious 7 delivers better than any other film in the franchise. It's an off-the-wall adventure like no other, obscenely, eye-wideningly, face-deformingly awesome. Three words come to mind; F**k. Ing. Hell.<br/><br/>By now you're probably rolling you eyes and accusing me of the kind of melodramatics I slam many a film for, but hear me out; I grew up with this franchise. Starting out as a naive 9 year old gearhead who was swept away by the coolness of the first installment, and maturing into a more technically informed teenager who began to enjoy the films ironically, and concluding as a full grown 20- something who went to the films seeking my relentlessly action- packed nostalgia fix. I have vivid memories of where I was and who I was with when I watched each movie. There are people I don't talk to anymore and haven't seen in years who are a part of memories that I will cherish forever. When the credits rolled, I felt a chapter in my life close, and as I stepped out of the theatre and into the sunset, I looked around a familiar world with a different perspective. And with the perfect send off of Paul Walker at the end, I found myself more swept away with emotion than any brilliantly written character-driven drama could possibly muster. I can't believe I'm saying this in a review of a Fast and Furious movie, but these are the kinds of experiences cinema was born for."

","Quickie Review:<br/><br/>Dom (Vin Diesel) and his family finally get to return home after leaving their criminal life behind. This calm life doesn't last long when Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) seeks out revenge against them for his comatose brother. This franchise made a great comeback in the past three movies, and this movie continues that momentum. Fast & Furious 7 is not perfect, adding too many story elements taking away the screen time from Jason Statham as the principal threat. However, the all- out ridiculous set pieces, non-stop one liners, and the character banter make this movie a joy to watch. Also Fast & Furious 7 serves as a great tribute to the late Paul Walker.<br/><br/>Full Review:<br/><br/>Most would agree that the Fast & Furious movies aren't meant to be taken seriously. The point is to go to the cinema with a group of friends and enjoy the absurd fun while stuffing your face with cinema snacks. Fast & Furious 7 is the perfect film for that. I just wish we had seen more awesomeness from one of the most loved action heroes, Mr. Statham.<br/><br/>There a lot of movies that have ridiculous amounts of explosions and action set pieces but in the end are horrible movies *cough* Transformers *cough*. What makes Fast & Furious work are the characters that are so likable. All these sequences would be white noise without the cast. The way they react, interact and tease each other, you can really tell that their comradery is genuine. There are countless moments where I laughed at the sheer stupidity of some of the things going on, but I didn't care because I was having so much fun. So if you loved the over the top nature of the previous movies with the great cast, you will continue to love this movie.<br/><br/>My only complaint is also a major one, Jason Statham was too much in the side lines. I love Statham in his movies, and when I saw that he was playing the villain I was excited. However, apart from the final act, he only conveniently appears at random points of the movie to make Dom's side missions a little harder. Don't get me wrong, Statham is great in all his scenes, but Djimon Hounsou a secondary villain has just as much screen-time. Hounsou's character wasn't even all that significant or menacing to warrant him being in the movie. All he did was scream ""WHAT!?"" like the artist Lil' Jon whenever things didn't go his way. So if the filmmakers had kept Statham as the sole villain it would have served the vendetta plot and the threat that Dom faced a lot better.<br/><br/>Of course I can't do this review without mentioning Paul Walker. It was tragic the way he passed away, and all of us know how devastated his family and his Fast & Furious family were. This movie carried a lot of emotional weight for the people involved. The way they honored Paul Walker was truly heartfelt. I was really moved by the tribute.<br/><br/>All in all, Fast & Furious 7 was fun and entertaining, did almost everything it set out to do. If you're not a fan of this franchise this movie will not convert you, but if you are fan then you will have a great time. Even with my complaint with the way Statham's character was handled, I still highly recommend checking out Fast & Furious 7. A great start to the summer blockbuster season.<br/><br/>Check out more on my movie review blog The Stub Collector: http://thestubcollector.wordpress.com/"

","The Fast and Furious franchise is racing into theaters once again. This time we are brought the 7th film in this massive franchise, that only gets bigger and bigger with each new film. The series started way back in 2001 with Paul Walker and Vin Diesel as the major stars. After the tragic death of Paul Walker before this film finished filming, production was shut down and the film was reworked in order to deal with this lose. The film deals with his death perfectly, not killing him off, and giving him one heck of tribute. The following is my review of Furious 7.<br/><br/>The film is written by Chris Morgan who also wrote parts three through six of this franchise. So he is clearly not a newcomer to the franchise. The series has taken different routes over the course of its fourteen years on screen, and the same can be said here. Back when the series was first starting, the story focused a great deal on the car races. Gone are those days, and now are featured big and absolutely absurd action scenes that just happen involve cars. The stories of course have changed, and some agree for the better. We still have the heist angles that were brought into play over the last few films, and this has really helped the franchise. The story isn't perfect in this film, and some of the characters are not written that well. Even car enthusiasts will be scratching their heads sometimes during this movie. This is a series that hasn't really been popular for its fabulous story work though. The film is written good enough for this series, and one has to hope Morgan comes back for the eighth film(if there is one).<br/><br/>This Fast and Furious film was directed by James Wan. Wan is well known in the horror genre for directing classics likes Saw, Insidious, and The Conjuring. Even though doing an action movie on this scale is far away from where he normally directs films, Wan does a good job overall. This film has more action scenes than probably any other film in the franchise. I found myself noticing that some of the bigger action scenes were lasting near or longer than ten minutes. Which is a great deal for a Hollywood action movie these days. The action scenes use tons of CG, and while most of the time it is good, there are some scenes that look laughably bad. The acting department has never been an area where this series has been great. Though the cast that has been together for many years now work so very well together, which is what makes this team great. With some amazing action scenes, not all looking great, and even some completely over the top you will ask yourself did they need to go this far, most watching this film will get a joy out of James Wan's work. I don't think Wan should quit his regular work directing horror movies, but seeing him in this genre from time to time would be nice.<br/><br/>The film was scored by Brian Tyler. Tyler is known for scoring some of the Marvel superhero movies recently, and Tyler has been composing for this franchise since part three. I'm not sure where others stand on this franchise in terms of score, but this one might take the cake. I loved the score in the big action scenes, and even when things were more subtle. Tyler is one of the better composers today, and this score proves that. If you love scores for action movies, this score adds a great deal of depth to the film.<br/><br/>In closing, this film was a blast to watch on the big screen. This is the last Fast and Furious film for Paul Walker, and features a great and emotional sendoff for his character. Even though the franchise will likely continue, we will all remember Paul Walker and cannot forget what he did for this franchise. Even if you find the film to be a let down compared to previous films, the action scenes are worth the price of admission. In terms of which version to pay for, I would say the IMAX version was fabulous, and well worth the extra five dollars. When the film gets those huge action scenes going, this is where IMAX excels with the bigger screen and far better sound. So my recommendation is you spend the extra few dollars and see this movie in IMAX.<br/><br/>8/10 <br/><br/>R.I.P. Paul Walker"

"stephendaxter","8","0","3","4 April 2015"," Out of this world action that will keep you entertained all the way
","This movie shows perfectly what this series has become since it decided to change from a serious racing film to a fun and over the top action film. And i am so glad they made that decision because this was packed with over the top stunts and fights with some comedy thrown in there, it was just so damn enjoyable. Not saying that i hated the first three instalments but this is just almost like a completely different franchise. You have to go into this film knowing that they aren't taking themselves seriously and making the stunts realistic because almost every stunt that is pulled in this film would result in certain death. But the lack of realism does not make this film any less enjoyable, in fact it is those moments of just totally crazy action that make this film so great. The only negative i can really give this film is story wise it wasn't all that amazing. You can tell that the flow of the story wasn't really the focus, they didn't spend a whole lot of time figuring out how to move these characters to different locations around the globe, they just made it happen with little to no explanation. But within 30 seconds you completely forget about that and get back to focusing on the real star of the film, the action. <br/><br/>The stunts and action sequences throughout the film from the fairly grounded ones to the completely insane ones are all just as thrilling and entertaining. All these sequences are really spaced out well and executed amazingly. Not to say that the climactic action sequence is a massive onslaught of fight after fight, stunt after stunt and has you on the edge of your seat for a constant 20 minutes. The cast were all great everyone got a fair amount of screen time, and you just always seemed to care about them. They had been set up and developed so well in the previous films that you just went into this film already liking them. Stepping aside from the action this film did mark the final film for Paul Walker who past away during the filming of this film, and it did a great job of honoring his work and effort he put into this series of films spanning 15 years. In the end this is a fun action thriller that you can just sit back and enjoy pretty much every minute of and laugh, maybe even cry but you will always be invested in the film. - 8.1"
"Havoc571","7","0","12","4 April 2015"," Becoming a spy series
","I gave this a 7 only because the action was pretty cool. As this one follows directly behind the last one and Tokyo Drift the story becomes more complicated again. This time the tech is brought to the next level and has nothing to do with the cars or really anything that has been portrayed in the last films. All of the movies that have transpired since the first 2 have had nothing to do with racing or the lifestyle that we all loved with the first one. In this one Leti all of sudden gets her memory back at the right time, Hobbs is injured for most of the movie and the rest of it turns into a Mission Impossible movie. All of the ""hacks"" and equipment in this movie make all of the cars and stunts really irrelevant. Drones hacking materials and the big brother of Shaw that will not die. I really hope if there are anymore of these films they will go back to their roots instead of all over the globe in search for a criminal. If I wanted to see a movie about awesome gear and tracking down bad guys then I would go for the new Mission Impossible. Point to this is do not go into this thinking that it is going to be any different from other movies, there is nothing special about this other than the ridiculous stunts that a car would never make it through and, the slow start and pacing time throughout the film. I find myself with each of these newer Furious titles that I would only really want to see it once as they are getting that ridiculous.I truly do hate the fact that this is my view on these now as I have been to every opening of these films since the first one and because they are so far fetched, it is really hard to enjoy them."
"Challenger2013","8","0","3","3 April 2015"," Wild, Touching, and Ridiculously Fun
","Ridiculous, absurd, and over-the-top. Yes, all of these terms can be used to describe the newest film in the FAST AND FURIOUS franchise. Of course, that's the case with all of the films, but it's especially true with this one. But just because it's absurd and a little dumb does not make it a bad film. In fact, it's pretty damn good, and a hell of a lot of fun. <br/><br/>The film begins kind of bland, giving us the introductory information on the new villain, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham). Shaw is the highly-skilled assassin whose younger brother was severely injured by the Fast family in the sixth film. He is out for vengeance against Dom (Vin Diesel) and his crew, and he won't slow down until he takes care of business. In comes the hot-shot director of a secret agency, played excellently by Kurt Russell, who informs Dom of a surveillance device called ""God's Eye"" that can find anyone and would be used for injustice if in the wrong hands. By telling Dom he can use the device to find Shaw, he convinces the alpha and his team to obtain ""God's Eye,"" leading to a series of car chases, fight scenes, and the usual fair from these films. <br/><br/>There are moments in the film that serve as near-high-points of the series. For example, the airplane/parachute scene that appeared in all the trailers is fantastic. And I know we all think they gave it away in the marketing, but we didn't see the half of it. There are a couple more scenes like this of course, like when Dom drives a car through not two, but three, multi-story buildings, but the parachuting scene is the best for sure. <br/><br/>Despite the greatness of the action sequences, the film has its faults. Many claim that the dumb thing about these films are the sequences that go against anything that is humanly possible, but to that I have one question: Is it not the same in the Marvel films everyone loves? The reason they aren't criticized for this is because we know the Marvel films exist in their own universe. But why can't the FAST films? While this crew may not have super- strength like Captain America or special suits like Iron Man, they pretty much are superheroes. The dumbest thing about this film is actually the corny and mediocre dialogue. There's one part where Hobbs (Dwayne Johnson) tells Shaw that he is going to ""break his finger in six places and stick it where the sun doesn't shine."" Funny? Maybe. Unnecessary? Definitely. My biggest complaint, however, is that I didn't feel as close to the characters as I have in past films. I still care deeply about them, but the few intimate moments weren't nearly as touching as in the other FAST films. Roman (Tyrese Gibson) is more annoying than funny, Hobbs is way too over-the-top, and I wanted much more from most of the scenes between Dom, Brian (Paul Walker), and Mia (Jordan Brewster). There are some pretty good new characters in the film, including two very good villains: Shaw and a warlord played by Djimon Hounsou, a hacker played by Nathalie Emmanuel, and even some cameos from Lucas Black, Ronda Rousey, and Iggy Azalea (yes, seriously). The best addition to this franchise is Kurt Russell, by far. He is very convincing in his role and fits his way into the ""crew"" easily. <br/><br/>Overall, director James Wan follows the same formula as the last film, which is fine because it works, and finds certain ways to make it his own. This is a rare film where I noticed the audience was clapping throughout (usually after outstanding car chases) and left the theater in tears, courtesy of a brilliant tribute to the late Paul Walker and his lovable character Brian O'Connor. The film has its flaws, but they are largely overweighed by the entertainment value. This is a damn fun film, and audiences will eat it up. Most of all, this is a great place to end the series, even though they probably won't. Its not because the films are getting worse. This one isn't nearly as good as FAST 5 and FAST 6, but it is very close, just like how Brian was always so close to beating Dom in a race. The reason it would be best to end it here is that loose ends were mostly tied up and I just can't see the series going on without Dom's right-hand man. Plus, the last scene is so beautiful and flawless that it could stick with us for a long, long time. The circumstances behind the scene sucks, but it's the perfect way to end this wild, heart-racing, entertaining ride."

","Fast and Furious is the good old action packed summer blockbuster, filled with awesome stars, over the top and set-pieces. Furious 7 is the best Fast and Furious yet, and has set the bar with brilliant, flashy action and stunts. Basically, it has improved upon what makes this series so entertaining to watch. As usual with these types of movies, the story is only an excuse to lead to some action, but there are some ""decent"" moments where the personal narratives intertwine between Letty (Michelle Rodriguez) and Toretto (Vin Diesel), regarding her ""amnesia"", and O'Conner (Paul Walker) and Mia regarding his transition into regular suburban life. Decker (Tyrese Gibson) provides the comic relief, and has some really funny moments in the movie, and Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham) provides a good villain and leaves a destructive, calamitous, and lethal path in his wake. In the end, it is a popcorn action movie, that is laughable, jaw-dropping, and a fun movie that is definitely worth watching in theaters."
"didonatope","Null","0","3","3 April 2015"," Furious 7, simply put, is one of the best popcorn films of all time.
","Over the past 14 years, the Fast & Furious franchise has certainly come a long way. Over the course of seven films, the characters went from hijacking trucks in East L.A. to high-tech espionage missions in Abu Dhabi. It's quite obvious that the cast and crew wanted to make Furious 7 the best and biggest film in the franchise. Considering the many obstacles they had to overcome, to say they succeeded in the end would be a gross understatement. Furious 7, simply put, is one of the best popcorn films of all time.<br/><br/>Picking up where the last movie left off, Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), finds out that Dominic Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew severely crippled his villainous brother. As a result, Shaw makes it his mission to harm Toretto's ""family"" in any way he can. After killing one of Toretto's close friends, Toretto decides to go after Shaw. Meanwhile, the CIA plans to use Toretto's vendetta against Shaw as leverage to help them stop a dangerous criminal (played by Djimon Hounsou) from threatening national security with a high- powered computer chip.<br/><br/>Some may call this plot a mess, but I felt that a crazy plot like this was suitable for a film that is intentionally over-the-top and silly. When you combine an outlandish plot with a generally light- hearted tone and lovable characters, you get the perfect example of escapist entertainment done right.<br/><br/>Many action films make the mistake of putting bland, stone-faced characters in outlandish set pieces. The result is usually a film that looks good, but isn't worth seeing again. Just like most of its predecessors, Furious 7 avoids this mistake and gives audiences some amusing, badass and heartfelt characters to root for. Whether it's Tyrese Gibson's cowardly-lion-type character or Michelle Rodriguez's mentally-vulnerable but kickass character, fans of the franchise will be more than happy to see their favorite characters return to the big screen.<br/><br/>Even the new characters stand on their own as fine additions to the series. Nathalie Emmanuel and Djimon Hounsou add some flare to the film and Jason Statham has his best role yet, playing a villain that you'll love to hate. In a career of mostly heroic roles, it's actually a nice change of pace to see him play the villain.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is as excellent as usual, playing Dominic Toretto with a smooth personality that's occasionally pushed over the edge when his family is threatened. Paul Walker, in the scenes shot before his tragic death, shines one last time as Brian O'Conner, an ex-FBI agent with all the right moves. It is quite bittersweet seeing these two characters interact this time around; it is the last time that they will be together, but the actors give the necessary heart and effort to make their characters work. <br/><br/>In regards to Paul Walker, with the exception of a few choice shots and angles, it is almost impossible to tell when he is on screen or when it is his CGI double. Those fearing an awkward uncanny valley situation will be pleased to know that the CGI in this film is first-rate and practically un-riffable. Even when it's obvious which scenes were added to write off Paul Walker's character, the way they wrote him off of the franchise is both respectful and touching. Kudos to Peter Jackson's Weta Workshop for giving Paul Walker a proper farewell.<br/><br/>Now it's time to address the heart of the movie; the main reason why people come in droves to see this: the INCREDIBLE set pieces. I think it's pretty clear to see that the filmmakers put their all into this, and director James Wan does an excellent job calling the shots. The cars are as slick and gorgeous as ever, and seeing them crash through buildings and fall from the sky is sure to please.<br/><br/>There's something about the way the action is shot that really makes it worth watching. Unlike some more subpar action movies, the set pieces are comprehensibly edited and allow the audience to get immersed in what's going on. In an Imax movie like this, immersion is extremely important, and audiences are sure to be thrilled to the edge of their seats.<br/><br/>This movie never falls short on the cheesy thrills. Some intentionally hilarious but nonetheless awesome scenes include driving a car between three skyscrapers, Dwayne Johnson flexing out of an arm cast, dropping cars out of a plane, and Jason Statham putting on his sunglasses as he walks from an explosion. It doesn't get more lovably cheesy than this. This movie is like a giant ice cream sundae: sweet, deliciously thrilling, and perfectly aware of how over-the-top and awesome it is. <br/><br/>The only real drawback I had to this film was that they didn't really get a chance to tie in the third film. Yes, an event from the third film is revealed to have fueled the plot, but it was kind of an odd choice to have Lucas Black show up for a minute before disappearing. I wasn't really a fan of his character in the third movie, so I was hoping they could redeem the character by having him join Toretto's team in this movie. That unfortunately didn't happen, so his cameo felt like a waste.<br/><br/>Overall though, Furious 7 is a triumph in every sense of the word. It's a triumph for the franchise, it's a triumph for action movies, it's a triumph for the cast and crew, and Paul Walker would be proud. Great job guys!"
"stevendbeard","8","0","3","3 April 2015"," Most Action-Packed in the Series
","I saw ""Furious Seven"", starring Vin Diesel-Riddick, The Pacifier; Paul Walker-Brick Mansions, Pleasantville; Jason Statham-the Expendables movies, the Transporter movies; Dwayne Johnson-Hercules_2014, Get Smart_2008 and Kurt Russell-Death Proof, Vanilla Sky.<br/><br/>People have said that this is the last in the Fast & Furious franchise, seeing as how Paul died during the filming of this one but I have a sneaking suspicion that there will be more, once they see how much the box office rakes in-it was very crowded at the 9:00 am showing that I went to and it is usually not very busy, that early in the morning. They had to use body doubles, including Paul's brothers, and CGI to finish the film and to be honest, I think they did a good job. I had a hard time telling the differences. The story starts right after number 6 ends. Jason plays the big brother of the villain from 6 and Jason is looking for revenge. Vin, Paul and the rest of the gang are all just taking it easy-Paul is even settled down with Jordana and child and driving a mini-van-when Jason comes looking for them, killing one team member and putting Dwayne in the hospital in the process. Kurt pops up as a government spook that knows Jason's background and offers Vin's team info on Jason, if Vin's team will help recover some kind of super computer spyware called 'God's Eye' for him. Of course there are lots of car stunts-cars parachuting out of planes and jumping between buildings- and fight scenes-Jason vs Dwayne, Jason vs Vin, Michelle vs Ronda-that will blow your socks off, if you are wearing any, and several cameos of previous Furious stars, like Lucas Black, and newcomers like Ronda Rousey, Tony Jaa and Iggy Azalea. All in all, I think this one is the most action packed, in the series. There is a song called 'See You Again' at the end and as the end credits start, 'For Paul' appears on screen and scenes with Paul from the previous movies are shown in a montage. It's rated ""PG-13"" for violence, action, language and sexual content-no nudity-and has a running time of 2 hours & 17 minutes. I really enjoyed this one and would buy it on Blu-Ray."
"Troy_Campbell","8","0","3","3 April 2015"," The best dumb fun you can have.
","Let's be honest, the Fast & Furious franchise is dumb. The plots are nothing short of ludicrous, the acting is often laughable and the dialogue is frequently atrocious. But I fricken love it. There's an unbridled exuberance throughout the series – especially since the fourth instalment – that is infectious, and F&F7 carries that torch capably. The stunts are obviously numero uno on everybody's list, both crew and audience alike, and they don't disappoint, despite being increasingly reliant on CGI. Pushing the limits even further in a cinematic universe where silly things like real-world physics are gleefully disregarded, the set pieces flow with amazing frequency, leaving you breathless for a sizable chunk of the movie. Since The Rock's inclusion in the fifth chapter the amount of fights have grown as well, and here we are treated to numerous entertaining fisticuffs that sees The Rock vs The Stath, Big Vin vs The Stath, and a whole army vs The Stath, to name only three. Speaking of The Stath (Jason Statham for those playing at home), his smooth yet ruthless killer is easily the best villain this series has seen, and he's treated to an appropriately fantastic entrance via a clever opening credits sequence. The other new players are more of a mixed bag though. Kurt Russell is delightful as a scenery-chewing Government official and Nathalie Emmanuel slots into Vin's gang with ease, but Djimon Hounsou and Ronda Rousey are completely wasted with underdeveloped and boring roles. The old crew – Vin Diesel, Paul Walker, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, Ludicrous and The Rock – offer much of the same stuff that has made them so well liked over the years, because, you know, if it ain't broke don't fix it. Which brings us to the late Paul Walker. After dying in a horrific car crash whilst filming was on a hiatus, the filmmakers have employed every trick in the book, including body doubles, CGI, and use of stock footage, to successfully deliver a well-rounded farewell to Walker. Signs of franchise fatigue are nowhere to be found in this seventh entry and, despite losing one of its beloved members, will undoubtedly be back for episode eight. And nine. And ten."

","So, I just came back from this movie and I can say one thing: it was certainly 2+ hours well spent in a cinema. So is it a fun movie? Oh, sure it is. As long as you're going into it expecting nothing what the first Fast and Furious installments used to be and accepting this franchise for what it's become. The first movie was this exciting tale of a criminal underworld and illegal street racing, which was still firmly grounded in reality. Over time, however, the franchise abandoned those roots and concentrated instead on increasingly implausible action sequences, the only resemblance to the first movie being that it still features the same cast and has exotic cars. And this movie, well, it is definitely in the latter category. Contrary to what has been said in the movie itself, cars do indeed fly and our heroes survive things that could have made the Terminator break apart. <br/><br/>But is it a bad movie? Hell no. If you go into this expecting a serious story, you will be disappointed. Instead, go see it like you would go see something like the Avengers. No semblance of realism, just over the top action, unkillable heroes, predictable and an extravaganza of special effects. That's what this movie was for me. Offtimes it's hilarious how the movie attempts to take itself seriously after a ludicrous scene from a realism perspective or some particularly goofy dialogue, but it's all good fun as long as, like I said, you yourself are willing to take it not too seriously."

","If you thought Vin Diesel flying 50 feet in the air to catch a girl was over the top in Fast and Furious 6, wait till you see Furious 7. Watch The Rock fall ten stories, Paul Walker defy gravity, Jason Statham tele-port through out the film, Vin Diesel carry a two ton car, drive off a cliff with all the insouciance of a man on his way to buy a pint of milk, crash and survive without a single scratch, and most importantly drive a car through not 1, not 2, but 3 sky scrappers, that's right...3!. So flush out your brain cells and enjoy an action packed, adrenaline filled, over the top flick. Also get ready for the tele novella with Vin Diesel and Michelle Rodriguez."
"Fluke_Skywalker","7","0","12","3 April 2015"," It delivers what it promises
","About 15 minutes into 'Furious 7' I had decided that my review would consist of only two words; Butt Cheeks. Sure there are other equally economical ways to describe it. Implausible. Ridiculous. Absurd. Oh, and here's another. Fun. If you can leave logic--and perhaps good taste--with a babysitter, this is an extremely entertaining popcorn action extravaganza.<br/><br/>I will say that with 'Furious 7' this franchise is getting dangerously close to self parody, but so long as they can hug that line, I'm down for another.<br/><br/>For those wondering about Paul Walker, I think they did an excellent job paying tribute to him in a way that was in-universe and real life at the same time."
"scottshak_111","7","0","14","3 April 2015"," Adrenaline never ceases to stop pumping
","It is all about flying Lykan, shattered skyscrapers, mammoth bullets, Gatling rounds, super-amped destruction, relentless drone syndrome, Jaa's Parkour, bad ass rides, skimpily clad models, exquisite close calls, death defying moments, Herculean jobs, mind numbing head-ons and bad ass action. This movie is an action-pack adrenaline pumping madness just like its predecessor. But does it have a great story? My answer would be a big No to that.<br/><br/>Wan unfortunately doesn't have a good story in his baggage. What he still has is some dope action to exploit, and he manages to create insanity with that! Watch out for that insane car-dive and the skyscraper stunt! Most memorable ones! Humour shines fine by Tyrese Gibson's presence, and he occasionally takes off the heat.<br/><br/>Furious 7 is thrilling throughout. Adrenaline keeps on pumping constantly. Destruction doesn't stop. Cars keep getting totaled. Bullets fly in the air like flies. The flick has pretty great one-liners that are downright bad ass. Snappy and witty comebacks make the screenplay quite clever in a way. Dramatic bits are kind of average, but make a dash for awesomeness to pay some quality Pablo homage in the end.<br/><br/>SPOILERS AHEAD: Statham makes a bad ass entry as Deckard Shaw into the lives of Furious guys with a dope fight with Hobbs. It is here we get to see that eye candy Rock Bottom that we have been waiting forever. Unfortunately he gets sidelined by an unconvincing side-story.<br/><br/>We already knew from the prequel, Shaw's brother would be lurking in the shadows waiting to drop the chaotic bomb at Team Furious anytime. So he promised Dom via a phone call. And Bam! goes the 'home' in splinters with a sustained visual of 5-6 blasts occurring simultaneously that engulf the entire house. The predator calls for it and Dom gears up like a Daddy to teach him a lesson.<br/><br/>The entrance of Kurt Russell was so pathetic that it made us instantly hate him. I swear I saw perplexed people in the theatre wondering ""Why?"" out loud. Mr. Nobody's addition to the tale was simply to weave two jobs that Dom could have lived without. Just so that he could find the hunter, he agrees to lick the candy Mr. Nobody was selling. But boy does it unroll into mind-numbing stunts! Skyscrapers hyperjump by the exotic Lykan hypersport would make your teeth turn into a nail clipper. Another pretty dope bit is the car sky-diving bit. Stunts like these ensure that the franchise isn't dead yet. It will continue to flabbergast you, compel you to jump on your seat.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the screen time of Deckard Shaw is quite less, and he fails to create a villainy charm in the movie. He does pop up hither and thither to overthrow Dom's plans but passes out weak as a very average forgettable villain. He looked puny compared to Dom fury.<br/><br/>The best thing however remains the show stopper – a perfect adieu to Paul. Final bits show Vin in pain, and you could almost read the tears that got masked by his acting. You could instantly comprehend and empathize with his loss. A series of flashbacks of Paul show up with Vin's narration in the backdrop and your heart falls in a heavy pit. Such a big chunk tore away! You are left to ponder in tears. It was a great decision not to kill Pablo's character. Giving him a respectful farewell from the franchise was really thoughtful.<br/><br/>In an action franchise like Fast and Furious, just remember you have to overlook everything. Logics are defied, Physics taps out to action, gravity stops working and time takes a hiatus for the protagonists. Just sit back and enjoy the action packed fun this movie promises to be and is. Be super-psyched and never forget Paul!"
"Mackiatoe","6","0","12","3 April 2015"," The ending the series deserved, even if it was ridiculous
","The FF series has been steadily getting more and more ridiculous since 2009's ""Fast & Furious"", and steadily better as well; its combination of impossible stunts, emotional moments and automotive underpinnings have kept things going nicely. These aren't films that are meant to be realistic or moving - they're simply the best for big screen entertainment that knows its boundaries (unlike many other films) and never fails to enjoy. Naturally, therefore, it seemed that the final instalment - for now, that is - would follow this pattern.<br/><br/>And, thank goodness, it did. The basic story is essentially the same; bad guy criminal is doing bad stuff, police/government get involved, Toretto & Co go in, and the usual car chases, shoot outs and explosions follow. As for the main plot item, it's a software superweapon known as 'Gods Eye', which is used as a deus-ex-machina whenever the plot needs to move on. Speaking of which, it's a very fast paced plot that doesn't bore even for a moment. Even if it is repetitive - which is to be expected - there's nothing inherently wrong with it. For me, it just about works, but the final battle was very long, some scenes didn't seem to want to end and I've never said this about a film before, but I felt it started off too quickly, without enough exposition. In some places too, it did drag, though not to a great extent. <br/><br/>The cast really stand out as the best part of the film.This time, we have Jason Statham playing the bad guy, who happens to be the brother of Owen Shaw, the antagonist for the previous two films. Statham's character is good; unashamedly based on British stereotypes and reassuringly gritty. He's not as sharp as Owen, but he still provides plenty of great moments, such as the coach hijack and the dinner scene in Abu Dhabi. The main cast give the same old performances, which you can't really fault, as the whole series is built around their 'family'. Their subplots, such as Brian learning to be a dad and Letty trying deal with her memory loss, keep things interesting when they aren't being chased or shot. Arguably the best addition is hacking genius Ramsey, played by Game Of Thrones's Nathalie Emmanuel. Unsurprisingly, she quickly becomes part of the team after she is rescued by them. She's the vulnerable side character that keeps the cast balanced, though she doesn't get the screen time she deserves.<br/><br/>But its here that things start to fall apart. There have been plenty of finales in previous F&F films that have been way too over the top to comprehend, and others that didn't do their film justice. This one doesn't fit into any of those types; it's bloated in some parts, but also brilliant in others. It takes too long to finish, but never gets boring or slows down. This problem is also found earlier in the film. The fighting scenes are often so fast-paced that you can't watch them properly, but they're still enjoyable. Some of the car chases are brilliant pieces of cinematography and others are totally unrealistic. It toys from one extreme to another with no middle ground; let me give and example. The Abu Dhabi Party Scene - Good Stuff:<br/><br/>> Roman being his usual self<br/><br/>> Letty getting into an awesome fight<br/><br/>> Well choreographed action, especially Deckard's entrance <br/><br/>And the bad stuff: <br/><br/>> Where was the chip being kept on the car? It seemed like it was in the centre console, so why waist time picking the car up? Seemed like plot convenience to give the other characters more time.<br/><br/>> Driving between buildings; what?<br/><br/>> The rest of the cast were completely forgotten about after Brian and Dom drove out of the building.<br/><br/>Maybe I'm being picky about films that are supposed to be simple. But I love how self aware its predecessors are, with a near perfect balance of action, emotion and comedy. This does do that, but its over shadowed by scenes and stunts that are just a bit too stupid. Maybe if they were a bit shorter they'd be better. Speaking of those scenes, here's a list of what I'm on about:<br/><br/>> The Abu Dhabi party<br/><br/>> The Automated Factory shoot out and get away - Kurt Russel's ""Mr Nobody"" died way too quickly here.<br/><br/>> Every scene with Gods Eye in it - it was used too many times and got uninteresting.<br/><br/>> Jakande's introduction - the dramatic effect went straight out of the window here due to stupid camera effects.<br/><br/>> The drone - where the hell was the US army, why didn't the drone just do its job and how did it do half the stuff it did?<br/><br/>> Dom's charger driving off after crashing into Owen's Aston Martin - How?<br/><br/>Hmmph. And yet it was enjoyable in some places. And well paced. And well choreographed. They certainly put the effort in, which is always a good thing. But it's just too much to be genuinely enjoyable. It lacks the characteristic, slightly ridiculous tone of the previous films not by trying too hard, but by trying to do too much. If anything, it's all for the final scenes, with Brian on the beach, the Dom/Brian medley and the parting of ways, made all the more somber and heartfelt by Paul's untimely passing. If anything, this is the fan pleasing finale that people wanted, and credit where credits due, some parts are brilliant. They showcase FF's ability to make an action film that knows it limits and balances everything out. You cannot beat them for entertainment value, as they are a cut above the rest. But here we see that ethos falling backwards and being masked by over doing everything. There's so much right with this film, but so much wrong as well.<br/><br/>6/10"
"olivergilbert1","8","0","2","3 April 2015"," For Paul
","The latest instalment of the fast & Furious franchise dedicated to late Paul Walker opened this bank holiday weekend, and although I didn't know what to expect before it started, I Left feeling satisfied and slightly emotional at what was another enjoyable and action packed ride. Although different to the previous instalments, 'Furious 7' still delivered with bigger and crazier stunts than what we have ever seen before. I have been a fan of the franchise since early days and since Paul Walker passed away I have been longing to see this instalment, and it did nothing but blow me away from the outset. From the brilliant fights to crazy car chases, this film put you on the edge of your seat feeling like part of the action. Once again the family behind fast & furious have done another outstanding job. Finally it was a fitting and emotional send off for Paul, and an amazing tribute to the legend that graced our screens and he will live on in his fans hearts forever. This films is a must see and won't leave you feeling disappointed and worth a watch for Paul walkers last ride."
"Myjoyandlight","7","0","12","3 April 2015"," Bittersweet movie with over-the-top action!
","I won't say that Fast & Furious 7 was the best film out of the franchise;however, I will say that it sure was the second movie out of the franchise to have some of the most unbelievable action scenes in it! The crew finds themselves back together after being hunted by the brother,Deckard Shaw, of their last victim (You know ... the guy...the villain from Fast & Furious 6). In Dom's pursuit to track down Mr. Shaw, he and the team are recruited by a government agent to find a hacker, and in return, the agent will give them Mr. Shaw's whereabouts. And that's when the fun begins. To capture the hacker, the crew has to plan a rescue mission that involves landing in a tight spot. How do they do it? Well, know that it involves cars and planes! But, as we know that doesn't mean that the action is over. The crew then has to make a trip to the Middle East finding themselves in Dubai and in the company of one of the wealthiest princes who has something that they want. I actually thought that this scene in the movie was the best; I found the action scene to be very enjoyable. Uh...airborne cars are cool! Eventually the crew lands back in the USA, and they get a minute to cool down. In this brief moment, one is reminded of Paul Walker's absence in real life. And although, he, Brian, Paul Walker's character escapes three near death experiences prior to his upcoming phone conversation with Mia, it is dialogue that he has with her that is truly heartfelt between their characters. After their cool down moment, the action is back on! And when I say, ""back on"" it is ridiculously over-the-top back on! More airborne cars, explosions, bullets, machine guns, and on the edge of your set WTF! moments! When all is said and done, the crew defeat who they should (at times I felt like I was watching a different installment of the Avengers). They share their last scene on the beach and Dom says goodbye to Brian and Paul Walker. One can see Paul Walker's brother standing in for him in the scene. It is a befitting farewell to Paul Walker and hopefully to the franchise. Good movie!"
"BrentHankins","7","0","13","2 April 2015"," Plenty of the franchise's trademark action, punctuated by a poignant tribute.
","The Fast and Furious franchise has been a box office juggernaut, with the last three installments taking in a collective total of $1.7 billion at the worldwide box office. The latest volume, Furious 7, would likely have eclipsed the success of its predecessors to begin with, but the tragic death of series star Paul Walker in the midst of filming has cast an even bigger spotlight on the film.<br/><br/>Production on Furious 7 was halted for several months after Walker's death in November 2013, and when filming finally resumed, it was with an altered script that promised to pay tribute to the late actor - his brothers even served as body doubles in order to allow his scenes to be completed. The result is a touching and poignant memorial that closes the door on Walker's character and his story without feeling like the subject is being forced.<br/><br/>But before we get to those tearful goodbyes, Dom Toretto (Vin Diesel) and his crew must contend with Deckard Shaw (Jason Statham), who happens to be an even bigger and more menacing threat than his younger brother Owen Shaw (Luke Evans), the villain from the previous film. Big brother Deckard doesn't take too kindly to his sibling's fate, and after murdering Han in Tokyo and breaking into the DSS office to take down Luke Hobbs (Dwayne ""The Rock"" Johnson), he sets his sights on Dom.<br/><br/>What follows is essentially an extended game of cat and mouse, with Dom and his crew trying (and often failing) to remain one step ahead of Shaw. There's also a convoluted plot that involves the gang working for a shadowy government agent (Kurt Russell) in order to get information on Shaw's whereabouts - which is really just an excuse the filmmakers needed to have team to hop from one exotic location to another.<br/><br/>Most of the cast returns here, including Tyrese Gibson, Chris ""Ludacris"" Bridges, and Michelle Rodriguez - all of whom are given an opportunity to shine during the film's many action sequences. If you've seen any of the marketing materials for Furious 7, then you've already gotten a glimpse of the biggest moments, but there are definitely some surprises left, including an insane chase during the third act that's almost as crazy as the bank vault heist from Fast Five.<br/><br/>The needlessly complicated plot - which also introduces a hacker who creates a program to tap into the global communications network and a militant leader (Djimon Hounsou) trying to steal the program for himself - is definitely the film's biggest weakness. We're constantly left to question why Dom and his team would ever find themselves involved in this mess, and there are so many threads to tie up that the running time feels about 15 minutes too long.<br/><br/>But let's be fair: the Fast and Furious franchise has always been about exotic cars, insane stunts, and gorgeous women, and it delivers those things in heaping doses. But closing the chapter on Walker's character also lends a bit of extra weight to the proceedings, and longtime fans of the series may find themselves reaching for a Kleenex during the film's final moments. There's little doubt that audiences will be pouring into theaters this weekend to say goodbye to Walker, and they should find themselves coming away from the experience with a sense of closure and satisfaction."
"851222","8","0","5","2 April 2015"," Not the most furious of fast, but still an entertaining flick
","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>""Furious 7"" (2015) is not the best in the series, although entertaining flick. If you like this series, you will definitely like ""Furious 7"". It's has over the top action scenes, nice but nothing fresh plot, cool actions scenes - everything you can expect from the series.<br/><br/>There are problems with this movie nevertheless. With each installment, the action scenes becomes more and more unrealistic. You have to turn your disbelief meter off to enjoy this flick even as an action popcorn flick. The outcome of each action scene is sooo over the top, so unrealistic that i simply tough ""Oh come on""! after each of them. I know this is an action flick and i know that this is a popcorn flick, but ... really? From many many near dead scenes our heroes witnesses, one with a driving off a mountain when surrounded by a bad guys in this movie stands from a crowd. I mean - really??? You can simply do THAT and WALK from a car with NO bruises??? As usual, there are hand to hand combat scenes and as usual - no one bleeds! Because this is a PG-13 movie.<br/><br/>The villain was not bad at all here - Jason Statham, probably the most menacing villain this series have had yet. The opening scene with him was cool, although rushed with bad music and to quick cuts. But i didn't like the outcome of his.<br/><br/>Overall, if you like this stuff, you will like ""Furious 7"". It's slightly better then the 6th part, but no match to a ""Fast 5"", which is still i think ranks as the best in the series. There is also a nice last farewell scene to a late Paul Walker - really nicely done here and has more meaning to a real life than a movie."
